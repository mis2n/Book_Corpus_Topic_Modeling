year. A detailed classification of these pupils and students is given 
on pages 3 to 6. In addition, there were some 400,000 persons enrolled 
in various special schools and institutions, such as business colleges, 
trade schools, conservatories of music, schools of art and elocution, 
schools for the delinquent and defective classes, Indian schools, ete., 
making a grand total of nearly 16,000,000 persons who attended a 
school of some kind for a longer or shorter period during the year. 
THE COMMON SCHOOLS. 
The term “common schools” is understood by this office to include 
public elementary and secondary (or high) day schools. The statistics 
of the different State common-school systems, compiled from data 
furnished by State superintendents, are given in detail in Chapter I. 
The following table contains a condensed summary of the common- 
school statistics, with the corresponding figures for 1892-93 in a

Tt will be observed that there was an increase during the past year 
of 425,258, or 3.15 per cent in the number of pupils enrolled in the 
common schools. This is an unusual rate of growth, the average annual 
increase for the ten years ending with 1892-93 having been only about 
286,000. It is worthy of note that this well-marked gain in school 
attendance occurred during a period of widespread business depres- 
sion, and it speaks well for the people that they endeavor to make up 
for the loss occasioned by irregular and uncertain wages by sending to 
school not only the younger children at such times, but also their older 
children, thrown out of occupation as wage earners.
-P-A-G-E-15
THE COMMON SCHOOLS. XV 
The percentage of the total population enrolled in the schools was 
20.53, as compared with 19.67 in 1879-80, and 20.32 in 1889-90. That 
is to say, in every 16,000 persons there are now 86 more enrolled in the 
common schools than in 1880. 
Another noteworthy gain was that of 2.3 day’s length of the school 
term, which is now 139 days, or nearly 10 days longer than in 1880, 
The average number of days attended by each pupil enrolled, however, 
was only 91.6, or about two-thirds of the time the schools were in 
session. 
There was an increase of 2,712 in the number of male teachers, and 
2,285 in the number of female teachers. The percentage of male 
teachers (32.2) shows an increase the first time in a number of years, 
another item to be explained by the business depression, men haying 
less reason to desert the calling of teacher and venture in more lucra- 
tive employments. 
The increase in the number of schoolhouses was only 1,103, while the 
total value of school property gained over $26,000,000. These figures 
would seem to indicate that much of the expenditure for schoolhouses 
had been devoted to the improvement and enlargement of existing 
buildings. 
In a former report I have discussed the question of the average total 
amount of schooling given to each individual in the nation. I have 
had a comparative table made, showing this item for each division of 
the country and for the whole United States, for the years 1870 and 
1880, and for each year in the present decade. 
The table includes the items of higher and special education which 
were omitted in my former estimate. For 1891 I found the result to be 
4.3 years for each citizen. But by including these items the average 
is increased to 4$ years. 
Average total amount of schooling (including all grades, publie and private) each indi- 
vidual of the population would receive wnder the conditions actually existing at the

THE GROWTH OF CITIES. 
  The disproportion between the percentages of population of the 
North and of the South found in cities makes its influence felt in the 
item of total average school attendance, and hence calls our attention to 
the influence of cities on the length of school sessions and the location 
of schools at convenient distances. In the North Central, and North 
Atlantic divisions the number of cities having over 8,000 inhabitants 
was, in 1890, 351, the same being an increase of 118 over the number 
in 1880. In the South Atlantic and South Central States the number 
of cities had increased in the same decade from 42 to 73. 
The city brings together the producer and the consumer. In the 
city the raw material brings the highest price, and the manufactured 
product is found at its cheapest price. 
The city makes combinations; it seeks out the producer and buys his 
product, selling him its equivalent of the merchandise of the world. 
The city thus connects the people of its environment with the world. 
The family that produces for itself its own food, clothing, and shelter 
is living on a low plane of civilization. It should produce some spe- 
cialty for the market of the world, and exchange it for a share in all 
the productions of mankind. Such process of exchange is like a sac- 
ramental consecration. Each person consumes or partakes of the pro- 
duct of the world of universal human society; each, himself, contrib- 
utes to the supply of allothers. Itis this process of intercommunication 
of each with all that is the essence of civilization. : 
The family that produces all that it consumes does not enjoy luxury 
or culture as the result of its labor. But when it has access to the 
market of the world through the mediation of the city, then it may 
have endless variety in what it consumes. By the division of labor, 
skill and productive power are increased, so that the share of each per- 
son is multiplied. Hence, each gets more than he gives to the world 
market. Itis a sort of living mirror of grace—by giving one’s product 
to the world, one gets in return manifold. Hence this mediation of 
one’s labor by aid-of the world market may be called a sacrament, 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
THE GROWTH OF CITIES. XVII 
  Here is seen the vast significance of the school education in enabling 
he citizen who shares in the productions of his fellow-men to know his 
ellows and understand their views of the world. It enables him to 
know their opinions, and to share in their spiritual as well as in their 
aterial productions. It enables him to participate in the formation 
f national and international public opinion. 
The type of modern cily, coming into existence since the days of steam 
nd electricity have made cheap and rapid transportation possible, is 
hat of a compact business center and a wide area of suburban resi- 
ence extending out from the city’s center to a distance of 5, 15, or even 
5 miles. The evils of city life in the middle ages were due to lack of 
ewerage, lack of a supply of pure water, and the consequent poisoning 
f the air in the dwellings, which were poorly lighted and ventilated. 
fhe city of the future, and indeed the city of the present, is a vast 
improvement. The death rates in London have been reduced to an 
average below that of most rural districts. 
It is the destiny of all civilization to increase the number and size of 
its cities. It is the necessary result of the invention of machinery and 
the labor-saving devices which flow from new discoveries in science, 
for the city is the necessary resort of the surplus laborers no longer 
meeded on the farm. Not so many people are needed to procure the 
raw materials of food, clothing, and shelter, but more and more people 
are required to turn these raw materials into articles of comfort and 
luxury; more and more people to work at transportation and intercom- 
munication, and more persons in the work of giving culture to the rest. 
The savage tribe, unaided by machinery, can allow but one person for 
the production of ornament—nearly all are needed for the supply of 
food and clothing of the plainest sort. But the partly civilized tribe 
can afford ten persons for the production of ornament and luxury. The 
proportion increases rapidly as we ascend in the use of machinery, and 
the time is arrived now when more than a hundred in a thousand are 
needed for the production of ornament and luxury. 
In transportation and intercommunication by means of railroads, 
telegraphs, postal systems, newspapers, books, libraries, schools, and 
churches—the line rises from mere transportation through intercom- 
munication up to culture. In these employments more and more of 
the population will find occupation. 
Instead of ninety-nine drudges producing raw material and one per- 
son working to furnish and diffuse directive intelligence, it will come 
to pass in the distant future that one man will, by the aid of machin- 
ery, furnish the raw material, another man’s labor will make the use- 
ful articles for food, clothing, and shelter, ten more will elaborate 
articles of comfort and luxury, the rest, more than 80 per cent of the 
community, will take up vocations having to do with protection and 
culture. With the growth of cities, therefore, there is a rapid increase 
of educational facilities.

  XYHI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
In the past twenty years the South has increased 54 per cent in pop- 
ulation, but its school attendance has increased 130 per cent—that 1s to 
say, more than twice as fast as the population. This means that there 
isa larger proportion of the population kept in school during the year. 
While in 1874 an average of 144 out of every hundred were enrolled in 
school, ten years later (1884) the average had risen to 18} per hundred, 
and in 1894, or twenty years later, the number enrolled is 22 in the 
hundred. Of all the people of the South, white and black, 1 in 5 
is in attendance on school for some portion of the year. In the twenty 
years from 1874 to 1894 the value of school property increased from 
$16,000,000 to $51,090,000—an addition of $40,000,000, or $2,000,000 a 
year. It built better school buildings and adopted modern improve- 
ments to such an extent that while in 1874 the average value of a 
schoolhouse in the South was only $373, in 1894 the value had risen 
to $643. 
Higher education has also a good record. It did not have so far to 
climb as the elementary schools for all classes of people. But while in 
1874 the number of college students for the South numbered 10,103, in 
1894 the number is 25,304, or two and one-half times as many. 
Turning to the important subject of race education, we find that the 
statistics are still more to the credit of Southern statesmanship. 
In 1876 the South had an enrollment in its schools of 571,506 colored 
children, and 1,827,139 white children. More than half a million col- 
ored children were in actual attendance on school for some portion of the 
year. But in 1894, eighteen years later, the white pupils had increased 
to 3,835,593, while the colored pupils had increased to 1,424,995. The 
increase of white pupils for the eighteen years was 109 per cent, while 
that of the colored was 150 per cent. Twenty-three out of every 100 
white inhabitants are enrolled in school, and 19 out of every 100 of the 
colored inhabitants. 
But with this fine showing as to numbers, it appears from the statis- 
tics here presented that the length of the school term is not yet up to 
the average. The average number of days in which schools are taught 
is, for the whole nation, one hundred and thirty-nine days, while the 
ayerage number of days for the South Atlantie Division of States is 
only one hundred and six, and for the South Central Division only 
ninety-three days. But the South had in twenty years increased its 
school term twelve days. With the growth of cities and large villages 
here discussed, the length of the annual school session will inerease 
until it is quite as long as that of the North Atlantic States. The city 
schools keep their doors open about two hundred days. In the agricul- 
tural districts there is a winter session of seventy to ninety days, and 
in many cases a shorter summer session, It is this that makes the 
average school years so short in the South. 
In the rural districts of New England the school term was only seventy- 
five days, as a usual thing, until the growth of large villages and cities
-P-A-G-E-19
THE GROWTH OF CITIES. xIx 
  with their ten-month schools finally created a public sentiment which 
mow insists on long terms for all districts. 
The best device yet discovered to help the schools in sparsely settled 
districts is the payment of cost of transportation by the school com- 
mittee and the consolidation of districts. The children from outlying 
districts are brought to the town center, where a large, well-graded 
school is kept up for two hundred days of the year. The cost of trans- 
portation for the pupils living more than a mile away is not so great an 
item as the cost of furnishing teachers and school buildings for half a 
dozen pupils each. 
In the small rural school no classification can be attempted, and for 
the most part the pupils never get beyond the rudiments of reading, 
writing, and arithmetic. With good classification the city teacher can 
teach from 40 to 60 pupils well. In the ungraded school not even 16 to 
80 pupils can be well taught. 
This increase of graded schools explains how it is that in the South, 
with a great increase of expenditures and with a much longer school 
session, the average cost per pupil is not materially increased. Twenty 
years ago it was $8.40; last year it was only $8.62. But the pupil 
receives now better accommodations, better instruction, and a longer 
school session than then, and the newly established training schools 
are sending into the work thousands of professional, trained teachers, 
It is interesting to note the effects of urban growth and the increase 
of schools in the South on the wealth and productive power. 
The wealth is estimated as follows by the United States Census:

Edueation has produced a laboring class that can use machinery to 
assist the strength of bone and muscle. It has made possible the 
great change of vocations from the production of mere raw materials 
to the production of the finished product. This is a change going on 
in all civilized countries. The machine is coming in at one end, and 
the mere drudge is going out at the other. The uneducated, unskilled 
man is not needed, for his hands and muscles can not compete with the 
machine. He is needed, however, in the work of directing the machine, 
and is therefore called upon to step up from the occupation of the mere 
drudge to the occupation of the overseer. The change from hand 
work to brain work is a necessity. But this can not go on without 
schools that fit the pupils out with alert and versatile intelligence.
-P-A-G-E-20
xx REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  Even in the fertile fields of the South unskilled labor does not bring 
good wages. But the skilled laborer in the city, using tools and direct- 
ing machinery, earns and receives an average of double the wages that 
the farm hand gets. 
Machinery is going out from the city to the farm; and the farm, too, 
needs fewer laborers, and can furnish more productions. The surplus 
farmers must go into mechanical industries, into transportation, and 
commerce. Fewer and fewer people are needed for the production of 
the raw materials of food, clothing, and shelter all the world over, 
thanks to mechanic inventions, which are pushing the mere illiterate 
drudge out of his vocation. He must climb to the plain cf the skilled 
laborer or else starve in his attempt to compete with the machine. 
A school system makes possible a change of vocations among its 
people. It puts alertness and versatility in place of mere brute strength 
and persistency. More than this, the school puts aspiration and ambi- 
tion into its pupils. It lifts the veil of distance in time and place, and 
shows them the achievements of the race. ‘You, too, can achieve the 
like.” The school next proceeds to teach the sciences by which the 
wonders of the world have been accomplished; mathematics, the tool 
of thought, by which matter is moved and forces are tamed into the 
service of man; history, and geography, and grammar, and literature, 
by which man comes to know men, and gains the ability to combine 
with them in civilized effort. 
The work of education is the direct work of helping individuals to 
help themselves. : 
Small as is the schooling: given by the nation to its people, some four 
and one-half years apiece, it suffices to make reading and writing uni- 
versal, and in addition to these gives also a limited acquaintance with 
the rudiments of arithmetic and geography. This fits the citizen to 
become a reader of the daily newspaper, and thus to bring him under 
an educating influence that will continue throughout his life. A news- 
paper civilization is one that governs by means of public opinion. The 
newspaper creates public opinion. No great free nation is possible 
except in a newspaper civilization. By aid of the printed page the 
school-educated person makes present to himself daily the events of 
the world and lives an epic life, for the epic life is the life of nations. 
A certain portion of the day of each citizen is given to contemplating 
world events, and to discussing them. Hesees the doings of his State 
and nation, and forms his own opinion. His opinion in the aggregate, 
with those of his fellow-citizens, is collected and offered to the world 
by the newspaper. Our schools suffice to produce a government by 
public opinion. This is a result of a higher order than the other good 
results which we have canvassed as among the benefits to the South of 
the education which it is giving to its children. To give people the 
power to readjust their vocations and to climb up to better-paid and 
more useful industries out of lives of drudgery is a great thing, a suffi-

cient reason in itself for establishing a public-school system. But to 
give the people the power of participating in each other’s thoughts, 
to give each one the power to contribute his influence to the formation 
of a national public opinion, is a far greater good, for it looks forward 
to the millennium, when no wars will be needed for the mediation of 
hostile ideas. 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
In Chapter 3 will be found a fuller presentation of the statistics of 
secondary education than ever before attempted by this Bureau. In 
Part III of this annual report more than half the space is oceupied 
with detailed tables relating to public and private secondary schools. 
There will be found the names and the usual statistics of 5,946 public 
high schools reporting to this office in 1894. This is an increase of 
1,700 over the number reporting in 1893. A special effort was made 
to secure returns from all the public high schools in the United States, 
and it is believed that only a small per cent failed to report. The 
total number of secondary students in these schools is 407,919, an 
inerease of 78,821 over the number reported in 1893. In 1894 there 
were 3,964 public high schools, with 289,274 students, and 1,982 private 
high schools, with 118,645 students. One must not suppose that there 
has been within a year or even two years any such increase as these 
fignres would indicate, although the growth of secondary schools within 
five years has been remarkable. The Bureau has reached out and 
gathered in statistics of all public and private high schools that could 
be persuaded to send reports to this office. Many of the schools are 
new and many more have been in existence for several years. 
The tables in Chapter 3 are very full and comprehensive. The deduc- 
tions drawn from them will prove of deep interest to those who are 
watching the development of secondary education in this country. The 
results of the work of these secondary schools, both public and private, 
indicate steady improvement. For example, there was relative increase 
in the number graduating 1m 1894 over 1893, and a comparison of the per- 
centages of students pursuing the ten leading secondary studies shows 
marked advancement. The per cent of students in Latin increased 
from 43.06 to 44.78 in the public high schools and from 39.23 to 40.77. 
in the private secondary schools. The per cent studying algebra in 
the public schools was 52.88 in 1893 and 56.14 in 1894, while in the pri- 
vate schools the increase was from 42.75 to 44.37, There was an almost 
imperceptible decrease in the per cent of students in Greek in the pub- 
lic schools and an insignificant falling off in the percentage of students 
in German, but for all the other high-school studies the percentages 
are higher for 1894 than for 1893. 
A bird’s-eye view of the statistics of secondary schools for 1894 is 
given in Table 20. This table, in connection with the six full-page dia- 
, grams in the same chapter, will convey a clear idea of the comparative

number 13.8 per cent were women. ‘T'he average number of instructors

143,632. Of the total number, 24.5 per cent were women and 4.9 per 
cent were colored. 
The home residence of collegiate students in 447 universities and col- 
leges has been collected and tabulated in a summarized form. From 
the data thus obtained the proportion of the population of the several 
States attending college has been computed and represented graph- 
ically. 
The value of the entire equipment of the universities and colleges is 
given as $212,181,552, of which amount $98,527,052 are endowment 
funds. The total income was $15,365,612, of which amount 38.1 per 
cent was derived from tuition fees, 34.3 per cent from productive funds, 
17 per cent from national, State, and municipal appropriations, and the 
remainder, or 10.6 per cent, from miscellaneous sources. The benefac- 
tions during the year amounted to $9,025,240. 
Colleges for women.—The 166 colleges for women reporting to this 
office, and not included in the list of 476 above referred to, had, in 
1893-94, 2,460 instructors and 23,707 students. Of the 15 fellowships 
reported, Byrn Mawr College holds 11. The benefactions to colleges 
for women amounted to $369,183, 
Colleges of agriculture and the mechanic arts —The number of students 
reported by the 63 institutions endowed by the acts of Congress of July 
2, 1862, and August 30, 1890, was 17,280, of which number 4,568 were 
in preparatory departments, 12,358 in collegiate departments, and 354 
in graduate departments. The total income reported by these institu- 
tions was $5,991,101.40, of which amount 36.6 per cent was received 
from the General Government, either as income from the funds realized 
by the sale of lands granted by the act of July 2, 1862, or as appro- 
priated by the acts of March 2, 1887, and August 30,1890. The present 
condition and progress of these institutions during the year under 
review, as reported by the several presidents, may be found in the third 
section of Chapter IV.

various agencies. Included in this chapter are interesting accounts 
of the work in Ohio by Prof. Willis Boughton, and in New Jersey by 
Dr. Austin Scott, president of Rutgers College; also a report of the 
School of Applied Ethies. 
Professional education—The number of students in theological 
schools was 7,658. Presbyterians had the largest number, 1,375; Cath- 
olics come second with 1,250, followed in order by the Baptists, Luther- 
ans, and Methodists. In comparison with the number of members, 
Congregationalists come first. 
There are 67 law schools, with 7,311 students. The legal profession 
of this country wields an immense influence in all matters that pertain 
to State, national, and municipal politics. They constitute mainly our 
public officers—legislative, judicial, executive—both State and national. 
Notwithstanding this, it seems that the qualifications for entering the 
legal profession are as low, if not lower, than for any other profession. 
The requirements for graduation from law schools, too, are less rigid 
than from any other class of professional schools. The fault lies not 
with the schools. They can not demand high attainments when so 
many States practically require no special attainments for legal prac- 
tice. The American Bar Association has in recent years undertaken 
efficient means to enlighten public opinion on this important theme. 
There are 152 medical colleges, with 21,802 students—17,601 regular, 
1,666 homeopathic, 803 eclectic, 1,732 graduate, etc. The process of _ 
raising the standard of medical education still continues. The Asso- 
ciation of American Medical Colleges a few years ago lengthened the 
course to three years of not less than six months each. In 1894 they 
again raised the standard to four years for all students entering upon 
the study of medicine in 1895 or subsequently. Moreover, nearly half 
the States require a State medical examination, while many others have 
strict regulations. 
There .are 88 schools of dentistry and pharmacy each, with 4,152 
dental students and 3,658 students of pharmacy. 
The statistics of normal schools are summarized in Chapter IV. 
There were 80,767 students in training courses for teachers in five 
classes of institutions; 37,899 in 160 public nermal schools, 27,995 in 
238 private normal schools, 5,500 in pedagogical courses in 173 colleges 
and universities, 5,041 in teachers’ training courses in 153 public high 
schools, and 4,332 in similar courses in 137 private high schools. The 
publie and private normal schools sent out 8,271 graduates in 1894. 
There is reported a very large increase over the previous year in the 
amount of appropriations from States, counties, and cities for the sup- 
port of public normal schools for 1894. In 1893 the appropriations for 
this purpose amounted to $1,452,914, and in 1894 the aggregate was 
$1,996,271. This increase was due in part to the increase in the num- 
ber of schools reporting. In like manner there was an increase in the 
amount appropriated for building from $816,826 in 1893 to $1,583,399

XXIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  in 1894, One of the interesting things noted in the chapter on normal 
schools is the increase in the number of students in pedagogical 
courses in universities and colleges. In 1891 the number of such 
students was 3,978, and in 1894 the number reported was 5,500, an 
increase of more than 38 per cent in three years. 
Chapter V presents the statistics of schools and colleges in Great 
Britain and Ireland for 1893, so far as these are attainable. The 
absence of special statistics of secondary schools in the kingdom is 
noticeable. Until this gap is filled, international comparison with 
respect to the scholastic influences by which nations are most deeply 
affected must be exceedingly partial and unsatisfactory. It is hoped 
that the supply of this data will be one outcome of the royal commis- 
sion now deliberating over the problems of secondary education. 
From the comparative statistics of elementary education in England 
presented in the chapter, it appears that in the period from 1876 to 1893 
the accommodation in elementary day schools increased 70 per cent, the 
enrollment 74 per cent, and the average attendance 106 per cent. The 
increase in the population during the same time was 22.6. For the 
somewhat shorter period, 1880 to 1893, Scotland shows an increase of 
22.5 per cent in school accommodation, of 24.4 per cent in enrollment, 
and 34 per cent in average attendance. The population in the same time 
increased by 10.4 per cent. The high rate of increase in enrollment in 
. England calls to mind the dearth of school provision and the alarming 
degree of illiteracy which gave rise to the agitation resulting in the 
school law of 1870. The first purpose of the law, i. e., the bringing of 
school privileges within the reach of all children, has been accom- 
plished. In the matter of school enrollment, England now occupies a 
leading position, 174 of the population being included in the school 
registers. Scotland had no such deficiencies to overcome. Here the 
passage of the school law (1872) was simply a measure for adjusting the 
school system to modern conditions; even here, however, the increase 
in school attendance is greater than the increase in population. The 
slightly smaller proportion of the population enrolled in Scotland than 
in England (164 as against 174 per cent) is due to the smaller attend- 
ance of the infants (i. e., children under 7 years of age) in the northern 
division of the Kingdom. 
Among other interesting tacts brought to view by the comparative 
tableis the increase in the adult teaching force, with the accompanying 
decline of the pupil-teacher system. The gradual elevation of the ideal 
of elementary instruction is of scarcely less importance than the steady 
effort to make adequate school provision. This developing ideal appears 
from the survey of changes in the conditions under which schools may _ 
share in the Government grant. ‘ 
The latest regulations (i.e., for 1895!) practically put an end to the 
system of “payment upon results.” Similar changes have taken place

also with respect to evening schools, which in the great cities are rap- 
idly assuming the character of evening high schools. 
In an article on “Industrial schools versus juvenile crime,” cited in 
the chapter, Mr. A. A. W. Drew, an official of long experience in the 
work, makes many pertinent suggestions on the relation of truancy to 
juvenile criminality and the nature of corrective agencies. 
The chapter closes with a tabular summary relating to state-aided 
colleges, which are the latest outcome of the sense of public responsi- 
bility with respect to popular education. 
Chapter VI deals with education in France. As regards the system 
in general, no official information has been published since the issue of 
my last annual report. The detailed view of primary instruction pre- 
sented in Chapter VI is condensed from the latest report of the 
government statistical commission.'. The report covers the periods 
1887 to 1892, maintaining at every point comparison between the 
beginning and the end of the half decade. 
On the whole, the condition of primary instruction appears to be 
very satisfactory. The school provision of the country for children 
of the obligatory school age—6 to 13 years—is nearly complete, and is 
supplemented by infant schools and adult schools, which are liberally 
supported. The enrollment in primary schools (5,471,402) is a little 
more than 14 per cent of the population, a ratio relatively about the 
same as in neighboring countries, although absolutely less. The 
inequality is due to the fact that the ratio of school population to total 
population in France (12 per cent) is below the normal. The main- 
tenance of a high standard of preparation, both professional and 
scholastic, is a characteristic feature of the primary teaching force. 
Of the men teachers less than 14$ per cent were without a teacher’s 
diploma or a university degree in 1891-92, and of the women only 124 
per cent without diploma. The publie schools surpass the private in the 
proportion of teachers having diplomas, the ratios being respectively 98 
and 82 per cent. With regard to certain other particulars the showing 
is less favorable. As compared with 1886-87 there has been a slight 
decline in school enrollment, in round numbers 55,000, or a little less 
than 1 per cent. This is in part accounted for by the decline in the 
school population (three-tenths per cent) during the same time. 
Increased attendance upon the primary classes of secondary schools 
and temporary causes would account also for a part of the loss in the 
primary schools. Still, with all the conditions in view, the commission 
express the opinion that the compulsory law (1882) is not so strictly 
enforced as at the beginning of the period reviewed. The schools that 
have suffered loss are either private secular or public clerical schools, 
chiefly the latter. t

XXVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
Naturally, all the data bearing upon the relative strength of public 
and private, or, more particularly, of secular and church schools, are 
carefully analyzed by the commission. The public schools derive their 
support from the Government, and are intended to be nurseries of 
patriotism; private schools, although subject to Government inspec- 
tion, are free from Government control; they may even foster social 
‘ and political sentiments at variance with the Government. 
Whatever be the general course of the private schools in these 
respects, the church schools are naturally opposed to the Government 
policy of secular education, hence they afford a means of measuring 
the strength of that policy. In 1892, private schools of all classes 
enrolled 23 per cent of the pupils in elementary schools as against 20 
per cent in 1887. The gain has been wholly in the church schools, 
which enrolled 20 per cent of the pupils at the later date as against 17 
per cent at the earlier. The change is due chiefly to the transfer of 
boys from public schools owing to the enforcement of the law prohib- 
iting the further employment of teachers belonging to religious orders. 
The time allowed for the execution of the law in schools for boys expired 
in 1891. It is yet too early to decide what the ultimate outcome of the 
law may be; meanwhile the immediate effects are watched with deep 
interest. 
Average attendance, as the term is understood in the United States, 
is an item that does not appear in French reports. Instead of this the 
attendance on two days, one at the season of highest average and the 
other at the season of lowest, is reported. Comparison in this respect 
between 1887 and 1892 shows a slight decline at the later date. The 
increased attendance upon superior primary or high schools, about 20 
per cent in five years, and the increasing number of pupils securing the 
certificate of primary studies and the high-school diploma (an increase 
of 30,000 in the former case and 600 in the latter) are adduced among 
the excellent results of the spread of popular instruction. In this con- 
nection, also, is noted the decreasing ratio of illiterate conscripts, there 
having been 89.7 per cent able to read and write in 1886 as against 92.6 
in 1891. 
The criminal statistics of the country have been carefully analyzed 
by the commission with a view to showing what they disclose, if any- 
thing, as to the relations of crime and education. With the spread of 
public instruction, the proportion of illiterate criminals necessarily 
declines; the statistics indicate, however, that the standard of attain- 
ments on the part of criminals is very low. It appears also from the 
results of the prison schools that a certain proportion of criminals, 
about 15 per cent, are incapable of profiting by instruction. The cur- 
rent expenditure for primary education increased about 7 per cent dur- 
ing the half decade, reaching, in round numbers, $37,200,000. The 
increase in the proportion of the expenditure borne by the State, i. e., 
from 49 per cent to 68 per cent, was caused by the State assuming the 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
  EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. XXVII 
payment of teachers’ salaries. This has been done with a view to 
securing a fair minimum salary to all teachers and perfecting the 
organization of the service. 
The fact, however, that school attendance decreases while the central 
Government increases its efforts for the improvement of the schools, 
throws some doubt on the wisdom of the centralizing policy. Possibly 
alarger measure of local responsibility would increase local enthusiasm 
for the schools. It is difficult to draw conclusions from conditions 
totally unlike those that prevail in our own country. It appears, how- 
ever, that while a centralized authority is more favorable for the incep- 
tion of reforms in a system of education, it does not insure greater 
stability or efficiency than is attainable through local influences. 
Chapter VII, on “Education in Central Europe,” begins with a brief 
mention of the previous publications of the Bureau on the subject of 
public education in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. 
Then follows an article on “Results of Prussian common-school sta- 
tistics,” which is prepared from Professor Tews’s elaborate exposé of 
that subject. The school authorities of most German States publish 
summaries of school statistics only at intervals of three or more years; 
the last one of Prussia received was published in the year 1891. The 
official statements were used in the reports of this Bureau without com- 
ment. But since then a number of weighty criticisms have appeared 
which place the statistical facts offered in the proper focus and analyze 
them from the standpoint of present necessities. No hostile motives 
prompted these efforts, for the minister of public education himself 
frankly admitted in the House of Deputies that “he was still strug- 
gling to obtain the daily bread with which to maintain the schools.” 
The author, Prof. J. Tews, of Berlin, discusses the statistics of 
elementary schools and teachers of Prussia. He shows ability in 
grouping, analyzing, and presenting statistical data, and hence his 
statements are readily accepted by the press of Germany and other 
countries. In his statements concerning the school population and 
overcrowding of class rooms he goes into statistical details, and his 
comparisons reveal new and interesting data. For instance, it appears 
that in 1886 Prussia had still 17,744 ungraded rural schools, with 
1,146,701 children; while in 1891 the number of such schools had 
decreased to 16,600, with only 969,598 children. There is a general 
increase in the grading of schools going on in Prussia. 
The comparisons between the east and west sections of the Kingdom 
are very noteworthy and instructive. In city schools the average num- 
ber of class rooms to the school varies between 6 and 25. The most 
surprising fact brought out is that within nine years the number of 
teachers needed and not supplied has increased from 6,000 to 12,000, 
and that the proportion of teachers to the number of classes has 
decreased from 91 per cent to 80 per cent. The showing in regard to 
the number of pupils to one teacher appears better, because while in  
-P-A-G-E-28
    XXVIII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
1882 the number of pupils to each teacher was 72.4, in the year 1890 
it was exactly 70. 
School attendance in Prussia is another prominent subject of which 
hitherto very little has been accurately known. The author notes a 
marked improvement. He also shows that the salaries of teachers 
have greatly increased, although he is unable to prove them adequate 
as yet. The comparison made by the author reveals that the Protestant 
schools have made more rapid progress than the Catholic schools. 
Over these conditions the State has no control, since elementary edu- 
eation is, and has ever been, so far as organization is concerned, a mat- 
ter belonging strictly to local communities. It is only in the super- 
vision of the instruction:and the distribution of State funds that the 
State takes a hand in the management. The upper grades of elemen- 
tary schools, the so-called intermediate or middle schools of Prussia, 
are then compared, and the comparison proves fruitful. This class of 
schools is very dear to the average citizen, representing as it does the 
most advanced state of elementary education. 
A very curious and, indeed for our conditions here in America, inter- 
esting fact is revealed in the comparison of nationalities as represented 
by the language spoken in the families of the school population of 
Prussia. It shows that there is still a large percentage of the popula- 
tion of the State who speak Polish only, or Danish only, amounting to 
about 10 per cent of the population. 
Like the foregoing facts, the statement concerning the proportions in 
which State and community meet the expenditures attract our atten- 
tion. The statistician, Mr. Mulhall, recently published the statement 
that the United States paid about $2.50 per capita of population for its 
schools, while Germany paid only 50-cents. The official statistics of 
Prussia show that this is erroneous, because the 50 cents per capita 
represent only the contribution of the State as such, communities and 
other agencies paying 42 per cent of the expenses. This would raise 
the amount to nearly $1. Tuition fees, receipts from school funds and 
endowments and from church exchequers amount to a great deal more, 
so that the per capita in Prussia, which is by no means the largest per 
capita in Germany, amounts to nearly $1.50. 
Accepting Mr, Mullhall’s consideration of the purchasing power of 
money in Germany as compared with that of America, it is reasonable 
to say that there is little difference between the $1.50 paid m Prussia 
and the $2.50 quoted for America. Mr. Tews concludes his article with 
the statement fully upheld by the facts preceding it, that an improve- 
ment of common schools is, and ever will be, a question of finance. 
In the second part of this scrutiny of Prussian school statistics, the 
conditions of the teachers are spoken of. The author has much to say 
on the question of parentage of teachers in Prussia. Is it true, that 
these are chiefly from the lower strata of society? The official statistics 
make an attempt at social definitions which seem reasonable. The
-P-A-G-E-29
  EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. XXIX 
fillowing statement is the general result: The 62,273 men and 8,439 
women teachers come, in 22,701 cases, from the agricultural popula- 
tion; in 20,409 cases from the industrial population; in 7,190 cases from 
the commercial population; and in 18,740 cases from the professional 
population. 
Also with reference to creeds, the statistics of teachers are reviewed. 
Then follows an attempt at grouping the teachers according to their 
age. Tables are given which may be used in this country as a basis of 
comparison in future computations. 
The question of sex in teaching is less ably treated for the obvious 
reason that the fact only lately begins to impress itself upon the Ger- 
man educational authorities that women are particularly well fitted for 
the teaching of primary grades. Various other points of interest may 
be left unnoticed in this introduction. 
The author mentions, however, the great discrepancy in the expendi- 
ture for elementary schools, as compared with those for secondary and 
higher institutions of learning. His calculation shows that every ele- 
mentary school child costs the State $7.08 a year. Every student in 
the intermediate schools costs $21.66. A student in a secondary school 
costs $26.89, and one in the universities $148.75, 
After this statistical exposé a brief article on the attendance in see- 
ondary schools in Germany is offered which is based on the publications 
and statistical survey made for the World’s Fair in Chicago. This has 
a particular interest to teachers in secondary schools in this country, 
since it reveals the fact that the proportion of students in secondary 
schools is about 5 per cent of the entire school population. 
A survey of the courses of study pursued in history in secondary 
schools found in vogue in Germany 1s opportune because the courses of 
study in secondary schools are made the subject of more thorough study 
m this country. The facts offered are given by Professor Baar, of 
Malmedy, Rhenish Prussia. 
For the history of education a bibliography of German books is 
added. This isa continuation of similar work begun in previous reports. 
This bibliography contains only books of recognized literary value. 
Mere magazine articles are omitted. 
An exhibit of the statistics of the university libraries in the several 
countries of Europe shows nearly six million volumes in Germany, two 
and one-half millions in Italy, and a less number in each of the other 
countries. It is to be remarked, however, that in Great Britain and 
France the public libraries (British Museum, Liverpool Public Library, 
for example) make up for the deficiencies of the universities, if indeed 
the figures are correct for those countries. 
Among the appliances for teaching which every university offers its 
teachers and students the library takes the front rank. A statistical 
summary of the number of volumes in these libraries, their actual 
expenditures, and, so far as possible, the number of books used in a

  given year, throws light upon the degree of scientific equipment of the 
institutions and offers a useful ratio of comparison. 
The chapter contains also a suryey of the common schools of Berlin 
which exhibits in characteristic features the growth and improvements 
of that city school system. It is a memorial prepared for the dedica- 
tion of the two hundredth city common-school building by one of the 
assistant school superintendents, Dr. Zwick. This memorial contains 
a great amount of local history, and the part which shows how the 
common school has gradually arisen from the so-called city pauper 
school proves that the German common school is not older than the 
American common school; that, indeed, the idea of a school common 
to all classes of society is not a German creation at all. 
Professor Mischler, of Strasburg, the statistician, has collected a 
number of summaries of public education from all the civilized coun- 
tries of the world, placed them in juxtaposition and compared them 
with reference to a few leading items, namely, attendance, expenditure, 
illiteracy, etc. He has done this for periods of thirty, forty, or fifty 
years, as far as obtainable, and endeavored to show the ratio of prog- 
ress in various countries. Naturally, he has been limited to very few 
items, because the science of statistics itself seareely dates back far- 
ther than the beginning of school registers in the present generation. 
The final results and conclusions. at which he arrives are hopeful and 
encouraging, 
The growth of the Italian people, from the time when Italy was the 
field of contest for other nation’s to the date of a united Italy, is shown. 
in Chapter VIII, by Dr. Hinsdale, professor of pedagogy in Michigan 
University. In the annual report of this Bureau for 1890-91 an excel- 
lent exhibit of education in Italy was prepared by Professor Oldrini, 
and additional matter of great value was furnished by the director of 
the royal statistical bureau of Italy, Signor Luigi Bodio, who courte- 
ously proffered his aid on his visit to this country to attend the session 
of the International Statistical Association held in Chicago (1894). 
Famed as Italy was for centuries in the matter of higher education, its 
people’s schools were neither numerous nor well attended until com- 
paratively recent times. From northern Italy, where the most progres- 
sive movements originated, popular education has gradually advanced 
southward. The Casati law, enacted by the Sardinian Parliament in 
1859, furnished the first basis of educational progress, and, with mod- 
ifications, it has been adopted in each province as it became a part of 
the political unity. The unification of Italy with its provinces, one by 
one wrested from foreign invaders, was the first step toward the present 
conditions, where, in a country burdened with debt and supporting 
an enormous army and navy, over $23,000,000 annually is spent for 
education. 
The centralization of the administration and educational forces in 
Rome, with the King as the executive, gave an impetus to educational 
effort. Through the department of public instruction, with its ramifi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. XXXI 
ations inte the various provinces, his majesty is cognizant of and takes 
interest in all progressive measures throughout Italy, and this very 
entralization of authority has aided in securing popular education 
hroughout the Kingdom. 
In 1861, omitting Venetia and Rome (the former subject to Austria, 
he latter to the Pope), the illiteracy of the inhabitants above 20 years 
f age was 73.50 per cent; twenty years later (1881) this had decreased 
0 63.45 per cent. In 1891 the percentage of illiterates of all ages was 
5; from 12 to 20 years, 42; and the marriage registers show only 28.39 
er cent for men and women in northern Italy. 
The number of pupils in public elementary schools has doubled since 
862. In that year 1,008,674 pupils were reported in 21,353 schools; 
in 1892, 2,266,593 pupils in 49,217 schools. In the last five years 
(1887-1892) training schools for teachers have increased from 135 to 
149; pupils from 11,060 to 18,020. 
Education is not compulsory above the elementary grades, yet the 
classical schools (ginnaso and licei, corresponding to our high scheols 
land academies and including our first two years of college) had 71,751 
students in 1891-92, and the technical schools and institutes 40,928 stu- 
dents in 1890-91. Seeking classical training in 1881, students, 63,860; 
seeking technical training for practical life in 1880, students, 28,069. 
The 21 universities show an accelerated increase in number of pupils; 
in 1856 a student population of 9,449, in 1882 of 12,919, in 1891-92 
increase to 17,792. The faculties of law and medicine had and have 
the largest number of students—5,330 in law in 1888, in medicine 8,018; 
in 1892 there were 5,442 law students, 7,326 in medicine and surgery, 
and 1,452 in pharmacy. 
Special attention is called in this article to the growth of the public’ 
schools in Rome during a twenty-years’ period. The development is 
noticeable in point of numbers, in the variety of schools, and range of 
instruction. In 1870 there were 41 schools and 6,291 pupils; in 1890, 
142 schools and 26,149 pupils. The cost of the schools of Rome in 
1871 was 579,375 lire ($111,819); in 1889 it was 2,760,816 lire ($522,837). 
Developing with “the new political Italy” there has been “a new 
educational Italy;” there is now ‘a national system of education,” 
“born of national spirit,” “coextensive with the national territory.” 
Practical training and scientific instruction now interest the people “in 
the land of the Renaissance,” where also “the classical tradition was

The subject of education in Russia was presented at some length 
in my report for 1890-91 (pp. 194-262). Attention was called to the 
complex conditions with which the authorities have to deal in their 
efforts to educate a people of which only 79.89 per cent are Russians; 
8.11 per cent belong to the Aryan races from the East; 2.67 per cent 
to the Semitic races; 9.17 per cent to the Finnish and Tartar groups; 
0.17 per cent to other races. Special attention was directed to the

form of government—the mir, or village community (of which there 
were 107,493 in European Russia), whose affairs are regulated in a gen- 
eral assembly of all the heads of families of the mir or village; to the 
Russian system of village industries suited to the locality, and to the 
reform movements in Russian universities which tend to more thor- 
oughly nationalize these institutions. 
The following brief statement epitomizes the above facts; it presents 
a total of 6.9 per cent of children of school age in school in 1875 and 
of 11 per cent in 1888, an increase in 13 years of 4 per cent. Thus it 
appears that there were 93.1 per cent of children of school age who 
were not in school in the former year and 89 per cent in the latter year. 
According to reports, only 2 per cent of the aggregate population are 
at school, and only 20 per cent of the recruits can read and write. 
School ofticials—curators, directors, ete.—have been called to St. Peters- 
burg to discuss the subject, and, as a result, compulsory attendance 
is to be enforced from the beginning of 1895 in the “ governments” of 
Charkov, Poltava, Kursk, and Woronetz. 
It is stated that ‘¢a rural school-teacher averages about $8.82 salary 
for a winter’s teaching.” The teacher has lodging and board, however. 
Special effort is being made to nationalize (or ‘ Russianize”) all 
schools. This is particularly noticeable in the Dorpat district, where 
the German element predominates; a Russian inspector has now taken 
the place of the rector of the university, student societies have been 
prohibited, and the Russian language is to be used in giving instrue- 
tion. 
A commission, or number of committees, is engaged in devising the 
best means to be adopted in founding a system of education for the 
whole Empire. One committee has acted as agent for the distribution | 
of needed school books. In 1894 the number distributed was 51,500, 
of which 86 per cent went to the “governments” of Central Russia, | 
where the Zemstvos, or provincial assemblies, were endeavoring to 
improve their schools. Another committee aided in the establishment 
of school libraries; another is engaged in collecting statistical informa- 
tion so as to more thoroughly present the educational needs of different 
subdivisions of the Empire. 
From the remotest period to the accession of Peter the Great the 
social organization of Russia was based on the patriarchal idea—women 
being excluded from school privileges. Catherine the Second was the 
first sovereign to display an interest in the education of the women of 
Russia. She established, in 1764, an Educational Home for Girls of 
Noble Birth. From that beginning there was developed an educational 
work which is presented in an historical sketch of the Marie (so called 
from the Empress Marie Fedorovna, 1796-1828) educational and chari- 
table institutions. Under the immediate patronage of their majesties, 
the Ozar and Czarina, these include hospitals and benevolent institu- 
tions, schools for the deaf, dumb, and blind, public schools and insti-

   tes for girls. In twelve years the Russian people have contributed 
10,000,000 rubles toward the support of the 472 institutions. In 1891 
here were 24,417 persons in the educational establishments and 498,108 
ere aided by the Marie institutions which receive support from the 
imperial family, from endowments previously founded, from a subsidy 
mposed of 500,000 rubles accorded by the State treasury, from pay- 
ents of pupils, and from public contributions. 
In addition to the development of the Russian village industries, 
hanual training is now taught in 19 teachers’ seminaries, in 6 gymnasia, 
1 18 military colleges, in 150 town and village schools, and there are 
even temporary manual-training courses for teachers. 
In Finland, a grand duchy of Russia, one still finds much of the 
urdy independence of the Swedes, to which nation it belonged until 
809. 
The Swedes and Finns formed a single nation for seven hundred 
ears, and for a long period Swedish ideas predominated. About 85 
er cent of the inhabitants of Finland are Finns and 14 per cent are 
wedes, but the Swedes have been the dominating, cultured element 
rv years; now there is greater equalization. In religious persuasion 
8.05 per cent are Protestants. 
Hach nationality has its own schools where the instruction is given 
either the Swedish or Finnish language, and there are also Swedish- 
‘innish schools in sections where the population is of too mixed a 
haracter to make it advisable to support separate schools. 
The ambulatory school, as in Sweden, is a noteworthy feature. The 
leacher holds a school for a short period in one place and then moves 
m to another, much in the way that the circuit courts move about in 
jhe United States. In Finland in 1891 the ratio to the hundred of pop- 
lation was 7.47 in ambulatory schools and 2.41 in stationary schools of 
mn elementary grade. Of the school population of 470,382 (7 to 16 
ears), only 21,523 children were not receiving any instruction at all. 
Coeducation has been attempted in some schools of both elementary 
nd secondary grades, and it is stated that, since 1883, five private 
coeducational institutions (four for the Swedes, one for the Finns) have 
een created, but the authorities do not as yet favor the giving of sub- 
idies to coeducational institutions. 
The benefits of education have been brought within the reach of the 
umblest peasant in Finland, and the comparative prosperity of the peo- 
le is due in part to this. Impetus has been given to agriculture and 
rorticulture, and to dairy farming, and prizes are offered to encourage 
he peasant class to develop the best methods of carrying on agricul- 
ural pursuits. Skilled persons go from place to place and instruct in 
sarpentering, smithcraft, fish curing, ete. Temperance associations 
nave been organized, and many pamphlets distributed which point out 
she dangers of alcoholic stimulants.

Competition in athletic sports is another feature authorized by th 
authorities; gymnastics is obligatory for both sexes in institutions 0: 
all grades, and school children are taught to swim, to skate, to rid 
bicycles, ete. 
In my report for 1892-93 I ineluded a chapter on child study (Vol. I 
pp. 357-391). The subject is continued in the present report, in con, 
nection with a survey of recent movements pertaining to psychology i 
general (Chap. X). 
Attention is called to new periodicals devoted to the subject as 
whole or to some particular phase—i. e., The Psychological Review, Th 
Child Study Monthly, etc.—and to the societies formed for promotin 
research in this province. Emphasis is placed upon the movement 
for correlating the results of different classes of investigation; th 
equipment of the leading universities for research in psycho-physies ii 
given somewhat in detail with notices of the courses in child stud 
maintained side by side with laboratory work. The principal results o: 
the new psychology bearing directly upon school work are cited, an 
emphasis is placed upon their agreement with the conclusions reaches 
by physiological investigations. 
To the general survey of the movement several papers are appended. 
comprising discussions of the relations between the old and the ne 
psychology, by Dr. Miinsterberg, the bearing of the new psycholog 
upon education by Dr. G. Stanley Hall, and other papers, discussin 
certain aspects of child study, the scope of psycho-physiology, and th 
grounds for the medical inspection of schools. The chapter conclude 
with a bibliography of the general subject covering the current year. 
The National Educational Association has of late years undertake 
several problems of great importance. A committee appointed at th 
Saratoga meeting in 1892 was charged with the examination of the exist. 
ing courses of study and ¢onditions of the secondary schools—that i 
to say, all institutions above the elementary schools which undertak 
to prepare students for college. This “committee of ten,” as it ii 
commonly called, reported extensively on its work, and its report wa: 
completed and published in the spring of 1894. 
Meanwhile, in the superintendents’ section of the National Educa- 
tional Association, another committee was appointed to investigate 
in a like manner the work of elementary schools. This committee 
consisted of fifteen members. Three questions were submitted to it: 
(a) The organization of city school systems; (b) the correlation of 
studies in elementary education, and (¢) the training of teachers. In 
order to facilitate the work the committee was divided into three sec- 
tions, each consisting of five members, and each of these sections was 
intrusted with reporting on one of the three questions mentioned. 
Their reports were laid before the National Educational Association in 
February, 1895, and were vigorously discussed in the educational and 
other journals of this country. In order to preserve these documents 
I have caused them to be reprinted in this annual report.

   One of the members of the committee, Superintendent James M. 
reenwood, of Kansas City, Mo., dissents from the majority report in 
he opinion expressed regarding arithmetic. He has kindly furnished 
ea number of shorthand reports of arithmetic lessons taken in the 
chools under his charge. They are of sufficient interest to teachers to 
ive them a place in this volume in the form of a supplement to the 
committee report. I add also a reprint of an article from the report of 
he St. Louis schools for the year 1872-73, entitled “ Educational 
alues.” It contains a somewhat fuller discussion of some of the points 
elative to the educative value of the several studies in elementary and 
econdary schools, and in this way may be useful in explaining points 
hat would seem to be obscure in the report of the subcommittee on the 
leorrelation of studies. 
In the report of the committee of fifteen on the correlation of 
studies it was partly assumed that the studies of the school fall natu- 
ally into five coordinate groups, thus permitting a choice within each 
group as to the arrangement of its several topics, some finding a place 
early in the curriculum and others later. These five coordinate groups 
Were, first, mathematics and physics; second, biology, including chiefly 
the plant and the animal; third, literature and art, including chiefly the 
study of literary works of art; fourth, grammar and the technical 
and scientific study of language, leading to such branches as logic and 
psychology; fifth, history and the study of sociological, political, and 
social institutions, Hach one of these groups, it was assumed, should 
Ibe represented in the curriculum at all times by some topie suited to 
the age and previous training of the pupil. This would be demanded 
by the two kinds of correlation defined in that report as (1) “symmet- 
vical whole of studies in the world of human learning,” and (2) “the 
psychological symmetry, or the whole mind.” 
The first period of school education is education for culture and edu- 
cation for the purpose of gaining command of the conventionalities of 
intelligence. These conventionalities are such arts as reading and 
writing and the use of figures, technicalities of maps, dictionaries, the 
art of drawing, and all of those semimechanical facilities which enable 
the child to get access to the intellectual conquests of the race. Later 
on in the school course, when the pupil passes out of his elementary 
studies, which partake more of the nature of practice than of theory, 
he comes in the secondary school and the college to the study of sci- 
ence and the technic necessary for its preservation and communication. 
All these things belong to the first stage of school instruction, the aim 
of which is culture. On the other hand, post-graduate work and the 
work of professional schools have not the aim of culture so much as the 
aim of fitting the person for a special vocation. In the post-graduate 
work of universities the demand is for original investigation in special 
fields. In the professional school the student masters the elements of 
a particular practice, learning its theory and its art.

  XXXVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
It is in the first part of education—the schools for culture—that th 
five coordinate branches should be represented in a symmetrical man- 
ner. Itis not to be thought that a course of university study, or that 
of a professional school should be symmetrical. The study of specia 
fields of learning should come after a course of study for culture hai 
been pursued in which the symmetrical whole of human learning and] 
the symmetrical whole of the soul are considered. From the primary} 
school, therefore, on through the academic course of the college, there 
should be symmetry, and five coordinate groups of studies represented) 
at each part of the course, at least in each year, although perhaps not 
throughout each part of the year. 
Commencing with the outiook of the child upon the world of nature, 
it has been found that arithmetic or mathematical study furnishes the} 
first scientific key to the existence of bodies and their various motions. 
Mathematics in its pure form, as arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and the| 
application of the analytical method, as well as mathematics applied) 
to matter and force or statics and dynamics, furnishes the peculiar 
study that gives to us, whether as children or as men, the command of 
nature in this, its quantitative aspect. Mathematics furnishes the 
instrument, the tool of thought, which gives us power in this realm. 
But useful, nay, essential, as this mathematical or quantitative study is 
for this first aspect of nature, it is limited to it, and should not be 
applied to the next phase of nature, which is that of organic life; for 
we must not study in the growth of the plant simply the mechanical 
action of forces, but we must subordinate everything quantitative and 
mathematical to the principle of life or movement according to internal 
purpose or design. The principle of life, or biology, is no substitute, on 
the other hand, for the mathematical or quantitative study. The forces, 
heat, light, electricity, magnetism, galvanism, gravitation, inorganic 
matter—all these things are best studied from the mathematical point 
of view. The superstitious savage, however, imposes upon the inor- 
ganic world the principle of biology. He sees the personal effort of 
spirits in winds and storms, in fire and flowing streams. He substi- 
tutes for mathematics the principle of life, and looks in the movement 
of inanimate things for an indwelling soul. This is the animistic stand- 
point of human culture—the substitution of the biologic method of 
looking at the world for the quantitative or mathematical view. 
The second group includes whatever is organic in nature—especially 
studies relating to the plant and the animal—the growth of material 
for food and clothing, and in a large measure for means of transporta- 
tion and culture. This study of the organic phase of nature forms a 
great portion of the branch of study. known as geography in the ele- 
mentary school. Geography takes up also some of the topics that 
belong to the mathematical or quantitative view of nature, but it 
takes them up into a new combination with a view to show how they 
are related to organic life—to creating and supplying the needs of the
-P-A-G-E-37
  
CORRELATION OF STUDIES. | XXXVII 
plant, animal, and man. There is, it is true, a “concentration” in 
this respect, that the mathematical or quantitative appears in geogra- 
phy as subordinated to the principle of organic life, for the quantita- 
tive—namely, inorganic matter and the forces of the solar system— 
appear as presuppositions of life. Life uses this as material out of 
which to organize its structures. The plant builds itself a structure 
of vegetable cells, transmuting what is inorganic into vegetable tissue; 
so, too, the animal builds over organic and inorganic substances, draw- 
ing from the air gnd water and from inorganic salts and acids, and by 
use of heat, light, and electricity converting vegetable tissue into ani- 
mal tissue. The revelation of the life principle in plant and animal is 
not a mathematical one; it is not a mechanism moved by pressure from 
without or by attraction from within; it is not a mere displacement or 
an aggregation, or anything of that sort. In so far as it is organic, 
there is a formative principle which originates motion and modifies the 
inorganic materials and the mere dynamic forces of nature, giving 
them special form and direction, so as to build up vegetable or animal 
structures. 
Kant defined organism as something within which every part is both 
means and end to all the other parts; all the other parts function in 
building up or developing each part, and each part in its turn is a 
means for the complete growth of every other part. These two phases 
of nature, the inorganic and the organic, exhaust the entire field. 
Hence a quantitative study conducted in pure and applied mathe- 
matics and biology (or the study of life in its manifestations) covers 
nature. 
It has been asked whether drawing does not belong to a separate 
group in the course of study, and whether manual training is not a 
study coordinate with history and grammar. There are a number of 
branches of study, such as drawing, manual training, physical culture, 
and the like, which ought to be taught in every well-regulated school, 
but they will easily find a place within the five groups so far as their 
intellectual coefficients are concerned. Drawing, for instance, may 
belong to art or esthetics on one side, but practically it is partly 
physical training with a view to skill in the hand and eye, and partly 
mathematical with a view to the production of geometric form. As a 
physical training its rationale is to be found in physiology, and hence 
it belongs in this respect to the second phase of the study of nature. 
As relating to the production of form it belongs to geometry and 
trigonometry and arithmetic, or the first phase of nature, the inorganic. 
As relating to art, or the esthetic, it belongs to the third group of 
studies, within which literature is the main discipline. 
But beside literature there are architecture, sculpture, painting, and 
music to be included in the esthetic or art group of studies. Manual 
training, on the other hand, relates to the transformation of material 
such as wood or stone or other minerals into structures for human use, 
   
-P-A-G-E-38
    XXXVIII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
namely, for architecture and for machines. It is clear enough that the 
rationale of all this is to be found in mathematics, hence manual train- 
ing does not furnish a new principle different from that found in the 
first or the second study relating to nature. 
The first study relating to human nature, as contrasted with mere 
organic and inorganic nature, is literature. Literature, as the fifth and 
highest of the fine arts, reveals human nature in its intrinsic form. It 
may be said in general that a literary work of art, a poem, whether 
lyric, dramatic, or epic, or a prose work of art, such as a novel or a 
drama, reyeals human nature in its height and depth. It shows the 
growth of a feeling or sentiment first into a conviction and then into a 
deed; feelings, thoughts, and deeds are thus connected by a literary 
work of art in such a way as to explain a complete genesis of human 
action. Moreover, in a literary work of art there is a revelation of man 
as a member of social institutions. 
The nucleus of the literary work of art is usually an attack of the 
individual upon some one of the social institutions of which he is a 
member, namely, a collision with the State, with civil society, or with 
the church. This collision furnishes an occasion for either a comic or 
a tragic solution. The nature of the individual and of his evolution of 
feeling into thoughts and deeds is shown vividly upon the background 
of institutions and social life. The work of art, whether music, paint- 
ing, sculpture, or architecture, belongs to the same group as literature, 
and itis obvious that the method in which the work of art should be 
studied is not the method adopted as applicable to inorganic nature or 
to organic nature. The physiology of a plant or an animal, and the 
habits and modes of growth and peculiarities of action on the part of 
plants and animals, are best comprehended by a different method of 
study from that which should be employed in studying the work of art. 
The work of art has a new principle, one that transcends life. It is 
the principle of responsible individuality and the priuciple of free sub- 
ordination on the part of the individual to a social whole. It is in fact’ 
the exercise of original responsibility in opposition to a social whole, 
and the consequent retribution or other reaction that makes the con- 
tent of the work of art. Further discussion is not necessary to show 
how absurd would be a purely mathematical treatment, or a biological 
treatment, of awork of art. Mathematics and biology must enter into 
a consideration of works of art only in a very subordinate degree. It 
would be equally absurd to attempt to apply the method in which a 
work of art should be studied to the study of an organic form or to the 
study of inorganic matter and forces. 
The next coordinate branch includes grammar and language, and 
studies allied to it, such as logic and psychology. In the elementary 
school we have only grammar. Grammar treats of the structure 
of language; there is a mechanical side to it in orthography, and a 
technical side to it in etymology and syntax. But one can not call
-P-A-G-E-39
CORRELATION OF STUDIES. XXXIX 
grammar in any peculiar sense a formal study any more than he can 
apply the same epithet to one of the natural sciences. Natural science 
deals with the laws of material bodies and forces. Laws are forms of act- 
ing or of being, and yet by far the most important content of natural 
science is stated in the laws which it has discovered. So in the studies 
that relate to man the forms of human speech are very important. All 
grammatical studies require a twofold attitude of the mind, one toward 
the sign and one toward the signification; the shape of a letter or the 
form of a word or the peculiarity of a vocal utterance, these must be 
attended to, but they must be at once subordinated to the significance 
of the hidden thought which has become revealed by the sign or 
utterance. 
The complexity of grammatical study is seen at once from this point 
of view. It is a double act of the will focusing the attention upon two 
different phases at once, namely, upon the natural phase and the 
spiritual phase, and the fusion of the two in one. Looking at this 
attitude of the mind, at this method of grammatical study, we see at 
ouce how different it all is from the attitude of the mind in the study 
of a work of art. In grammar we should not look to an evolution of a 
feeling into a thought or a deed; that would be entirely out of place. 
But we must give attention to the literal and prosaic word written or 
spoken, and consider it as an expression of a thought. We must note 
the structure of the intellect as revealed in this form: The word is a 
part of speech, having some one of the many functions which the word 
can fulfill in expressing a thought. Deeper down than grammatical 
structure is the logical structure, and this is a more fundamental reve- 
lation of the action of pure mind. Logic is in fact a part of psychology. 
Opening from one door toward another, we pass on our way from. 
orthography, etymology, and syntax to logic and to psychology. All 
the way we use the same method; we use the sign or manifestation as 
ameans of discovering the thought and the scientific classification of 
the thought. 
Much has been said in the report of the committee of fifteen on the 
abuse of grammar in the study of literary works of art. The method 
of grammar leads to wonderful insight into the nature of reason itself. 
It is this insight which it gives us into our methods of thinking and 
of uttering our thoughts that furnishes the justification for grammar 
as one of the leading studies in the curriculum. Its use in teaching 
correct speaking and writing is always secondary to this higher use, 
which is to make conscious in man the structure of his thinking and 
expression. Important as it is, however, when it is substituted for the 
method of studying art it becomes an abuse. It is a poor way to study 
Shakespeare, Milton, Chaucer, and the Bible to grammatically parse 
them or analyze them, or to devote the time to their philological pecul- 
iarities, the history of the development of their language, or such 
matters. The proper method of studying the work of art is not a  
-P-A-G-E-40
XL REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
substitute for that in grammar; it does not open the windows of the 
mind toward the logical, philological, or psychological structure of 
human thought and action. 
There is a fifth coordinate group of studies, namely, that of history. 
History looks to the formation of the state as the chief of human 
institutions. The development of states, the collisions of individ- 
uals with the state, the collisions of the states with one another—these 
form the topic of history. The method of historic study is different 
from that in grammatical study and also from that in the study of lit- 
erary and other works of art. Still more different is the method of 
history from those employed in the two groups of studies relating to 
nature, namely, the mathematical and biological methods. The history 
of literature and science has many examples of misapplications of 
method. For instance, Buckle, in his History of Civilization, has 
endeavored to apply the biological method and to some extent that of 
physics, apparently thinking that the methods of natural science, 
which are so good in their application to organic and inorganic nature, 
are likewise good for application within the realm of human nature. 
The reader of Buckle will remember, for instance, that the superstitious 
character of the Spanish people is explained by him as due to the fre- 
quency of earthquakes in the Peninsula. In selecting a physical cause 
for explaining a spiritual effect, Mr. Buckle passed over the most obvi- 
ous explanation, which is this: The people of Spain were for many 
centuries on the marches or boundaries of Christian civilization and 
over against a Moslem civilization. Wherever there is a border land 
between two conflicting civilizations—a difference, either political or 
religious—there is a sharpening of the minds of the people so far as to 
produce the effect of opposition and bigotry. A continual effort to hold 
one’s religious belief uncontaminated by the influence of a neighboring 
people leads to narrowness and to a superstitious adherence to forms. 
Narrowness and bigotry in religion are the foe to science and the friend 
to all manner of superstitions. 
Mr. Buckle’s work has interested people very much because it is an 
attempt to bring the methods of natural science into the study of human 
history. Butit can not be regarded as anything more than an example 
of the attempt to substitute for the true method in history a method 
good only in another province. 
In biology the whole animal is not fully revealed in each of his mem- 
bers, although, as stated in Kant’s definition, each part is alike the 
means and the end for all the others. The higher animals and plants 
show the greatest difference between parts and whole. But in his- 
tory it is the opposite; the lower types exhibit the greatest difference 
between the social whole and the individual citizen. The progress in 
history is toward freedom of the individual and local self-government. 
In the highest organisms of the state, therefore, there is a greater 
similarity between the individual and the national whole to which he
-P-A-G-E-41
  CHILD STUDY. XLI 
belongs. The individual takes a more active part in governing himself. 
The state becomes more and more an instrument of self-government in 
his hands. In the lowest states the gigantic personality of the social 
whole is all in all, and the individual personality is null, except in case 
of the supreme ruler and in the few associated with him. 
The method of history keeps its gaze fixed upon the development of 
the social whole and the progress which it makes in realizing within its 
citizens the freedom of the whole. This method, it is evident enough, 
° is different from those in literature and grammar; different also from 
the biological and the mathematical methods. In history we see how 
the little selves or individuals unite to form the big self or the nation. 
The analogies to this found in biology, namely, the combination of indi- 
vidual cells into the entire vegetable or animal organism, are all illusive 
so far as furnishing a clew to the process of human history. 
From the above considerations it is possible to see what is the relation 
of this inquiry into educational values to the questions of child study 
and other topics in psychology, as well as to the Herbartian principle 
of interest. First and foremost, the teacher of the school has before 
him this question of the branches of learning to be selected. These 
must be discovered by looking at the grown man in civilization rather 
than at the child. The child has not yet developed his possibilities, 
The child first shows what he is truly and internally when he becomes 
agrownman. The child is the acorn. The acorn reveals what it is in 
the oak only after a thousand years. So man has revealed what he is, 
not in the cradle, but in the great world of human history and litera- 
ture and science. He has written out his nature upon the blackboard 
of the universe. 
In order to know what there is in the human will, we look into Plu- 
tarch’s Parallel Lives. To see what man has done in philosophy, we read 
Plato, Aristotle, Leibnitz, and Hegel. For science we look to the New- 
tons and Darwins. We do not begin, therefore, with child study in our 
school education. But next after finding these great branches of human 
learning we consider the child, and how to bring him from his possi- 
bility to his reality. Then it becomes essential to study the child and 
his manner of evolution. We must discover which of its interests are 
already on the true road toward human greatness. We must likewise 
discover which ones conflict with the highest aims, and especially what 
interests there are that, although seemingly in conflict with the highest 
ends of man, are yet really tributary to human greatness, leading up to 
it by winding routes. All these are matters of child study, but they 
all presuppose the first knowledge, namely, the knowledge of the 
doings of mature humanity. There can be no step made in rational 
child study without keeping in view constantly these questions of the 
five coordinate groups of study.

  XLII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
United States. After a general introduction, in which the author dis- 
cusses the educational theory of the American common school, he pro: 
ceeds to trace, with some detail, the main outlines of the progress 
of the common-school idea from the time of its earliest appearance in 
New England. He recounts, also, the attempts at popular education 
in all of the other Colonies before the era of the Revolution, traces the 
increased interest in education of the various States as shown by the 
constitutions adopted during the war of the Revolution, and points | 
out the awakening sense of nationality in matters of education which ° 
was displayed in the grants of magnificent areas of territory in what 
was then the new Northwest for purposes of education by the Congress 
of the Confederation. 
In Chapter XVII, Rey. A. D. Mayo has given a sketch of the services 
of the late Robert Charles Winthrop to the Peabody education fund. 
In this paper also he traces briefly the career of George Peabody, show- 
ing how his fortune was accumulated, and unfolding the motives which 
led him to devote so large a share of his fortune to this particular form 
of education. Dr. Mayo traces also the career of Mr. Winthrop, and 
suggests the thought that his greatest service to the American people 
lies not in his political career, nor in his speeches and writings, but in 
the ability and fidelity which he displayed as president of the Peabody 
trustees in administering that great fund. The Peabody fund has been 
used to stimulate State and municipal action toward the organization 
and equipment of schools. It has also encouraged individual effort. 
To it more than to any other instrumentality is due the establishment 
on firm foundations of the common-school system in the South. 
By an act of Congress approved August 30, 1890, additional funds 
were granted to the different States and Territories for the more com- 
plete endowment of their colleges of agriculture and the mechanic arts. 
According to the terms of the act, the expenditure of the sums so 
appropriated was to be restricted to certain specified purposes. The 
disposition of these funds made during the current year by the various 
beneficiary institutions is given in detail in a table in Chapter I of 
Part II (pp. 792-794). 
The effect of forests upon climate, agriculture, and in regulating the 
flow of water in streams has long been acknowledged. Several Euro- 
pean nations own extensive forests, which not only perform important 
economic functions, but also, under expert management, yield immediate 
and direct revenue, The national forests of France, of 2,200,000 acres, 
yield annually about $5,000,000 net income. The planting, care, and 
preservation of forests are therefore subjects which these nations have 
recognized as demanding serious study. Mr.C, Wellman Parks, whom 
I appointed as special agent of this Bureau to the Antwerp Exposition, 
made an inquiry into the instruction given in several typical European 
forestry schools, the results of which are given in Chapter II of Part II 
(pp. 809-818), The account closes with a statement of the instruetion

in forestry given at the different land-grant colleges in the United 
States. : 
“Geology in the colleges and universities of the United States” is 
the subject of Chapter III of Part II, contributed by Thomas Cramer 
Hopkins, A. M., 8S. M., fellow in geology, University of Chicago. The 
information compiled and the matter discussed in this chapter will 
prove especially valuable to teachers of geology and to prospective 
students in geology who are desirous of comparing the work done and 
the facilities offered in the different institutions in this branch of 
science. In preparing the chapter Mr. Hopkins used the replies from 
colleges and universities received in response to a circular sent out 
from this office asking for statistics on this subject. Besides having 
access to college catalogues, he gained much information from personal 
correspondence and interviews, and secured contributions from a num- 
ber of well-known geologists in leading institutions. The matter is 
conveniently arranged and discussed by States, about 380 colleges 
and universities being mentioned, the chapter concluding with the 
statistical tables. : 
In 1887 a committee of distinguished chemists was appointed by the 
American Association for the Advancement of Science to consider the 
question of attaining uniformity in the spelling and pronunciation of 
chemical terms. Their report was adopted by the association at its 
meeting in 1891, was readopted in 1893, and is printed in full in Chapter 
IV of Part IL of this report (pp. 873-876). The summary of rules 
which it contains has also been printed by this office in the form of a 
chart for distribution to high schools and colleges. 
In Chapter V, Dr. C. M. Woodward, director of the St. Louis Manual 
Training School, has sketched the “‘Rise and progress of manual train- 
ing.” This phase of the general subject of industrial training has 
attracted a great deal of attention within the last few years, because 
of the ability of its advocates and the novelty of their claims in cer- 
tain respects, but more especially because the decay of the system of 
apprenticeship has led people to look for some means of industrial 
education that could prepare youth for their future vocations, without 
at the same time depriving them of general culture in letters and 
the arts. 
Professor Woodward is the founder of the first school in this country 
that aimed to give a manual training that is educative in its entire 
effect. 
The university-extension movement has attained considerable pro- 
portions since first introduced into this country in 1890. In some cases 
the extension work has been dropped after a trial, these instances 
occurring mainly in sparsely settled regions, where the expenses of a 
circuit of lectures are too great. In general, however, the plan has 
been found to be a useful and practicable means of supplementing the 
common-school instruction of large numbers of persons who for one

reason or another have been debarred from the privileges of attending 
a college or university. Chapter VI of Part IIL (pp. 951-971) gives a 
detailed account of the status of university extension in the United 
States, the courses offered by various institutions, and reports of the 
work accomplished. 
In Chapter VIII, Part II, education of the colored race is discussed 
at some length with particular reference to the industrial training of 
the negro. In the 160 schools there are 18,595 pupils_in elementary 
grades, 13,375 in secondary, and 1,161 in higher or collegiate grades, 
making a total of 33,131 in these schools. Of the total number, 33,131, 
there were 8,050 students in industrial departments, 5,940 studying to 
be teachers, and 1,067 studying a learned profession. Chapter VIII 
reviews the financial history of several colored schools, showing how 
they were established and how still supported. The courses of study 
are somewhat critically examined and the courses in industrial training 
in several of the leading schools are discussed in detail. 
A digest of the public school laws of the several States is given in 
Chapter IX of Part II (pp. 1063-1300). To facilitate examination and 
comparison of the legislative provisions and requirements of the differ- 
ent States upon any given point, a uniform mode of treatment has 
been employed. 
In Chapter X of Part II (pp. 1301-1349) is given a compendium of 
sanitary legislation affecting schools in the United States, compiled by 
Miss Hannah B. Clark, of the University of Chicago. An attempt has 
been made to include in it all the laws affecting the health and safety 
of school children which appear upon the statute books of the different 
States, as well as city ordinances and regulations of school boards and 
boards of health. It would appear from Miss Clark’s investigations 
that about one-third of the States require vaccination of school chil- 
dren; one-third take some slight precaution against fire; one-fourth 
have enactments designed to prevent the spread of contagious diseases ; 
eight States require suitable sanitary arrangements; two prescribe 
proper ventilatien, and one (Kentucky) the minimum amount of space 
to be allotted to each pupil. Kentucky is also the only State that 
requires school seats to be “suited to the age of the child.” 
Various questions relating to the status of education in several of 
the States are treated of in Chapter XI of Part II (pp. 1351-1449). 
Chapter XII (pp. 1451-1492) is taken up with the “Report on education 
in Alaska,” by Rey. Sheldon Jackson. 
Chapter XIII, Part II, presents “A preliminary list of American 
learned and educational societies.” The compilation of this list was 
originally begun by Mr. Appleton Morgan, president of the New York 
Shakespeare Society, assisted by Mrs. L. L. Lawrence, of Plainfield, 
N. J., to both of whom my thanks are due. The work was continued 
and completed by Dr. Stephen B. Weeks, of this Bureau. An effort 
has been made to give the leading facts connected with the life history
-P-A-G-E-45
  CRIMINOLOGICAL CONGRESSES. XLV 
of each society, its objects, the time and place of organization, the 
names of its founders, its present officers, and some notice of the extent 
and form of its publications. Such a list as that undertaken here has no 
direct predecessor in the United States, and has been particularly dif- 
ficult for that reason; but it is believed that the list as printed will be 
of service, and.will be useful in making future lists more complete. 
In Chapter XIV of Part II, Dr. A. McDonald, specialist in education 
and crime, contributes a chapter on his criminological studies. He 
endeavors to prove that there can be no rational treatment of crime 
until causes are investigated. He estimates nine-tenths of crime to be 
due to bad social conditions. But he contends that crime is not a dis- 
ease, in the medical sense, for statistics recently gathered by this 
Bureau show 82 per cent of criminals in good health. But the crim- 
inal should be imprisoned, first of all, because he is dangerous to the 
community. 
Criminology is not yet a science, except by courtesy. It is an initi- 
atory step in the direct study of human beings themselves and their 
relations to their surroundings. The students engaged in this field of 
research hold that the brain and the mind of the criminal naturally 
act and react upon each other, but can not decide which is primary in 
the present state of our knowledge. 
There is little chance of lessening crime until children have the 
educative influence of a proper home or home-like institution. 
In Chapter XV of Part Il, Dr. McDonald makes report on the recent 
international congress held at Budapest for psychological, criminologi- 
eal, and demographical questions. 
The best measures of combating or ameliorating criminal degener- 
acy are those of education (von Liszt). Whether responsible or not, 
the criminal must be placed where it is impossible for him to do injury, 
if he is dangerous to life or property (von Liszt). 
At the Demographical Congress the Bertillon system of measure- 
ment was recommended not only for criminals but for all persons, so 
that every citizen could easily establish his identity beyond doubt. 
The congress favored legislation that would gradually enact an eight- 
hour work day for all trades, and that would prohibit night work 
except where general public considerations require it. In regard to 
hygiene the congress resolved that: At all universities professorships 
should be constituted for the advancement of scientific researches in 
hygiene. In all elementary and special schools instruction in hygiene 
should be combined with and form the egmplement to gymnastics, 
games, and other exercises of the season. The teaching might be car- 
ried on in conjunction with the instruction in natural-science branches. 
There was a general agreement among those experts of different 
nations who examined young men for entering the military service 
that for the last few years there has been a gradual degeneration, phys- 
ical and moral.

  XLVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
The extent to which industrial training in its various phases has 
been engrafted upon the work of education in America is brought out 
by the tables upon pages 2093 and 2114. These show that industrial 
training is of such prominence as to be almost the principal purpose of 
many of the schools for colored youth in the South and for Indians in 
the West; that it is an essential part of the training of reform schools, 
and in a less degree of that of schools for the so-called defective classes; 
and that the number of charitable concerns in which industrial training 
is the central idea is constantly growing. In institutions of these classes 
the instruction is avowedly intended to be of direct use to the pupil in 
earning his livelihood, and as such it amounts to trade-teaching pure 
and simple. But in other classes of schools represented in the tables 
the “trade idea” is scouted, and the statement is made that the princi- 
pal, if not the sole, purpose of the manual training given is its educa- 
tional value. In this category are to be included the distinctively 
“manual training schools” and most of the normal schools and city 
public schools. Other schools combine the two ideas and attempt to so 
adjust their instruction as to give it a direct practical use, claiming for 
it at the same time an important pedagogical value. In this category 
may be included most of the mechanical training given in the colleges 
and schools of technology, as well as in many schools of lower grade. 
Notwithstanding these differences in purpose and the resulting varia- 
tion of method, there is a strong similarity between them, and all must 
be included in any presentation of industrial training in America. 
The showing is on the whole a creditable one. In the tables there 
are represented as giving industrial training the public schools of 94 
cities, 19 normal schools, 49 institutions of collegiate grade, 65 schools 
for colored youth, 28 schools for Indians, 27 schools for the blind, 57 
schools for the deaf, 20 schools for the feeble-minded, 55 reform schools, 
17 manual training schools, 6 trade schools, and 19 charity schools. 
Numerous bibliographies of educational literature have been com- 
piled and printed. Some of these bibliographies are general in their 
character, covering the whole field of education, while others are re- 
stricted in their scope to some particular subject, such as ‘child study” 
or the “study of geography.” They are to be found principally seat- 
tered through official reports, text-books, pamphlets, periodicals, ete. 
In Chapter XVI of Part II (pp. 1701-1722) an attempt has been made 
to compile a classified list of such recent educational bibliographies 
as were more readily accessible to the compiler or of the existence of 
which he obtained knowledge through any source. Details of size and 
classification or contents of the bibliographies, publisher, and price of 
the work they are contained in, are given when obtainable, as well as 
such other information, in the form of notes, as would enable a reader 
to determine whether any bibliography were such a one as he wanted, 
and put him in the way of getting it if he desired it.

PAR a. 
CHAPTER I. 
WHOLE NUMBER OF PUPILS AND STUDENTS. 
The following table has been prepared to show, as near as can be 
ascertained, the total number of persons in the schools and colleges of 
the United States, public and private. The classification has been 
made according to the grade of the instruction received, irrespective 
cf the character of the institutions which the pupils attend, the object 
being to ascertain the number of pupils of each grade. Thus all pupils 
in the “preparatory” departments of colleges have been classed as 
secondary, while all elementary pupils attending secondary schools 
have been given their proper classification. 
It would appear that there were 15,530,268 persons in the United 
States who attended a school! or educational institution of some sort 
at some period during the school year 1893-94. Two persons out of 
every nine (22.88 per cent of the population) were at school. 
As compared with the preceding year, there was an increase of 
446,638, or 2.97 per cent. 
It is to be understood that these figures are only approximate. The 
statistics of private elementary education are very imperfect, and their 
degree of accuracy varies from year to year. The large increase over 
the preceding year in the number of secondary and higher students is 
in part a result of their number having been more fully ascertained the 
present year. There have also been some changes of classification, by 
which the number of private normal students in particular appears to 
have been largely increased. On the whole, this table is not strictly 
comparable with corresponding tables published in previous reports of 
this office for ascertaining the increase in the number of pupils; it is 
believed, however, to be more accurate than any heretofore published, 
except as regarding private elementary pupils (column 3). 
1 Excluding, in general, evening schools; music, elocution, art, industrial training, 
trades, and private business schools; schools for the defective, dependent, and delin- 
quent classes, and Indian schools. These collectively enroll some 300,000 pupils.

CHAPTER II. 
CONSOLIDATED STATISTICS OF STATE AND CITY COMMON 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
Nore.—The common schools as here understood include public day schools of elementary and 
secondary grades; i. e., public primary, grammar, and high schools. Classification by race is given 
elsewhere in this report. 
I.—STaTE ScHOoL SYSTEMS. 
The following tables contain the common school statistics of the 
various States and Territories for 1893-94, with the exception of some 
half dozen States, for which the figures of 1892-93 are given. The 
totals for the United States are therefore subject to correction. 
Tables 1 and 2 contain various details regarding different classes of 
the population and their relations to each other, which it is important 
to have in mind in considering the educational status of the several 
States. The total population, the number of persons from 5 to 18 years 
of age, and the adult male population have been carefully estimated 
for the epoch 1894, using wherever possible as a basis the increase 
of the State school population as determined by the annual school 
censuses.

  10 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
ENROLLMENT, 
The common school enrollment for 1893-94, as given in Tables 3 and. 
4 following, is less than that found by adding together columns 2 and 4 
of the table of Chapter I (p. 4), in that it does not embrace secondary 
pupils in public universities and colleges. 
The whole number of pupils enrolled in the common schools is found 
to be 13,935,977, or nearly twice the number in 1870-71. The increase 
over the number reported the preceding year, 425,258, is unusually large, 
and would seem to indicate that periods of “ hard times” have a fayor- 
able effect upon school attendance, numbers of children, perhaps from 
lack of remunerative labor, being diverted from the factory or workshop 
to the school. 
The percentage of the school population (5 to 18 years of age) enrolled 
in the schools is 69.39, as against 69.10 in 1892-93.

  24 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
II.—Ciry ScHoou SystTrems. 
[See Part III of this report for the school statistics of individual cities.] 
The most conspicuous of the facts brought out by the following tables 
is the relatively reduced expenditure for city schools during the year 
covered by this report. 
In view of the stringency of the times, this was to be expected. 
Retrenchment has been the rule in all lines, and the schools have been 
no exception. Itis rather a matter of congratulation that they have 
fared so well, for in the cities of only a few States has there been an 
actual decrease, and in the country at large the increase in expenditure 
in cities has been 5.92 per cent upon the same basis which shows an 
increase in enrollment of 8.68 per cent and in average attendance of 
10.37 per cent. The total cost of the city schools per capita of average 
attendance has been $30.64 in 1893-94, or a reduction of $1.28 from 
that of 1892-93. 
It is worthy of note that instances have been rare in the cities of 
actual decrease in the salaries paid to individual teachers. Necessary 
retrenchment has been as a rule secured by postponing the erection of 
new buildings, by increasing the number of pupils allotted to each 
teacher, and by curtailing the expense for all incidentals that could be 
spared without serious detriment to the schools. Thus it happens that 
the average amount paid to supervisors and teachers was substantially 
the same in 1893-94 as in 1892-93, being about $614 in both years, and 
that the expense for teaching and supervision has increased in a much 
greater ratio than the total expenditure. 
The States in which there has been an actual falling off in the total 
amount spent for schools in the cities are Tennessee, Mississippi, 
Arkansas, Wisconsin, Missouri, South Dakota, Nebraska, Colorado, 
Utah, Washington, and California. In only three of these, namely, 
Tennessee, Arkansas, and Missouri, has there been a similar reduction 
in the amounts paid for tuition. 
In the consideration of the statistics of cities the fact should not be 
overlooked that the list of places which are represented in such tables 
is constantly increasing as communities reach the minimum limit of 
population prescribed for classification as “cities.” The limit of 8,000 
inhabitants followed by this office is an arbitrary one and differs from 
that recognized by the laws of some of the States. But its adoption 
was based upon reasonable assumptions, and since uniformity of prac- 
tice is, after all, the most essential consideration, and other statistical 
bureaus have adopted the same rule, its use by this office has been 
entirely satisfactory. 
It is impossible to determine accurately every year just what com- 
munities have reached the required numbers, and it necessarily follows 
that the annual revision of the list is attended with perplexities and 
doubts. The collection of school statistics of cities’and villages of  
-P-A-G-E-73
  
    CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 25 
between 4,000 and 8,000 inhabitants was begun for this report, and a 
means is thereby obtained of determining with a fair degree of cer- 
tainty just what additions should be made to the list of cities. Eighty- 
one new communities appeared from their school statistics to be worthy 
of rank among the cities of 8,000 inhabitants, and their statistics were 
accordingly incorporated in the city table. This number (81) was much 
greater than the number of new cities in the report of 1892-93, and 
‘in this fact must be found the explanation of the increase in enrollment 
of 8.68 per cent for the last year as against 4.86 per cent for 1892-93. 
These two quantities’are not comparable with each other, but are to be 
used only in comparison with other ratios for the same years. 
One of the effects of the infusion of a greater proportion of small 
cities into the list is to be seen in the heavy increase in the number of 
schoolhouses and the smaller average size of each. Small houses are 
necessities for scattered settlements, in order that the schools may be 
sufficiently accessible to the pupils. As the territory fills up the small 
buildings are gradually replaced by larger ones, the small houses being 
demolished or sold; thus it happens that cities of 8,000 inhabitants 
have usually as many schoolhouses as cities three or four times their 
size. 
To the introduction of 81 new small cities, therefore, must be ascribed 
a great part of the increase of 786 in the number of buildings. Six of 
the new places added to the list in Massachusetts alone have 108 school- 
houses. Nevertheless there are several instances in which larger cities 
have made extensive additions to the number of their buildings. Buf- 
falo, N. Y., reports 21 more than last year and Brooklyn 30 more. 
The increase of 7.58 per cent in the value of school property appears 
anomalous in view of the reduced expenditures for such purposes and 
of the general stagnation in business which has checked the normally 
steady increase in the value of city real estate. The only explanation 
is to be found in the supposition that the increase mentioned is the result 
of the unusually heavy expenditures for buildings during 1892-93, 
The following notable differences appear in the valuation of school 
property as reported in the years 1892-93 and 1893-94: New York, in- 
crease, $1,485,221; Chicago, increase, $2,143,000; Cincinnati, inerease, 
$2,000,000. 
The increase of 480, or 16.58 per cent, in the number of supervising 
officers during the year is remarkable. The following table shows that 
the greater part of the increase comes from a few cities:

It is gratifying to note that the average length of the school term for 
all the cities shows an increase of 1.3 days over last year. For the 
previous three years there had been a steady diminution in this respect, 
and this evidence that the apparent tendency toward an unnecessavily 
short school year has been checked must be regarded as encouraging.

CHAPTER III. 
STATISTICAL REVIEW OF SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
More than half the space devoted to detail tables in Part IV of this 
report is surrendered to secondary schools. Of the 8,364 educational 
institutions mentioned by name in the two volumes, 5,946 are schools 
lof secondary grade, viz, 3,964 public high schools and 1,982 private high 
schools and academies. In these 5,946 high schools there were 407,919 
students pursuing secondary studies in 1894. In the same schools 
there were 677,933 pupils in elementary grades. In Part IV will be 
found the two tables giving the statistics of each school in detail. The 
following table is a review of the statistics of public and private high 
schools for the past five years, summarized for each year:

The sudden increase from 4,246 secondary schools and 329,098 stu- 
dents in 1893 to 5,946 schools and 407,919 students in 1894 should be 
explained. It was known that several hundred high schools, both 
public and private, had never reported to this office. Many of these 
were comparatively new schools. Some had grown up out of elementary 
schools and the development of village into city systems, but most of 
them were independent high schools established within the last five 
years. 
For several months during the spring and summer of 1894 the statis- 
tician of the Bureau was busy collecting lists of public and private 
ED 94: 3 33  
-P-A-G-E-82
  34 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
secondary schools from all the States. Circular letters were addresse: 
to all county and city superintendents of public instruction and t 
the officials of schools already on the lists in this office, asking for infor- 
mation concerning new schools. The result was that more than 10,000 
schools, public and private, were reported to this office as high schools, 
jreluding those already known to the Bureau. Blank forms for statis+ 
tical information were sent to these schools. More than 2,000 of thos 
addressed were never heard from, and it was concluded that most o 
these were elementary schools. Nearly 2,000 of the schools reporting 
were found to be below the secondary grade. Many of these were higt 
schools in name, but had no students pursuing high school studies, 
Some had students in only one study which could be classed as second- 
ary and many others were elementary schools, reporting two or three 
or more students in high school studies, but giving no evidence that 
they were organized as secondary schools or making efforts to reach 
high school standard. 
After throwing out the reports of all schools which should be classed 
as elementary the result of the investigation was the addition of 1,700 
to the list of secondary schools over the number reporting the previ- 
ous year. This was an increase of 1,152 in the number of public high 
schools and 548 added to the number of private high schools. The 
increase in the number of secondary students was 78,821. Of this in- 
erease 56,323 were in the public high schools and 22,498 in the private 
schools and academies. 
In 1893-94— that is, for the school year beginning in the fall of 1893 
and ending in June, 1894—the average number of secondary students 
to each high school was 69; in 1892-93 the average number was 77; in 
1891-92 the number was 74; in 1890-91 it was 69; and in 1889-90 the 
saverage number to a school was 71. The fluctuation in these aver- 
ages is largely due to the manner in which many principals made their 
reports, in many instances elementary pupils being classed as second- 
ary students. The large difference between the average numbers for 
1892-93 and 1893-94 can be easily explained. There was possibly a 
slight falling off in the attendance in some sections of the country. 
Many of the new schools had fewer students than the average of the 
old schools, but the apparent falling off is chiefly due to a more rigid 
classification of students. 
It was supposed that the addition of so many new schools to the 
lists would lower the average standing, but such has not been the 
result. The decrease in the average number of secondary students 
aceredited to a school has doubtless contributed to raise the standing 
of the average school. It is easily shown that the 5,946 schools report- 
ing in 1894 rank higher than the 4,246 reporting in 1893, when the 
percentages of graduates and the percentages pursuing high school 
studies are compared. The following tables, comparing percentage 
figures for the two years in public and private schools and for the two

lasses of schools combined, will show that there was decided improve- 
ent in the schools of 1894 over the schools of 1893:

The above figures show the percentages for 1893 and for 1894 of 
students in each of the ten leading high school studies. The per cent 
studying Latin inereased from 43.06 to 44.78 in the public high schools 
and from 39.23 to 40.77 in the private schools, which was an inerease 
rom 41.94 to 43.59 for publie and private high schools combined. The 
r cent studying algebra increased from 52.88 to 56.14 in the public 
chools and from 42.75 to 44.37 in the private schools, the increase for 
ublic and private schools combined being from 49.92 in 1893 to 52.71 
n1894. There was a barely perceptible decrease in the per cent study- 
ng Greek in the public high schools, more than counterbalanced by an 
nerease in the private schools. There was the falling off of less than 
me-quarter of 1 per cent in the percentage of students in German. In 
all the other studies the percentages for 1894 stand considerably higher 
han the corresponding figures for 1893. The per cent of graduates 
was also greater in 1894 than the previous year. In the public schools 
he per cent of graduates increased from 12.62 in 1893 to 12.90 in 1894, © 
and in the private schools the increase was from 8.65 to 9.40. 
It may be interesting to note that the number of pupils in elementary 
studies in the public and private high schools is considerably greater 
than the aggregate number of secondary students in the same schools. 
In 1893-94 the number of elementary pupils in the 5,946 high schools 
was 677,933, or 114 to each school. In 1892-93 there were 501,035 ele- 
mentary pupils in the 4,246 schools, or 118 to each school. 
The line between the real and the so-called high school is each year 
becoming more distinct and the classification of students into elemen- 
tary and secondary is more rigid. The methods of collecting informa- 
tion have been improved, and with the continued growth of high schools 
the statistics of secondary education show better results. Each year 
for twenty-three years the report from this Bureau has contained a 
chapter devoted to secondary schools. A brief survey of the results of 
this work may prove of interest.

In 1871 the United States Commissioner of Education began to col- 
lect statistics of secondary schools. In the report for that year appears 
a list of 638 private high schools and academies. In these schools 
80,227 students were receiving instruction. This number, doubtless, 
included all the pupils in the schools, those in the elementary branches 
as well as those pursuing secondary studies. The next annual report 
shows a list of 811 schools, with 98,929 students, for 1872. The 1873 
report had a list of 944 schools, with 118,570 students. It is probable 
that in 1874 an attempt was made to exclude from the enumeration at 
least a portion of the elementary pupils, for while the number of schools 
reported for that year had increased to 1,031 the number of students 
was less by 20,000 than the previous year and some hundreds less than 
two years before. The number of students reported in the 1,031 schools 
for 1874 was 98,179. For 1875 the number of schools was 1,143 and the 
number of students 108,235, 
The Bureau began collecting the statistics of city high schools in 
1876. That year the report of the Commissioner of Education showed 
that there were 22,982 secondary students in the public schools of the 
192 cities reporting. From 1876 to 1889 the annual reports contained 
statistics of public high schools in connection with city systems. 
During the same period the reports from private secondary schools 
were published annually. In 1884-85 the number of these schools 
reporting had reached 1,617, with 160,137 students. Two years later 
the number of schools had dropped to 936 and the number of students 
to 101,112. A similar falling off is noticeable also between 1892 and 
1893. The violent fluctuations in the printed statistics of different 
years should not be attributed to rapid increase or decrease in..the 
number of schools, but in part to peculiar conditions affecting the col- 
lection of statistics, and in part to changes in the form of inquiry. 
These changes grew out of efforts to arrive at a somewhat precise dis- 
tinction between elementary and secondary school work. Such efforts 
had become necessary both by reason of the great increase in the num- 
ber of high schools and classes, due to the development of the public 
school systems of the Southern and Northwestern States, and also in the 
number of so-called secondary courses of study. From the nature of 
the case the best means of arriving at the facts desired under the new 
conditions could not be immediately determined. The statistics and 
discussions of secondary education for several years indicate the com- 
plications of this problem and the progress made toward its satisfactory 
solution. Considering secondary students without reference to the class 
of institution in which they are found, the increase in the number of 
such students has been quite regular on the whole. So far-as actual 
secondary work is concerned, the statistics for the successive years up 
to 1890 are quite as valuable as the reports of the past five years, and 
afford proper bases of comparison with the statistics of later years.

Prior to 1889-90 few public high schools outside of the city systems 
had been reached. Meanwhile, in the endeavor to sift out pseudo 
secondary schools, some private schools had been lost that belonged 
properly in the secondary class. But the view of the whole field had 
become clearer, and in 1890 a systematic effort was made to collect 
statistics from the public high schools and classes not reached by the 
city inquiry, and also from private schools not previously reached or 
temporarily lost from the list. The result of the effort was the increase 
in the list from 713 in 1889 to 2,526 in 1890, and the increase of over 
75,000 students reported in the public secondary schools. Of course 
there had been no such actual increase in one year, nor in several 
years. The Bureau had only reached out and gathered statistics from 
a source hitherto overlooked, namely, the independent public high 
schools. 
Since 1890 a uniform system of collecting information has been fol- 
lowed, greatly augmenting the value of the statistics of secondary edu- 
cation compiled for the last five years. Similar schedules of inquiry 
are sent to public and private high schools, and the form of tabulating 
the statistics is the same for each. This facilitates comparison. 
In this chapter will be found the statistical summaries for secondary 
schools for the scholastic year ended June, 1894. The tables give the 
numbers of public and private high schools, the numbers of teachers, 
of students, of graduates, and of students pursuing certain studies in 
each State and Territory. There are also tables of percentages and 
comparisons between public and private high schools. Six diagrams

are inserted, showing the distribution of secondary students according 
to the geographical divisions of the country. Diagram 1 serves the 
double purpose of showing the distribution of students and indicat- 
ing the comparative prominence of public and private high schools in 
each division, as well as in the United States as a whole. . Diagram 2 
shows the ratio of male and female students in the secondary schools. 
The four remaining diagrams indicate the relative number of students 
} pursuing four leading secondary studies. The six diagrams are easily 
understood when studied in connection with the tables. 
Pusiic HieH ScHoous. 
Reports were received from 3,946 public high schools for the year 
ended June, 1894. It will be seen by reference to the second column 
of Table 1 that 1,063 of these schools were in the North Atlantic Divi- 
sion, 294 in the South Atlantic, 389 in the South Central, 2,043 in the 
North Central, and 175 in the Western Division. The State reporting 
the largest number of public high schools was Ohio. That State had 
402, a greater number than could be found in either the South Atlantic, 
South Central, or Western Division. New York came next, with 297, 
and Illinois next, with 272. 
The number of teachers instructing the 289,274 secondary students 
in the 3,964 public high schools was 12,120. More than half of these 
teachers, or 6,382, were women. In the North Atlantic Division there 
were 3,899 instructors of secondary students—1,589 men and 2,310 
women. In all the other divisions the proportions of male and female 
teachers are more nearly equal, the male teachers predominating in 
the South Atlantic and Western divisions. The female teachers in the 
North Atlantic Division are 59.25 per cent of the teaching force in the 
public high schools of that section, and this preponderance increases 
the per cent of female teachers for the United States to 52.66. 
A comparison of the first and fourth columns of Table 1 will show 
that the average number of teachers to each school was 3.1 for the 
whole country, 3.7 for the North Atlantic Division, 2.8 for the South 
Atlantic, 2.5 for the South Central, 2.9 for the North Central, and 3.3 
for the Western Division. In Table 19 is shown the average number 
of teachers to each school in each State and Territory. There are 
marked differences between the averages of different States. Ohio, 
with 402 schools, has 1,040 teachers, or 2.6 to each school, while New 
York, with only 297 schools, has 1,161 teachers, or 3.9 to each school. 
Table 19 also shows the average number of secondary students to each 
- school in each State and the average number to each teacher, as well as 
the proportion of male and female teachers. Another column of the 
same table gives the average numbor of elementary pupils to each 
school. 
The distribution of secondary students is shown in columns 5, 6, and 
7 of Table 1. Of the 289,274 secondary students in the public high

schools of the United States, 117,202, or 40.45 per cent, were males, 
and 172,072, or 59.55 per cent, were females. This proportion practi- 
eally holds good in each of the five divisions, though individual States 
vary considerably from these percentages. The largest percentage of 
male students for any State is 47.39, in Mississippi, if we omit Wyoming 
and New Mexico, where the number of schools is very small. The 
largest percentage of female students was 65.68, in Louisiana. The 
second and third columns of Table 6 show these proportions for each 
State. 
The number of colored students included with the 289,274 secondary 
students was 4,197. Of these 774 were in the North Atlantic Division, 
988 in the South Atlantic, 841 in the South Central, 1,554 in the North 
Central, and 40 in the Western Division. Columns 8, 9, and 10 show 
the distribution of these colored students among the States. 
The number of elementary pupils in the 3,964 public high schools of 
the United States is much larger than the number of secondary stu- 
dents in the same schools. There were 583,329 of these elementary 
pupils—282,702 males and 300,627 femaies. Thus, while the number of 
secondary students to each school was 73, the number of pupils below 
the secondary or high schoo! grades was 147 to each school. The aver- 
age number of elementary pupils to each public high school in the 
North Atlantic Division was 122, in the South Atlantic 111, in the 
South Central 181, in the North Central 156, and in the Western 
Division 182. Compare these averages with the average number of 
secondary students in each school as shown in Table 19. Compare 
columns 2 and 4 by divisions and by States. 
The principal of each public high school was asked to report the 
number of students preparing for the college classical course and the 
number preparing for a scientific course in college or technical school. 
‘When summarized, these reports show that 22,774 students were pre- 
paring for the college classical course and 18,606 were preparing for a 
college scientific course. These figures are not considered important, 
from the fact that the questions were differently understood by differ- 
ent principals. Many gave the number of students pursuing courses 
in the directions indicated; others reported only students who had 
declared their purpose of studying for college; others failed to answer 
the questions for the reason that they did not know the number of 
students preparing for college. The summaries by States of the two 
classes of college preparatory students are given in the first six col- — 
umns of Table 2, and the corresponding percentages will be found in 
Table 6. 
The 3,964 public high schools sent out 37,328 graduates in the spring 
or summer of 1894, or an average of 9.4 to each school. The number 
was 12.9 per cent of the number of secondary students. The distri- 
bution of these graduates by States can be seen from columns 7, 8, 
and 9 of Table 2. The average number of graduates to each school in

the North Atlantic Division was 12.4, in the South Atlantic 6.5, in the 
South Central 4.5, in the North Central 9.1, and in the Western Divi- 
sion 10,8. Compare these averages with the average number of stu- 
dents in each school as shown in Table 19. 
Of the 37,328 graduates 13,233 were males and 24,095, or 64.55 per 
cent, were females. The per cent of female graduates, 64.55, is consid- 
erably greater than the per cent of female students, 59.55. Not only 
does ‘the number of female students exceed the number of male stu- 
dents in every State in the Union, but the number of female graduates 
is very much larger in each State. Fewer boys enter the public high 
schools and fewer still complete the course of study. 
The last column of Table 2 gives the number of students in the 
graduating classes of 1894 who had been preparing for college. The 
number was 9,966, or 26.70 per cent of the number graduating. There 
were 4,797 male college preparatory students among the graduates, 
and 5,169, or 51.88 per cent, females. It will thus be seen that a larger 
number of boys than girls, in proportion to the number graduating, are 
college preparatory students. Of the number of male graduates, 36.25 
per cent were preparing for college, while only 21.45 per cent of the 
girls intended to go beyond the public high school course. The pre- 
ponderance of male college preparatory students in the graduating 
class is very great in all the States of the North Atlantic Division and 
is noticeable in many of the Southern and Western States. A study 
of the last six columns of Table 2, in connection with the correspond- - 
ing percentage columns of Table 6 will prove interesting. 
STUDENTS AND STUDIES. 
High school principals were requested to report the number of stu- 
dents pursuing each of the ten leading secondary studies, Latin, Greek, 
French, German, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, physics, chemistry, 
and general history. The reports from the 3,964 public high schools are 
summarized in Tables 3, 4, and 5. These three tables, giving the num- 
ber of students in each study in each State and Territory, should be 
examined in connection with Table 6, which gives the corresponding 
percentages. These tables are also illustrated by diagrams 3, 4, 5,and 6. 
Latin.—The number of students pursuing Latin was 129,524, or 44.78 
per cent of the whole number. The per cent of male students studying 
Latin was 44.40, and the per cent of female students 44.45 per cent. 
The South Atlantic Division shows the highest percentage of Latin 
students, 63.68; the South Central comes next, with 51.74; the Western 
next, with 44.25; the North Atlantic next, with 43.53, and the North 
Central last, with 42.25 per cent. The State reporting the highest per 
ceut of students in Latin was North Carolina, with 84.80. Next in 
order come North Dakota, Delaware, Alabama, Maryland, and Georgia, 
all showing percentages above 65.

Greek.—Only 9,633 high school students studied Greek. This was 
only 3.33 per cent of the wholenumber. The per centof male students 
pursuing Greek was 4.95, and the per cent of female students 2.23. In 
the North Atlantic Division 6.70 per cent of the students pursued this 
study, 3.81 per cent in the South Atlantic, 2.85 in the Western, 1.70 in 
the South Central, and 1.32 per cent in the North Central. In eleven 
of the Western States not a single student was reported as pursuing 
Greek. Maine shows the largest per cent of students in this language, 
13.47, Rhode Island following with 11.64 per cent. In no other State 
does the rate reach 10 per cent. The only State outside of New Eng- 
land reaching even 6 per cent is Georgia, with a percentage of 7.25. 
French.—The number of students in French was 19,702, or 6.81 per 
cent of the whole. Of this number 6,683 were males and 13,019 females. 
The per cent of male students pursuing French was 5.74 and the per 
cent of female students studying the language was 7.56. As in the 
ease of Greek, the North Atlantic Division leads, with the largest per- 
centage, 14.40. The South Atlantic follows, with 8.56 per cent; the 
Western with 4.34; the South Central with 4.09, and the North Central 
Division is last, with 2.19 per cent of students in French. The single 
State showing the largest per cent of students in this language is Lou- 
isiana, with 67.27 per cent. Massachusetts is next, with 34.04 per 
cent, followed by Rhode Island with 24.36, and New Hampshire with 
22.01. Eleven States and Territories had no students in French. 
German.—The German language was studied by 34,056 students in 
the public high schools, or 11.77 per cent of the whole number. Of 
these, 12,665 were males and 21,391 were females. The per cent of 
males studying the language was 10.80 and the per cent of females 
12.43. In the North Atlantic Division 13.01 per cent of the students 
studied German, in the South Atlantic 12.55, in the Western 12.17, in 
the North Central 12, and in the South Central only 3.82 per cent. 
The largest percentage, 33.55, was in Maryland. New Jersey came 
next, with 30.53, the District of Columbia next, with 30.14, and Colorado 
next, with 27.59. Oregon had 20.92 per cent of her students in German, 
and Wisconsin had 20,02, All the other States fell below the last 
figure, and seven States did not report a single student studying the 
language. 
Algebra.—The high school study claiming the highest number of stu- 
dents was algebra. Of the total, 289,274, there were 162,386, or 56.14 per 
cent of the whole. The number of males pursuing this branch was 
67,553, or 57.64 per cent of the total number of male students. The 
number of female students in algebra was 94,833, or 55.11 per cent. 
The Southern schools seem to be strong in mathematical studies. In 
the South Central Division 70.02 per cent of the students were pursuing 
the study of algebra, and in the South Atlantic the per cent was 64.96. 
In the Western Division the per cent was 63.24, in the North Central 
55.39, and in the North Atlantic only 51.37. It may be claimed that

in many of the New England schools algebra is begun in the grammar 
school and is dropped a year sooner in the high school than is the case 
in most Southern schools. 
Geometry.—In the whole country 78,680 public high school students 
received instruction in geometry. This was 27.20 per cent of thewhole 
number. Of these, 31,368 were males and 47,312 females. The per cent of 
males studying this branch of mathematics was 26.76 and the per cent 
of females 27.49. The Western Division shows the largest percentage, 
34.69. The South Atlantic shows 33.59 per cent, the South Central 
33.19, the North Atlantic 26.37, and the North Central Division 25.27 
per cent. In Maryland 71.94 per cent of the students studied geometry 
and in Louisiana 41.71. California shows a per cent of 40.87 and Texas 
40.40. As in the case of the study of algebra, most of the States of the 
two Northern divisions show smaller percentages of students in geom- 
etry than do the Southern and Western States. 
Trigonometry.—Comparatively few public high schools include trig- 
onometry in the course of study. Only 8,464 students studied this 
branch, or 2.93 per cent of the whole. Of these, 4,036 were males and 
4,428 females. The per cent of males studying trigonometry was 3.44and 
the per cent of females 2.57, Again it is noted that the two Southern 
divisions take the lead in a mathematical study. In the South Central 
the per cent is 7.48, in the South Atlantic 6.48, in the Western 2.53, 
in the North Central 2.33, and in the North Atlantic Division 2.20. In 
Kentucky the per cent of students studying trigonometry is 14.99, in 
Maryland it is 10.40, in Georgia 10.39, and in Alabama 10.24. Itmay be 
said that most students who take trigonometry in the high school have 
in-view a short course in surveying or civil engineering. Very few of 
them are college preparatory students. 
Physics.—Of the 73,162 students studying physics 30,433 were males 
and 42,729 were females. It is seen that 25.96 per cent of the males 
and 24.81 per cent of the females in the schools pursued this branch 
of study. The per cent. of the total number was 25.29, the largest 
relative number being in the Southern States. In the South Central 
Division 34.20 per cent of the students pursued the study of physics, 
in the South Atlantic 30.75 per cent, in the Western 28.82, in the North 
Central 23.93, and in the North Atlantic Division 23.76 per cent. 
Nevada, with only eight schools reported, had 66 per cent of the stu- 
dents in physies, Maryland had 58.94, Mississippi 39.83, and Texas 
38.79. This again indicates the practical trend of the courses of study 
in most of the schools of the South and West. 
Chemistry.—The total number studying chemistry was 29,819, or 10.31 
per cent of the whole. Of the males 10.02 per cent, or 11,744, and of 
the females 10.50 per cent, or 18,075, were studying chemistry. The 
Western Division now takes the lead with 16.17 per cent of the higu 
school students of that section studying chemistry. The South Central 
Division had 11.57 per cent, the North Atlantic 11.54, the North Cen-

tral 9.05, and the South Atlantic 7.39 per cent. Nevada shows 32 per 
cent, Louisiana 20.11, California 18.41, and Colorado 18.40. 
General history.—The importance of historicai study is admitted in 
all the States, as shown by the large percentage of students in all parts 
of the country pursuing this branch. In the public high schools 105,521, 
or 36.48 per cent, were reported as studying history other than that of 
the United States. The per cent of males in this study, compared with 
the total number of male students, was 36.08, and the per cent of 
females 36.74. In the Western Division the per cent of the whole num- 
ber is 57.55, in the South Atlantic 51.68, in the South Central 41.50, 
in the North Atlantic 35.48, and the North Central Division 32.28. In 
Louisiana the per cent of students studying general history was 81.71, 
in Nevada 70, and in Colorado 69.11. 
Diagrams 3, 4, 5, and 6 illustrate the proportions of students in four 
representative studies in the five geographical divisions and in the 
United States asa whole. Latin, algebra, physics, and general history, 
representing studies in language, mathematics, natural science, and his- 
tory, are taken for illustration. é 
EQUIPMENT AND INCOME, 
lt is an easy matter for a school officer to report the number of teach- 
ers, students, graduates, and the number pursuing certain studies; but 
it is more difficult to answer questions relating to the income and equip- 
ment of the institution. Very few can give more than an estimate of 
the value of school buildings and grounds, and not all are willing to 
state the exact amounts of money received from tuition and other 
sources. For these reasons the figures shown in Table 8 should be 
taken as summaries of estimates. 
The aggregate value of buildings and grounds of the public high 
schools reporting this item is $64,638,091. This would give an average 
value for each institution reporting of $21,596. The value of the build- 
ings and grounds belonging to public high schools in the North Atlantie 
Division amounts to $21,604,054, or $28,130 for each of the 768 schools 
reporting; in the South Atlantic the aggregate value is $1,624,165, or 
$7,519 for each of the 216 schools reporting; in the South Central the 
aggregate is $3,802,910, or $11,665 for each school reporting; in the 
North Central the aggregate is $32,912,042, or $21,180 for each school 
reporting; in the Western Division the aggregate value for all report- 
ing on this item is $4,694,920, or $36,395 for each of the 129 schools. 
The aggregate amount of State and municipal aid received by the 
public high schools is shown to be $8,488,181. This figure is too small, 
for the reason that many principals found it impossible to give even an 
estimate of the amount received from this source. This is especially 
true of high schools in the cities where, no separate account is kept of 
the funds expended for elementary and secondary grades of the_city 
system. Of the 3,964 schools 1,582 failed to report this item.

  50 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
The schedule sent out from this Bureau to secondary schools called 
for the amount of State or municipal aid, the amount derived from 
tuition, and the income from all sources. It was found when the work 
of tabulation began that the sum of the first two items did not in all 
cases equal the third, although in many cases it was stated that there 
were other sourees of income. For this reason it was found necessary 
to correct many of the schedules by inserting “from other sources and 
unelassified” sums large enough to make the financial statements bal- 
ance. These necessary estimates force the “other source and unelas- 
sified” aggregate up to $2,956,989. Itis probable that a large proportion 
of this amount more properly belongs in the column of “State and 
municipal aid,” and possibly part of it should have been reported as 
tuition fees. 
The aggregate income of the public high schools from all sources was 
$12,274,057. As this item was reported by only 3,109 of the 3,964 
schools, the average for each school reporting was $3,947. If it may be 
assumed that the 855 schools not reporting the amount of their income 
each received this average sum the grand aggregate may be shown to 
be $15,645,908, 
The amount of income reported for the public high schools of the 
North Atlantic Division was $3,561,686, or $4,491 for each school report- 
ing; in the South Atlantic the amount was $525,020, or $2,253 to each 
school reporting; in the South Central the amount was $961,526, or 
$2,870 to each; in the North Central the amount was $6,206,184, or 
$3,842 to each; in the Western Division it was $1,019,641, or $7,666 to 
each school reporting. 
Only 2,972 schools are reported as having libraries. It is fair to 
assume that nearly all the schools failing to report on this item were 
without libraries. The aggregate number of volumes reported was 
1,572,690, or 529 volumes to each school reporting. The public high 
schools of the North Atlantic Division had 637,056 volumes in their 
libraries, or 742 to each; in the South Atlantic 46,610 volumes were 
reported, or 405 to each school reporting; in the South Central the 
number was 55,575, or 332 to each school; in the North Central there 
were 783,507 volumes, or 466 to each school; in the Western Division 
49,942 volumes were reported, or 326 to each school reporting.   
Private HicH ScHOooLs. 
The statisties of private high schools and academies are summarized 
in Tables 9 to 18. The statistics of each of the 1,982 schools reporting 
will be found in the detail tables in the last part of this report. The 
items tabulated correspond to the items tabulated for publie high 
schools. The tables of summaries 1 to 8 for publie high schools are 
similar to Tables 9 to 16 for private high schools, and may be compared.

STATISTICAL REVIEW OF SECONDARY EDUCATION. 51 
The private high schools are more evenly distributed over the country 
than is the ease with public secondary schools. Of the 1,982 private 
schools 662 are in the North Atlantic Division, 406 in the South 
Atlantic, 435 in the South Central, 354 in the North Central, and 125 
in the Western Division. New York reported the largest number, 201; 
Pennsylvania comes next with 139, North Carolina follows with 111, 
and Tennessee reports 101. The other States had fewer than 100 each. 
The number of teachers instructing the 118,645 secondary students 
in the 1,982 private high schools was 8,007. More than half of these 
teachers—4,272, or 53.36 per cent—were women. The male teachers 
numbered 3,735, or 46.64 per cent. The preponderance of female 
teachers is shown in each of the five geographical divisions, but is 
more marked in the North Atlantic Division. In the North Atlantic 
there were 3,429 teachers—1,840 (or 53.66 per cent) women, and 1,589 
(or 46.34 per cent) men. In the South Atlantic there were 670 female 
teachers, or 53.82 per cent, and 575 male teachers, or 46.18 per cent. 
In the South Central the 712 female teachers constituted 53.61 per 
cent, and the 616 male teachers 46.39 per cent. In the North Central 
there were 797 female teachers, or 52.20 per cent, and 730 male teachers, 
er 47.80 per cent. In the Western Division the numbers were 253 and 
225, or 52.93 per cent females to 47.07 per cent males. 
The average number of teachers to each of the 1,982 private high 
schools was 4, or about one more than the average for the public high 
schools. The average number of teachers to each school in the North 
Atlantic Division was 5.2, in the South Atlantic 3.1, in the South 
Central 3.1, in the North Central 4.3, and in the Western Division 3.8. 
A column in Table 19 shows the average number of teachers in each 
private high school for each State and Territory. 
DISTRIBUTION OF STUDENTS. 
The distribution of secondary students in the 1,982 private schools 
is shown in columns 5, 6, and 7 of Table 9. Of the 118,645 secondary 
students 59,786, or 50.39 per cent, were males, and 58,859, or 49.61 per 
cent, were females. This is a more nearly equal division than was 
noticed in the number of male and female students in the public high 
schools, where the female students included about 60 per cent of the 
whole number. In the North Atlantic Division the proportion of male 
to female students was 52.04 to 47.96, in the South Atlantic 50.45 to~ 
49.55, in the South Central 47.76 to 52.24, in the North Central 51.68 
to 48.32, and in the Western Division 43.75 to 56.25. The largest per- 
centage of male students in the private high schools in any State 
was 67.40 for Wisconsin. The second and third columns of Table 14 
give these proportions for each State. 
The number of colored students included in the 118,645 secondary 
students in private high schools was only 3,782. Of these 1,620 are 
females and 1,162 are males. Only 94 were reported from the North

ban 
Atlantic Division, 96 from the North Central, and 3 from the Western 
Division. These were colored students in white schools. In the 
South Atlantic 1,630 were reported, and in the South Central 959, all 
in schools for the colored race. The distribution of colored secondary 
students by States is shown in columns 8, 9, and 10 of Table 9. 
The number of elementary pupils in the 1,982 private high schools 
was 94,604. Here the girls predominate, the number being 51,345, as 
against 43,259 boys. In the North Atlantic Division there were 12,098 
males and 12,151 females, while in the other divisions the proportion of 
female students in the elementary grades was much larger. 
In the case of public high schools it was seen that the number of 
‘elementary pupils was much larger than the number of secondary 
students, there being 73 secondary and 147 elementary to each school 
on an average. In the private high schools the proportion of second- 
ary students is much larger than the elementary. There were 60 
secondary students and 48 elementary pupils to each school. Table 19 
shows the average number of elementary pupils to the school in each 
State, as well as the average number of secondary students. 
The first six columns of Table 10 show the number of secondary 
students in the private high schools preparing for college. There 
were 30,736, or 25.91 per cent of the whole number. The per cent pre- 
paring for the college classical course was 16.36 and the per cent 
preparing for a college scientific course was 9.55. Combining columns 
4 and 5 of Table 14 it will be seen that 29.62 per cent of the secondary 
students in the private schools of the North Atlantic Division were 
preparing for college, 26.79 per cent in the South Atlantic, 23.70 in the 
South Central, 21.09 in the North Central, and 23.90 per cent in the 
Western Division. In all the divisions save the Western larger num- 
bers were preparing for the college classical course, but in the latter 
section the college scientific preparatory students exceed the classical 
preparatory in number. 
The number graduating from the private high schools in the class of 
1894 was 11,151, an average of 5.6 to each school. Of the number 
graduating 5,940 were males and 5,211 females. The number gradua- 
ting was 9.4 per cent of the whole number of secondary students. The 
distribution of these graduates by States can be seen from columns 7, 
8,and 9 of Table 10. The average number of graduates to each pri- 
vate high school in the United States was 5.6. The average number 
for the North Atlantic Division was 7.8, for the South Atlantic 3.6, for 
the South Central 3.7, for the North Central 6.6, and for the Western 
Division, 4.6. 
Of the 11,151 graduates from the private high schools 5,022, or 45.04 
per cent, were college preparatory students—3,410 males and 1,612 
females. The last columns of Table 10 will show the number of male 
and female college preparatory students in the class of 1894 in each 
State and division. In Table 14 will be found the per cent of graduates
-P-A-G-E-101
STATISTICAL REVIEW OF SECONDARY EDUCATION. 53 
in each State prepared for college. In the North Atlantic Division 
50.36 per cent were college preparatory graduates; in-the South Atlan- 
tic, 43.68 per cent; in the South Central, 38.64 per cent; in the North 
Central, 39.80 per cent; in the Western Division, 39.93 per cent. 
STUDENTS AND STUDIES. 
Tables 11, 12, and 13 show the number of students in the private high 
schools in each State pursuing each of the ten principal secondary 
studies, and Table 15 gives the percentages corresponding. These tables 
are also illustrated by diagrams 3, 4, 5, and 6, placing the number of 
students pursuing certain studies in the private high schools in contrast 
with the number in the same studies in the public high schools. 
Latin.—The number of students pursuing Latin was 48,374, or 40.77 
per cent of the whole number. In the case of public high schools 
the per cent was 44.78. The South Atlantic Division shows the high- 
est per cent of private secondary students studying Latin, 47.44. The 
North Atlantic is next with 44.67 per cent, the South Central has 36.22 
per cent, the North Central 35.12, and the Western Division, 31.38, 
Greek.—In the private high schools 10,720 students, or. 9.04 per 
cent, studied Greek, while only 3.33 per cent in the public high schools 
included this language in their course of study. It is noticed that 
more than half of the students in Greek, or 5,660, were in the North 
Atlantic Division. It is also significant that 8,914 of the total number 
were males and only 1,806 were female students. 
French.—The number studying French was 22,370, nearly two-thirds 
of this number, or 14,898, being female students. The number study- 
. ing French was 18.85 per cent of the whole. More than half, or 12,854, 
of the students in this language were in the North Atlantic Division, 
where 29.03 per cent studied French. The percentage for the South 
Atlantic was 18.39, for the South Central 9.21, for the North Central 
11.07, and for the Western Division 15.80. 
German.—In the study of the German language the male students 
take the lead in numbers. Of the 18,096 students in German 9,455 
were males and 8,641 females. As in the case of French, more than 
one-half of the students in German,.or 9,135, were in the North Atlan- 
tic Division. Of the remainder, 4,958 were in the North Central Divi- 
sion. For the whole country 15.25 per cent of the private secondary 
students studied German. In Wisconsin the per cent was 46.02. 
Algebra.—Of the total number of secondary students in the private 
high schools 52,637, or 44.37 per cent, studied algebra—28,487 males 
and 24,150 females. As in the public high schools, this branch claims 
a greater number of students than any other study, but in the case of 
the private schools the per cent, 44.37, falls far below the per cent in 
algebra in the public schools—56.14. In the private schools of the two 
Southern divisions, as was true of the public schools, the per cent 
studying algebra was much greater than the per cent in this study 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
    54 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
in the other divisions of the country. In the South Atlantic the per 
cent was 51.99, in the South Central 50.64, in the North Central 40.97, 
in the North Atlantic 40.17, and in the Western Division 38.36 per cent. 
In the District of Columbia 73.85 per cent of the private secondary 
students included algebra in the course of study in 1893-94. 
Geometry.—The number studying geometry was 24,374, or 20.54 per 
cent of the whole. Of this number 14,275 were males and 10,099 were 
‘females. There is not a wide variation of percentages for the five divi- 
sions, but the individual States show percentages varying from 3.61 to 
38.46. In many schools geometry is taken up in the last year of the 
course, in many instances in the last half of the final year. 
Trigonometry.—This branch of mathematics was pursued by 7,036 stu- 
dents—4,441 males and 2,595 females. The percentage for the United 
States was 5.93. For the South Central Division it was 7.76 per cent, for 
the North Central 6.99, for the South Atlantic 5.05, for the North 
Atlantic 4.95, and for the Western Division 4.78 per cent. In Indiana 
the rate was 13.53, in New Jersey 10.52, and in Michigan 10.44. 
Physics.—The number of students pursuing physics, 24,812, was 20.91 
per cent of the whole, almost equally divided as to sex in the aggre- 
gate. For the five divisions there was considerable variation in the 
percentages. In glancing down the column of States wide differences 
will be noted. In Florida 34.14 per cent of the private secondary 
students studied physics, while in Vermont the per cent was only 
12.65. For the North Atlantic Division the per cent studying physics 
was 19.71 and in the South Central 24.57. 
Chemistry.—Of the 12,241 students in chemistry, 6,216 were males 
and 6,025 females. The per cent to the whole number of private sec- _ 
ondary students was 10.32, the five divisions showing but small varia- 
tion from this rate. As in the case of physics the same wide difference 
is observed between individual States. 
General history.—Measured by the number of students in each study, 
general history occupies the third place in importance in the private 
high schools, algebra and Latin claiming larger numbers of students. 
Of the 118,645 private secondary students, 40,418 were, studying gen- 
eral history—18,228 males and 22,190 females. The per cent was 34.07 
for the United States, 36.62 for the South Atlantic Division, 36.52 for 
the North Atlantic, 35.90 for the Western, 31.13 for the North Central, 
and 29.98 per cent for the South Central Division. In Maryland the 
rate was 61.22 and in the District of Columbia 54.91. 
_ EQUIPMENT AND INCOME. 
About 63 per cent of the private high schools had libraries in 1894, 
Of the 1,982 only 1,242 reported the number of volumes. In the libra- 
ries reported there were 1,420,336 volumes, or an average of 1,144 vol- 
umes to each school library. In the North Atlantic Division 68 per 
cent of the schools had libraries and an average of 1,545 volumes to
-P-A-G-E-103
  STATISTICAL REVIEW OF SECONDARY EDUCATION. . 55 
each. In the South Atlantic 45 per cent of the schools reported libra- 
ries, the average being 932 volumes to each. The per cent of schools 
having libraries in the South Central was nearly 60, with 613 volumes 
to each. Inthe North Central 74 per cent of the private high scheols 
possessed libraries, the average being 1,179 volumes to each. For the 
Western Division the per cent was 72 of the number of schools, and 
the average number for those reporting was 997 volumes. In the 63 
school libraries reported from Massachusetts there were 111,114 vol- 
umes, or 1,732 volumes to each. The 146 schools reporting libraries in 
the State of New York have 231,161 volumes, or 1,583 to each. Seven 
schools in the District of Columbia report 30,780 volumes, an average 
of 4,397 to each. 
Only 1,463 of the private secondary schools reported the value of 
buildings and grounds. These reported a total valuation of $49,495,897. 
This would be an average of $33,831 to each school reporting. In the 
North Atlantic Division the average value of each was $60,415, in the 
South Atlantic $15,546, in the South Central $14,179, in the North 
Central $35,718, and in the Western Division $40,329 to each school 
reporting. 
Only 308 schools reported having received State or municipal aid. 
The total amount thus reported was only $172,163. 
Of the 1,982 schools, 1,259 reported the amounts received from tuition 
fees, the aggregate for the United States reaching $5,500,918. The 
income from “all sourees” reported by 1,416 schools aggregated 
$8,204,352. This is larger than the sum of State aid and tuition fees, 
for the reason that many of the schools reported only total income. 
This made it necessary to insert a column including items “from other 
sources and unclassified.” This column includes the sam of $2,531,271. 
A small per cent of this perhaps belongs to the State aid column, a 
eertain per cent was derived from benefactions, but the larger pro- 
portion embraces receipts from tuition fees not separately reported. 
The average total income for each school reporting was $5,794. The 
average for the schools of the North Atlantic Division was-$10,515, for 
the South Atlantic $2,836, for the South Central $2,505, for the North 
Central $5,474, and for the Western Division $5,787 to each school 
reporting. 
DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. 
Forty-three per cent of the private secondary schools were reported as 
denominational schools. That is, 852 ef these schools were controlled 
or partially supported by a religious denomination and 1,130 were non- 
sectarian. 
The 1,130 nonsectarian schools had 4,309 teachers and 66,050 students 
in secondary studies. The 852 denominational schools had 3,698 
teachers and 52,595 secondary students. These figurse ean be verified 
by reference to Tables 17 and 18.
-P-A-G-E-104
  56 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
The Baptist denomination controlled 93 schools with 433 teachers 
and 7,320 students; the Congregational, 56 schools with 190 teachers 
and 2,757 pupils; the Episcopal, 112 schools with 579 teachers and 
5,402 students; the Friends, 54 schools with 236 teachers and 3,444 
students; the Lutheran, 31 schools with 130 teachers and 1,805 stu- 
dents; the Northern Methodist, 57 schools with 322 teachers and 5,781 
students; the Southern Methodist, 50 schools with 201 teachers and 
4,333 students; the Presbyterian, 97 schools with 338 teachers and 
4,889 students; the Roman Catholic, 254 schools with 1,062 teachers 
and 13,127 students. AIl other denominations controlled 48 schools 
with 207 teachers and 3,727 students. 
Tables 17 and 18 show in what States these denominational schools 
are found. It may be remarked that no single denomination con- 
trolled secondary schools in every State and Territory of the Union. 
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE HiIGH SCHOOLS COMPARED. 
To emphasize the points of similarity and contrast between public 
and private high schools Table 20 has been prepared. This table will 
show for the United States and for each of the five geographical divi- 
sions separately, for public high schools, for private high schools, and 
for both in combination, the number of schools, number of teachers of 
secondary students, and number of students in secondary studies. 
These totals are followed by the average number of teachers to a 
school, average number of secondary students to a school, average 
number of secondary students to a teacher, average number of gradu- 
ates to a school, and average number of elementary pupils to a school. 
All the columns from 11 to 33, inclusive, show percentages. There are 
shown the percentages of male and female teachers, male and female 
secondary students, male and female graduates, and male and female 
college preparatory students in graduating class. There are also shown 
the percentages of college preparatory students, both classical and 
scientific, to the total number of secondary students; also the percent- 
ages of students pursuing each of the ten leading high school studies. 
The average number of teachers to the public high school was 3.1, 
while the average number to the private high school was 4, as will be 
seen by reference to column 6. The next column shows the number of 
secondary pupils to a public school to be 73 and to a private school only 
60. This gives 24 students to a teacher in the public and 15 to a teacher 
in the private school, as shown in column 8. It is probable that in most 
private high schools the teachers of secondary students were also teach- 
ers of the elementary students, while in the public high schools, where 
the work of each teacher is more strictly confined to certain grades, 
fewer high school teachers are called upon to instruct elementary 
pupils. 
A glance down columns 6,7, and 8 will reveal the fact that the dis- 
proportion between the number of teachers to the public and to the
-P-A-G-E-105
STATISTICAL REVIEW OF SECONDARY EDUCATION. 57 
private school is about the same in each geographical division. The 
North Atlantic Division had the greatest number of teachers to the 
school—3.7 to the public and 5.2 to the private school. The number of 
secondary pupils to a teacher in the public schools varied from 22 in 
the two Southern divisions to 24 in the two Northern and 25 in the 
Western Division. In the private schools the number of students to a 
teacher was 13 in the North Atlantic and Western divisions, 16 in 
the South Atlantic and North Central, and 18 in the South Central 
Division. 
The number of secondary students to a public school was 89 and to 
a private school 67 in the North Atlantic Division. The Western Divi- 
sion is next with $4 and 49, the North Central with 69 and 68, the South 
Atlantic with 60 and 49, and the South Central with 54 and 56, the 
latter division being the only one in which the average number of 
private secondary students was greater than the number of public 
secondary students to a school. 
The average number of graduates to a school in 1894 is shown in 
column 9. The number was 9.4 to each public school and 5.6 to each 
private school. This column should be compared with column 18, 
which shows the per cent of graduates to the number of secondary 
students. Not only does each division turn out a larger number of 
graduates from each public high school, but also a larger percentage 
of graduates to the number of secondary students than from the pri- 
vate high schools. 
The average number of elementary pupils to a school is shown in 
column 10. For public schools the number was 147 to a school, or double 
the average number of secondary students. For private high schools 
the number to a school was 48, or only four-fifths as great as the 
average number of secondary students. The averages for the several 
divisions show wide variations, the smallest average for public schools 
being 111 in the South Atlantic, and the highest 182 in the Western 
Division; the smallest average for the private schools being 37 in the 
North Atlantic and the highest 70 in the Western Division. 
The remaining columns of the table, 11 to 33, deal with percentages. 
Columns 11 and 12 show the percentages of male and female teachers. 
In both public and private high schools in each of the divisions, with 
two exceptions, the number of women who were instructing students 
exceed the number of male teachers. In the public schools of the 
South Central only 46.26 per cent were women, and in the Western 
Division the female teachers were only about 48 per cent of the whole. 
In the North Atlantic Division they were 59.25 per cent for the public 
schools and 53.66 per cent for the private schools. In the private schools 
of each division the force of female teachers was larger than the male 
force by 2 to 4 per cent. 
In columns 13 and 14 will be found the percentages showing the 
proportion of male and female secondary students. In the public 
   
-P-A-G-E-106
58 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
  schools the per cent was 40.45 for males and 59.55 for females, while in 
the private schools the division was more nearly equal, being 50.39 for 
males and 49.61 for females. In the five geographical divisions the 
proportion of male and female students was about as 40 te 60. In the 
private schools of the North Atlantic Division the per cent of males 
was 52.04, in the South Atlantic 50.45, in the South Central 47.76, in the 
North Central 51.68, and in the Western Division 43.75. 
The next three columns, 15, 16, and 17, show the proportions of séc- 
ondary students reported as preparing for college courses, classical or 
seientifie. The per cent of public secondary students preparing for 
college was 14.30, divided between classical and scientific students in the 
proportion of 7.87 to 6.43. ‘The per cent of private secondary students 
preparing for college was 25.91. The percent of classical students was 
16.36, and of scientific students 9.55. The per cent of college prepara- 
tory students, combining public and private schools, was largest in the 
South Central Division, 23.37, the per cent of public and private 
sehool college preparatory students being about the same. While the 
South Central has a larger percentage of college preparatery students 
in the public high schools than has any other division, the North 
Atlantic, South Atlantic, and Western divisions had larger percentages 
in the private schools. The North Atlantic has 29.62 per cent of the 
private secondary students preparing for college—18.25 per cent elassi- 
cal and 11.37 per cent. scientific students. The South Atlantie shows 
the highest per cent of classical students in the private high schools, 
19.36 per cent, while the South Central had the highest per cent of 
classical preparatory students in the publie high schools, 14.36 per cent. 
In the publie high schools of the North Central Division and in both 
publie and private high sehools of the Western Division the scientific 
college preparatory students outnumber the classical preparatory stu- 
dents. In all other instances, as shown in the table, the classical 
students are preponderant. 
Column 18 shows the per cent of graduates to the whole number of 
secondary students. In the public high schools the graduating classes 
of 1894 composed 12.90 per cent of the total. In the private secondary 
schools the per cent of graduates was 9.40. In all the divisions the 
public high schools show the highest percentages of graduates. 
In column 19 is shown the per cent of college preparatory students 
in the graduating class of 1894 to the number of graduates. In the 
publie high schools 26.70 per cent had prepared for college, and in the 
private high schools 45.04 per cent. In all the divisions the private 
high schools lead the public schools in large percentages of college 
preparatory graduates. In the North Atlantic 50.36 per cent of the 
private high school graduates had prepared for college and only 21.63 
per cent of the public high school graduates. In the Western Division 
the per cent of college preparatory students among the graduates was 
34.39 for the public high schools and 39.93 for the private secondary 
schools.

STATISTICAL REVIEW OF SECONDARY EDUCATION. 59 
The fact should not be forgotten that the students in the public high 
schools numbered nearly two and one-half times as many as the num- 
ber in the private high schools, and that the former turned out 37,328 
graduates in 1894 to 11,151 by the latter, and that among the public 
high school graduates were 9,966 college preparatory students and 
5,022 among the private high school graduates. 
The per cent of male and female graduates can be seen by inspecting 
columns 20 and 21. In the public high schools the per cent of male 
graduates was 35.45 and of female graduates 64.55. It is thus shown 
that a larger proportion of girls than of boys complete the high school 
course, for it is seen in columns 12 and 14 that the proportion of male 
.and female students is about as 40 to 60. In the two Southern divisions 
the per cent of female graduates in the public schools was nearly 69. 
In the private high schools the males comprised 53.27 per cent of the 
graduates. In these schools there was almost an equal number of 
males and females. Only in the South Central Division did the per 
cent of female graduates exceed the males. There the per cent was 
55.45. In the North Atlantic Division the per cent of male graduates 
in the private schools was 56.72. 
A study of columns 22 and 23 will prove the fact that a larger pro- 
portion of young women than young men fail to go beyond the high 
school. Whilethe female graduates are nearly 60 per cent of the whole 
number, the proportion of college preparatory students for male gradu- 
ates is nearly 55 per cent. In the public high schools the proportion is 
about 48 males to 52 females, and in the private high schools 68 males 
to 32 females. In the North Atlantic Division the proportion of male 
college preparatory graduates was even greater, being 57 per cent in 
the public high schools and nearly 76 per cent in the private high 
schools. In the North Central and the two Southern divisions more 
than half the college preparatory graduates from the public high schools 
were females, but the proportion is much smaller than the proportion 
of girls graduating. In the Western Division more than 52 per cent of 
the college preparatory graduates were males for the public schools 
and 71 per cent for the private high schools. In all the divisions the 
male college preparatory graduates in the private high schools far exceed. 
in number the female graduates prepared for college. 
The remainder of the table, columns 24 to 33, shows the per cent of 
students pursuing each of the ten leading high school studies. In the 
public high schools of the United States about 45 per cent of the stu- 
dents pursued Latin and in the private high schools only 41 per cent. 
In the North Atlantic Division the per cent was 43.53 for the public 
schools and 44.67 for the private schools. In the South Atlantic 63.68 
per cent of the public high school students studied Latin and 47.44 per 
eent of the private secondary students. In the South Central the per 
cent was 51.74 for the public and 36.22 for the private schools. In the 
North Central the percentages for the public and private schools were 
42,25 and 35.12, and in the Western Division 44.25 and 31.38, 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
60 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
Greek was studied by only 3.33 per cent of the students in the public 
high schools and 9.04 per cent in the private high schools of the United 
States. The corresponding rates for the North Atlantic Division were 
6.70 and 12.78. 
In the public high schools of the United States 6.81 per cent of the 
students studied French and 18.85 per cent in the private schools. For 
the North Atlantic Division the corresponding percentages were 14.40 
and 29.03. Inthe South Atlantic the per cent for the public high schools 
was 8.56 and for the private high schools 18.39. 
terman was studied by 11.77 per cent of the students in public high 
schools, 15.25 per cent in private high schools, the North Atlantic and 
North Central divisions showing the highest percentages for this study . 
for public and private schools combined. 
Algebra is the leading secondary study in both public and private 
high schools in each of the five geographical divisions, the only excep- 
tion being in the private high schools of the North Atlantic. For the 
whole country 56.14 per cent of the students in the public high schools 
and 44.37 per cent in the private high schools study algebra. As 
already noted in this chapter, the two Southern divisions lead in math- 
ematical studies. In the South Atlantic the percentages for algebra 
in the publie and private high schools were 64.96 and 51.99, and in the 
South Central 70.02 and 50.64. In the North Atlantic the correspond- 
ing percentages were 51.37 and 40.17, in the North Central 55.39 and 
40.97, and in the Western Division 63.24 and 38,36. 
Geometry had less than half the number of students claimed by 
algebra. For the United States the per cent in the public schools was 
27.20 and in the private schools 20.54. In all the divisions the per- 
centage was highest in the public high schools, being above 33 per cent 
in the two Southern divisions and nearly 35 per cent in the Western 
Division. 
Trigonometry claims a percentage of 2.93 in the public high schools 
and 5.93 in the private schools. In this study the two Southern divi- 
sions again lead, the private high schools of the South Central showing 
a percentage of 7.76. 
Physics is the only science study in many secondary schools. It was 
pursued by 25.29 per cent of the students in the public high schools 
and 20.91 per cent in the private schools. In this study the South 
Central Division leads with 34.20 per cent in the public and 24.57 in 
the private schools. 
Chemistry is studied by about 10 per cent of the high school students 
in the United States, the Western Division leading with 14.68 per cent, 
16.17 per cent in the public high schools and 11.11 per cent in the 
private schools. 
General history follows algebra and Latin in importance as a high 
school study, claiming 35.78 per cent of the whole number of students, 
36.48 per cent in the public and 34.07 in the private schools. The West-
-P-A-G-E-109
  
STATISTICAL REVIEW OF SECONDARY EDUCATION. 61 
ern Division had 57.55 per cent of its publie high school students in 
this study and 35.90 per cent of its private secondary students. The 
corresponding figures for the South Atlantic were 51.68 and 36.62, for 
the South Central 41.50 and 29.98, for the North Atlantic 35.48 and 
36,52, and for the North Central 32.28 and 31.13. 
Diagrams 3, 4, 5, and 6 are graphic comparisons of the number of 
students in the United States and in the five geographical divisions 
} studying Latin, algebra, physics, and general history, public and pri- 
vate secondary schools being represented in contrast on the same page. 
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECONDARY STUDENTS. 
The distribution of secondary students in high schools, without ref- 
erence to the classification of public and private, is shown in Tables 21, 
22, 23, and 24. These tables deal with numbers and percentages 
arranged in parallel columns. The first column of Table 21 gives the 
number of high schools in each State, and the second column the num- 
ber of secondary students in these schools. The third column gives 
the number of male students and the fourth column their per cent to 
the whole number, while the fifth column shows the number of female 
students and the sixth their per cent to the total. The seventh column 
gives the number of students preparing for the college classical course 
and the eighth column their per cent to the whole number of students. 
The first column of Table 22 shows the number of students preparing 
for a college scientific course and the next column their per cent. The 
third column gives the total number preparing for a college course, 
whether classical or scientific, and the next column shows the per cent 
to the whole number of students in the schools. As will be seen, col- 
umn 3 of Table 22 is obtained by combining the seventh column of Table 
21 and the first column of Table 22. In the fifth column of Table 22 
will be found the number of students graduating in the classes of 1894 
and in the next column their per cent to the total. In column 7 of 
Table 22 is given the number of college preparatory students in the 
elass' that graduated in 1894 and the next column shows their per cent 
to the total number of graduates. Tables 23 and 24 show the number 
of students in each of the ten high-school studies and the per cent in 
each to the total number of secondary students. 
For greater convenience reference may be made to Table 20, which 
gives, by divisions, the total numbers of secondary schools, teachers, 
and students, as well as the numbers for public and private schools 
separately. In that table the average number of teachers to a school 
is shown to be 3.4, the average number of students to a school 69, the 
number of students to a teacher 20, the number of graduates to a 
school 8.2, and the average number of elementary pupils to a school 
114. These averages are for the United States. The averages for each 
of the five geographical divisions are given in the same table. 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  62 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
From Table 21 it will be seen that of the 407,919 secondary students, 
176,988, or 43.39 per cent, are males, and 230,931, or 56.61 per cent, 
are females. The male students exceed the female students in number 
only in New Hampshire, New Jersey, Indian Territory, and Utah. 
In the high schools of the United States there were 72,116 secondary 
students preparing for college, or 17.67 per cent of the whole—10.34 per 
cent for a classical course and 7.33 per cent for a scientific course. The 
State showing the largest per cent of classical preparatory students 
was North Carolina, with 20.77 per cent, and the State having the 
highest per cent of scientific preparatory students was Minnesota, with 
17.03 per cent. Arkansas shows the highest per cent of college pre- 
paratory students, 36.17 per cent, classical and scientific combined. 
The number of students graduating from the high schools in the class 
of 1894 was 48,479, or 11.88 per cent of the total number of students 
for that year. The North Atlantic Division had the largest per cent, 
13.21, and the South Central the smallest, 7.37. Of the 48,479 grad- 
uates there were 14,988 students who had been preparing for college. 
This number was 30.92 per cent of the number of graduates. The 
per cent of college preparatory graduates was considerably smaller in 
the North Atlantic and North Central than in the three other divisions. 
Tables 23 and 24 give the numbers and percentages of students pur- 
suing the leading high school studies in each State. Algebra was 
* studied by 52.71 per cent, Latin by 43.59 per cent, general history by 
35.78 per cent, geometry by 25.25 per cent, physics by 24.02 per cent, 
German by 12.78 per cent, French by 10.31 per cent, chemistry by 
10.31 per cent, Greek by 4.99 per cent, and trigonometry by 3.80 per 
cent. 
It has been noted that the Southern divisions lead in the per cent of 
students pursuing mathematical studies and in the per cent of students 
in Latin. In the South Atlantic 55.12 per cent studied Latin and 57.86 
percent algebra. In the South Central 44.49 per cent studied Latin 
and 59.63 per cent algebra. The North Atlantic Division shows larger 
percentages in Greek, French, and German than any other division. 
The South Atlantic leads in Latin, the South Central in algebra, 
trigonometry, and physics, and the Western Division in geometry, 
chemistry, and history. 
A study of Tables 23 and 24 will prove of value to those interested 
in tracing the apparent popularity of certain high school studies. If 
we suppose that only the ten branches mentioned are taught in the 
high schools and that each student pursues regularly three of these 
studies at a time, and only three, it is apparent that the sum of the 
percentages given for each study should equal 300; thatis, the first line 
of pereentages across the tops of Tables 23 and 24 opposite “ United 
States” when added should equal 300, provided each student pursued 
three and only three studies confined to the ten mentioned in the 
table. As a matter of fact, the sum of the ten percentages for the
-P-A-G-E-111
  STATISTICAL REVIEW OF SECONDARY EDUCATION. 63 
United States is only about 224. It is clear that on an average two of 
the ten studies were taken and about one-quarter of another, or one- 
quarter of the time of a third study was taken, leaving about three- 
fourths of the time for one study to be given to secondary studies not 
mentioned or to studies below the secondary grade. The sum of the 
percentages for the North Atlantic Division is nearly 232, showing 
approximately that two of the ten studies were taken and one-third of 
the time of another. For the South Atlantic Division the ten percent- 
ages equal 252, showing that two studies were taken and more than 
half of the time of another. For the South Central the sum of the 
percentages is 228, indicating that an average of two of the ten studies 
were taken and 28 per cent of the time of another. For the North 
Central Division the pereentages equal 206, showing that two of the 
studies were pursued, leaving only a small fraction of time for a third. 
The sum of the percentages for the Western Division is 246, showing 
that two of the studies were pursued and almost half of the time of a 
third was taken. : 
These figures can only show that other studies in addition to the ten 
mentioned enter into the course in many schools and divide the time 
of the students, always supposing that each student has three studies 
-atatime. Doubtless in many cases these additional studies are below 
the secondary grade, but it is certain that not a few schools prescribe 
in addition to the ten several other high school studies. Among these 
may be mentioned astronomy, physical geography, geology, zoology, 
botany, physiology, psychology, rhetoric, civics, and English literature. 
OTHER SECONDARY STUDENTS. 
In addition to the 407,919 secondary students in public and private 
high schools there were many others pursuing secondary studies in the 
public and private elementary schools of the country. In States where 
high schools are few one or more pupils may be found in almost every 
eommon school pursuing certain high school studies. Not afew young 
men have prepared themselves for college in the elementary schools with 
the assistance of the country school-teacher who could spare a few 
minutes’ time each day to direct the work of a few students:in second- 
ary studies. These secondary students are seldom reported as such to 
State superintendents of public instruction, and this office is without 
sufficient data upon which to base an estimate of the number in each 
State, but itis not improbable that in the United States there are nearly 
100,000 students in the elementary schools pursuing secondary studies 
for at least a portion of the year. 
The number of secondary students in the preparatory departments of 
colleges and universities, in normal schools, and in manual training 
schools is known. By reference to the statistical summaries of the 
above classes of institutions it will be found that in the colleges and 
universities there were 47,976 secondary students, in the colleges for
-P-A-G-E-112
  64 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
women 4,576, in normal schools 16,469, and in manual training schools 
3,418. These numbers, added to the total for public and private second- 
ary schools, bring the grand total of secondary students up to 480,358. 
This number does not include any number supposed to be in the elemen- 
tary schools, but only the secondary students reported to this Bureau for 
the year ended June, 1894. 
Table 25 is a résumé showing the distribution of all the secondary 
students in the United States as reported to this office. The first 12 
columns show the distribution of public secondary students, columns 
13 to 28 private secondary students, and the last column gives the total. 
Columns 1, 2, and 3 recapitulate the numbers of male and female stu- 
dents in the public high schools, giving the total 289,274. In columns 4, 
5, and 6 the number of secondary students in the preparatory depart- 
ments of public colleges and universities will be found, the total being 
5,441—males 4,053 and females 1,388, These institutions are State uni- 
versities and agricultural and mechanical colleges. In columns 7, 8, 
and 9 are given the numbers of secondary students in public normal 
schools. The total number was 7,291—males 2,032 and females 5,259. 
Column 12 shows that the total number of public secondary students 
was 302,006, the two preceding columns showing that the males num- 
bered 123,287 and the females 178,719. 
In column 15 the number of secondary students in private high 
schools is given—118,645. T’'rom column 18 it will be seen that there 
were 42,535 secondary students in the preparatory departments of 
private universities and colleges—28,884 males and 13,651 females. 
Column 19 shows that in the preparatory departments of colleges for 
women there were 4,576 secondary students. The institutions of higher 
education previously mentioned are coeducational or for men only. The 
number of secondary students in private normal schools is given as 
9,178 in column 22, there being 5,021 males and 4,157 females. In 
manual training schools there were 3,418 secondary students—2,059 
males and 1,359 females. Only 11 States are here represented, 15 
independent manual training and trade schools reporting the 3,418 
secondary students. Column 28 shows the total number of private 
secondary students to have been 178,352. There were 95,750 males and 
82,602 females. 
The last column of the table gives the grand total of secondary stu- 
dents in the United States so far as reported to the United States 
Bureau of Education. The total number was 480,358. As shown in 
columns 29 and 30, there were 219,037 males and 261,321 females. In 
the North Atlantic Division there were 151,507 secondary students, in 
the South Atlantic 46,472, in the South Central 58,557, in the North 
Central 198,210, and in the Western Division 25,612.

An examination of the preceding summarized statements shows that 
the colored students form a very small percentage of the total number. 
This is especially true with respect to the collegiate and graduate 
departments. The colored students are most numerous in the prepara- 
tory and professional departments of institutions in the South Atlantic 
and South Central divisions. As would naturally be expected, the 
proportion of women students is smallest in the North Atlantic Divi- 
sion. This is due undoubtedly to the number of excellent colleges for 
women located in said division. In the Southern States nearly all the 
institutions for colored people are open to both sexes. This fact, 
together with the recent opening to women of a number of institutions 
which had previously been open only to males, accounts for the com- 
paratively large proportion of women students in the South Atlantic 
and South Central divisions. The largest proportion of women stu- 
dents is found in the North Central and Western divisions, where 
nearly all of the institutions are coeducational. 
The number of students to each instructor in the collegiate depart- 
ments is as follows: United States, 9.7; North Atlantic Division, 10.5; 
South Atlantic Division, 8.7; South Central Division, 11.8; North 
Central Division, 9.2; and Western Division, 7.2. 
Of the 60,415 students reported as being in the collegiate depart- 
ments only 45,664, or 75.6 per cent, were reported in courses leading to 
a first or bachelor’s degree. This percentage is known to be too small, 
as the desired data were not given by a number of institutions. In 
some cases, especially in institutions where the system of “schools” is 
used, it is impossible to give in advance the particular degree for which 
a student may apply. The percentage of students reported in under- 
graduate degree courses that are pursuing courses leading to the 
several degrees, together with the number of students in pedagogical 
and business courses, are as follows:

STATISTICAL REVIEW OF HIGHER EDUCATION. 107 
Residence of college students.—One of the items of information fre- 
quently called for by correspondents of this office is the proportion of 
the population of the several States and Territories that attend col- 
lege. This item can be ascertained only approximately. This is due 
to the fact that the only way to obtain the number of students from 
the several States attending college is to examine the catalogues of all 
the universities and colleges of the country and ascertain the home 
‘residences of the students enrolled. The inaccuracy of the statistics 
thus derived is caused by the failure of a number of institutions to. 
publish either the home residences or the classification of their stu- 
dents. An examination of the catalogues of the universities and col- 
leges in the possession of this office has resulted in obtaining statistics 
concerning the residence of students from 447 institutions, including 
the principal colleges for women and technological schools. In this 
examination only students in collegiate courses of study have been 
counted, preparatory students and students in law, medicine, theology, 
pharmacy, music, art, etc., not being included. 
The total number of college students in the 447 institutions that 
reported the residences of the students was 67,179, of which number 
66,357 reside in the United States and 840 are residents of other 
countries. 
The following table gives for each State and Territory the popula- 
tion, the number of students in college, the proportion of population. 
in college, proportion of students attending college in their respective 
States, proportion of the students attending college in the several 
States who are residents of those States, and the proportion of stu- 
dents attending college in the several States who are residents of the 
geographical division in which the several States are located:

larger proportion of its population in college than any other State or

Territory. This is due undoubtedly to the large number of people who 
are called to the capital city of the country by official duties and 
who reside there temporarily, and whose children while attending col- 
lege are frequently credited to the District of Columbia when they 
should really be credited to other States. Next to the District of 
Columbia is Massachusetts, with 0.21 per cent of its population in col- 
lege. Then follow Nevada, Vermont, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Con- 
necticut, in the order named. Among the geographical divisions of the 
country the Western Division leads, with a percentage of 0.130, followed 
by the North Atlantic Division, with 0.127. The proportion of popu- 
lation in college may perhaps be more graphically represented by the

larger proportion of the students of their own State than the colleges 
of any other State inthe Union. Next come California, Massachusetts, 
Tennessee, Alabama, Michigan, and Virginia. Among the divisions 
we find that the North Atlantic Division leads with a percentage of

  Here we find that Oklahoma heads the list of States and Territories 
with 100 per cent, showing that all of the college students attending 
college in Oklahoma were residents of Oklahoma. We also find that 
in Connecticut the local students form but 32.49 per cent of the total 
number, showing that the Connecticut colleges draw 67.51 per cent of 
their students from other States. We see, therefore, that while Con- 
necticut and New Jersey hold but a comparatively small proportion of 
their own college students, they draw very heavily from other portions 
of the country.

134 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
III.—CoLLEeGES OF AGRICULTURE AND THE MECHANIC ARTS. 
The number of colleges of agriculture and the mechanic arts endowed 
by the acts of Congress of July 2, 1862, and August 30, 1890, is 63. Of 
this number 14 are for the education of colored students, and of the 
other 49 two have annexes in which colored students are taught, but 
whose statistics are incorporated with those of the institutions for white 
students. 
The number of students reported by the colleges of agriculture and. 
mechanic arts was 17,280, of which number 4,568 were in preparatory 
departments, 12,358 in collegiate departments, and 354 in graduate 
departments. It will be seen from an examination of the statistics that 
the proportion of preparatory students in this class of institutions, as 
in the case of universities and colleges, is least in the North Atlantic 
Division. 
The total receipts for the year 1893-94, as reported by the several 
institutions, were $5,991,101.40. Of this amount, $2,192,386.24, or 36.6 
per cent, were received from the United States Government either as 
income from the funds realized by the sale of lands granted by the act 
of July 2, 1862, or as cash appropriated by the acts of March 2, 1887, 
and August 30, 1890. 
The statistics concerning these institutions are given, by States and 
Territories, in the following table:

VI.—NorMauL SCHOOLS. 
The number of normal students, or students in various institutions 
pursuing training courses for teachers, in 1894 was 80,767, according to 
the returns made to this office. These students were distributed as 
follows: In 160 public normal schools, 37,899; in 238 private normal 
schools, 27,995; in pedagogical or teachers’ training courses in 173 
universities and colleges, 5,500; in 153 public high schools, 5,041; in 137 
private high schools, 4,332. It will thus be seen that normal students 
were reported from 861 distinct institutions. The 398 public and private 
normal schools sent out 8,271 graduates. The other institutions did 
not report separately their nermal graduates nor the number of students 
completing pedagogical courses. 
A special effort was made by this Bureau in 1894 to secure reports 
from all new normal schools and from the many institutions of this 
class known to have been in existence for several years but from which 
this office had never received statistical reports. The result was an 
enormous increase in the number of normal students reported, an in- 
crease from 52,008 in 1893 to 80,767 in 1894. In 1893 there were 27,926 
students reported in 121 public normal schools and in 1894 the number 
was 37,147, reported by 160 schools. In 1893 the number of students 
reported by 39 private normal schools was 7,286, and in 1894 there 
were 238 schools, reporting 27,995 students. if 1393 there were 5,232 
normal students reported in 155 colleges and universities, and in 1894 
the number reported was 5,500 in 173 of these higher institutions. In 
1893 the number of normal students reported in public high schools
-P-A-G-E-195
    ~ 
STATISTICAL REVIEW OF HIGHER EDUCATION, 147 
was 4,803, and in 1894 the number was 5,041. There was a decrease in 
the number of normal students reported in private high schools between 
1893 and 1894. The number in the former year was 6,761 and in the 
latter 4,332. This is easily explained. Many of the private high schools 
and academies had been gradually modifying their courses of study 
from year to year until those institutions had become practically normal 
schools, and in very many instances the names of long-established 
academies had been changed to “normal school,” indicating beyond 
question the change in the scope of the institution. In such cases the 
school has been transferred from the list of private secondary schools 
to that of private normal schools. It is readily seen that the falling 
off of 2,429 in the number of normal students in private high schools 
is not a real loss. The apparent loss is simply a number transferred, 
which makes up a portion of the 20,709 increase of students in private 
normal schools. 
In this chapter are ten tables summarizing the statisties of normal 
schools and showing the distribution of normal students. Tables 1, 2, 
and 3 show the number of teachers and students, amount of income, 
value of equipment, ete., for public normal schools, and Tables 4, 5, and 
6 give the same items for private normal schools. The statistics of the 
898 normal schools are given in detail in Part IV of this report. 
PUBLIC NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
Table 1 shows that in the 160 public normal schools there were 1,561 
teachers instructing normal students, and 551 teachers engaged wholly 
in other departments. It also shows that in the total enrollment of 
56,849 there were 37,899 normal students. Of these 11,606, or 30.62 per 
cent, were males, and 26,293, or 69.38 per cent, females. These 160 
schools turned out 5,952 normal graduates, or 15.70 per cent of the 
number of normal students. The last column of Table 1 shows that 
2,713 colored students were included in the total of 37,899. These 
colored students were nearly all in public normal and industrial schools 
in the two Southern divisions. More than three-fourths of the normal 
students reported in the 160 public normal schools were in the North 
Atlantic and North Central divisions. 
Table 2 gives the number of pupils in model schools connected with 
the public normal schools as 23,842. This number doubtless includes 
a large proportion of the 13,392 given in the same table as elementary 
pupils. There were 933 students in business courses, and 7,291 classed 
as secondary students. 
Table 8 is a financial exhibit of the public normal schools for the 
year ended June, 1894, The aggregate of appropriations from States, 
counties, and cities for support was $1,996,271. Tuition fees amounted 
to $393,329. The third column gives $334,273 as the aggregate of 
unclassified sums reported and money received from miscellaneous 
sources. As a number of schools reported only total amount received 
for support it is evident that a part of the $334,273 properly belongs 
in the first column and prebably a smaller proportion in the second 
   
-P-A-G-E-196
  
148 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
column. The total amount received for support by the 160 public nor- 
mal schools was $2,723,873. This was an average of $17,023 to a 
school. In the North Atlantic Division the average was $21,938 to 
a school, in the South Atlantic $11,614, in the South Central $9,134, 
in the North Central $19,770, and in the Western Division $17,628. The 
14 public normal schools in the State of New York received $425,557 
for support, or an average of $30,397 to a school. The 5 schools in 
Virginia received $165,954, or an average of $33,191 to a school. 
Public normal schools received appropriations from States, counties, 
and cities for building purposes aggregating $1,583,399. More than 
half of this amount was received by schools in the North Atlantic 
Division—$856,670—the North Central Division receiving $374,799 and. 
the Western Division $279,000. In the South Atlantic Division the 
appropriations for building amounted to $49,580 and in the South 
Central to $23,350. 
The aggregate value of buildings and grounds is shown to be 
$15,571,846, and the value of other property $1,289,100. The value of 
buildings and grounds in the North Atlantic Division was $8,152,186, 
or more than half the total; in the North Central the value was 
$3,588,179, in the Western $1,435,000, in the South Atlantic $1,430,200, 
and in the South Central $966,281. 
Table 10 is a review of appropriations for public normal schools for 
the past five years, showing the amount received for support and the 
amount for building each year. For 1893-94 both items were larger 
than for any previous year—$1,996,271 for support and $1,583,399 for 
building. The largest previous aggregate for support was $1,567,082 
in 1891-92, and the largest amount previously reported for building 
was $900,533 in 1889-90. The increase of appropriations for support 
in 1894 over 1893 was very large in éach geographical division, the 
increase being about 100 per cent in the two Southern sections. . The 
increase of appropriations for building was very large for the North 
Atlantic, the North Central, and Western divisions, but there was 
a slight decrease for the South Central Division. In the South the 
demands for support are more urgent than the needs for building. 
PRIVATE NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The 238 private normal schools reported in 1894 were very unevenly 
distributed among the States. The North Central Division had 110 of 
these schools, the South Central 59, the South Atlantic 46, the North 
Atlantic 13, and the Western Division 10, Iowa alone reports 23 
private normal schools and Ohio 20. By an inspection of the second 
column of Table 4 it will be seen that thirteen States and. Territories 
were without private normal schools, and nine States reported only one 
each. 
-In the 238 schools reporting, there were 1,086 teachers instructing 
normal students and 918 teachers wholly engaged in other departments. 
In a total enrollment of 62,934 there were 27,995 normal students. Of 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
  STATISTICAL REVIEW OF HIGHER EDUCATION. 149 
these 14,176, or 50.64 per cent, were males, and 13,819, or 49.36 per cent, 
were females, as shown in Table7. It was noted in connection with 
public normal schools that the female students constituted nearly 70 per 
cent of the number in training courses for teachers. The 238 private 
schools reported 2,319 graduates, or 8.28 per cent of the number of 
normal students. Compare this with the.15.70 per cent graduating 
from the public normal schools as given in Table 7. ~ 
The North Atlantic Division had only 1,385 students in teachers’ 
training courses in private normal schools as against 16,424 in public nor- 
mals. The North Central had 19,454 in private normals and 12,056 in 
public normals. In the South Atlantic the numbers were 2,728 for the 
private and 3,334 for the public normals; in the South Central 3,421 
private and 3,374 public, and in the Western Division 1,007 private and 
2,711 public. Of the 5,522 colored students in private normal schools 
3,589 were in the South Atlantic and 1,703 in the South Central Divi- 
sion. These colored students were in normal and industrial schools 
which are supported by churches or benevolent societies. A few of 
these schools are of high grade, but many could scarcely be classed as 
secondary schools, but they are normal schools educating colored men 
and women to become teachers of elementary schools for their own 
race. 
Table 5 gives the number of pupils in the model schools connected 
with the private normal schools as 3,520. There were in these schools 
19,078 pupils in elementary studies, 6,395 students in business courses, 
and 9,178 in other courses of study of secondary grade. 
Table 6 shows that the private normal schools received appropriations 
from States, counties, or cities amounting to $24,544. The aggregate 
reported as received from tuition fees was $564,628. The amount from 
all other sources, including unclassified sums from tuition, State appro- 
priations, and productive funds, was $174,009. The total received for 
support was $763,175. Of the $76,127 derived from productive funds, 
a portion was expended for support and the remainder devoted to 
permanent improvements. 
These schools received from public appropriations $135,910 for build- 
ings. The total value of buildings and grounds was $3,750,259, and of 
other property $719,938. 
IN OTHER INSTITUTIONS. 
Table 8 shows the distribution of the 14,873 normal students reported 
in other institutions than public and private normal schools. In 173 
colleges and universities 5,500 students were in pedagogical courses. 
These students were not reported to this office by sex, but a large pro- 
portion of them are males. In 153 public high schools there were 5,041 
normal students—1,390 males and 3,651 females. In 137 private high 
schools 4,332 normal students were reported—2,000 males and 2,332 
females, 
Of the normal students in higher institutions nearly half, or 2,707, 
were found in the North Central Division, Ohio alone reporting 744.  
-P-A-G-E-198
150 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
Of the 1,187 reported from the South Central Division Tennessee had 
473. Of the 5,041 normal students in public high schools 2,184 were 
in the North Atlantic Division, New York reporting 1,054 and Penn- 
sylvania 770. In the North Central Division there were 1,529, lowa 
reporting 438 and Kansas 423. Of the 4,332 normal students in pri- 
vate high schools 1,727 were reported from the North Central Division, 
Ohio alone having 411 and Iowa 455. 
The last column of Table 8 shows that normal students outside of 
public and private normal schools were distributed geographically as 
follows: In the North Atlantic Division, 3,361; South Atlantic, 2,297; 
South Central, 2,332; North Central, 5,963, and Western Division, 920. 
Table 9 is a recapitulation of the totals in preceding tables, showing 
the distribution of the 80,767 normal students in the five classes of 
institutions by divisions and by States. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS FOR TEN YEARS. 
The table below is a statistical review of public and private normal 
schools for the past ten years. The growth since 1884 has been steady. 
The apparent decrease in the number of students in the public normal 
schools in 1888, as shown in the fourth column, was due to a change in 
classification. For the preceding three years all students had been 
reported, but since that time normal students only have been included 
inthat column, In 1884 there were 132 private normal schools, but 
subsequently about 100 of these were transferred to the list of private 
secondary schools. In 1894 many of these schools again appear as 
normal schools.

  STATISTICAL REVIEW OF 151 HIGHER EDUCATION. 
PEDAGOGY IN HIGHER INSTITUTIONS. 
Many universities and colleges, recognizing the necessity of profes- 
sional training for teachers, have organized departments of pedagogy 
or prescribed certain courses of study for those who may expect to 
become teachers after leaving college. In 1891 the Bureau made its 
first inquiry regarding students in pedagogical courses in these higher 
institutions. That year the number of such students reported was 
3,978. Unfortunately the number of institutions reporting was not 
recorded. In 1893 the number of institutions reporting was 155 and

While it is extremely difficult to obtain a comprehensive view of 
higher education as maintained in Great Britain, the statistics of ele- 
mentary education are very complete and uniform for the successive 
years from 1870. 
Up to a very recent date the chief effort of the Government has been 
to get all children under instruction and to secure appreciable results 
as an outcome of the public money expended. So Jong as this standard 
prevailed the statistics of attendance, enrollment, ete., offered a suffi- 
cient index of progress. The following table brings into comparative 
view the chief items relating to the elementary school system of England 
and Wales for the years 1876 and 1893 and to the system of Scotland 
for 1880 and 1893. As regards England and Wales, it should be noted 
that the earlier of the two dates (1876) was the year of the passage of 
the first of the laws amending the original “education act” of 1870.  
-P-A-G-E-215
  EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 167 
The purpose of the law of 1876 was ‘to afford additional means for 
securing the attendance of children at school, especially in districts 
where there was no school board, or where there were no by-laws in 
‘ force as to school attendance.” The authorities constituted by the new 
law in districts not under school boards were termed “school attend- 
ance committees.” 
The six years during which the law of 1870 had been in operation 
‘had shown clearly the need of greater stringency in respect to school 
attendance. It will be remembered that the chief purpose of the origi- 
nal law had been to secure the instruction of all children, and thus free 
England from the stigma of dense and increasing illiteracy. The part 
which the Government assumed in the work was simply to require 
adequate school provision in every district. This might be afforded in 
public elementary schools managed by elected boards and maintained 
in part by local taxes (rates), or in private (voluntary) schools, of whieh 
the various religious denominations were in general the owners and 
managers. Both classes of schools were to receive grants from the 
Government upon the same conditions, and their proper fulfillment of 
the conditions was to be determined by annual examinations conducted 
by Government inspectors. Since 1876 the system has been further 
modified by the laws of 1880 and 1891, the former obliging local authori- 
ties to make by-laws for compelling parents to send their children to 
school and the latter providing for the remission of school fees by means 
of an annual grant to the schools accepting its provisions. The effect 
of the law of 1891 has been to make elementary education practically 
free. 
The earlier of the two years (1880), employed in the comparative 
view for Scotland, is not marked by any event of special importance. 
The law establishing the Scotch system was passed in 1872. The Gov- 
ernment assumed substantially the same relation to the work in Scot- 
land asin England. The Scotch law was, however, more comprehensive, 
as suited the more highly developed and more homogeneous state of 
popular education in the northern division of the Kingdom. In Scot- 
Jand a school board was called into existence in every parish, and not 
only were the parish schools, but also the higher grade burgh schools, 
placed under the management of the boards, although the burgh 
schools did not share in the public funds. Subsequently these high- 
grade schools were permitted to share in the local taxes, so that the 
system of public education in Scotland was carried to the door of the 
universities. < 
As the Scotch law embodied a compulsory clause, its effects upon 
school attendance were uniform throughout the country. Religious ~ 
instruction was restrained simply by a conscience clause, which per- 
mitted children to be withdrawn from the exercise at the request of 
their parents, whereas in the English law, not only was there a con- 
science clause binding upon all the schools, but there was also a clause
-P-A-G-E-216
168 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
prohibiting board schools from giving instruction in any “religious 
catechism or religious formulary which is distinctive of any particular 
denomination.” 
Scotland has been entirely free from the contentions over this subject 
that have repeatedly convulsed England. The former was the first, 
also, to secure exemption from school fees, the laws providing for their 
remission bearing date 1889 and 1890. 5 
It should be added, for the more complete understanding of the 
comparative statistics, that until 1890 the amount of the grant for 
each school depended in a measure upon the actual number of children 
present on the day of the inspector’s examination, hence this item has 
always been reported.

  a Includes the grant in lieu of fees. 
As regards the view presented above it will be seen that certain 
items included in the table have little more than local interest. Even 
these, however, serve to make the impression more precise and definite. 
The variation in the number of institutions inspected, for example, 
may arise from purely accidental causes, as severe weather rendering 
the schools in certaim rural regions, especially of northern Scotland, 
inaccessible. 
The decline in the number of pupil teachers is significant, especially 
when considered in connection with the increase in the number of cer- 
tificated and assistant teachers. It shows a growing preference for 
adult teachers who have passed through the training period. It can

not escape observation that almost in every particular considered there 
has been marked increase during the periods covered by the compari- 
son. Along with the progress in these measurable quantities there 
has been also a remarkable development in the ideal of scholastic work. 
This has always been determined chiefly by the conditions for obtain- 
ing the annual parliamentary grant. These conditions are formulated 
each year by the department in the so-called “code,” or body of regu- 
lations, which must be sanctioned by Parliament before it can be 
adopted. The radical changes that have been introduced into these 
documents from. time to time are the indexes of the most important 
changes that have been effected in the schools. 
For the purpose of making these changes intelligible a historical 
survey of the earlier codes is here presented. It is taken substantially 
from the introduction to the School Board Chronicle edition of the code 
of 1891. The survey is carried back to a period antedating the law of 
1870. It will be remembered that the Government began making grants 
to elementary schools-as early as 1833. In 1860 the various “minutes” 
which had been issued for the guidance of the committee of council in 
charge of this fund were consolidated, and with this digest as a start- 
ing point the document known as “the revised code” of 1861 was 
issued to regulate the future distribution of the grants. Under this 
code the grant was made to depend chiefly on the average attend- 
ance and the results of the individual examination of the scholars in 
reading, writing, and arithmetic. The effects of this code are thus 
summarized by our authority: 
The inevitable result followed that the teachers were compelled to confine their 
attention to these elementary subjects, while others, such as history, grammar, geog- 
raphy, mathematics, which in the hands of a capable teacher foster mental activity 
and create a thirst for knowledge in the scholar, were starved out; and this serious 
result was not counterbalanced by the fact that the new system of individual exam- 
ination enabled the inspector “to report with all but absolute certainty upon, at all 
events, the attainments required, and to apply praise or blame with an amount of 
firmness and decision which under the former code he was able to do.” 
Perhaps the effect of the revised code could hardly be better summed up than in 
the language of Mr. J. G. Fitch, one of Her Majesty’s inspectors of schools. In one 
of his reports he says: 
“<T can not resist the unwelcome conviction that the new code (1861) is tending to 
formalize the work of the elementary schools and to render it in some degree lifeless, 
inelastic, and mechanical. I find too many teachers disposed to narrow their sense 
of duty to the ‘six standards,’ or to what they sometimes call, with unconscious 
sarcasm, the ‘paying subjects.’ I find an increasing eagerness on the part of teachers 
to get hold of text-books which are ‘specially adapted to the requirements of the 
revised code,’ and which claim, as their chief merit, that they do not go a step 
beyond those requirements. The practice of explaining and questioning on the 
meanings of words appears to me on the decline. Spirited oral teaching, mutual 
interrogation, home lessons, and other devices by which the intellectual life of a 
school is kept up are far less common than they ought to be, and, as I have reason 
to believe, than they once were. The teaching of grammar, history, and geography 
has been much discouraged. It has always been a characteristic of the best schools
-P-A-G-E-218

170 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
that in each of them there was some one subject which, if not a hobby of the master’s, 
was yet one in which his own tastes led him to take particular interest, and which 
by its special finish and excellence served to prove that his heart was in his school 
and that he was proud of its success. I regret to say that I see comparatively little 
of this sort of enthusiasm, and that the adoption of a uniform standard tends in 
some measure to discourage it.” 
The late Mr. Matthew Arnold’s condemnation of the system under the revised code 
was, if anything, stronger than that of Mr. Fitch. In his report on education in 
Germany, France, Italy, and Switzerland, he wrote: : 
“The fault of the teaching in our popular schools at home is that it is so little form- 
ative; it does little to touch their nature for good and to mold them. Again and 
again I find written in my notes, ‘The children human.’ They had been brought 
under teaching of a quality to touch and interest them, and were being formed by it.” 
* * * * * Se * 
Passing to conditions under the law of 1870, the writer continues: 
When the education act of 1870 was passed a pledge was given that the amount 
of the annual grants previously available for the support of elementary schools 
should be increased. . A new code was accordingly framed in 1871 with special refer- 
ence to the alterations required by that act. The principle of payment by results 
was still maintained, but a more liberal view was taken, both of the subjects which 
might be taught and the amounts to be earned. The schedule of specific subjects 
for which grants were allowed included geography, history, grammar, algebra, 
geometry, natural philosophy, physical geography, the natural sciences, political 
economy, and languages. 
With slight modifications the code of 1871 remained in force until it was super- 
seded by the code of 1882. 
This code, generally known by the name of its author, Mr. Mundella, 
at that time vice-president of the education department, made the first 
break in the mechanical system that had grown out of the “revised 
code.” Individual examination in the elementary subjects was still 
maintained; for these alone a teacher could secure from the grant rates 
| varying from 13s. to 16s. per capita of the children who passed. Liberal 
. grants were offered also for attainments in the higher subjects. The 
most important feature introduced by the new regulations was the 
“merit grant.” This was to be awarded at rates varying from 1s. to 3s. 
per capita of average attendance, according to the report of the in- 
spector as to the general conditions of the school—i. e., whether excel- 
lent, good, or fair. Inspectors were instructed in making up the report 
| to consider the special difficulties of the teachers, the general intelli- 
gence of the district, ete. 
The spirit of the new regulations was progressive, but in actual 
practice they accomplished less than was expected. Even the merit 
grant proved to bea means of increasing mechanical teaching, and was 
a special subject of complaint before the commission of 1886 appointed 
to inquire into the workings of the elementary school laws. An out- 
come of the recommendations of this commission was the code of 1890. 
| In this, for the first time, there was a radical departure from the sys- 
| tem of “payment upon results.” It allowed the larger proportion of   
 
-P-A-G-E-219
    EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. Ti 
the grant to be paid at a fixed ratio upon the basis of average attend- 
ance.! Moreover, the individual examination of all pupils was no longer 
demanded; instead, the inspector might examine the class in general 
or a few pupils, according to his judgment. The law of 1891 providing 
for the remission of school fees gave rise to some special regulations 
which were embodied in the code for 1892, but these were not in line 
with the movement here discussed. 
The last measures in the series that have emancipated the schools 
from a deadening routine are embodied in the regulations just issued for 
the year 1895. The most important of these has reference to the inspec- 
tion of schools. Heretofore the inspectors have made a rigid annual 
examination of every school on the Government list. From this ordeal 
schools that have reached a certain standard are now excused; in place 
of the formal examination there may be substituted two annual visits 
from the inspector, the visits to be made without notice. On these 
occasions the inspector is to test the instruction and the general condi- 
tion of the school, and from the notes taken at the time to make up his 
report of the school. If the report is satisfactory the school will be 
entitled to the full grant. Thus virtually ends the system of “ pay- 
ment upon results.” 
The regulations have also reduced the work required in the lower 
grades, introduced a special schedule for small schools (i. e., those with 
an average attendance below 60), and have placed cottage gardening 
as a subject of instruction for boys on the same basis as cookery, 
laundry, and dairy work for girls. Another provision which shows 
the tendency toward freer methods of instruction is that allowing the 
time spent by pupils during school hours in visiting museums, art gal- 
- leries, etc., to be counted as school attendance. It is stipulated that 
the visits shall be made under proper guidance. 
EVENING SCHOOLS. 
The measures.adopted for the development of evening schools show 
the same progressive spirit as those that are gradually transforming 
the day schools. The present ideal of evening schools is indicated 
by the new name applied to them, i. e., ‘““ Evening continuation schools.” 
Prior to the regulations of 1893 they were essentially elementary 
schools, conducted like the day schools upon a rigid system of payment 
for results. The spirit of the new regulations and the conditions 
‘Prior to 1890 the grant comprised four divisions in ‘‘schools for older scholars,” 
as follows: (1) A fixed grant of 4s. to 6s. per pupil. (2) A merit grant varying from 
1s. to 3s. per pupil, according to the inspector’s report. (8) A grant for the three ele- 
mentary subjects of instruction according to the number of pupils passing a satis- 
factory examination in each. (4) Various grants in class and specific subjects. The 
code of 1890 raised No. 1 from ds. to Gs. to 124s. to 1ds., made No. 2 a definite grant of 
1s. to 148. for good discipline and organization, and abolished No. 3. 
   
-P-A-G-E-220
  172 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
which have made them necessary are thus clearly summarized in the 
London Journal of Education (July 1, 1893): 
Mr. Acland’s! evening school code has not disappointed the hopes of those who 
expected bold and useful reforms. For the first time we are to have real continua- 
tion schools, and yet the new vice-president has had the advantage of the criticisms 
bestowed on the abortive attempt in the same direction of his predecessor. Indi- 
vidual examination is abolished and inspection without notice substituted; no 
scholar will henceforth be compelled to take the elementary subjects; adults may be 
freely admitted, and will earn grants; a variety of practical and recreative subjects 
have been recognized. The principle of the minute of 1892 is adopted in the appor- 
tionment of the variable grants, viz, that they shall depend on the number of 
hours’ instruction given in each subject, and this is extended to the fixed grant, pay- 
ment by average attendance being superseded. 
These are daring changes, but some of them had been long advocated by educa- 
tionalists. The cautious relaxation in 1890 of the old trammels had produced an 
immediate increase in the night schools, but the tradition that evening schools were 
for the three R’s was still too strong, and the increase has not been maintained. After 
our heavy expenditure on day school, children, we have allowed them to forget every- 
thing from the moment they have reached a standard where intelligence is begin- 
ning to be evoked. After a year or two at work, the ordinary London boy can not 
sum, his writing is atrocious, his grammar worse, his reading merely sufficient for 
comic cuts, 
Let us glance at the figures for London day and night schools. Taking the com- 
pulsory period, and assuming the children are in the day schools for eight years, i. e. 
from 5 to 13, the average number between those ages on the rolls for the last eight 
years is about 575,000. Last year there were enrolled in the evening schools 30,000 
boys and girls between 13 and 21. True, many of the 575,000 have died after leaving 
school, and there would be slight compensation by immigration, but one would 
suppose there would be now over 500,000 young people between 13 and 21 in London. 
The proportion in day continuation schools is, unhappily, very small. Further, of 
the 30,000 enrolled in the evening schools, an average of 10,000 only attended during 
the two winter sessions, and only half that number in the summer. The immense 
majority of our working lads and lassies are not carrying on their education at all 
during these valuable years. 5 
Mr. Acland wishes to have interesting schools to attract them and thorough teach- 
ing when they have come in. The most important of his new provisions is doubtless 
the abolition of the formal examination and payment by individual passes. For 
years we have been crying out against the cram to which teachers and pupils resorted. 
~ before the examination—a cram which was distastefnl and useless. We are now to 
haye an inspection of methods of teaching of general knowledge and intelligence. 
To prevent a slackness of work the inspector will reduce the variable grant from 
1s. 6d. to 1s. if both the actual teaching and its method are not thoroughly satis- 
factory. 
The fixed grant ought to be larger when paid, as is proposed, on each complete 
twelve hours of instruction, as it will enable us to disregard a falling off in numbers, 
and to continue to teach the earnest pupils whom we have previously sacrified to 
the necessity of keeping a high average attendance. 
The explanatory memorandum? also suggests that meetings can be lengthened, but 
after a day’s work it is unwise to exact too long a time for instruction. We must 
not omit to note that, under article 14, a limit of grant is fixed on the basis of aver- 
age attendance; but we hope the department has calculated that this will not nullify 
the change and prevent our opening more frequently for special subjects, and allow- 
ing pupils to attend only some of these.

For the fixed grant time is recognized, though spent over subjects for which no 
variable grant can be given—e. g., drawing, manual training, physical exercises, and 
housewifery. It is evident from the exordium and from the fifth article (which 
provides that these may be given on other premises if necessary) that it is desired 
to encourage these. 
The following citations from the code and appendixes give in outline 
the programme for the evening schools, also the expanded programme in 
English subjects, and in detail the section pertaining to civic instrue- 
tion. To this is added the explanatory memorandum in which the pur- 
poses of the Government in respect to these schools are more fully 
expressed. 
It should be added that corresponding changes have been made in 
the regulations for evening schools in Scotland.

making genuine progress in the subjects taught. 
12. The annual grant becomes due at the end of the school year, and is paid as 
soon as may be after that date. 
13. The annual grant is made up of the several grants, which, with their amounts, 
are enumerated below: 
(a) A fixed grant calculated as follows: All the hours during which each regis- 
, tered scholar has received secular instruction (articles 6 and 7) during the 
school year shall be added together, and a grant of 1s. shall be paid for

twenty hours in cooking with her own hands. 
The time for cookery must be entered in the time-table, and should not be 
less than a continuous hour or hour and a half at any meeting; provided

means of obtaining a certificate, the certificate above mentioned shall not 
be required, but the competency of the teacher must be proved to the 
satisfaction of the department. (2) For the purpose of demonstration, 
not more than three classes of 18 scholars may be present, provided the 
inspector reports that the number present may be conveniently accommo- 
dated; but for the ten or twenty hours required for cooking with their 
own hands (during which time no demonstration lesson can be given) not 
more than 18 scholars shall be taught at the same time by one teacher. 
(d) Where the inspector reports that special and appropriate provision has been 
made for the practical teaching of laundry work by a teacher recognized 
by the department as qualified te teach that subject, a grant of 2s. is

by the total number of hours during which the school has been open during the same 
period.

1.—LirE aND DuTIES OF THE CITIZEN. 
It is our business carefully to cultivate in our minds, to rear to the most perfect vigor and matur- 
ity, every sort of generous and honest feeling that belongs to our nature. To bring the dispositions 
that are lovely in private life into the service and conduct of the Commonwealth—so to be patriots 
as not to forget we are gentlemen. * * * Public lifo is a situation of power and energy; he tres- 
passes against his duty who sleeps upon his watch, as well as he that goes over to the enemy. 
(Burke: Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents.) 
[This syllabus touches only on certain limited aspects of the public life of the 
citizen. Various important considerations are therefore omitted which teachers will 
no doubt discuss in dealing with the subject. 
The subject as here set out will be found difficult to teach, except to those older 
scholars who are in the habit of reading and thinking intelligently about public 
affairs. For the instruction of such students the general outline here given may be 
of service to teachers, though it covers more ground than can be dealt with even in 
two or three courses. The teacher will select that part which is most appropriate to 
the circumstances and needs of the school and the locality. For younger scholars a 
much simpler form of syllabus should be prepared from which the more technical 
treatment of the machinery of local and central government should be omitted.

o the history of and reasons for our local and national institutions and our responsi- 
ilities in connection with them.

his subject.] 
INTRODUCTION. 
What the citizen should aim at in the interest of his country. 
Public duties accompany all forms of work in life, whatever the occupation or 
rofession. 
Serving personal interest alone is not enough. 
The individual benefits from a well-ordered community. The community ought to 
enefit in its turn from the efforts of the individual. ‘All for each” should be 
equited by ‘“‘each for all.” 
The reasons for attachment to our country and for a sense of duty toward our 
ellow-citizens are similar to those for love of home and family. Loyalty to one’s 
wn village or town should lead to a larger patriotism. Those who are growing up 
nto citizenship should realize their debt to the men and women who have served 
he nation generously and wisely in the past, and their own duty to their country in 
he present. Self-interest and class interest should be subordinate to general and 
ational interests. 
The nation and the state—What they mean. Difference between representative 
overnment and despotic government. Responsibilities involved in representative 
overnment.

ing citizen should add to the wealth of the community. Relation of skill and

-P-A-G-E-228
  180 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
The importance to the nation of effective, honest, and intelligent management of 
all forms of business and industry. The disasters which result from mismanagement 
or fraud. 
The duty of the community to sympathize with every reasonable effort of the 
workers to improve their condition and develop their intelligence. That which 
injures their efficiency or lessens their hopefulness leads to national loss and to the 
maintenance or increase of poverty and ignorance. A healthy and skillful body of 
workers, upright in character and self-reliant, is a source of strength to the country. 
Faithful discharge of homelier duties of life is the best preparation for their dis- 
charge in city and nation. Civic duty begins in the life of the family, expands with 
occupation in trade, business, and profession. 
In earning their livelihood men and women also serve their fellow-citizens and 
their country. Membership of self-governing societies is among the best means of 
civic education. 
As intelligence, honor, and virtue are essential to the welfare of the family, so is 
patriotism necessary to national and social life. We have to recognize that our 
public responsibilities are duties as much as personal and family obligations. We 
have no right to expect just legislation or impartial administration unless we per- 
form with intelligence those public duties which devolve upon all. If we suffer 
injustice in connection with public affairs, we have little right to complain unless we 
have done our own duty. 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM. 
I. The objects contemplated in the evening continuation school code are: 
(a) To give freedom to managers in the organization of their schools. 
(b) To offer to managers and teachers a wide choice of subjects adapted to the 
various needs of scholars and districts. 
(c) To suggest, both concisely and in detail, courses of instruction in these 
subjects. 
(d) To enable managers to combine instruction in subjects for which grants are 
paid by the State with instruction in other subjects for which no such 
grants are paid, but which it may be for special reasons desirable to include 
in the curriculum. 
II. The following are the principal changes now introduced: 
(a) The attendances of persons over 21 years of age will henceforth be recog- 
nized. 
(b) No scholar will henceforth be compelled to take the elementary subjects. 
(c) Further precautions are taken to avoid duplication of grants by the educa- 
tion department and the science and art department. 
(d) Grants will be paid as in day schools for the instruction of the school as a 
whole instead of, as formerly, for the attainments of individual scholars. 
(e) The fixed grant is no longer paid on the average attendance, but on the aggre- 
gate number of hours’ instruction received by the scholars. This will give 
a direct encouragement to the prolongation of evening school sessions and 
the lengthening of meetings. 
(f) Instead of grants for individual passes, grants will now be paid for time 
devoted to each subject, the amount of such grant being dependent on the 
value of the instruction given. 
(g) Examination by the inspector on a fixed day is abolished and visits of inspec- 
tion without notice are substituted. 
III. The new regulations are designed generally to meet the requirements of schol- 
ars who are no longer subject to the law of compulsory attendance at school and who
-P-A-G-E-229

desire to prolong their education, either in the ordinary school subjects or in some 
special subjects in order to fit themselves for some industrial career. Evening con- 
tinuation schools will have to meet various needs, as, for instance: 
| (a) The case of the smaller schools, which are intended mainly to supply defects in 
early elementary instruction and to continue such instruction with a view 
to the ordinary pursuits of daily life. 
(b) The case of schools, especially in the more populous districts, in which the 
general education of the scholar is prolonged and combined with some form 
of useful and interesting employment. 
(c) The case where the principal part of the work will be preparatory to the 
special studies directed by the science and art department or to lectures 
established by the county councils, university extension lectures, or other 
forms of secondary or higher education. 
IV. The duties of Her Majesty’s inspector in giving effect to the provisions of the 
evening continuation school code will be: 
(a) To visit without notice, on one occasion at least, and if possible on more than 
one, at some time at which the school is shown by the time-table to be at 
work, every school for which a grant is claimed, and to devote if possible 
to the inspection the whole time of one meeting of such school. 
(b) To confer with the managers, whose presence, if it can be obtained, is very 
desirable, and with the teachers; to ascertain that due arrangements have 
been made for securing accurate registration of attendance; to examine the 
registers and time-tables, and to report on the qualifications of the teachers 
and the course of instruction. 
(ec) To hear lessons and observe the manner in which the classes are conducted; to 
question the scholars on the work which has been done in at least two of 
the subjects taught in the school, and to report generally on the instruction. 
(d) To satisfy himself that the schoolrooms are suitable for their purpose, bearing 
in mind the importance of an adequate supply of artificial light. 
(e) To recommend what variable grant (if any) should be paid, having due regard 
to the opinion he has formed upon the general character of the teaching 
and the particular methods employed. The higher of the two grants will 
not be paid for any subject unless the inspector is able to report that both 
the actual teaching of the subjects and the methods employed in such 
teaching are thoroughly satisfactory. 
V. My Lords will be interested to learn from the reports of Her Majesty’s inspectors 
the results of any successful experiments by which evening continuation schools 
have been rendered more attractive, e. g.—by means of lantern illustrations, music, 
manual work, discussion of some book which has been read by the class; field, nat- 
uralist, or sketching clubs; gymnastics, or other employments of a more or less 
recreative character. For many of these purposes grants of public money can not 
be given, but, provided that the managers take care that at least one hour at each 
meeting is devoted to the teaching of the subjects mentioned in article 2 of the 
code, and that the instruction is systematic and thorough, every arrangement for 
making the school attractive should be carefully considered. For instance, besides 
the introduction of some of the recreative subjects mentioned above, encourage- 
ment might be given to capable lecturers to deliver from time to time short lec- 
tures, well illustrated, in connection with some of the subjects in the school time- 
table. 
VI. Unless special efforts are made to encourage those who are leaving the day 
school to continue their education at evening schools, the chances of success in the 
evening schools will be much diminished. Care should therefore be taken to give 
full information to such scholars of the times and places at which evening continu- 
ation schools are held. With this object the managers of those schools should put 
themselves in communication with the managers of the neighboring day schools,

VII. My Lords will be glad to know from time to time of any special difficulties 
which appear to be connected with the work of evening continuation schools with a 
view to their being lessened or removed. They attach a very high importance to 
the work which may be done under this code, as effective continuation schools sup- 
ply one of the most important means for turning to better account than at present 
the money and time now spent in the day schools, 
In connection with the survey of the elementary schools. of Great 
Britain, it is not out of place to consider the agencies created by the 
Government for the restraint and correction of vicious and lawless 
youth. The following citation from a recent article by Mr. A. A. W. 
Drew, who has been officially engaged in the work, will put the reader 
in possession of its salient features. To this statement is added a 
short extract from a recent article touching the new lines of educa- 
tional work which have been assumed by the London County council 
in its effort to rescue the slum population: 
INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS AND JUVENILE CRIME. 
About the year 1866—i. e., four years before the introduction of the school board 
system which gave new life to the work of public elementary education in England— 
a great wave of doubt had passed over the minds of our senators, which made them 
question whether the old plan of committing juvenile offenders to prisons or to 
reformatories was either a wise or a judicious one; and the result was the introduc- 
tion into Parliament ef a bill to deal with that question, and the passing of an act, 
known as the industrial schools act, which made a great change in our method of 
dealing with youthful criminals. 
In 1869, the year before the first school board act was passed, as many as 10,314 
juvenile criminals, under the age of 16 years, were committed to prisons in England; 
while the last completed returns—viz, those for 1891—show that in that year only 
8,855 were so committed, Also,in 1869 there were sent on to reformatories 1,331 
children, of whom 1,075 were boys and 256 were girls; while in the year 1891 there 
. were only 1,020 children committed to reformatories, of whom 885 were boys and 
135 were girls. What had become of the balance of juvenile criminals from 1869 to 
1891, so that the number sent to prisons or reformatories had decreased from 10,314 
in the former year to 3,855 in the latter? Is it true that education, by a curative 
process, had largely diminished the number of such children, notwithstanding the 
enormous increase in the population of the country? 
Of late years there has sprung up, under the fostering influence of the industrial 
schools act of 1866, a large number of schools, differing absolutely from prisons and 
very widely from reformatories, known as “certified industrial schools.” In 1866 
there were in this country, not including Scotland, only 57 such schools, contain- 
ing a total of 2,566 children, of whom 1,893 were boys and 673 girls. In 1861 there 
were in Great Britain 153 certified industrial schools, containing 23,688 children, 
of whom 19,292 were boys and 4,396 girls. These numbers include those detained 
in truant schools under the elementary education act, and also in certified day 
industrial schools; so that it will be seen that although the number of children 
committed to prisons and reformatories has decreased, the numbers in industrial 
schools has increased from 2,566 in the year 1866 to 23,688 in the year 1891. 
From this it will be seen that public elementary education has not yet reformed 
our juvenile criminals, only that the policy of the country has transferred them 
from prisons or reformatories to industrial schools. Even this isa great step to have 
taken, but the same policy requires to be vigorously followed up by the removal of 
those blots which still remain as hindrances to the reformation of youthful offenders. 
And this our Parliament alone can bring about by legislation.
-P-A-G-E-231
    EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 183 
The fact of the matter is that, short of Utopia, there must of necessity exist for 
corrective, industrial, and educational purposes a graduated series of establishments 
suitable for the many varying cases which come under treatment. 
After nearly thirty years of close acquaintance with the juvenile population of 
this great metropolis, I have no hesitation in saying that truancy is to be credited 
with nearly the whole of our juvenile criminality, and that if much more energetic 
steps were taken to deal with our young truants, the list of convictions for criminal 
offenses would be very largely reduced, and in my opinion it is well worth while 
seriously to make the attempt. 
The percentage of truants cured by a single short visit to a well-managed truant 
school has already been given as 80 per cent, and, to take the latest return of tho 
home office, the percentage of industrial school children in 1891 who have passed 
through these schools, and are now reported as doing well, is, for boys, 85.5 per cenv, 
and for girls, 84 per cent; thus incidentally showing, what actually is the fact, that - 
the reformation of a bad boy is just a shade easier than that of a bad girl. 
The industrial schools amendment act of 1880 is a most useful one, especially as 
regards girls; and I marvel to find that so very little use is made of it. I can only 
say that our committee never neglects to deal promptly with any case which comes 
before it under this act, which adds to section 14 this further condition under which 
a child may be sent to an industrial school, “‘thatis lodging, living, or residing with 
common or reputed prostitutes, or in a house resided in or frequented by prostitutes 
for the purpose of prostitution, or that frequents the company of prostitutes.” 
Yet another very useful act is that of 1891. It is entitled ‘‘An act to assist the 
managers of reformatory and industrial schools in advantageously launching into 
useful careers the children under their charge,” and its provisions authorize the 
managers of all such schools, with the child’s own consent, and, if necessary, without 
the parents’ consent, ‘‘to apprentice him to or dispose of him in any trade, calling, or 
service, or by emigration, notwithstanding that his period of detention has not 
expired, and such apprenticing or disposition shall be as valid as if the managers 
were his parents.” But in the case of emigration the consent of the home secretary 
must also be obtained. (Andrew A. W. Drew, Contemporary Review, May, 1893, 
732-742.) 
TECHNICAL EDUCATION UNDER THE LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL, 
If it be asked what new thing the present council has done, apart from extending 
the first council’s work, I think we may with some confidence refer to the starting 
of its department of technical education. The circumstances of London differ so 
much from those of other cities and counties, the difficulties and complications of 
its educational problems are so great, the chaos of uncoordinated authorities is so 
bewildering, that the first council may well be excused for not immediately adding 
technical education to allits other duties. But the second council grappled with 
the problem in its very first summer. Having been, from the outset, the chairman 
of the special committee and then the technical education board, to which the 
council has delegated its educational functions, I am disqualified from expressing 
any opinion as to the success of this new departure, but I think it will be admitted 
that we have made good use of our time. The technical education board, which 
carries on this part of the council’s work, has already established a comprehensive 
“scholarship ladder,” from the board school right up to the highest technical col- 
lege, the best art schools, and the university. It has done much, by its liberal grants 
and skilled inspection, to develop and improve the various ‘‘polytechnics” now 
growing all over the metropolis. Under the expert guidance of Dr. Garnett it has 
worked a beneficent revolution in evening science and technology classes, and made | 
more practical the instruction in these subjects given in the public secondary 
schools; whilst the London schools of art are, under its fostering care, springing 
into new life. By the appointment, as its art advisers, of such expert craftsmen as 
Mr. George Frampton, A. R. A., and Mr. William Lethaby, a distinguished sculptor 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
184 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
and ano less distinguished architect, the board has shown how keenly it is alive to 
the need for a thorough reorganization of the ‘arts and crafts” side, and we need 
not now despair of London one day possessing a municipal art school to rival that 
of Birmingham. Nor have the women and girls been forgotteu. Besides sharing in 
all the preceding advantages, they enjoy a special department of. their own. The 
board has set up three ‘schools of domestic economy” (shortly to be increased to 
five), which intercept the maidens of thirteen who would otherwise be leaving 
school to “take a little place.” It has started at Battersea a domestic economy train- 
ing school which is already turning out skilled teachers accustomed to the house- 
keeping of the London poor; and, by a permanent staff of qualified instructors in 
cookery, dressmaking, laundry work, and hygiene, it has given thousands of lessons 
in these subjects to groups of workingwomen in all parts of London, who are too 
old or too poor, too hard worked or too apathetic, to take advantage of any exist- 
ing institutions. (Sidney Webb, Contemporary Review, January, 1895, pp. 141-142.) 
UNIVERSITY COLLEGES AIDED BY THE GOVERNMENT. 
The report of the Commissioner for 1891-92 gave an account of recent 
provision for technical instruction developed in the chief industrial cen- 
ters of Great Britain. Along with this movement, and in many cases inti- 
mately connected with it, is the establishment of university colleges— 
that is, colleges which maintain the courses of instruction required 
for degree examinations (usually of London University) or which are 
affiliated with Durham or Victoria universities. In 1889, Parliament 
allowed a grant of £15,000 ($75,000) to these colleges, a policy which 
has been renewed each succeeding year. In consideration of this allow- 
ance the colleges participating in the £15,000, and also the three col- 
leges in Wales which receive from the treasury an annual grant of 
£4,000 each, were invited in 1893 to furnish a report to the education 
- department. This was to comprise in each case a historical outline, a 
statement of the constitution and purposes of the college, and its pres- 
ent status. The statements submitted have been published asa report 
of the Department, and from this source the following tabulated par- 
ticulars are derived. Of the colleges included it may be said that, 
while they present great divergence in respect to origin, government, 
endowment, and facilities, they have certain common characteristics. 
They have all arisen in response to the need of a wider diffusion of 
higher education than is possible through the agency of Oxford and 
Cambridge alone, coupled with the equally urgent demand for special 
training in the applications of science and the methods of scientific 
research. 
As will be seen by reference to the table, women share freely in the 
provisions of these colleges. With regard to the showing in the table 
as to scholarships, it should be said that both items given, i.e, the 
number and the annual value of the scholarships, are approximates 
only. From the nature of the data presented in the original report 
exact statements are impossible. In several instances free scholarships 
are mentioned, of which neither the number nor the money equivalent 
is specified; in others, one or the other item is given, but not both.  
-P-A-G-E-233
    EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 185 
Again, a scholarship is sometimes available in any one of two or more 
colleges, according to the choice of the successful competitor, so that 
there may be even duplication of funds in the tabulation, but this could 
occur in a few instances only. The showing, with all imperfections, is 
important, as it gives a fairly clear idea of the provision for higher 
education available for young men and women of marked ability, but 
who could not otherwise afford the expense of advanced instruction, 
In England, where free high schools are almost unknown and free 
universities entirely so, the provision of endowed or of free scholar- 
ships is a matter of great public moment. It should be added that 
while in the majority of instances the scholarships secure tuition in the 
colleges to which they pertain, a few are intended to secure university 
advantages for the holders.

188 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
The system of public education in France has been considered very 
fully in the three preceding reports of the Commissioner. Every year 
sees some modification in the details, but the essential features of the 
system remain unchanged. Characterized in brief, it is a highly cen- 
tralized system under the direction of the minister of public instruc- 
tion, fine arts, and worship.! His control is exercised through a 
graded series of appointed officials belonging to the central adminis- 
tration or to the académies (17 in number, including 1 in Algiers), 
which are the local subdivisions of the system. Public instruction is 
a state service, professors and teachers constituting a professional order 
whose qualifications, duties, privileges, honors, emoluments, and penal- 
ties are as rigidly fixed by law as those of other branches of the civil 
or those of the military service. 
Professional judgment and experience are brought to bear upon the 
conduct of the system through the councils, i. e., the superior and 
academic, the majority of whose members are chosen by their peers 
from the several teaching orders. 
The public scholastic institutions are grouped in three classes— 
superior, secondary, primary— corresponding to three departments of 
the central administration. The affairs of each are separately admin- 
istered. On the scholastic side the secondary and superior institutions 
are closely coordinated; the course of study of the primary schools is 
also made continuous with the modern secondary course. Private 
institutions flourish side by side with the public; the former are also 
subject to the general supervision of the minister and his agents. 
The principal statistics of public and private instruction, as presented 
in the latest official reports, are given in the foregoing summary. The 
summaries relating to primary instruction are from the latest volume 
prepared by the commission on the statistics of primary instruction. 
The same report is the source of the detailed information which follows. 
The particulars considered are such as show the progress or the actual 
efficiency of the schools in respect to matters of general interest. 
Before proceeding with the statistical analysis it may be well to note 
that the commission, whose report is here reviewed, was constituted in 
the ministry of public instruction and fine arts, March 15, 1876, and has 
issued altogether five reports. The first, bearing date 1878, covered the 
school year 1876-77; the second, 1880, presented in comparative view 
all the statistics that had been collected from 1829 to 1877, inclusive; 
the third and fourth covered, respectively, the years 1881-82 and 1886-87. 
The present volume deals with the year 1891-92 and also with the quin- 
quennial period 1887-1892, These successive reports have been pub- 
lished in the years of the quinquennial census, an arrangement which 
facilitates the comparisons between the school population and school 
attendance. 
IM. Poincaré was appointed to the office January 26, 1895, replacing M. Leygues, 
who had been appointed the June preceding. January 27, 1895, the ministry of 
worship was attached to the province of this minister.  
-P-A-G-E-237
  EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 189 
In the intervening years the minister of public instruction has pub- 
lished an annual summary of the state of primary instruction, The 
sources of information for these annuals, as also for the more detailed 
quinquennials, are chiefly the annual statement submitted by the 
primary inspectors (450 in number) for their respective districts and 
by the academic inspectors of each department. These are collated by 
the central commission. The financial statistics are drawn in the same 
way from the annual accounts of the prefects of departments and the 
detailed statements of receipts and expenditures prepared annually for 
the Government. 
PRIMARY SCHOOLS, CLASSIFICATION AND SUPPLY. 
The classes of primary schools recognized under the law of October 
30, 1885, are infant schools (écoles maternelles) for children 2 to 6 years 
of age, elementary primary schools for children of the obligatory 
school period, 6 to 13 years of age, and superior primary or high schools. 
Every commune must support at least one public primary school unless 
especially authorized to combine for this purpose with another com- 
mune (law of 1833), and every commune of 500 inhabitants must main- 
tain a separate school for girls (law of April 10, 1867) unless authorized 
to substitute a mixed school (for boys and girls.) 
The extent to which these requirements have been met in 1891-92, and 
comparison in this respect with 1886-87, are shown by the following 
statistics:

From the foregoing table it is evident that the provision of public 
schools increases. Only 50, or one-tenth per cent of the whole number 
of communes, remain to be brought into compliance with the law. The 
provision of separate schools for girls accords with the sentiments 
which long adherence to the Catholic Church has fostered in the 
common people of France. The number of communes making such 
provision exceeds the number coming under the provisions of the law 
of 1867, although a few communes having the required population have 
not fulfilled the law.  
-P-A-G-E-238
    190 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
The table refers to the elementary primary schools (i. e., for children 
of the obligatory school ages, 6 to 13). It may be added that the 
establishment of an infant school (école maternelle) is obligatory only 
for communes having a population above 2,000 inhabitants, of whom 
at least 1,200 are collected at one center. The number of such com- 
munes is about 8,000 and the number of infant schools 5,411 (public, 
2,603; private, 2,808). In reality, the commission say less than 3,000 
communes are without an infant school or an infant class attached to 
a@ primary school. 
School enrollment.—The enrollment in primary schools (public and 
private) is for France alone, 5,471,402; for Algiers, 85,068; total, 5,556,- 
470. Since 1886-87 there has been a loss of 40, 000, on seven- tontlis 
per cent, in the total enrollment, and of 54,963, or iiostonths per cent, 
in that of France alone. To understand the bearing of this fact it will 
be necessary to follow the report in its analysis of school population 
and enrollment. In this consideration Algiers is omitted.!_ The enroll- 
ment for France is equivalent to 14.35 per cent of the population (actu- 
ally present, census 1891), as against 14.72 per cent of the population 
enrolled in 1886-87. Part of the loss in enrollment is accounted for 
by the relative diminution of the school population (i. e., ages 6 to 13), 
which was only 12.1 per cent of the total population in 1891, as against 
12.4 per cent in 1886. While the actual population of obligatory school 
age (6 to 13) was 4,663,671 in 1891, the enrollment for those ages in the 
primary schools was 4,408,268. The enrollment for the same ages in 
the infant schools (113,892) and in the elementary departments of sec- 
ondary schools (64,413) brings the total to 4,586,573, about 77,000 less 
than the population of the ages specified. Of these 5,000 were known 
to be receiving instruction at home. As to the remainder, a little above 
1 per cent of the school population, it is not to be supposed that they 
have never been or will not be instructed. The laws regulating child 
labor,’ together with the law of es education, form an effectual 
1 For obvious reasons comparisons between etena enrollment and population in 
Algiers would be valueless, so far as European countries are concerned. 
2 The diminution in the ratio of school population to total population is attributed 
by the report to the low rate of births and to immigration, which is almost wholly 
of adults. That the ratio is below the average of other countries would be explained 
by the same reasons, with the added consideration of the strong vitality of the 
French adult population. 
3(France. Law of June 2, 1874). Children below 10 years and girls below 21 years 
shall not be employed in any work on Sundays by their patrons, in manufactories, 
mines, wood (or dock) yards, and workshops. In workshops where constant fires are 
kept up children may be employed on Sundays and holidays in indispensable work 
conformably to the public administrative regulations. 
(a) Children shall not be employed in any kind of work before having completed 
their tenth year. 
(b) Restrictions with respect to children from the beginning of their eleventh year

safeguard against illiteracy, provided they be enforced. The machinery 
for enforcing the laws exists; nevertheless, the opinion is expressed in 
the report of the commission that in some localities the authorities 
have relaxed their vigilance in these matters. It is further suggested 
that discrepancies between the census and the school tabulations may 
have arisen from different constructions of the age limits. It is evi- 
dent that a portion of the children of school age not enrolled belong to 
the floating population (mariners and foreign merchants), passing from 
school to school, one day here and another there, and being actually 
registered nowhere. That there is quite a large contingent of such 
children appears from the fact that certain localities have established 
special schools for them. The number of children under 6 years of 
age enrolled in the elementary primaries is 545,706 and in the infant 
schools 567,856, a total of 1,113,562, just about 41 per cent of the whole 
population of those ages. Of youth 13 to 16 years of age, 525,055, or 
23 per cent of the census number, were on the rolls of the primary 
schools. 
From comparison of the statistics for 1891-92 with those of 1886-87, 
it appears, (1) as regards children of the obligatory school age (6-13), 
that the census shows a decline of 1.4 per cent between 1886 and 1891, 
  
1. No child must be employed unless it be shown that he actually attends a public 
or private school. 
2. Children of this age must not be employed except in industries specially des- 
ignated by a public administrative regulation (spinning factories of all classes, 
twisting work, printing on cloth, paper industries, glass manufacturing work, etc.). 
8. Children shall not be subjected to work for any length of time exceeding six 
hours a day. 
4, The working hours must be divided by a recess. 
5. Children shall not be employed in any kind of night work. All work between 
9 o’clock in the evening and 5 o’clock in the morning is considered night work. 
6. They shall not be employed in work on Sundays or legal holidays, 
(c) Restrictions with respect to children from the beginning of their thirteenth 
year until their fourteenth year complete: 
1. They shall not be employed more than twelve hours a day. Before the age of 
15 years complete, no child shall be permitted to work more than six hours a day 
except it be proved that he has acquired an elementary primary school education. 
2. The working hours shall be divided by recesses. 
3. They shall not be employed in any night work. 
4, They shall likewise not be employed in any work on Sundays or legal holidays. 
5. The work of children in subterranean passages is not permitted, except under 
the special conditions determined by the public administrative regulations. 
(d) Exceptions: 
1, In workshops where continued fires are maintained children may be employed 
at night or on Sundays and holidays in work determined by the public administrative 
regulations. 
2. The public administrative regulations determine the different kinds of work 
which, because they are sources of danger to children or exceed their strength, are 
prohibited. 
8. Children can not be employed in the manufactories and workshops indicated in 
the official list of unhealthy or dangerous establishments except under the special 
conditions set forth by the public administrative regulation.

and the school registers (all classes of schools included) a loss in enroll- 
ment of 3.3 per cent during thesametime. This diminution has occurred 
wholly in public schools, the private primary schools showing an 
increase of 14 per cent in their enrollment. (2) The census shows a 
diminution of 3.8 per cent in the number of children from 2 to6 years, 
inclusive, with only a decline of one-tenth per cent in the number of 
those ages enrolled in infant and in primary schools. (3) As regards 
youth above the obligatory school age, or from 13 to 16, there is shown 
an increase of 4.2 per cent between the census of 1886 and 1891 and an 
increase of 8.3 per cent in the number enrolled in primary schools (chiefly 
superior primary). The enrollment for these ages in 1891-92 was 25.5 
per cent of the total population of these ages, as against 24.5 per cent 
in 1887, 
DISTRIBUTION OF PUPILS IN VARIOUS CLASSES OF SCHOOLS. 
The distribution of pupils in the various classes of schools is inter- 
esting as an index of the social influences affecting them. Here are to 
be considered the distribution in mixed and in separate schools for 
boys and girls and in secular (lay) and church schools. In these con- 
siderations Algiers is included. Under the first head it appears that 
for every 1,000 pupils enrolled in public primary schools 166 were on 
an average in mixed schools in 1891-92 (165 in 1886-87). At both 
dates 54 per cent of the pupils in mixed schools were boys and 46 
per cent girls. In the private primary schools the proportion of 
pupils in mixed schools is much less, i. ¢., only 26 on an average in 
every 1,000. Here the proportion of girls is higher than that of boys, 
i. e., 61 per cent, as against 39 per cent. The fact of a slight increase 
in the enrollment in mixed private schools (9 per cent since 1887) 
indicates at least that the prejudice against coeducation for children is 
not increasing. 
The following table shows for the first and last years of the quin- 
quennial period the distribution of pupils in secular and in church 
schools, public and private:

From an examination of the above tables it appears that the relative 
ratios of pupils in secular schools and in church schools were very 
nearly the same at the end as at the beginning of the period, being for 
the secular schools 70 per cent in 1891-92, as against 69.5 per cent in 
1887-88, and in church schools 30 per cent and 30.6 per cent at the 
respective dates. The proportion of the pupils in the public secular 
schools varied slightly, the former gaining about 1 per cent and the 
latter losing one-half per cent on the total enrollment. In the churck 
schools, on the other hand, the changes are more marked, public church. 
schools losing above 4 per cent on the total enrollment, while private 
church schools gained 3 per cent. It appears that the loss in the enroll- 
ment of public church schools was very largely due to the transfer of 
boys to private schools, church and secular. This movement is an out- 
come of the execution of the clause of the law of October 30, 1886, 
relative to the “laicization” of schools; in other words, substituting 
lay teachers for those belonging to religious orders. 
It was ordered that the law should be carried into effect with respect 
to all schools for boys in five years from its passage; that is, by Octo- 
ber, 1891, whereas no limit was put to the time in the case of schools. 
for girls. The ratios of actual gain or loss in the several classes of 
schools in the period considered, 1887-88 to 1891-92, are shown in the:

Average attendance.—The statistics of enrollment are of first impor- 
tance as showing the actual spread of instruction. The details of the 
classification of pupils are interesting as an index of the relative 
strength of public and private schools. Neither of these particulars, 
however, gives any idea of the hold which the schools have upon the 
pupils. This, indeed, it is difficult to express by statistics; the item 
which bears most directly upon the subject, i. e., average attendance, 
does not seem to be kept at all in the registers of French schools. In 
place of this an enumeration is made from time to time, under the order 
ED 94——13  
-P-A-G-E-242
  104 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94, 
of the minister, of the actual number of pupils present on two days, 
one in the season of highest attendance, the other in the season of 
lowest attendance. Such enumeration was made at the beginning and 
at the end of the quinquennial period, with results as follows: : 
For every 1,000 pupils enrolled there were present on the days 
specified:

Public a 786 719 | 801 720° 
Private - \ 
\ 865 849 | 879 866. 
  
These conclusions are supported by this showing: 
(1) That the attendance in December is greater than in June, a fact 
easily explained, as in the latter month many pupils are withdrawn to 
work in the fields. 
(2) That the average attendance was not so high in 1891-92 as in 
1886-87. 
(3) That average attendance is higher in the private than in the 
public schools. This difference is attributed by the report to the more 
favorable situation of the private schools, which are found chiefly in the 
cities and towns. 
High schools and classes (Keoles primaires supérieures et cours com- 
plémentaires).—By a law of January 26, 1892, the superior primary 
schools, in which industrial or commercial training is the predominant 
feature, were transferred to the jurisdiction of the minister of commerce 
and industry, and are henceforth to be known as practical schools 
of commerce and of industry. The number of schools so transferred 
was 14, of which 12 were for boys and 2 for girls. They numbered, 
December 31, 1891, a total of 1,916 pupils, i. e., 1,511 boys and 405 girls. 
There remain under the joint authority of the minister of commerce 
and the minister of public instruction 43 superior primary schools (32 
for boys, 11 for girls) and 4 complementary courses (3 for boys, 1 for 
girls) in which technical instruction is given, but does not form a prin- 
cipal feature. There are in addition under the jurisdiction of the min- 
ister of public instruction 259 superior primary or high schools, and 
1,009 complementary courses for general instruction. Of the schools, 
21 are private establishments, and of the courses, 531. This leaves 238 
public high schools (not technical) and 478 courses. The statistics of 
these schools and courses are included in the totals already considered. 
They comprised in 1891-92 an enrollment of 45,599 pupils (32,806 boys, 
12,793 girls), as against 38,441 in 1886-87. Of the total, 41,844, or 91 
per cent, were in public establishments. Paris furnished 5,659 pupils 
in this grade, or one-tenth of the whole—a slight increase over its 
proportion at the beginning of the decade. 
Of the public high schools, 101 have a two. years’ course and 180 a 
three years’ course. Provision is made by scholarship funds (bourses) 
 
-P-A-G-E-243

for aiding promising pupils who could not otherwise continue their 
studies in the high schools. The number of pupils so aided in 1891-92 
was 1,110 (674 boys, 436 girls). 
- Yeachers—The total teaching force of the primary schools was 
155,427. Of these, 8,753 (all women) were in the infant schools, 5,100 
in the public, and 3,613 in the private schools of this class. As to the 
146,674 teachers in the primary schools proper (elementary and supe- 
rior), 70 per cent were in the public schools and 30 per cent in the 
private. Of the former, 54 per cent were men, as against 56 per cent 
in 1886-87. Of the latter, 24 per cent, as against 21 per cent at the 
earlier date. : 
The classification of the teachers with respect to position and secular 
or clerical relations are set forth in the following table:

The number of principals, i. e., of teachers directing a school (82,454), 
is not quite equal to the number of schools (82,533). This discrepancy 
is explained by the fact that the superior primaries or high schools, 
which are comprised in the total of the schools, are in several instances 
in charge of the same principal as a lower grade school. It is notice- 
able also that the total of all teachers, principals, and assistants is a 
little greater than the total number of classes—102,486 as against 
100,815. This is due to the fact that in schools comprising as many as 
six classes and 300 pupils the principal is not charged with a partie- 
ular class. 
The law provides that mixed schools may be directed by either a 
master or a mistress. The greater proportion of masters employed in 
these schools, i.e., 70 per cent of the total, is explained, the report says, 
by the desire of the mayors of small communes to secure their services 
as secretaries.

, 
As already indicated, there is, as a rule, a distinet teacher for each 
class inaschool. An interesting view of the relation of teachers to 
the work of the schools is afforded by statistics showing the aver- 
age number of pupils to a class. From these it appears that 88.9 per 
cent of the classes do not exceed 50 pupils. In 1887 this proportion 
was 84.8 per cent. The increased proportion of lay teachers in the 
public primaries and the reverse movement, i. e., increase in the pro- 
portion of church teachers in the private primaries, are due to the 
same causes as the transfer of pupils from secular to church schools 
already considered.

  -In respect to the above showing it should be explained that teachers 
without a professional diploma may have an equivalent or higher guar- 
anty of preparation in a university degree, i. e., the baccalaureate, or 
even, as is the case with many teachers in the superior primaries, the 
“licencié” or the doctor’s degree. In fact all the men in charge of a 
school in 1891-92 had either a teacher’s diploma or a degree, while of 
the women principals less than 12 per cent were without diplomas. 
The decrease in the proportion of assistant teachers not provided 
with diplomas, which was noticeable in 1887 as compared with 1882, 
has continued during the last half of the decade, amounting to a 
decrease of 15 per cent in the case of men and of 4.2 per cent in that 
of women. As might be expected, the proportion of teachers in the 
public schools having diplomas is larger than of those in private schools, 
i. e., 98 per cent, as against 82 per cent. The proportion is, however, 
increasing in the private schools. 
For the full title of teacher (titulaire) a diploma (certificat d’aptitude 
pédagogique) higher than the “brevets” is required. This diploma can 
not be obtained without at least two years’ actual practice in teaching. 
The proportion of teachers possessed of the same increases aS shown 
by the following table:

EDUCATION IN FRANCE, 197 
Under the law of July 19, 1889, the State pays the salaries of primary 
teachers. Principal teachers are divided into three groups, viz, elemen- 
tary, superior primary, and normal; each group is divided into five 
classes, with annual salaries fixed as follows: 
  
| Primary schools. Normal schools. Superior primary . | teachers.   
| Men. | Won   
      Men. | Women. 
  
$200 $200 $360 $700 Fifth class $600

Second 360 300 500 | 1,000 900 
First class . 400 320 560 | 1,100 1,000 
  
An additional sum of $40 is allowed principals in charge of a school 
of three or four classes, and of $80 for a school of more than four 
classes. 
' Promotion from one grade of salary to the next may be made with- 
out a change of place; it depends upon the length and efficiency of 
service and can only take place when there is a vacancy. Moreover, 
teachers of the fifth and fourth classes can not be promoted to a supe- 
rior class until after five years’ service in the inferior position; no 
teacher is eligible to the second or first class who is not provided with 
the highest certificate (brevet superieur) and who has not served at 
least three years in the class preceding. It is, however, expressly 
provided that, so far as length of service affects promotion, teachers 
having served ten years may be placed in the fifth class; fifteen years, 
in the fourth class; twenty years, in the third, and twenty-five years, in 
the second. 
Assistant teachers in primary schools are paid $160. Assistant 
teachers in superior primary schools, from $220 to $420. 
In addition to his salary every teacher must be provided with a 
residence or with a money equivalent for the same. The law imposes 
this provision upon the communes and fixes the rates of indemnity for 
residences. 
Cities of more than 150,000 inhabitants are not included in these 
provisions. Their schools are maintained by municipal funds, except- 
ing that the State may contribute thereto a sum not exceeding the 
product of 8 centimes additional to the direct taxes. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
The law requires every department to maintain two normal schools, 
one for men, the other for women, unless authorized to unite with 
another department for this purpose. In 1886-87 only one of the 90 
departments was without a normal school for men. Since that year- 
the number of these has been reduced to 87 by the union of depart- 
mental schools in two cases. Meanwhile the number of normal schools 
for women has risen from 81 to 85. The schools for men employed a

force of 124 directors 413 regular professors and teachers, and 353 spe- 
cial instructors, and had an enrollment of 3,878 students. The normal 
_schools for women employed 141 directors, 361 regular professors and 
instructresses, and 219 assistants. Their enrollment was 3,707, From 
1887 to 1892, inclusive, the schools for men had a total of 7,189 grad- 
uates, as against 8,054 in the five years preceding, and the schools for 
women 5,615, as against 4,285. 
It may be added that tlie professors in the departmental normals are, 
as a rule, graduates of the State normal schools, St. Cloud (for men) 
and Fontenay-aux-Roses (for women). In addition to the public normal 
schools, there are the following private institutions for the profes- 
sional training of teachers: Institut des Fréres de la Doctrine Chré- 
tienne, a Protestant normal school, Boissy St. Léger, and the school of 
the Alliance Israélite. 
SCHOOL BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENTS. 
The buildings for primary schools of all grades are, as a rule, the 
property of the communes. This is the case as to 53,362 schoolhouses 
or groups of buildings, leaving 9,870 rented. The number of public 
primary schools having a gymnasium, more or less complete, is 6,234, 
an increase of 642 above 1887. There are also 752 schools provided 
with a workshop, 52,309 with a garden, an increase above 1887 of 236 
in respect to the former and of 1,965 in respect to the latter. The fol- 
lowing statistics pertain to the chief auxiliary agencies for promoting 
popular instruction:

The number of school savings banks diminishes from year to year. 
In part this is explained by the fact that many teachers prefer to sub- 
Stitute for the school bank the postal savings bank.

Teachers’ mutual beneficial associations are numerous. - They showed 
in the year under review a total of 46,643 members, with funds amount- 
ing to very nearly $1,500,000. 
FINANCES, 
The current expenditure for public primary education, including the 
maintenance of the primary normal schools, has increased about 7 per 
cent since 1887, rising from $34,648,211 to $37,261,215. This amount 
was distributed as follows: Expenses of inspection, $449,312; obliga- 
tory expenses of primary schools, $29,768,032, or 79 per cent of the 
total; normal schools, $1,856,849; divers expenses, chiefly optional 
with the communes, $5,187,022. Of the total above given, the State 
furnished 87.9 per cent, as against 49 per cent in 1887. This great 
increase in the proportion furnished by the State is a result of the law 
of 1889, under which the State assumed the payment of the teachers’ 
salaries. The expenses per capita of pupils in the public primary 
schools, infant schools included, rose from $6.61 in 1887 to $7.57 in 
1892. Upon the supposition that the cost per capita is about the same 
in private as in public primaries, the expenditure for the former would 
be about $12,000,000, which would swell the total expenditure to very 
nearly $50,000,000. The expenditure for buildings for public primary 
schools amounted in the fifteen years ending with 1893 to $118,800,000, 
and for normal schools to $8,000,000. 
RESULTS OF ELEMENTARY INSTRUCTION, 
It is not easy to determine the immediate outcome of a system of 
popular instruction, or at least to state this in any precise terms. The 
report deals, however, with several conditions bearing upon this 
inquiry: First, as to the certificates of primary study awarded upon 
the results of examination for which children may present themselves 
at 11 years of age and upward. The number who passed the exami- 
nation in 1891-92 was 175,675 (boys, 96,412; girls, 79,263), an increase 
of 30,541 in five years. 
The high school diploma (certificat d’études primaires supérieures) 
created by a decree of December 28, 1882, was awarded to 1,850 candi- 
dates (1,132 boys, 718 girls) in 1892 as against 1,212 in 1887. The 
report also gives a detailed statement as to the course taken by high 
school pupils immediately after leaving the school.

The statistics indicating the degree of illiteracy are given under two 
heads, as follows: 
1886. 1891. 
Per cent.| Per cent. 89.7 92.6 Conscripts able at least to read . a 
79.8 87.4 Brides able to sign the register.      aThe proportion of bridegrooms signing the marriage register is almost the samo as in the case of conscripts. 
As to these items the commission say: ‘¢They prove but little and 
moreover relate to persons who have been out of school eight years or 
more. It is, however, noticeable that departments which stood lowest 
ten years ago have made greatest advance. In 1881, as regards con- 
scripts able to read, the difference between the highest and the lowest 
department was 40; that is, for every 100 conscripts, there were 40 
more in the latter unable to read. In 1891 the difference was only 26. 
It is interesting to note that the diffusion of elementary instruc- 
tion has greatly reduced the need of provision for instruction among 
conscripts. 
Regimental schools are no longer an indispensable feature of military 
camps, and under an order of December 27, 1887, instruction is to be . 
provided for recruits only where it is actually needed. | 
Schools for marine conscripts are still maintained, but since 1883 only — 
those recruits are accepted who can read and write. Schools are main- | 
tained in all prisons and a classified record keptof the status of erimi-_ 
nals with respect to their attainments at the time of their commitment — 
and of their discharge. 
Two facts are emphasized by these statistics: (1) That the proportion 
of illiterate criminals diminishes, although for the majority the degree 
of attainment is very low. For example, of 10,420 men under deten- 
tion in 1889-90 a little less than 9 per cent had finished the primary 
course; a very small proportion, 25 per cent, had been in the high 
schools. The proportions were almost identical for women prisoners. | 
(2) A certain proportion of criminals seem incapable of instruction. 
In 1890, of men prisoners under instruction, 18 per cent, and of women
-P-A-G-E-249

12 per cent, were reported as remaining illiterate after a year’s instrue- 
tion. So of 12,706 persons (men and women) committed in 1890 on 
short sentences. 16 per cent were reported as iliiterate at the time of 
their discharge, although they had been under instruction in the 
interval.

       ETROSPECTIVE VIEW OF THE BUREAU’S PUBLICATIONS ON THE 
SUBJECT, SINCE 1889. 
The annual report of the Bureau of Education for 1888-89, Part I, 
ontains in chapter 2 a comparison of the schools of the United States, 
ermany, and France, with large diagrams giving the number of 
upils and other items of information, in squares, each representing 
,000 pupils. This chapter also contains a graphic representation of 
he courses of study in American, German, and French elementary and 
igh schools with reference to linguistic studies, history and geog- 
raphy, mathematics and natural sciences. For purposes of easy com- 
arison typical courses of study are quoted and placed side by side, 
showing in what branches one kind of schools excels and in what 
ranches it is excelled. The chapter closes with some extensive quota- 
ions from foreign educators. 
The same annual report contains two charts which show graphically 
he ratio of entire population in schools between kindergarten and 
nniversity of every State and colony in North and South America, 
nd also in Europe. These charts have been reproduced in a different 
anner and brought up to date in the succeeding annual reports of 
889-90 and 1890-91. 
| Chapter 5 of the annual report of 1888-89 also contains a bird’s-eye 
view of the schools of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, which gives 
in brief manner their historical development, together with statistics 
und diagrams. 
The annual report of 1889-90 has accounts of the so-called middle or 
intermediate schools in Prussia, of private schools in Prussia, of the 
movement for promoting public play of school children, of the educa- 
tion of neglected and depraved children, and of juvenile wage workers 
in Prussia. The schools of the Kingdom of Saxony are described and 
their statistics given in detail. A diagram exhibiting the economic 
levelopment of the Kingdom of Saxony between the years 1875 and 
1889 brings out some curious facts. A brief article on school gardens 
vives a résumé of what is done in that respect for the children in 
Europe.

  204 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
The famous December conference on secondary schools was calles 
and in part conducted by the Emperor of Germany, who had insistec 
upon reforming the secondary schools, which he believed to be incapa 
ble of meeting the just demands of the present age. This conference 
consisted of some of the most distinguished educators of Germany 
and their views and deliberations are sketched in an article found iu 
the same annual report of 1889-90, which also contains a brief view o 
the schools of Austria-Hungary, a brief statement of the school systen 
in Prussia, and a diagram showing the proportion of the population ii 
elementary, secondary, and higher institutions. 
In view of the fact that the authorities in Germany publish schoo 
statistics only at intervals of three years, no new statistical feature 
could be obtained in the following year; hence, in order to do full jus 
tice to the important educational interests of central Europe, th 
annual report of 1890-91 contains an account of the industrial an 
technical education in central Europe, in which the lower, secondary 
and higher institutions for technical and industrial education ar 
described and in part compared. A statistical view is appended. 
The same annual report contains a statistical summary giving, first 
the total number of youth in schools below universities in the variou 
civilized countries of the world; second, the teachers; and third, th 
expenditures so far as obtainable. All data offered in these tables ar 
given in absolute numbers as well as in ratios. 
Legal education is also a topic discussed in the annual report 
1890-91. It does not confine itself to America, but extensively describe 
the European law courses, and presents a comprehensive bibliograph: 
of legal education. Volume II of the same annual report opens witl 
a review of the history and status of public kindergartens in Europeai 
and American States, written by Dr. W. N. Hailmann. The article i 
illustrated. | 
The next annual report of the Bureau, that for 1891-92, has in chap 
ter 6 an article on the training of teachers in Germany, Austria, an 
Switzerland, in which an historical review, statistics, rules, and regula 
tions of European normal schools, their present management and cours 
of study, as well as views of normal school men concerning the train 
ing of teachers, are given. 
The Swiss school system finds attention both historically and stati 
tically in the same volume. The exhibitions in various countries o 
appliances for teaching are briefly enumerated and sketched in th 
same report. 
Chapter 10, on German universities, was translated from a work pré 
pared by Professors Paulsen and Conrad for the World’s Fair in Ch 
eago. The historical reviews and reflections on the present status 
the universities in Germany by Professor Paulsen and the Age 
statistics of Professor Conrad have attracted wide attention. 
 
-P-A-G-E-253
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 205 
Chapter 11 of the volume mentioned contains an account of the schools 
for recruiting the civil service in France and a statement of the require- 
-inents for civil service in Prussia, prepared by Profs. W. F. and W. W. 
Willoughby. 
The annual report of this Bureau for 1892-93 contains a discussion of 
recent developments in the teaching of geography in central Europe, 
giving first a historical sketch of geography as a study in schools, then 
a discussion of geography in the schools of to-day; then a contribution 
of Professor Goodison of the State normal school, of Ypsilanti, Mich., 
on modern methods and devices of teaching geography in central Europe, 
illustrated copiously, and followed by accounts of personal observations 
in schools of Germany. This chapter also concludes with a bibliography 
on the subject of geography. 
The schools of Bavaria, like the schools of Saxony in previous reports, 
are reviewed by a correspondent of this Bureau at Munich. 
The important recent movement toward a profound study of psycho- 
logical phenomena has resulted in the formation of a society for child 
study and experimental psychology. The annual report of 1892-93 
gives a symposium on that subject, which contains a number of full 
papers and extracts of papers prepared by eminent educators of the 
United States. 
This is followed by a chapter on German criticism of American edu- 
eation and education exhibits by noted German educators who were 
sent by their Government to Chicago for the purpose of reporting upon 
the exhibits in Chicago as well as the schools. These accounts go into 
minute details where their authors were brought face to face with fea- 
tures of American life and educational efforts new to them. Naturally 
they are not always absolutely correct, but it is surprising to notice the 
felicity with which they point out the excellent features of the schools 
as well as their weak points. The educational congresses held in con- 
nection with the Fair are amply treated by these authors, as is also the 
congress of the librarians. 
The report on American technological schools, reprinted in English 
translation from a German publication, sheds light on this feature of 
the educational world, and the observations the author makes prove 
him to be impartial and just. His numerous diagrams bear evidence 
of a diligence in comparing statistics worthy of imitation. 
The statistical table of elementary instruction in foreign countries is 
for the first time in the history of this Bureau complete with regard to 
the States of Germany. The Prussian statistical bureau has under 
taken to furnish a summary for all the States of Germany, thus enabling 
the world to judge of the combined efforts in behalf of public education 
of the united German Empire.

  206 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
RESULTS OF PRUSSIAN COMMON SCHOOL STATISTICS OF THE YEAR 
1891. 
INTRODUCTION, 
The school authorities of Prussia, Bavaria, and other States of Ger- 
many publish at intervals of three or more years summaries of school 
statistics and detailed accounts of the changes occurring. The last 
comprehensive publication on Prussian and Bavarian schools was pre- 
pared for the Chicago World’s Fair. The summaries offered then 
were used in the annual report of this Bureau for 1892-93, and a 
recapitulation of official data would be unprofitable. The data were 
freely commented upon, chiefly in a laudatory manner, by the German 
commissioners to the World’s Fair (see pp. 521-575 of Ann. Rep. of 
1892-93); but since then a number of weighty criticisms have appeared, 
which place the statistical facts offered in the proper focus and analyze 
them from the standpoint of modern demands. No hostile motive 
prompted these efforts, for the minister of public education himself 
frankly admits that he is struggling to obtain “the daily bread with 
which to maintain the schools;” and it is conceded, even by opponents. 
of the Government, that the authorities make every effort to keep pub- 
lic education abreast with that of other countries and in harmony with 
its own glorious past. 
In the two following articles on “Results of Prussian school statis- 
ties of 1891” a calm, dispassionate analysis of the official data is offered, 
adapted from a work of the same title by Mr. J. Tews, of Berlin. This 
eritical exposé sheds light on Prussian elementary school statistics 
which are apt to escape observation. The author is a master in group- 
ing, analyzing, and comparing statistical data, and hence his state- 
ments are readily accepted in the press of Germany and other 
countries. 
The author divides his exposé into two articles: (1) “The common 
elementary schools,” and (2) “The teachers of. common elementary 
schools,” which articles are offered here in English garb stripped of all 
unnecessary and irrelevant matter. The author subsequently published 
another article on the courses of study, which, however, goes beyond 
the scope originally contemplated, and is therefore omitted in this trans- 
lation. 
Part I.—THE COMMON SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA. 
Statistics of Prussian common schools, dated May 20, 1886, proved 
that the provisions for education in the “land of schools” were inade- 
quate, and no one well informed in the case extenuated existing facts. 
A retrogression has been officially confirmed. Undoubtedly there are 
substantiating facts that make the retrogression in the provisions for 
public education and teachers’ salaries appear less glaring. A difficult
-P-A-G-E-255
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 207 
task confronted the Prussian administration of education early in the : 
eighties. The number of pupils in common schools rapidly increased 
in eight years (from 1878 to 1886) from 4,200,160 to 4,838,247 children; 
‘between 1882 and 1886, from 4,339,729 to 4,838,247 children; conse- 
quently about 13 per cent and 104 per cent, respectively. Such an 
augmentation could only be managed by straining every power ; instead, 
it was oftener the case that everything went on in the old ways. 
Statistical publications of Prussian common schools until then 
awakened little interest, but the publication of 1886 attracted special 
attention. The exposed evils not only aroused teachers, but in a great 
measure were animadyerted upon by the press. Consequently the 
  latest reports, of May 25, 1891, supported by facts and events, fell upon 
well-prepared ground. The question in the minds of all who consulted 
the two ample volumes was, Do they show a forward or a backward 
movement; have school administrators been oceupied in rectifying the 
existing deficiencies, or have they meekly looked on the decline of the 
States’ educational institutions? The exhibition of statistics prepared 
for the Exposition in Chicago did more than was necessary to direct 
publie attention to the authoritative sources of Prussian statistics. 
Nothing can be more easily misused than statistical data. Ivre- 
spective of the not infrequent cases in which correct statements are 
intentionally misapplied, few only are able to read a statistical work in- 
telligently. Absolute figures are never understood easily; they should 
always be taken in their relative, comparative value. The question, 
therefore, whether a school system has made satisfactory progress 
within a certain period, is not to be judged offhand according to a few 
figures, but demands a careful examination and comparison of all rele- 
vant factors. A mere increase in number is of itself no satisfactory 
progress. Presupposing, for instance, that teachers’ salaries during 
a certain period averaged an increase of 100 marks, but that cost of 
living and the payment of other officials at the same time increased 
in greater proportion, there would necessarily follow a manifest retro- 
gression in the mode of living and social position of teachers. Or 
if the number of pupils to every teacher diminished from 70 to 60 
within a certain time a satisfactory progress would only have been 
attained, if this improvement were not behind similar improvements in 
other States. From this point of view, all that has been done for the 
promotion of education in Prussia since the seventies is inadequate, 
as other German States, France, and Austria as well, have in the mean- 
time accomplished incomparably more. Inthe order of States, if meas- 
ured by their educational efforts, Prussia has taken a place in the rear. 
The task of improving Prussian common schools between 1886 and 
1891 was comparatively easy. Whereas the increase of pupils was 
unusually large from 1878 to 1886, the period since 1886 shows only a 
minimum increase in the whole State, and even a decrease in many 
localities, notably in the country. While the entire population be- 
   
-P-A-G-E-256
    208 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
tween 1835 and 1890 increased 5.8 per cent, namely, from 28,318,470 to 
29,959,388 persons, the number of school children increased only 1.4 
per cent, namely, from 5,225,891 to 5,299,310. In 1886 the number of 
children of school age (6 to 14) constituted 18.4 per cent of the entire 
population; in 1891 only 17.6 percent. The number of children attend- 
ing common or people’s schools increased in a little larger proportion, 
from 4,838,237 to 4,916,476, i. e., 1.62 per cent, while private schools, 
elementary and other, show a decrease in the number of pupils. An 
increase of pupils has only taken place in cities and in a few country 
districts, particularly in the west. In most rural districts the number 
of pupils has diminished. This decrease is particularly noticeable in 
the districts of Kénigsberg (—10,000), Gumbinnen (—6,200), Frankfort 
(—4,000), Céslin (—5,500), Breslau (— 14,500), Liegnitz (—4,200), Cassel 
(—4,300), Cologne (—8,000). The retrogression is not so considerable 
in the districts of Marienwerder, Stettin, Posen, Bromberg, Erfurt, 
Schleswig, Liineburg, and Wiesbaden, and altogether insignificant in 
Danzig, Stralsund, Hildesheim, Stade, Osnabriick, Aix-la-Chapelle, and 
Hohenzollern, A considerable increase of rural pupils took place only 
in the districts of Potsdam (+8,000), Miinster (+4,300), Arnsberg 
(+12,800), Diisseldorf (4+6,500), and Trier (+7,500). The year 1891, 
compared with 1886, showed that among the school children of the 
whole State there were 41,500 fewer in the country and about 111,500 
more in cities. With reference to the religious denominations it is 
noteworthy that in many districts the number of Catholic pupils was 
comparatively below that of the Protestant; while the number of 
Jewish pupils, both in cities and country, dimished. : 
If the school administration had desired to leave affairs in the same 
condition during the five years in question, then additional institutions 
would have been necessary for only 78,229 newly admitted children. 
As in 1886, there was one teacher for every 75, and one class room for 
every 64.4 children, the odium of a retrogression would have been 
avoided by creating 1,043 teachers’ positions and forming 1,215 classes. 
The question follows, Were these favorable conditions taken advan- 
tage of? The author attempts the answer in the following: 
The difficulty of educational administration varies in the different 
divisions of the State. In the first place, there is a great difference in 
the number of children in various communities. The least number of 
school children, in general, is found in the governmental districts of 
Potsdam, North Saxony, East Hanover, North Schleswig, East Prussia, 
parts of Lower Silesia, and the districts bordering on the Netherlands. 
The minimum is reached by the Hanoverian district of Liichow, with 
15.1 per cent school children, followed by Léwenberg (Silesia), with 
15.8 per cent, and West Priegnitz (Brandenburg) with 16 per cent. 
The whole territory between the Vistula and the Oder (Posen, Upper 
Silesia, west Prussia, the governmental district Céslin), South Han- 
over and South Saxony, and the whole territory between the Rhine

and the Weser, together with North Hanover and Holstein, have 
comparatively few school children. The maximum is reached by the 
districts of Schmiegel, in Posen, with 22.9 per cent; the town of Essen 
follows with 22.6 per cent, Hoerde with 22.4 per cent, and Kosten 
(Posen) with 22 per cent. To understand the true value of these 
figures, we must bear in mind that with the ratio of children in 
Liichow, Prussia would be obliged to accommodate in school 4,526,868 
children, but 6,860,810 with the ratio found in Schmiegel. This fact. 
alone suffices to demonstrate that the principle of common schools 
should not be so rigidly carried out that the community would have to 
bear the full burden of expense. Educational efforts of larger cities 
appear very modest when compared with reference to the number of 
children they accommodate, as may be demonstrated by a proximate 
example. In 1890 the province of Pomerania had somewhat fewer 
(1,520,889), and Hesse-Nassau (1,664,426) more inhabitants than Berlin 
(1,578,794), but in 1891 Pomerania had 251,229, Hesse-Nassau 268,627, 
and Berlin only 175,620 children to provide for in the public common 
schools. Pomerania needed 4,672, Hesse-Nassau 5,027, and Berlin 
only 3,206 class rooms for instruction. In view of these figures, it 
appears more pardonable that Pomerania should have only 4,264 and 
Hesse-Nassau but 4,254 schoolrooms, than that Berlin should lack 
apartments for four classes only. Pomerania had 4,192, Hesse-Nassau 
4,147, and Berlin 3,203 teachers. Nevertheless, large cities are still in 
the front rank, but not so far ahead as is generally believed. 
The Prussian common school is very far from being, as it is usually 
idealized, the common elementary school for all. Unfortunately, sta- 
tistics do not furnish information enough on this point. They register 
the number of children in obligatory attendance at common or other 
schools, but do not specify how many nonattendants receive instruction 
in the elementary classes of secondary schools for boys and advanced 
schools for girls. 
Altogether 4,916,476, or 93 per cent, of the 5,299,310 children of school 
age, were placed in common schools; in cities, 1,615,455, or 85.4 per 
cent, of the 1,891,031 children of school age; in the country, 3,301,021, 
or 97 per cent, of 3,408,279. The laws of 1888 and 1889 have brought 
about a perceptible rearrangement of schools in many cities. Since 
the limit between the common schools and institutions beyond their 
scope have been strictly defined, many have been removed from the 
category of common schools to that of intermediate or middle schools, 
and vice versa. Many of the larger cities are still far from recognizing 
the general common school as the common foundation of all higher 
educational institutions; meanwhile, an approximation to this end is 
noticeable. 
Kénigsberg has 11,391 of its 22,211 children in obligatory attendance 
in common schools; Danzig has 12,289 of its 17,792; Berlin, 175,620 
of 212,681; Charlottenburg, 7,115 of 10,442; Stettin, 11,109 of 16,493;

Posen, 5,725 of 10,869; Breslau, 39,260 of 49,156; Frankfort on the Main 
12,902 of 23,580. On the other hand, in many cities of the west th 
common schools are attended by the majority of children. In Dortmun 
there are 16,286 common school pupils to 16,793 school children; i 
Crefeld, 17,854 to 19,224; in Essen, 12,941 to 14,215; in Bochum th 
number in attendance even exceeds the number of children of schoo 
age (9,854 to 9,224), probably on account of earlier admission and longe; 
attendance at school. The above figures show in a general way Hay 
differently private schools, elementary classes of secondary schools, an 
so-called middle schools have developed. 
That a number of Prussian children of the laboring population di 
not in name even attend school during the whole time required is wel 
known; but it is not uninteresting to compare the respective figures 
In the spring of 1891, 3,229 children (2,431 of them in Posen) could no 
be admitted because of overcrowded schools; 17,527 children are me 
tioned as not having entered school at the completion of their sixtl 
year, but were kept back one or two years; 62,838 were allowed to leay, 
school before the completion of their fourteenth year; 20,945 of th 
latter belonged to Rhenish Prussia and 13,566 of them to the distric 
of Diisseldorf. The last figures probably indicate children permitte: 
by the superintendent to leave school. In reality a much larger num 
ber leave before the legally appointed time, to lose in a short time iy 
factories and industrial work a great deal of what has been acquires 
at school, if liberal provision is not made by establishing continuatioy 
schools. 
After these digressions let us examine Prussian schools more closely 
Prussian statistics, unlike the Austrian, by way of example, do no| 
refer to the accommodations. Counts Briihi and von Buch, in the Hous| 
of Deputies, say the schoolhouses are palaces; Representative Ricke 
is of the opinion that there are many dilapidated huts among the 
The statistical report is noncommittal on this point. Only 70,950 clas| 
rooms were provided for 82,746 classes, so that not fewer than 23,59 
classes were obliged to share apartments with others. If we dedu 
rented class rooms there remain only 68,593 owned by the State. T 
1886 there were 62,095 for 75,097 classes. At that time 13,002 (in 189 
14,153) classes lacked their own rooms.! 
In regard to the construction of school buildings also a retrogressio 
is noticed. Minister von Gossler’s demand for 20,000,000 marks fo} 
school buildings was not regarded in the least exorbitant, and th 
Clerical-Conservative majority in the Diet gave the strongest evidene 
‘of their friendly attitude toward schools when they voted down th      11t is a hygienic requirement that each class, even in half-day schools, should ha: 
a class room of its own. Anyone acquainted with the A B C of school hygiene wi 
not consider this demand unreasonable. It borders on inhumanity to oblige chi 
dren of widely different ages to sit on the same benches; to instruct a second cla: 
in an already vitiated atmosphere and let the other class wait outside in all sorts 
weather.

lump sum of 6,000,000 marks demanded by the present minister by — 
appropriating instead 2,000,000 marks for this purpose annually. 
The most widely different conditions in this respect are noticeable in 
the separate provinces. Schleswig-Holstein, the first in order in every- 
thing excellent pertaining to schools, approaches nearest to normal 
conditions, owning 3,660 rooms for 3,670 classes. In this province the 
, number of rooms is about equal to that of the classes. Last in order 
is Silesia, which has but 8,495 rooms for 12,323 classes. In the rural 
districts of that province only 6,191 rooms are provided for 9,482 classes; 
in the district of Breslau, 1,500; in that of Liegnitz 1,100 classes are 
without apartments of their own. While in Silesia the number of 
classes increased by 860, only 453 additional rooms were provided; in 
the rural districts of that province the number of classes increased by 
573, that of class rooms by 268. 
As far as the formation of classes is concerned Prussia ranks among 
the countries which do not favor coeducation.

The number of separate classes for boys and girls we see increased 
20 per cent; that of mixed classes only by 64 per cent. In the cities of 
several provinces the number of mixed classes has decreased according 
to absolute figures. City and country must be separately considered 
in this respect. In cities, in 1891, 28 per cent, or only 7,467 out of 26,651 
classes, were mixed. The greatest number of mixed classes is to be 
found in the city schools of Posen (908 out of 1,339, or 685 per cent). 
Rhenish Prussia (2,128 out of 4,956, or 425 per cent) ranks next. The 
district of Diisseldorf particularly distinguishes itself in this respect 
(1,764 out of 2,949, or 60 per cent). Third in order comes Westphalia 
(795 out of 2,063, or 39 per cent). The least number of mixed classes is 
found in Berlin (29) and in the city schools of Schleswig-Holstein (82). 
In the rural districts separate classes for the sexes are found to any 
noteworthy extent only in a few provinces (Rhenish Prussia, West- 
phalia, Silesia, Brandenburg) possessing a greater number of villages 
with urban conditions, still the separate classes (5,265) throughout 
constitute 9.4 per cent of the sum total (56,095), 30 per cent (2,216) in 
Rhenish Prussia (total 7,417), and 25 per cent (1,139) in Westphalia 
(total 4,477). There are no separate country schools for the sexes in 
the governmental district of Bromberg; Céslin and Marienwerder 
each has one. Whether there be any advantage in separate instruction 
for boys and girls may be doubted. Altogether, 1,718,269 out of 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
  212 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
2,467,558 boys and 1,691,812 out of 2,448,918 girls are mstructed in 
mixed classes, consequently more than two-thirds of the total number, 
but only three-tenths in cities. 
The grading of pupils has likewise suffered little alteration in Prus- 
sian common schools during late years. It moves parallel with the 
growth of villages. The following table presents a survey of the 
changes that have taken place:

The change is easily recognizable. The ungraded school is fast losing 
ground; schools with two to five grades show only insignificant changes, 
while the schools with six or seven grades are rapidly increasing. In 
1882 there were still 20,082 ungraded schools (30.5 per cent) in which 
1,336,404 children were instructed. The fewest ungraded schools are 
found in Silesia and Westphalia; the next in Pomerania and West 
Prussia; 40 per cent of the common school pupils of the last-mentioned 
provinces are still instructed in ungraded schools; in the country in 
East Prussia almost one-half, in Pomerania more than one-half (101,497 
of 179,828 children). The two-grade school is found oftenest in East 
Prussia and Posen; schools of three grades in Silesia, Hanover, West- 
phalia, and Hesse-Nassau (20 to 25 per cent of the children); schools of 
four grades again in Silesia and Westphalia (12 per cent); the five- 
grade school in Silesia and Saxony (7 to 8 per cent); the six-grade 
school in Berlin (all schools with one exception), Brandenburg, and 
Saxony. The seven and higher grade schools alone constitute a large 
percentage in Hesse-Nassau (17 per cent), in Wiesbaden (25 per cent), 
followed by Rhenish Prussia (in this case, Diisseldorf with 20 per cent), 
anid Westphalia (10 per cent). The district of Diisseldorf is about to 
follow the order of the day by replacing the unprofitable, though other- 
wise preferred, six-grade school by schools of seven and more grades. In 
the latter the number of pupils increased from 40,600 to 70,199; in the 
former, the six-grade schools, it decreased from 77,349 to 67,707. Hopes 
are entertained that the adoption of the same measure in a smaller 
degree in the districts of Hanover and Osnabriick means the beginning 
of a reform that will spread over the whole State. 
In the rural districts schools of few grades predominate. The fol- 
lowing table presents a review. In 1891 there were:

Aside from the decrease in the number of ungraded schools (1,041), 
the changes are inconsiderable. Country schools of five or more grades 
prevail only in Silesia, Brandenburg, Westphalia, and Rhenish Prussia. 
Of not less importance than the number of grades is the number of 
classes in a schoolhouse. We shall confine ourselves to the city schools 
of six and more grades. The six-grade schools averaged 10.7 classes; 
the schools of more grades, 11.8. In the various provinces the differ- 
ence is not considerable, but nevertheless noticeable throughout. For 
instance, Silesia has fewer schools than Saxony, and Rhenish Prussia 
fewer than Westphalia. The six-grade schools of Silesia average 9 
classes; those of Saxony more than 12; the seven and higher grade 
schools of both provinces between 11.6 and 17.5. In Westphalia the 
seven and higher grade systems average 14.6; in Rhenish Prussia only 
9.3 classes. In this respect a review of the largest cities is of great 
interest.

  214 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
As it is to the interest of education for schools to be as small as 
possible, consequently that the number of classes should not exceed if 
possible the number of grades, it is an encouraging fact that in six- 
grade schools the average of classes has fallen from 10.8 to 10.5. Cor- 
respondingly the number of classes in schools of seven and more 
grades has increased from 11.4 to 11.6. 
In Prussia, during the last few years, thousands of schools have 
arisen in which the number of classes is larger than that of the 
teachers. Until 1878 there were very few of these schools. In 1878 
there were 57,165 teachers’ positions for 57,780 classes; consequently 
only 615 classes were unprovided for. From that time on conditions in 
this respect have become worse. There existed in—

     Deficit in the number of teachers.. 
Proportion of teachers to classes........ 
This statement shows that in 1886 there were no teachers for 10,347; in 
1891, none for 12,652 classes; or, that in 1886, 20,694, and in 1891, 25,304 
classes shared teachers with other classes. Substitutes and assistants, 
it is true, are not included in the total number of teachers (1886, 1,183; 
1891, 1,657); but, on the other hand, neither are unfilled or not regu- 
larly filled positions deducted (1886, 467; 1891, 1,020). In every case a 
decided retrogression has taken place, which is particularly manifested 
in the arrangement of two-grade schools with one teacher (1882, 2,989; 
1886, 5,481; 1891, 5,925), and three-grade schools with only two 
teachers (1882, 1,847; 1886, 2,610; 1891, 3,136). 
In view of this fact, the diminution of overcrowded classes means 
little. A stroke of the pen can change an ungraded into a school of 
two grades with one teacher, or a two-grade school with two teachers 
into a three-grade school; neither money nor teachers are required, 
since these teachers have to work additional time. Improvements thus 
accomplished are not real. The statements concerning normal and 
abnormal class attendance have therefore little value. The only true 
standard is, “Have the numerical relations between teachers and 
pupils improved or not?” The following statement gives the answer:

How easily the apparent improvement was effected has been seen, 
and is evident from the above figures. The improvement has influenced 
the whole State, even if in very unequal degrees, but has not yet brought 
about satisfactory conditions. 
The following table indicates the most progressive and the most 
backward districts.

The latest statistics contain numbers that, unfortunately, do not show 
the numerical relation of teachers to scholars in any better light than 
the averages. The average numbers of certain districts are very high.

As there are small schools, too, in the distriets, a deduction from these 
numbers is easily made, the foregoing figures being from a district that 
does not rank unfavorably. 
   
-P-A-G-E-264
216 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
The Handbook for School Inspectors, Clergymen, and Teachers, of 
the years 1891 and 1892, for the governmental district of Merseburg, 
states: 
Of the 1,048 schools with one or two teachers, 226 villages have 80 to 120 pupils to 
one teacher; 55 villages have over 120 pupils to one teacher, and 188 each two teachers 
to more than 120 pupils. To bring these schools to the normal condition designated 
in the general regulations, i. e., one teacher for every 80 children, the government 
must appoint 524 additional teachers. This number is wanting alone in schools of 
one and two grades in a single governmental district. In all the other schools, hence 
in the cities of that district, there exists the same repletion. For instance, 3 schools, 
each with one teacher, have 197, 194, and 193 children respectively. Oftentimes one 
teacher has over 150 or 160 children in charge. In 8 schools two teachers instruct 
250 and more pupils; in another place 288 children are taught by two teachers. 
After the above statement, even a moderate equipment of teachers 
ean not be accepted as an unconditional proof of the satisfactory con- 
dition of the schools. The question is: How many teachers are there 
for the number of classes?) The overcrowding of many classes, com- 
bined with the lack of teachers, will emphasize present unsatisfactory 
conditions. Of the 4,916,476 common school pupils 1,661,182 children 
were members of overcrowded classes. A class is considered over- 
crowded according to the existing law when it numbers more than 80 
in an ungraded school, and more than 70 pupils in a school of two or 
more grades. Not less than 1,309,175 children sat in classes numbering 
from 81 to 100, or 71 to 90 pupils respectively; 324,821 children sat in 
classes of 101 to 150, or 91 to 120 pupils respectively, and 27,186 chil- 
dren in classes of more than 150 or 120 pupils respectively. In the 
face of such circumstances it is easily understood why the minister of 
public instruction should say that the school administration could not 
guarantee the maintaining of the present educational standard of the 
people. ‘It is true,” he said, ‘that it was worse in former times; but 
then Prussia was justly called the ‘land of schools,’ for it stood at the 
head; to-day, however, we are behind countries whose schools are very 
much younger than ours; for instance, France, where every 40 to 50 
children have a teacher.” 
The most backward governmental district in this respect is Miinster. 
Only 21,462 or 23.01 per cent of the 93,264 school children were mem- 
bers of classes having the normal number. Fully 71,802 children (76.99 
per cent), or seven-ninths of the total number, were in classes with more 
than 70 to 80 children. The next districts, Arnsberg with 35.78 per 
cent, Diisseldorf with 39.86 per cent, Oppeln with 43.64 per cent, classes 
of normal capacity, are as far ahead of Miinster as they themselves are 
below the average (66.21 per cent). The above numbers do not give 
entire evidence of the conditions of the district of Miinster. In its 
cities only 10.08 per cent of the children are seated in classes not 
crowded. Miinster, however, is entitled to the credit of levying the 
minimum of school taxes. In 1891 throughout the State these taxes 
amounted to 4.89 marks per head of the population.!. Miinster man- 
1A mark is equal to 23.8 cents.

ages its schools with 3.60 marks, in the country with 3.41 marks; while 
Oppeln expends 3.68 and Kénigsberg 3.75 marks; the neighboring dis- 
tricts of Arnsberg raise 6.06; Minden, 4.71; Diisseldorf, 5.69; Cologne, 
6.35; and even the poor district of Céslin, 4.75 marks, 
The average requisite amount throughout the State for the schooling 
of a child is 29.74 marks (in the country 24.73 marks). Miinster again 
makes the most moderate demands; it maintains its schools with 20.70 
marks. In the cities of the governmental district of Miinster, above’ 
all in the city of Miinster itself, education is particularly cheap. They 
expend 24.43 marks for each child, while the State average in cities 
amounts to 39.99 marks, and even Hast Prussia requires more than 32 
marks. In the last thirty years (since 1864) the expenses of a common 
school pupil average an increase of about 17 to 18 marks—the exact 
amount can not be obtained. Again Miinster is last in order with 
12.88 marks. 
School attendance in the larger cities is of special interest. It is, to 
some extent, characteristic of the school system, since, as a rule, in 
cities there is one teacher for every class who keeps the register of 
attendance. The following table is a summary of 28 of the largest 
cities of Prussia:

Among all these cities we see that Stettin shows the best conditions; 
but still arather large attendance in the lower classes is easily reckoned 
from its average of 49. In Stettin the law does not allow over 60 
pupils in a class; hence the class rooms are certainly not empty in this 
city either. It follows that Miinster is last in order, with Bochum next 
above. 
   
-P-A-G-E-266
  218 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
We must pass, with only few suggestions, over other extremely inter 
esting conditions, illustrated by statistics. The number of boys in 
common schools (2,467,558) is very little greater than that of girl 
(2,448,918), because a greater number of school boys are instructed i 
other educational institutions. In cities (805,182 boys and 810,27 
girls), particularly in Berlin, the “ City of Intelligence” (86,544 boy: 
and 89,076 girls), girls are in the majority, despite the fact that 1,00 
births average from 512 to 515 male children. One thousand five hun: 
dred and forty-eight more boys than girls were born in the year 189] 
alone (averaging in the whole State 33,000 to 36,000 more). In former 
years the number of female pupils was still lower than that of male 
pupils (in 1822 about 60,000), because with girls obligatory attendane 
was less strictly enforced than with boys. -At present, there is hardl, 
a perceptible difference resulting from the law, with the exception of 
Schleswig-Holstein, where boys are required to attend school one yeai 
longer than girls. The influence of this regulation is particularly 
noticeable in the rural districts of that province (73,090 boys; 64,804 
girls). 
The Catholic has more children on an average than the Protestant 
population, and a larger percentage of Catholic children attend com 
mon schools. The intensely interesting figures are here omitted, ai 
their interest is almost purely theoretical. If, in consequence of th 
greater number of children, Catholic communities should be mor 
heavily taxed, measures of equalization are adopted by the State whe 
ever possible. Since 1887 permission of the governmental oo 
authorities is indispensable for the adoption of such measures, ani 
these men are not always of opinion that improved education is a bene 
fit. The two denominations do not always show an equal readiness 
to make sacrifices for educational purposes.

Older statistical reports on Prussian common schools ciassify educa- 
tional data more according to the denominations than do_ the present; 
for instance, in regard to salaries. These figures deserve to be wrested 
from oblivion. The average amount of teachers’ salaries in 1861 was 
as follows:

        These references go to show that Catholic teachers were on an aver- 
age paid less than Protestant.! 
The numerical relation between teachers and pupils was formerly 
and is to-day less favorable among Catholics. A change has been 
effected since the influence of the church has been restricted from the 
beginning of the era inaugurated by Minister Falk. From 1871 to’ 
1886 the number of Catholic teachers increased 34.56 per cent, or in 
greater proportion than the number of pupils; the number of Protes- 
tant teachers increased 25.24 per cent, corresponding with the moderate 
increase in the number of pupils. And still a difference prevailed in 
1886, when there were 82 pupils to every Catholic and 71 to every 
Protestant teacher. The number of pupils to the class in Catholic 
ae’ averaged 71, in Protestant schools 61 children.” 
257A communities riiore! school societies still exist these inequalities are found 
oftener. A specimen compilation of these instances would not be inopportune, 
*The Polish nationality and the policy of the school authorities were each in part 
responsible for the fact that in Prussia in 1871 6.6 per cent of Protestant and 15.16 
per cent of Catholic men, and 11.37 per cent of Protestant and 21.81 per cent of 
Catholic women, were illiterate.

‘Since 1886 the difference has increased; Protestant schools have 
made more rapid progress; Catholic schools haye either followed at a 
slower rate or remained at a standstill; the State has no control over, 
these conditions. 
In 1891 Protestant schools numbered 3,050,864 pupils; Catholic 
schools, 1,635,779 pupils. The two denominations, therefore, show a 
ratio of 13 to 7. Consequently, if both were equally progressive, there 
should be a little over 1 Catholic school, class, etc., to 2 Protestant. 
The following figures show the real facts. The increase in city and 
country combined was as follows:

Proportionately, very few additional Catholic schools and teachers’ 
positions were established. While just as many teachers’ positions 
were created for the 4,741 new classes of Protestant schools, 611 addi- 
tional classes were opened in Catholic schools without the new appoint- 
ment of a single teacher. Protestant and Catholic schools increased, 
respectively, 2.13 and 0.52 per cent; teachers, 11.42 and 9.75 per cent; 
the number of classes, on the other hand, 9.81 and 11.14 per cent. In 
Protestant schools there are 66 pupils to every teacher; in Catholic 
schools the proportion is 69 to 1; in cities alone, 59 to 1 Protestant, and 
69 to 1 Catholic; in the country, 69 to 1 Protestant, and 79 to 1 Cath- 
olic. The differences are still greater in the various provinces. In the 
district of Miinster there are 65 pupils to every teacher in Protestant, 
and 90 in Catholic schools. Under the late school laws the Protestant 
schools.of the district increased their number of teachers 13.2 per cent; 
the Catholic schools, 9.8 per cent. Similar figures are derived from 
nearly all the other governmental districts. Proportions found in the 
Polish districts can not be accepted unconditionally. Only a few facts 
mmay be quoted. In the Protestant and Catholic schools of the district 
of Posen there is 1 teacher to 65 Protestant and 103 Catholie pupils; 
in cities the proportions are 1 to 60 and 1 to 77; in the country, 1 to 67 
in Protestant, and 1 to 110 in Catholic schools. ‘Official statistics of 
1891, among other things, present a special list of classes with extraor- 
dinarily large attendance, i. e., more than 150 children to a class in 
ungraded schools, and more than 120 to a class in schools of two or more 
grades, Of these, 67 are Protestant, 98 Catholic, and 9 mixed schools. 
Posen has 26 Catholic and no Protestant schools; Silesia has 3 Protes- 
tant and 39 Catholic; Westphalia, 10 Protestant and 18 Catholic, of 
which 2 and 14, respectively, are in the district of Miinster; Rhenish 
Prussia, 2 Protestant and 13 Catholic. Of the larger Prussian cities, 
as already stated, Miinster and Bochum have the poorest equipped

schools; in the city of Miinster there are 88 children to every Catholic 
and 66 to every Protestant common school teacher. : 
It is cruel irony on the “wounding of nonsectarianism,” perpetually 
deplored, to say that an improvement of schools was made possible 
only by the intervention of State governmental power, and that their 
retrogression began with the investment of the power to command in 
communities and district boards. 
To give a clearer view of the position of both creeds in respect to 
education, we must include those branches of our public school system 
that are not so completely subject to State authority as elementary 
common schools, i. e., intermediate or middle schools. Neither must we 
forget in this case that the proportion of both creeds in Prussia is 13 to 
7; consequently an equal development must show figures on the Cath- 
olic side a little over half of those on the Protestant. The following 
figures indicate the results:

These numbers indicate the readiness of Catholic and Protestant com- 
munities to make sacrifices for educational purposes, as State authority 
here ceases and private liberality has full scope for action. The author 
does not incline toward overrating intermediate schools; many of them 
could be spared, he thinks, for they only serve caste prejudices. If com- 
mon schools were better provided for in places where intermediate 
schools do not exist, the foregoing figures might be considered favor- 
able to the Catholics, but deductions prove a reverse of conditions. 
The proportion of nationalities represented by the pupils of common 
schools is particularly interesting. The language spoken in the fami- 
lies of the 4,916,476 children is German only in 4,268,909, Polish only — 
in 491,142, Polish and German in 76,298, and Danish in 22,735 cases. 
The others are divided among the nationalities of smaller representa- 
tion. Official statistics attest for the whole State a small increase of 
from 86.58 to 86.83 per cent of German-speaking children. However, 
the case is reversed in the decisive positions of the contending nation- 
alities. 
In the province of Posen the German nationality has retrograded 
during the last five years instead of progressing. In many districts 
the number of German-speaking children has considerably decreased, 
while the Polish have increased. The case is reversed in only few 
districts; as, for instance, in the district of Rawitsch, in which the 
 
-P-A-G-E-270
  
  222 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94, 
number of German-speaking children has increased by 627 (in 1886 by 
1,812; in 1891 by 2,439); the number of Polish-speaking children has 
remained stationary (between 685 and 678). Those speaking both Pol- 
ish and German have likewise increased in number. A similar state 
of affairs exists in the cities of the districts of Colmar in Posen and 
in the county of Bromberg. In the latter the number of German- 
speaking children rose from 699 to 1,113, while the number of others 
changed but little. In many districts the number of children of both 
nationalities decreased, but toa greater extent among the Germans 
than among the Poles. The relations of the city of Posen are partic- 
ularly conspicuous; the number of German speaking children fell from 
2,257 to 1,647; the number of Polish slightly increased (from 3,543 in 
1886 to 3,653 in 1891), and the number of those speaking both German 
and Polish slightly decreased (between 505 and 425). Consequently 
in every case there is a loss of the German nationality. It is a con- 
spicuous fact that the retrogression of the German element is much the 
strongest in cities of Posen. In the cities of the district of Wreschen 
the number of German-speaking common school pupils decreased to 
Jess than half (1886, 755; 1891, 337), while the Polish increased in 
the same proportion (between 592 and 1,035). The following figures 
refer to the whole governmental district of Posen. The number of 
German-speaking children decreased by more than 3,000, from 61,760 
to 58,561; the number of Polish diminished by 500 (in 1886, 134,573; 
in 1891, 133,885); the number of those speaking German and Polish 
remained almost the same (between 7,628 and 7,728). In the district 
of Bromberg the number of those speaking German decreased about 
1,800 (from 51,613 to 49,849); those speaking Polish about 600 (from 
53,013 to 52,461); those speaking both German and Polish likewise 
about 600. The percentage of the retrogression of the German 
nationality is apparently large throughout, 
it is apparent that in this case there is no question of momentary 
displacements, explained by certain spontaneous actions. Evidently 
more Germans than Poles have emigrated. The numbers of common 
schools alone give no absolute standard for the relations of school chil- 
dren and population, as higher and intermediate schools are propor- 
tionately more largely attended by Germans than by Poles. In Upper 
Silesia, too, the number of Polish-speaking children has greatly 
inereased. In 1886 there were no Polish pupils in the city schools of 
the districts of Ratibor and Leobschiitz; in 1891 there was quite a con- 
siderable number. In the rural districts of the district of Kreuzburg 
there was a decided increase of Poles. In the entire district of Oppeln 
the number of German-speaking children diminished by more than 
4,000, while the Polish increased by 3,500, as was also the case with 
the number of those speaking both German and Polish. In Upper 
Silesia, also, the displacement is strong. Conditions in West Prussia 
have remained about the same. Displacement in individual instances

are less important, and have not all taken place with a disadvantage to 
Germans. In the remaining provinces the scattered population not 
German shows a greater or less diminution, as, for instance, on the 
Danish frontier. Most undoubtedly in cases where the greatest stress 
is laid upon Germanization, progress compared with retrogression sinks 
into insignificance. . 
In conclusion, the expenditures incurred by Prussian common schools 
may be mentioned.

Or, $34,801,624.25. 
A question of special interest is, In what proportions do State and 
community meet these demands? The State contributes only a small 
amount (2,000,000 marks) to the expenditures for buildings. Since the 
enactment of the school-tax law it defrays a large part of the expenses 
for salaries. 
Forty-one per cent, or 31,750,000 of the 74,736,000 marks, which the 
teachers draw for salaries are paid out of the State treasury, namely, 
5,835,000 marks allowances for rent and 25,549,000 marks from the 
State school tax. Communities, landed proprietors and societies, that 
is, those obliged to support schools, contribute 32,500,000 marks, or 42 
per cent. The sum of 1,379,000 marks was raised by tuition fees; school 
funds and endowments yielded 6,544,000; churches, ete., contributed 
2,476,000 marks. Besides, the State pays male and female teachers 
8,432,000 marks for increased salaries on account of age and meritorious 
service. The relations are very dissimilar in cities and the country. 
While in cities the State contributes only 274 per cent, or 9,215,000 
marks, toward salaries, and 1,651,000 marks for. increase of salaries on 
account of age, only 22,295,000 marks, or 663 per cent, remain to be 
paid by communities and other local authorities. In the rural districts 
the State pays much more than half the amount of salaries, namely, 
22,544,000 marks, or 55 per cent, and besides this 6,781,000 marks for 
increased salaries on account of age. There remained only 10,281,000" 
marks, or 25 per cent, to be paid by the local authorities. In the year 1885 
the sum of 35,291,000 marks toward teachers’ salaries had to be raised 
for rural schools, besides 6,136,000 marks for tuition fees, which item had 
dwindled in 1891 to 346,000 marks. The decrease in the communal bur- 
den amounts to about 19,000,000 marks in round numbers. The lowest 
amounts from communities, great land owners and societies are collected 
in East Prussia; next in order come Pomerania and the districts of 
     
-P-A-G-E-272
  224 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94, 
Erfurt, Hildesheim, and Cassel. The following figures show what small 
amounts are collected in manyrural communities: In the district of 
Ortelsburg 169 teachers receive salaries amounting to 127,000 marks; 
the rural communities in the district of Pillkallen pay 2,162 marks 
(80,000 marks are necessary for 106 teachers); Darkehmen pays 1,668 
marks (61,000 marks for 79 teachers are required); Goldap, 1,461 
(86,000 marks for 112 teachers); Oletzko, 1,860 (83,000 for 106 teachers) ; 
Lyck, 2,163 (93,000 for 117 teachers); Litzen 722 (71,000 for 94 teachers) ; 
Sensburg, 868 (83,000 for 108 teachers). We see that in these districts 
of East Prussia the teachers’ salaries are paid almost entirely by the 
State. Similar conditions exist in most of the Pomeranian country 
communities. The district of Demmin contributes 2,596 marks (88,000 
marks are requisite for 105 teachers); Anklam, 525 (51,000 for 61 
teachers); Pyritz, 1,377 (82,000 for 97 teachers); Naugard, 1,458 (87,000 
for 105 teachers; Greifenberg, 966 (67,000 for 85 teachers); Regenwald, 
568 (80,000 for 98 teachers); Belgrad, 2,319 (75,000 for 97 teachers); 
Rummelsburg, 1,008; Bublitz, 878; Biitow, 501; Lauenburg, 1,527. 
Similar and somewhat higher numbers are indicative of the conditions 
in the provinces of Saxony, Hanover and Hesse-Nassau. The western 
provinces show quite favorable results from country communities also. 
The following figures show how much communities in the country 
and landed proprietors owe to the relief afforded by the school law of 
1888, not to mention the cessation of tuition fees. Country communi- 
ties contributed in 1885 to teachers’ salaries in the district of Kénigs- 
berg 867,000 marks; in 1891 only 128,000; in Gumbinnen, during 1885, 
613,000, butin 1891 only 44,000; in Danzig, in 1885, 392,000, but in 1891 
ouly 92,000; in Marienwerder, in 1885, 622,000, but in 1891 only 144,000; 
in Stettin, in 1835, 172,000, in 1891 only 43,000; in Céslin, in 1885, 
206,000, but only 52,000 in 1891; in Stralsund, in 1885, 141,000, but in 
1891 only 18,000; in Posen, in 1885, 602,000, but in 1891 only 176,000; 
in Bromberg, in 1885, 304,000, but in 1891 only 55,000. The equaliza- 
tion of expenditures in cities caused by the law referred to can hardly 
be compared with the foregoing figures. In most districts the expend- 
itures of cities for teachers’ salaries have increased, despite State 
appropriations, and only in few cases in proportion to the increase of 
population. In 1885 cities expended altogetier for teachers’ salaries 
21,003,000 marks; in 1891, 22,295,000. 
The sums paid for common schools are considerable. Official statis- 
ticians calculate an average of 29.74 marks, or $7.08, for every child. The 
accuracy of this calculation may be doubted. However, let us take for 
granted that the figures are approximately correct. Secondary educa- 
tional institutions, with only 150,000 students, cost 31,500,000 marks, of 
which 14,500,000 are raised by tuition fees, so that each pupil still 
requires 113 marks ($26.89) additional. The Prussian universities, for 
about 12,000 students, require 7,500,000 marks State appropriation, an 
average of 625 marks ($148.75) per head. In comparison the demands
-P-A-G-E-273
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 225 
of elementary common schools are modest. Even the schools dearest 
to the people, the intermediate, are far more expensive than the ele- 
mentary. Each one of their pupils costs 91 marks ($21.66), or about 50 
marks after deduction of tuition fees. 
The improvement of the common schools is, and ever will be, a ques- 
tion of finances. This the managers and councilors of the State admin- 
istration know very well. The old adage is frequently quoted, y 
Money which on schools is spent 
Brings in the highest rate per cent. 
PART II.—THE COMMON-SCHOOL TEACHERS OF PRUSSIA. 
This is intended to be a presentation of comparative statistics relative 
to the position of Prussian common school teachers, women included. 
It is the custom of our time to deal with subjects impersonally. A 
“government” is praised or condemned when only an individual or sev- 
eral officials are meant. We speak of the “church” when we mean the 
clergy, and of the “school” when the question refers to teachers alone. 
This manner of expression is as just on the one hand as it appears 
open to objection on the other. By identifying officers with the insti- 
tution whose representatives they are, the intention evidently is to 
characterize their full importance; a more significant background is 
thereby given to matters pertaining to them personally. On the other 
hand, we express ourselves impersonally when we do not desire to ele- 
ate the institution concerned. Knowing, however, that the institution 
‘in itself is a phantom, that it is and becomes something only through 
the persons connected with it, we speak most frigidly about its signifi- 
cance, but when occasion offers give the persons concerned with it a 
rebuff. Many speeches and publications overflowing with good will 
for the “school” manifest this temper. The present Prussian minister 
of education, Dr. Bosse, strongly emphasized the insufficiency of the 
teachers’ salaries, and assisted the “school reformers” in city councils 
by telling them very distinctly and in plain language where and what 
the real force of the public system of instruction is. When he sub- 
mitted his bill on the “Improvement of common schools and salaries 
of teachers, male and female” (the title was sufficiently expressive of 
the minister’s meaning), he spoke as follows in his introductory speech, 
January 10, 1893: 
The Royal Government has arrived at the conviction that a systematic grada- 
tion and a proportionate regulation and fixedness of the salaries of common school 
teachers, especially the increase just necessary for teachers in the poorer distrists, 
is altogether impossible under the provisions of the law of May 26, 1887. It recog- 
nizes more and more in this law—I am speaking advisedly—the danger of a stand- 
still and the decay of a uniform development, not only of the system of compensation, 
but of our entire public school system. * * * Ishall confine myself only to the 
general conclusion that the law of May 26, 1887, leads, and must lead, to conse- 
quences which neither the Royal Government nor the Diet foresaw, or could have 
foreseen; to consequences which most seriously imperil the Prussian school system 
throughout.

When Deputy Rickert demanded energetic efforts in behalf of the 
instruction in domestic economy, Dr. Bosse replied that he must first 
procure “daily bread” for the schools. He doubtless used the term 
in a different sense from the one applied above. Soon afterwards this 
debate was most forcibly exemplified. The city of Elbing, which has 
59 teachers (among them 8 women) for 5,021 children, and pays most 
meager salaries, wanted to establish a school of domestic economy, 
after the model at Marienburg, The minister refused his sanction, to 
the satisfaction of all true friends of education. 
A great deal of insincerity attaches to efforts in behalf of schools, 
efforts that appear to teachers like the cat going around the hot brothin 
the tale of old. That is the one reason why teachers as a body oppose 
many “reforms” often more directly than by mere criticism. Yet 
teachers should be identified with current movements. In the midst 
of the stream they can always keep up with the current. They can 
also, if necessary, build a dam and turn aside the stream into a direc- 
tion in which it will spread greater blessing. Some educational journals 
in Germany believe even now that they may and must ridicule reforms 
like instruction in domestic economy and manual training. They mean 
to reclaim the school for “ general” education in Pestalozzi’s name. 
Pestalozzi, however, united, as is known, his educational system most 
intimately with practical, useful work—spinning cotton. Outside 
reformers are often better disciples of Pestalozzi than their antago- 
nists. For this reason it is no cause for surprise to hear that teachers 
with such views meet with strong opposition from the public, who 
judge the teacher’s attitude in the same way in which the resistence 
of many ecclesiastics to religious reformsis judged. Teachers must not 
decline but accept what is of value, and admit what is new with the 
greatest generosity, and expose the shortcomings of what should have 
been accomplished. Otherwise they refute idealists without convincing 
‘ materialists. Both are led to an unhealthy fellowship instead of solic- 
iting the aid of the former, so that with their help they may take pos- 
session of more defensible positions. 
“Impersonal” school advocates can not be told too often that theix 
endeavors are unnecessary labor, if not dissimulation. “The teacher 
constitutes the school.” Undoubtedly this is an aphorism, but aphor- 
isms prove nothing. They are correct only if we add a long series of 
presuppositions, restrictions, and explanations, a condition which, of 
course, does not apply to imperative demands arising in public. Con- 
sequently public discussion becomes proverbial wisdom that is only 
half true and detrimental when an enrichment of general ideas, but 
not when a distinct action is aimed at, which is possible only by means 
of an agreement of a few well-instructed persons. Then there are 
eatchwords which, when rightly used, strike like lightning. Such a 
one is the old phrase: “The teacher is the school.” Most assuredly. 
The teacher in great measure truly makes the school. Where is there
-P-A-G-E-275
  
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 227 
an excellent school without a teacher professionally inspired? There 
isnone. Professional zeal, fidelity to the duty of vocation, and peda- 
gogical tact, can partly overcome existing miserable conditions; whereas 
the most excellent external conditions can in no single part replace 
the missing good teacher. This fact is fully appreciated by the chief 
Prussian school authorities, as has been already mentioned. The min- 
ister of education, Dr. Bosse, has not only repeated and expressed in 
warmest terms how highly he estimates the personality of the teacher, 
but has also pointed to the sad circumstances that handicap the edu- 
eator in the exercise of his official duties. 
Undoubtedly every man, hence also every teacher, is in a great meas- 
ure himself responsible for the part he takes in professional or in civil 
life. In educational work, much or little can be made out of natural 
powers. Self-discipline, self-stimulation, self-education, and self- 
restraint do much to cover many outward deficiencies. But, with the 
majority, these stimuli soon decline, if legislation and administration of 
education do not do what they are bound to do to create an excellent 
universally well-equipped corps of teachers. 
The efficient teacher can not be conjtiired up by magic like a Deus ex 
machina; when considered from purely personal individual worth, he 
_is a product of all the influences brought to bear upon him during his 
youth at home and at school, during the time of his professional devel- 
opment and during his professional life. Excellent teachers are neither 
instantaneously created by bureaucratic mandate, nor are they brought 
forth by more or less seasonable effusions on the virtues of a teacher; 
but they are the result of long, continuous solicitude and provident care; 
a fruit maturing only long after the sowing. What Dinter long ago 
affirmed of the school question is true even now. Higher education for 
the teacher, better salaries and professional supervision are vital ques- 
tions to-day more than ever before. Meanwhile in the political life of 
modern time are added full political freedom and a position of the pro- 
fessional body unobstructed by exceptional laws, i. e., in school admin- 
istration, provisory care of schools, as well as in civil life. 
In many respects we must consider the personnel of the teaching 
force in our solicitude for education. It may be of much greater 
importance to a school from what kind of a family the teacher comes, 
what kind of a wife he has, how he educates or rather can educate his 
own children, how his family dresses, keeps house and recreates, and 
what social position he and his family occupy than how the schoolroom 
is furnished, the schcolhouse built, the system of heating is arranged, 
ete. Conclusively, in everything the man as such makes the things, 
and excellence can be accomplished by excellent men only. 
The statistics which furnish the material for the following showing 
can suggest nothing concerning the internal momenta of the teacher’s 
personality. They necessarily deal with outward facts, But in this 
connection reference will be made beyond bare numerical material to 
causes and effects that can not be expressed in figures.
-P-A-G-E-276
  228 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
Individuals and professionals are not unjustly judged according to 
their family connection. Oftentimes unconsciously a value is set upon 
education at home, against which we certainly can advance no objec- 
tions. It is evident that consideration is thus given to caste; but even 
such unpleasant things as family pride and class prejudice are partly 
justifiable. 
What is the parentage of teachers in Prusia? : 
It is an old prejudice designedly nurtured by true friends that 
male teachers are recruited from the lower classes, and in this respect 
are not on a level with female teachers. This opinion has already 
become so firmly rooted that even teachers themselves express it in 
good faith, though not always opportunely and to the benefit of the 
cause. Statistics,! in so far as they refer to the personal and private 
relations of teachers require a different view of the case. 
The official statements concerning the parentage of teachers gen- 
erally distinguish 6 main groups: (A) Agriculture, cattle raising, for- 
esters, and hunters; (B) mining, civil engineering; (C) commerce and 
transit; (D) domestic service; (E) imperial and State service, ete., 
and liberal professions; (F) without any profession or specified pur- 
suit. Of these groups D and F need not be considered at all. Out 
of 62,272 male teachers they averaged between 202 and 854, and out 
of 8,439 female teachers, between 11 and 203. The remaining 4 groups 
are separated into 28 subdivisions, further distinguished by: (a) Inde- 
pendents, including business managers and superintendents; (b) audit- 
ors, commissioners, and supervisors; and (c) assistants and “hands.” 
An attempt at social definition, we see, enters into very minute details. 
The following statement is a general result. The 62,272 male and 
8,439 female teachers are descended as follows:

These numbers prove the already well-established fact that the 
majority—more than one-third—of common school teachers belong to 
the peasantry or agricultural class. In former times this was even 
more generally the case. Villages with small and moderately large 
farms were the best recruiting grounds of preparatory institutions; 
lately, however, they have proved less available. Railroads have 
brought cities closer together, and thereby opened to the peasant’s 
son the gymnasium on the one hand and commerce and industries on 
the other. Military service, too, at present, engages a comparatively

large proportion of the surplus peasant population. In consquence the 
authorities fail in their purpose of trying to draw from the villages 
boys for normal education. A preponderance of the peasant element 
among teachers does the school no harm, for generally only gifted 
members of peasants’ families adopt this profession. The most excel- 
lent acquisitions are received from the agricultural classes, as also 
undoubtedly many impractical idealists who with difficulty find their 
right places in the world. Later, when they understand that the 
recruiting officers, in which capacity ecclesiastics and preparatory : 
instructors specially officiate, have not sufficiently enlightened them 
on the important point of material success, and on the civil and pro- 
fessional position of teachers, their pleasure in life and vocation is 7 
not increased. In Eastern Prussia female teachers seldom come from 
rural districts, in western Prussia more frequently; on the whole, there 
are only half as many women as men teachers. Among both sexes | 
recruits belong to independent agricultural families; 86.5 per cent of ! 
18,840 male, and 89.3 per cent of 1,173 female teachers. The fathers of | 
1,399 male and 105 female teachers were classed among auditors, commis- | 
sioners, and supervisors; those of 1,548 male and 36 female teachers,. 
among assistants and “hands” in agriculture. | 
The second strongest group are mechanics, represented by 28.5 per . 
cent men and 31.4 per cent women teachers. It may be here remarked | 
that the industries of clothing and cleaning (tailors, shoemakers, etc.) 7 
proportionately furnish the most teachers (4,034 men and 401 women); | 
next to them are builders (2,372 men and 414 women). | 
Commerce furnishes more female (18.4 per cent) than male teachers 
(9 per cent); 2,234 male and 808 female teachers belonged to families | 
of merchants and commercial agents. Hotel proprietors and tavern 3 
keepers furnished 1,745 male and 171 female teachers. | 
In these groups, men as well as women teachers are not at all con- 
spicuous among the lower strata of the respective occupations, as the 
following statement shows:

Hence it may be said that in so far as the agricultural and industrial 
classes augment the number of teachers, they offer recruits from social 
strata which enjoy satisfactory material existence. From this point of 
view the friends of the teaching profession can hardly, as has been 
repeatedly done, raise any objection to equitable demands on the part 
of the teachers. In so far, these statistics have great and practical 
value. 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
    230 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
That the lower strata of officeholders, from which 25.7 per cent men 
and 32.1 per cent women teachers come, likewise furnish only a propor- 
tionately small number of teachers, can be found just as satisfactorily 
.from statistics. The classes specified by (a) independents, supplied 
13,912 male and 1,878 female teachers; those by (b), auditors, commis- 
sioners, and supervisors, being 1,629 and 730; those by (c), clerks and 
assistants, being only 490 and 102. Still, these numbers prove little 
respecting men teachers. The greater number of these (13,008) belong 
to teachers’ families, which also supply a considerable number of female 
teachers (874); while other officeholders manifestly force their sons to 
become teachers. It is of interest that imperial and State service fur- 
nished a very considerable number of female teachers (1,038). The 
“privy counselor’s daughter” is no isolated figure in common schools, 
though not so frequent as we incline to believe from appearances in some 
large cities. The ministry furnished 183, the army and navy 130 female 
teachers. The number of men teachers belonging to the last groups 
were 201 and 176, 
As concerns the proportion of male and female teachers, details differ 
to some extent from what we might infer from the general statements. 
Thus, for instance, in agriculture, there is the difference whether the 
“independent farmer” be a peasant or landed proprietor; and in trade 
or industry, whether the one referred to be a merchant or small trades- 
man. Statistics say nothing about these facts; they only point out 
the formal differences. Neither must we lay much stress upon them, 
nor, above all things, deduce unfavorable conclusions for one or the 
other sex. As a rule, the richest families do not allow their children 
to pursue the profession of teaching... Among the wealthier strata the 
motive, almost without exception, lies in material relations. A landed 
proprietor, manufacturer, or merchant reduced in circumstances may 
stand lower than a rising peasant, mechanic, or tradesman. A palpa- 
ble difference between families of male and female teachers is noticeable 
only in imperial, State, and communal officers. These furnish only 
1,803, or 2.9 per cent of male, and 1,038, or 12.3 per cent, of female 
teachers. This fact, as well as other proportions of descent not to be 
enlarged upon here, often plays an important part in the financial and 
professional position of both sexes. 
More striking differences come to light when we consider the two 
ereeds. The proportions are as follows: In 1891 there were 22,199 
(92.6 per cent) male and 3,527 (7.4 per cent) female Protestant teachers, 
in contrast to 17,737 (78.5 per cent) male and 4,853 (21.5 per cent) 
female Catholic teachers. In the former case female teachers consti- 
tuted only one-fourteenth; in the latter two-ninths of the totals repre- 
senting each creed. But how about the parentage? A great many of 
the Catholic female teachers belong to the agricultural class; i. e., 1,042, 
or 21.5 per cent, in contrast to 271, or 7.7 per cent, of Protestant teachers. 
That a peasant’s daughter in the one case so often and in the other so
-P-A-G-E-279
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 231 
rarely attains prominence is sufficiently explained, partly by the fact 
that a disproportionately larger number of Catholic female teachers are 
engaged in the country (2,540, or 52.3 per cent, against 574, or 16.3 per 
cent, Protestant), and partly by the fact that Protestant teachers are 
educated principally at institutions affiliated with girls’ higher schools, 
whereas Catholies are educated at special normal seminaries.' Notice- 
able, but less striking, is the preponderance of Catholic teachers whose 
parents are devoted to industrial pursuits; i. e., 1,894, or 39 per cent, 
contrasted with 753, or 21.3 per cent, Protestant teachers. In the group 
of commerce Catholics are in the minority relatively considered, namely, 
776, or 16 per cent, while 734, or 20.6 per cent, are Protestants. The 
Catholics are fully eclipsed by the Protestants in the last group (impe- 
rial, State, and communal officeholders). This last group has 1,005, or 
20.7 per cent, Catholic, and 1,695, or 48 per cent, Protestant female 
teachers. These differences are less pronounced among the men 
teachers. The numbers are as follows: Agriculture supplied 15,136 
Protestant and 6,649 Catholic teachers. The number of Catholics is 
comparatively greater, particularly in reference to independent farmers. 
Industrial pursuits supplied 12,572 Protestant and 5,082 Catholic male 
teachers. The percentage (20 per cent) is almost the same on both 
sides, and identical with that of commerce (3,788 Protestant and 1,693 
Catholic male teachers), while officeholders are less strongly repre- 
sented by Catholics—4,026 against 1,193 Protestant teachers. It is of 
particular interest that a smaller percentage of Catholic teachers have 
fathers who are school-teachers—3,225 against 9,753 Protestants. The 
larger influx to the Catholic ministry amply explains this fact. 
Similar records from earlier years do not exist. Comparisons would 
throw an interesting light on the development of the profession and 
thereby on common schools themselves. An old school principal, Mr. 
Fritz Oehmke, of Cammin, Pomerania, asserted in a late publication 
that teachers formerly were recruited from the better classes. He thus 
writes: 
I shall not suppress the fact that preparatory teachers formerly enjoyed the advan- 
tage of educating talented, earnest youths for the teachers’ profession. If parents 
mostly of the middle classes noticed that their sons combined a ready understanding 
with earnestness of character, they decided upon their becoming teachers; and if 
the local teacher and minister agreed with them their resolution was carried into 
effect. Out of such material something could be made; but how do we stand to-day 
with few exceptions? Talented children of well-to-do parents choose every profes- 
sion before that of teaching. If children of such parents are of somewhat limited 
capacity, and in addition physically weak, the impression is that they can still 
become teachers. Formerly, poor people did not dare to think of their sons becom- 
ing teachers; now, their ambition is not to raise their children to be day-laborers 
like themselves, but to make teachers of them, that they may live like gentlemen. 
Even if they have no money for their education, they know that their children will 
be provided for in STEP aNSy, institutions and seminaries. 
    
LA present there exist in earns three Protestant Gein, Drossig, Augusten- 
burg), five Catholic (Miinster, Paderborn, Montabaur, Sarburg, Xanten), and two 
nonsectarian (Trier, Posen) normal seminaries.

In judging the whole character of the pamphlet the author can not 
be taken too seriously, and Dr. Bosse’s words that he could not under- 
take to guarantee the support of common education would, in conse- 
quence, be more significant. 
Statistics furnish the same conclusions for male and female teachers 
of intermediate schools. Results on the whole are the same, only 
fewer teachers belong to families actively engaged in agriculture. 
Fathers of the 2,955 male and 1,310 female teachers in intermediate 
and higher female schools are classed as follows: 
  
    
  
       Teachers,

C. Commerce.........-. 313 227 
D. Officcholders, teachers, liberal professions - 988 733 
  
In this case 529 male and 79 female teachers belonged to families of 
common school teachers. The social position of the fathers within 
these groups was the same as among teachers of common schools. 
The results are the following figures: Male teachers, (a) 2,480, (b) 284, 
(c) 191; female teachers, (a) 1,075, (b) 210, (c) 25. The preponder- 
ance of officeholders’ children in this division is evident, particularly 
among female teachers, of whom 304 were daughters of actual office- 
holders, 94 of parsons, and 97 of teachers of secondary schools. 
Of great importance for the official action as well as nonofficial influ- 
ence of a profession is the average age of its members. A class like 
that of privy counselors or other higher govermental officials receives 
a certain prestige from the gray hairs of its members. Transgressions 
among them are rare, and moreover, it represents a positive view of 
life, a conservative one. In a class, however, in which the youthful 
element predominates social influence is greatly jeopardized; at all 
events, the whole class feels perhaps too strongly the impetus of these 
fresh forces, whose influence manifests itself in unguarded words and 
rash actions. Youth most certainly has the ascendency among teach- 
ers, as the following statement shows:

EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 233 
That “youth” is so strongly represented in the teaching profession is 
probably not generally known. At most one-sixth of the male teachers 
are younger than 25 years of age, and two-fifths are younger than 30. 
Male teachers up to the thirty-fifth year are in the majority. In com- 
parison with male female teachers number fewer between the ages of 
20 and 25 years, but more between 25 and 30 years, and strikingly 
more in the next five years. A comparison of the absolute differences 
between the sexes on this point would be of little value. If there 
should be a war between “the young and the old,” the former would 
have the advantage of numbers, particularly im the country. A num- 
berof deplorable occurrences always taken advantage of by opponents 
of the teaching profession are self-explained by the foregoing figures; 
for if the lower five years were abandoned, i. e., if teachers were, in 
the ages mentioned, still occupied in educating themselves, or acting as 
substitutes under supervision, all in all the result would be a gain. 
While the number of young teachers is large, that of old teachers is 
small. That only 2.54 per cent reach the age of 65 years in teaching 
proves that the duration of life and preservation of strength are very 
limited among teachers. The increase of teachers’ positions in the last 
forty years must be taken into consideration when judging the figures. 
It is interesting to note that cities have proportionately fewer old 
teachers than the country. The 446 teachers above 65 years of 
age are only 2.15 per cent of city teachers; the 1,135 country teach- 
ers of the same age are 2.73 per cent. The city teachers over 50 
years constitute only 16.7 per cent; the country teachers of the same 
age, 18.2 per cent. In this case also the great increase in cities must 
be considered; but it is nevertheless remarkable that of the 2,181 
teachers and principals of Berlin only 1 served more than fifty years, 
only 3 from between forty-five and fifty, only 12 between forty and 
forty-five, and only 38 between thirty-five and forty years. One of the 
districts of Berlin (“‘ Kleine Gaulte”) numbers only 6 principals and 3 
regular teachers at the age of 70 years and above: Prolongation of 
life is therefore hardly to be expected from settling in a large city. 
More important materially than duration of life is the time of service, 
to which the following statement refers:

This table demonstrates the same facts that are brought to light in 
considering duration of life; at the same time a series‘of other truths 
force themselves on our observation, The accumulation in the first 
lines of the above statement is even larger than in the foregoing table. 
The fact that the number of young teachers is proportionately large 
plays an important part in the consideration of salary. Scales of sal- 
ary like those lately adopted in Berlin, according to which pay rapidly! 
increases during the first years of service, have an entirely different 
effect on the whole body of teachers from those long scales, the middle 
of which is reached late in life, and the end rarely ever. The highest 
ratios between the ages of 25 and 40 years should be considered. 
avery salary over and above these has only a problematic value. The 
familiar scales, according to which the highest salary is received after 
forty years of service, do not represent the facts very truthfully. If 
in all Prussian cities collectively only 710 out of 20,727 teachers serve 
that time, it means the institution of a lottery setting a premium upon 
physical endurance, and not fixing an aim attainable under ordinary 
circumstances. If we start the scale from the twenty-fifth year of life, 
the last increase in salary should be made at the thirtieth year of 
service, or possibly at the twenty-fifth. 
The number of veterans still in office after fifty years of service is small 
(247, or 0.4 per cent), and has essentially decreased in later years, since 
the enactment of the pension law. In 1871 there were 540, or 1.09 per 
cent of 49,594 teachers who had served more than fifty years. During 
the same year 6.48 per cent had served more than forty years, in 1891 
only 4.4 per cent. At present many an aged teacher, grown old in his 
profession, can retire earlier. During the years 1886-1891 the number of 
pensioners increased from 3,928 to 5,691. For the most part pensioners 
die soon; in May, 1886, they numbered 3,592; reduced to 1,627 in 1891. 
The different provinces present striking differences in regard to the 
time of service. In Berlin teachers who had served from one to five 
years (225) formed only 10.3 per cent, in East Prussia 22.22 per cent of 
the totality. East Prussia (31) and Hanover (40) have the greatest 
number of old teachers; Berlin (1 who had served over fifty years), 
Schleswig-Holstein (2), West Prussia (6), Westphalia (10), and Rhenish 
Prussia (only 28 who had served fifty years out of 8,355) have very few. 
The small proportion of female teachers of long service is explained by 
the fact that until1864, with very few exceptions, only Rhenish Prussia 
admitted female teachers intocommon schools. Berlin followed in 1857.

a Eight-elevenths, or 72 per cent, of the children are under 18. 
Cities and country present very little difference. The marriage ques- 
tion is affected to some extent by the fact that teachers under 25 years 
of age are more numerous in the country (8,325, or 20.04 per cent) than 
in cities (2,080, or 10.03 per cent). On an average, country teachers 
marry sooner than their city colleagues. In cities the number of teach- 
ers married before the completion of their twenty-fifth year amounts to 
104, or 5.26 per cent of the whole class at this age; in the country, to 481, 
or 6.13 per cent. Between 25 and 30 years of age, 2,149 (42.5 per cent) 
are married and 2,846 single; in the eountry, 4,871 (54.12 per cent) are 
married and only 4,060 single; between 30 and 35 years of age, 2,561 city 
teachers, or 73.25 per cent, are married and 868 single; in the country, 
5,148 (83.30 per cent) are married and 921 are single. The number of 
bachelors over 50 is quite small. Altogether there are 423—in cities 
119, and 234 in the country—which constitute about 0.7 per cent of the 
totality, and hardly compare with the married teachers or widowers 
older than 50 and numbering about 10,582.
-P-A-G-E-284
  
  236 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
Statistics also record the number of living children. Altogether 
there are 123,048. Every marriage averages almost 3 children (2.9); 
2.4 for cities (34,427 children) and 3.2 for the country, showing no} 
insignificant difference in this respect either. . 
We can not pass over these figures without recurring to the early 
marriages of teachers, for a long time a favorite theme of the conserva- 
tive press and even in the Diet. Dr. Bosse has given this subject also 
its true value. It is hardly to be commended, but easily explained by 
the existing circumstances, that of the 10,405 teachers whose age does 
not exceed 25 years, 585 (5.62 per cent) are already married. It is not 
even explainable why 104 out of those 585 are city teachers. The fact 
remains, however, that out of 19 teachers of that age 1 decides upon 
so early a marriage. In the country 1 out of 16 enters the married 
state at that early age. The number of such marriages will positively 
decrease as soon as the Government more firmly carries out the prin- 
ciple of placing the youngest teachers rarely if at all in independent 
positions in which marriage is often a necessity. Further on we do not 
notice too great a haste in marrying. As the foregoing statement 
shows, there are rather a considerable number of middle-aged bachelors, 
while the number of unmarried old men is not large. 
A comparison of the aforementioned numbers with those of the 
statistics of the entire population is not only interesting but of impor- 
tance in-judging the whole subject. This is not the place to institute 
comparisons with allied professions, as the necessary foundations are 
wanting. A smaller percentage of teachers as a rule enter upon mar- 
ried life than the average population over 20 years of age. Whereas 
in the entire population of Prussia the number of unmarried men is 
only 46.7 per cent of the married, or 31.86 per cent of the entire male 
population over 20 years of age, the number of bachelor teachers is 
49.8 per cent of the married, or 33.25 per cent of the totality. (Widowers 
are not included in either case.) This preponderance of bachelors 
among teachers applies exclusively to those under 25 years of age. 
While on an average 7.75 per cent of males between 20 and 25 years 
of age are married, there are only 5.62 per cent of teachers of that age 
married. At a more advanced age the proportions are reversed. 
Between the ages of 25 and 30 years an average of 48.5 per cent of| 
men are married, and exactly 50 per cent of teachers; between the ages 
of 30 and 35 years the average is 76.6 and 79.9 per cent of teachers. 
The number of teachers’ widows is disproportionately high. While 
there is 1 widow to every 3.33 married teachers, or 5.25 teachers in 
general, the number of widows in the entire population is notably less; 
i. e., 1 widow to every 4 marriages, or to every 6 men above 20 years of| 
age. The reasons for this state of the case may be the early mortality 
among teachers, and the disinclination and meager prospect of widows 
for a second marriage.

In considering personal relations ‘of the teaching profession, the 
examinations deserve to be mentioned as an important point. The 
62,272 male teachers and principals are thus divided according to the 
examinations:

      Of the 8,439 female teachers, 6,011 were examined for common schools, 
2,107 for girls’ higher schools, and 24 for principals’ positions; 39 had 
not been examined as yet. The remaining 258 (204 examined and 54 
not examined) were fully employed industrial teachers. Conspicuous 
differences are noticeable between the creeds. Catholic teachers (17,737) 
constitute 28.5 per cent of the totality; they number only 142 (20.9 per 
cent) of examined intermediate school teachers, and 326 (20.3. per cent) 
of principals. Catholic women teachers (4,843) constitute 57.5 per cent 
of the totality; of them 430 took the examination for girls’ higher 
schools. With Protestant women teachers the majority (1,635) are 
examined for girls’ higher schools, the minority (1,599) for common 
schools. 
An interesting comparison is furnished by the teachers of interme- 
diate and girls’ higher schools. In these institutions 468 teachers 
“examined for intermediate schools” are employed against 1,348 exam- 
ined for common schools only. The majority of “intermediate school 
teachers,” therefore, remain true to common schools. In intermediate 
schools, moreover, corresponding to the small number of Catholic pupils, 
the Catholic element sinks into greater minority (2,664 Protestant and 
281 Catholic male teachers, 1,190 Protestant and 113 Catholic female 
teachers), so that in the event of preferment, Catholic teachers are at 
an evident disadvantage, the greater, since a corresponding remunera- 
tion in common schools does not follow; on the contrary, the unfortu- 
nate law of the 26th of May, 1887, that paralyzes the State, Catholic 
districts are again forced into stagnation. 
The question of sex not only belongs to a presentation of the subject 
of the teaching profession, but may in fact be considered one of the 
most important features. As stated before, the two creeds present 
entirely different results in the numerical comparison of the sexes. 
The proportion is unequal in the separate provinces, too. The follow- 
ing table shows the results for cities and country:

Besides these 1 other Christian of different faith, and 58 Jewish (40 
in Berlin) regular female teachers, and 207 assistants hold positions. 
The eastern part of the State has throughout a few female teachers. 
They are confined to three provinces: Berlin, Westphalia, and Rhen- 
ish Prussia, which together have 5,815 female teachers, or 68.4 per 
cent of the totality, while these provinces employ only 14,808, or 23.8 
per cent, of the male teachers in the monarchy. 
The two creeds offer material for comparison. Collectively, there 
are 62,272 male to 8,439 female teachers; consequently 1 woman to more 
than 7 men; in other words, female teachers constitute 12 per cent of 
the teaching profession. Protestant schools number 3,527 female to 
44,199 male teachers, a proportion of 2 to 25, respectively, or female 
teachers constituted 7.4 per cent of the totality. Catholie schools 
employ 17,737 male to 4,853 female teachers, a proportion of 2 female 
to less than 7 male teachers; in other words, female teachers consti- 
tuted 21.5 per cent of the totality. Protestant female teachers officiate 
principally in cities; of the 3,527, only 574 hold positions in the country. 
On the other hand, the greater number (2,540) of Catholic female 
teachers fill positions in the country. The inequality in the distribu- 
tion of female teachers of both creeds is more noticeable in the sta- 
tistics of single provinces and districts than in those referring to the 
State. The city schools in the district of Miinster employ 41 Protes- 
tant male and 11 female teachers. On the other hand, Catholic female 
teachers are in the majority in the same district; there are 115 male to 
136 femaleteachers, The Protestant city schoolsin the district of Minden 
employ 241 male and 19 female teachers; the Catholic, 70 male and 60 
female teachers. The district of Arnsberg numbers 613 male and 130 
female teachers in Protestant city schools, and 286 male and 281 female 
in Catholic schools. The following figures refer to the city schools of 
Rhenish Prussia:

  The difference in country schools is strikingly greater. In the Prot- 
estant rural schools the 547 female teachers constitute 2 per cent. of the 
totality (29,269); in the Catholic, on the other hand, with five times as 
many female teachers and three-sévenths as many male (12,164), the 
female teachers constitute 17 per cent of all the teachers. The two 
western provinces again bring out this difference most prominently.

“In Westphalia the number of Protestant men teachers in rural schools 
is greater by 300 than the Catholic; the number of Protestant women 
teachers, on the other hand, amounts to little less than one-fourth of 
the Catholic. In Rhenish Prussia the Protestant country school female 
teachers are numerically not worth noticing, while the Catholic female 
element is almost one-third of the total number. The numbers reported 
from the district of Diisseldorf are particularly important. Although 
there were 203,000 Catholic and only 137,000 Protestant school children, 
the number of Catholic male teachers (1,730) equaled the Protestant 
(1,728). In 1891 Protestant schools numbered only 283, the Catholic 
996 female teachers. 
From 1886 to 1891 the total number of female teachers increased 
from 6,848 to 8,439; hence, by 23.2 per cent; while the number of male 
teachers at the same time advanced only by 7.55 per cent. The increase 
at present particularly affects Protestant teachers (1886, 2,551; 1891, 
3,527, an increase of 40 per cent in five years). In 1886 Catholic female 
teachers numbered 4,233; the increase (14 per cent) was therefore not 
so important. In 1861, in Prussia, 431 Protestant and 1,321 Catholic 
   
-P-A-G-E-288
  240 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
female, and 23,023 Protestant and 10,347 Catholic male teachers were 
engaged in teaching in the common schools. 
The question of female teachers can not be further amplified here, or 
we should be obliged to clear away a heap of worthless superficialities 
and manifest untruths derived from different sources. We may consider 
the increase in the number of positions for women teachers an evidence 
of educational interest, if we are satisfied with superficial reasons. It 
is often a question of securing an income for unmarried women, a 
motive never entirely wanting. The introduction of the woman ques- 
tion is a palpable superficiality. A female teacher displaces a teacher’s 
wife, so that the woman question is. really not promoted a single step. 
However, that is a subject which does not permit of being treated 
secondarily. He who wishes to write on this subject intelligently must 
not be afraid of clearing away errors. From the school standpoint, 
there is much to say on the question, particularly in reference to school 
politics. It is known what great value the Catholic clergy place upon 
the service of women teachers. 
And now to the question of salary. The statistics are so well known 
that we might leave them out, if thereby one of the most essential 
features in a presentation of the condition of Prussian common school 
teachers were not omitted. 
The following report for the year 1891 includes all allowances for 
time of service, exclusive of free dwellings and fuel, or corresponding

The average income in cities is found to be 1,452 marks ($345.57), 
in the country 1,000 marks ($238); cities and country together, 1,203 
marks ($286.31). 
Whoever wishes to acquaint himself better with the import of these 
numbers should consult the proceedings of the Prussian House of 
Deputies from the 10th of January, 1893, and the scheme for the im- 
provement of the common school system and salaries of teachers, male 
and female, in which the minister of education, Dr. Bosse, presented a 
tabulation of these numbers that might have aroused qualms of con- 
science in the most zealous advocates of small salaries. 
The fluctuation of the amounts of teachers’ salaries in Prussia is 
demonstrated in the following table:

The salaries of male and female teachers bear the following ratios = 
In cities, 100 to 69; in the country, 100 to 80; on an average of 100 to. 
79, or 5 to 4. These about correspond to the number of hours employed 
by both sexes, so that the principle, equal pay for men and women, is 
generally carried out with Prussian common schoolteachers. In single- 
instances we of course meet with differences. Oftentimes the young: 
female teacher is proportionately or absolutely better paid than the 
male teacher of equal time of service (Berlin); whereas in more advanced. 
age the male teacher is more liberally paid, a piece of social justice to- 
be found anywhere, except in such ill-regulated conditions as those of 
the capital of Pomerania. This proportion should be increased if male- 
teachers are expected to establish families and male and female teachers: 
to retain the same social standing. 
One of the most interesting tables of all the official returns is the: 
comparison of salary and time of service. Unfortunately, the table 
includes dwellings and fuel; if it referred to salary only it would 
manifest very plain facts. But it answers every purpose as itis. The 
following data, demonstrating the defective regulation of teachers” 
salaries, are plain:

Female teachers, 10 to 40 years of servi 49 | 601 to 750 
These figures are a convincing proof of the inadequate regulation of 
salaries; a female teacher 19 years old with 1,201 to 1,350 marks; a 
male teacher of the same age with 1,501 to 1,650 marks (rural position); 
and next to them a male teacher of 40 to 50, and two others of 30 to 
40 years of service with 451 to 600 marks! Similar incongruities would 
not be permitted to exist among any other elass of public officers. 
The close connection between salary and service is sufficiently known, 
but the practical consequences are not deduced. While the salaries 
of bachelors and female teachers are sufficient to permit even certain 
incidental expenses (traveling, etc.) which other officeholders. with 
corresponding education are allowed in greater measure, teachers with 
families often suffer positive want. The average is, indeed, so regulated 
that a moderately good day-laborer receives almost as good wages as a 
teacher. This can be demonstrated by a simple arithmetical example 
that has, of course, no claim to mathematical exactness. 
According to reports on personal relations, Prussia, in 1891, had 
62,272 male teachers. The salaries for 63,237 positions amount to 
75,020,124 marks ($17,854,789.51), consequently 1,186 marks ($282.27) 
for each position. Sixty-two thousand two pdeed and seventy-two 
teachers would, therefore, clear 62,272 x 1,186 = 73,854,592 marks. This

Nearly a quarter of a million persons are to live on 74,000,000 marks. 
It is true 34,620 children are over 18 years of age, consequently are partly 
self-supporting. Butif we calculate that many of the younger and older 
children must not only be supported but educated, we are not exagger- 
ating if we allow only a bare support for all the children. What is the 
normal sum which a Prussian school-teacher has at his disposal for each

EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 243 
member of his family? If we dividé the salary by the number of 
persons the result is 327 marks ($77.83). But such a calculation is 
| seriously wrong. Bachelors are counted in with 327 marks. If we 
| contrast young and old teachers, allowing each three-fourths of the 
average salary, which corresponds with facts, there remains for the 
205,539 members of country teachers’ families a sum of 56,000,000 marks 
($11,900,000) in round numbers; i. e., 272 marks ($64.74) to a person; 
in round numbers, 75 pfennig or 17 cents a day, or 3.75 marks (89 cents) 
for a teacher’s family, and this leaves no allowance for abnormal cases 
of ten or more members, since in teachers’ families, as in schoolrooms, 
overcrowding is not rare. This belongs to the natural history of Prus- 
sian common school teachers. 
These salaries are not all derived from schools; a not ineconsiderable 
part are derived from church services; another part must be collected 
from the utilization of lands. In 1891 the number of school positions 
united with church offices amounted to 15,430. It is greater on the 
Protestant than on the Catholic side. In the former case, out of 17,737 
teachers only 3,082 held church offices. In cities the two creeds, col- 
lectively, performed between 1,555 and 390; in the country between 
10,793 and 2,692 church service. The payment of church functionaries 
averages greater on the Protestant side; in cities 404, in the country 312 
marks, whereas Catholics received only between 308 and 247 marks. 
Protestant church service is best paid in the communities within the 
district of Gumbinnen (1,191 marks on an average); then follow the 
city positions in the district of Stralsund (850 marks). Last in order 
are Cassel (97 marks), Bromberg (94 marks), and Wiesbaden (72 
marks). Catholic ecclesiastics are paid somewhat better only in the 
communities of Kénigsberg (501 marks) and in the cities of Liegnitz 
(478), Oppeln (472), and Hanover (572 marks), 
A gift of land is connected with 30,684 positions, of which 2,018 are 
in cities. The positions connected with the best land donated are in 
the districts of Kénigsberg, Gumbinnen (4 hectare on an average), the 
province of Hanover (Liineburg and Stade between 74 and 63 hectare); 
the poorest land donations are in Rhenish Prussia, particularly in Aix- 
Ja-Chapelle (one-sixth hectare) and Cologne (one-half hectare). 
The acquisition of a home is of great importance for the welfare of a 
teacher’s family. Unfortunately, in cities, a strong retrogression has 
set in. In 1871 the communities owned 7,017 teachers’ dwellings, of 
which 2,964 were rented; the last statistics numbered only 4,292 house 
owners and 207 tenants. At present, principals only are furnished 
with dwellings. In the country there are 37,654 homes (rented or 
owned) for 41,545 teachers, consequently 3,891 teachers must provide 
their own homes. Only 2,036 dwellings are at the disposal of the 3,166 
female country teachers. A home, the foundation of so many comforts 
in life, is becoming a rarer possession among teachers every day.

In conclusion, an important question for a class of officeholders is, 
How many of them can acquire a leading or self-supporting position? 
There are 41,545 teachers for 30,871 schools. According to the above | 
numbers about 11,000 teachers are between the ages of 20 to 27, hence | 
every country school-teacher can be a principal or have full charge 
of a school himself at the age of 27. On an average, teachers of 60 
years of age and older may become principals with two or more 
assistants; but every country school-teacher between 25 and 50 years of 
age might have a position with one assistant. The ambition to super- 
intend others in their profession is easily realized in the country as 
well as in cities. In 1891 there were 3,871 schools in cities. If the 
appointment of principals went directly according to time of service, 
every teacher 49 years old and over could be rector or principal in Ber- 
lin, despite the great number of schools.. This end could be attained 
at 47 years of age. As the appointment of principals follows from 
other considerations, partly justifiable, rather a large proportion of 
teachers must relinquish the anticipation of practicing their profession 
in an independent or prominent position, a fact fraught with many 
suggestions which explain the proposition of Dérpfeld to introduce 
schools of four classes.

INTRODUCTION. 
The education of the young is a public affair, common to all citizens; 
hence it can flourish only in public schools under the care and manage- 
ment of the entire population, endowed with the prerogatives of self- 
government. 
This conviction is the fundamental thought that has created the 
Berlin common schools, and has guided all efforts toward their perfec- 
tion on the part of the city authorities. The system began on a small 
scale, but it has since assumed the proportions of a stately, well-con- 
structed edifice. In viewing the course of its development two periods 
are distinctly discernible. 
During the first period, from 1826 to 1869, the city authorities grad- 
ually assumed the care of the children of school age by establishing a 
well-organized system of schools and making arrangements for regular 
attendance of all the children of that age. The tuition was either 
gratuitous or a fee had to be paid. However, the common school had 
the unmistakable stamp of a pauper school, which seemed for a time 
indelible, the well-to-do classes of society avoiding them and patroniz- 
ing private schools. 
In the second period, from 1870 to the present time, the public school 
system of Berlin became what it is now, to wit: A common school sys- 
tem in the true American sense of the word. Its exterior and interior 
   
-P-A-G-E-294
  246 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
is well planned in outline; it is capable of being enlarged, and affords 
opportunities for new members to be organically connected with it. Its 
gates are open to the youth of all strata of the population and instruc- 
tion is gratuitous, while the fulfillment of the duty of attendance is 
secured by laws which appear to the community as self-evident as nat- 
ural laws. The common school of Berlin is supported on the prineiple 
that all children, regardless of the wealth or poverty of the parents, 
shall sit side by side in school, and be taught and trained according to 
the same principles of culture and civilization, because this is consid- 
ered the best way for the elevation of the morally forsaken and for 
uniting the different classes of society and establishing a homogeneous 
population. 
Within the second period the year 1878 has especial significance, 
inasmuch as it is the year in which the completion of the system was 
reached. The municipal supervisory organs that are considered neces- 
sary conditions of a sound internal development began their activity 
during that year, and more attention was given to the pedagogical 
management, as well as to a careful revision of the course of study. 
Beginning with that year the common school system increased to 
unheard of dimensions, so that within fifteen years the number of 
school buildings increased from 100 to 200; the number of children 
attending from 79,000 to 180,000; the number of classes from 1,365 to 
over 3,300, and the annual expenditures, exclusive of new buildings, 
increased from 3,890,668 marks to nearly three times that sum, namely, 
to 9,191,327 marks.' This memorial is intended to sketch the last 
period more minutely, but in order to understand and judge it cor- 
rectly a review of the development preceding it is necessary. 
THE COMMON-SCHOOL SYSTEM FROM 1820 TILL 1869. 
The beginning of the Berlin common school system dates from the 
year 1820. In this year the city relieved the State of the care of the 
city poor, and also of the pauper schools. Six pauper schools, with 7 
classes and 500 children, besides 700 children taught in private 
schools—that was the nucleus of the system; up to that year the 
public schools of Berlin were not communal institutions. The children 
of school age attended partly secondary schools, but for the most part 
the numerous graded and ungraded private schools, the educational 
results of which were very meager. The children of the poor had 
been attending schools connected with orphan asylums or chureh con- 
gregations and other corporations; a large number (in 1818 about 
8,000 of 27,000) did not attend any school. 
  
10n the Ist of mee 1894, te pit en of erie was 1s 204, with 3,435 ete (1,690 
boys’ and 1,709 girls’ classes, 35 mixed), and a total of 182,393 children (90,297 boys, 
92,056 gus), the number of teachers 4,138 (203 aes 2,093 men teachers, 1,136 
women teachers, 609 women teachers for women’s handiwork, and 97 assistants); 
the annual expenditures amounted to 9,904,428 marks, to whieh the city treasury 
contributed 9,811,898 marks.

The first important step to a well-organized system supported by the 
community was made in the year 1826. Thecity council passed a reso- 
lution “ to reorganize the pauper schools and extend them so that they 
would satisfy all demands.” A member of the city council became the 
technical leader, whose title was “City school councilor.” He cooper- 
ated with the city deputies and the royal commissioners in framing a 
plan of organization. According to his plan all poor children should 
in future be taught in public city elementary schools. In 1827 the city 
was divided into four “poor districts,” each one of which should in 
future have at least one communal pauper school. The schools were 
named after the number of the district, and this has given rise to the 
nomenclature adhered to to the present day. Since it took a long 
period of years before these city schools could be erected, the attend- 
ance of pauper children was secured by paying tuition for them from 
the city treasury in private and parochial schools. Children of school 
age who were working in factories and shops during the day were 
required to attend evening and afternoon schools. A tuition fee was 
required if the conditions of the parents justified it; if not, the fee 
was remitted. 
Smice the city authorities had taken the publie school system under 
its own care, and had appointed a professional supervisor, the former 
school board was dissolved, and a purely communal committee of 
school administration was appointed, in accordance with the law of 
1808, which provided for the government of cities. This committee 
of the council was promptly confirmed by the authorities of the 
State. On the 1st of August, 1829, the committee began its work; its 
true name is “City school deputation.” The city ordinance which 
called the school committee into existence defined its functions, and 
up to the present day they have not undergone any essential changes, 
although in the course of time its membership has increased in accord- 
ance with the phenomenal increase of the school system and the entire 
city. The committee consists of members of the “magistrat” (the 
upper house of the city legislature) and the common couneil (the lower 
house), of a certain number of private citizens elected by the two 
houses aforementioned, and of the ecclesiastical superintendents of 
the city (who up to the year 1877 acted as royal commissioners, that is 
to say, as the representatives of the State government); hence there 
were four distinct classes of members, namely, representatives of the 
upper and of the lower houses of the city council, private citizens, and 
ecclesiastical members. In 1853 a second city school councilor, spe- 
cially designated for the elementary schools, was appointed by the 
eouncil. In 1866, after most of the Catholic elementary schools had 
become city institutions, the archdeacon of St. Hedwich’s Chureh 
became a member of the committee. Since the year 1875 the number 
of members has been 32, namely, 6 members of the upper house, 10 of 
the lower house of the city council, 11 city deputies, 4 Protestant super- 
matendents, and the Catholic archdeacon. In the year 1877 the city
-P-A-G-E-296
  248 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
school inspectors (in this country called assistant superintendents) 
became also members of the committee; they are, however, city as well 
as State officials, and as State officers bear the title of “royal district 
inspectors.” The business of the committee (school deputation) con- 
sists of the supervision and administration of the entire common school 
system of Berlin. 
The city authorities began in 1827 with the establishment of com- 
munal pauper schools according to the plan agreed upon and the means 
available for that purpose. Up to the year 1840, 12 such schools, with 
73 classes and 7,074 children, were in existence; in 1850, their number 
had increased to 15, having 126 classes and 10,691 children; in 1860, 
there were 20 schools with 185 classes and 14,178 children, The expendi- 
tures increased in the three decades mentioned from $52,467 to $130,945, 
and $200,902. The part borne by the community after the deduction 
of tuition fees amounted to $4,150 in 1840 and $111,904 in 1850, but 
$165,595 in 1860. 
Each of these pauper schools had at first 4 classes or two grades; 
that is, 2 boys’ and 2 girls’ classes each, with 75 children; in all, about 
300. Later they were changed, as the needs of the community increased, 
to 8 classes each; that is, 4 ascending grades for boys and 4 for girls, 
each school containing about 600 children. 
These schools were partly kept in buildings owned by the city, partly 
in rented quarters. Since 1840 schoolhouses were built so that besides 
two dwellings for the principals and the first assistant teacher, there 
were eight class rooms. The thirteenth communal school attached to 
the Elizabeth Church, containing two dwellings for teachers and ten 
class rooms, which school has recently been removed to give room to a 
modern structure, dated from 1840, 
The corps of teachers of these pauper schools consisted of a head 
teacher who was charged with the supervision of the external manage- 
ment of either the boys’ or the girls’ department. Later, this head 
teacher was made the principal of the entire school building. He acted 
as class teacher of the highest grade, assisted by the requisite num- 
ber of-class teachers, and a limited number of assistants, such as 
teachers of female handicraft. These last-named assistants did not have 
to pass an examination, nor were the children graded in this branch. 
The salaries and number of hours of work were different for teachers 
of boys and girls. Those of boys received between $300 and $400, and 
assistants between $160 and $300. The class teachers taught between 
twenty-four and thirty-two hours, the assistants between eighteen 
and thirty-two hours. Teachers in female handiwork received a com- 
pensation of $50 per year for eight hours’ work per week. Since the 
year 1840 a regular increase in salaries at stated intervals was arranged 
for. In 1855 a schedule adopted by the city council fixed the salary of 
head teachers at between $650 and $750; that of the class teachers 
in nine steps, between $300 and $650.

The course of study of these pauper schools, which it must be under- 
stood were attended by other than pauper children, embraced only that 
which seemed most necessary for life, namely—religion, the mother 
tongue, arithmetic, penmanship, and singing. To these were added 
in the three upper grades of the boys’ classes the elements of geome- 
try with exercises in drawing; also, in the upper classes of both boys’ 
and girls’ departments, the elements of natural history, geography, and 
history, while for the girls alone instruction in knitting, darning, sew- 
ing, and marking of linen was added. The number of hours work per 
week was thirty-two for the two upper classes, twenty-six for the two 
lower classes (see course of study from the year 1840 in Table No. 9). 
Annual examinations in the presence of deputies of the city council and 
the school board, who reported upon their result to the provincial 
authorities, were held and premiums were distributed among poor and. 
diligent children. The success of the instruction given in these schools 
was almost uniformly characterized as very satisfactory, and it con- 
firmed the city authorities in the further development of the system. 
Local supervision over the communal pauper schools, as well as over 
parochial and private schools, was exercised by local school boards con- 
sisting each of a clergyman of the parish and two secular members. 
The duties of these boards were defined by “instructions” issued in 
1832. These local boards were also the organs through which the city 
school committee conferred with the teachers. At first, this school 
committee was only a city supervisory board, for the administration of 
the pauper schools was still conducted by the board of charities. Not 
until the year 1837 did the school committee assume the administration, 
but even then the board of charities fixed the amount of tuition fees 
payable monthly. The principals of the schools were charged with the 
collection of the fees. In every case the city school committee deter- 
mined what school a child should attend, i. e., the division of the city 
into school districts. 
Only a small number of the children of school age were accommo- 
dated in city pauper schools entirely free from paying tuition fees, 
others (and up to 1860 they were the majority) attended free of charge 
any of the numerous parochial or private schools which were conducted 
by private teachers licensed by the city authorities. The city paid for 
the indigent children attending such schools. In 1840 these private 
elementary schools had 6,292; in 1850, 11,772; in 1860, 14,178 children 
of school age; that is, one-half of all the pauper school children. The 
fact that these private institutions were indispensible induced the city 
authorities to bestow much attention to their improvement. 
Though direct interference in their administration on the part of the 
city school authorities was precluded, the authorities were nevertheless 
able to exert an influence over them, since they could make the assign- 
ment of pupils for which the city paid, dependent upon certain condi- 
tions. On the other hand, simple prudence prevented too severe con-
-P-A-G-E-298
250 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
ditions, since the city could not do without these private schools, its 
own provision for indigent pupils being inadequate. 
The Royal Government, as early as 1832 and 1839, had issued orders 
and regulations for the licensing, administration, management, and 
supervision of private elementary schools essentially similar to those 
intended for communal pauper schools. In 1846 the Government issued 
new regulations concerning improvements in management, teaching 
force, and supervision; and in 1855 a new course of study was pre- 
scribed for these schools. 
The city authorities, after the year 1845, supported more liberally the 
private elementary schools to which indigent pupils were assigned, by 
raising the monthly fees and by granting material assistance to the 
teachers, such as appropriations for fuel, and by entering into formal 
contracts for the tuition of certain numbers of pupils of the respective 
districts. By these measures the principals were relieved of soliciting 
pupils, knowing that they could rely upon a certain number of pupils 
to start with. They were thus enabled to bestow more interest upon 
their buildings and equipment. They could now enter into contracts 
with assistant teachers and prevent overcrowding of classes. With 
the beginning of the sixth decade the number of these schools decreased 
quite perceptibly in proportion to the increase in the number of city 
schools, so that in the year 1890, with the abandonment of the last 
private elementary school (Hube’s institution), the last remnant of a 
former system vanished. Several historians of the Berlin schools call 
the period from 1845 to 1860 the “period of private school misery.” 
We must return, though, to the period preceding it, by saying that 
city pauper schools and private elementary schools accommodated the 
greater part of all the pupils of school age in Berlin. Children of school 
age not found there either attended the elementary classes of secondary 
institutions, or if they were very poor and obliged to earn money dur- 
ing the day, they attended since 1830 so-called city supplementary 
schools. These were evening schools, occupied the city pauper school- 
houses, and were taught by the teachers of such schools. The time 
_ devoted to instruction in these evening schools amounted to between 
eight and twelve hours per week; the tuition fee was very low, and in 
many cases instruction was gratuitous. It was confined to religion, 
reading, writing, and arithmetic. Since 1840, no child was admitted 
to these evening schools unless during the day engaged in factory 
work. Other requirements were that the child must have completed 
its eleventh year of life, and have attended day school for at least three 
years. The results of these evening schools were anything but satis- 
factory, so that in the year 1848 they were changed to Sunday schools, 
open between 8 and 12 in the morning. These Sunday schools had in 
1848, 1,639; in 1850, 1,568, and in 1860, 1,004 pupils. 
When, in 1853 the old rules and regulations, dated 1839, concerning 
the occupation of children in factories, were changed, it was ordered 
   
-P-A-G-E-299
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 251 
    
   
    
     
       
        
    
   
      
       
   
     
     
     that every child engaged in factory labor must have at least three 
hours’ instruction in a day school, and for the Sunday schools the age 
for admission was changed from the completed eleventh to the com- 
pleted twelfth year of age. Since 1855 the Sunday schools were sup- 
plemented by factory schools with half-day sessions. In 1860 the city 
ad still two such factory schools which later on were changed into 
egular city day schools, as was done also with the remaining Sunday 
schools. The number of factory children for which the parents desired 
la half-day session diminished to such extent during the seventh decade 
that the schools had to be abandoned. 
In 1892 an imperial law was passed that no child under 13 was 
allowed to work in factories, and children over 13 only in eases where 
he common school course had been completed, and dispensation from 
attending school was obligatory. This law had a remarkable effect 
upon the schools, as is clearly seen from the statistics which show an 
increase in the number attending advanced grades. 
Up to the middle of the forties the city authorities had laid the 
‘oundation of a system of communal schools which was able to develop 
without revolutionary measures ‘or violent reforms; that is to say, pro- 
vision necessary to accommodate all children of school age was made 
ossible. Now it became necessary to create authorities which would 
secure the enrollment and regular attendance at school, so that the 
aw of compulsory education could be thoroughly carried out. The 
ocal boards mentioned before were replaced by local school committees 
in the year 1845. This measure was the second important step for the 
establishment of an entire system that embraced all youth of school- 
going age, legally prescribed to be 6 to 14. 
These local committees, which are still in existence, made it possible 
o carry out the duty of attending school prescribed by law. From 
hat time children who had completed their sixth year were taken in 
charge at once, and placed in the schools where they belonged, and 
heir attendance was constantly controlled by means of the daily reg- 
ister of the teachers, and the visits of the committee. At the begin- 
ming opportunities for attending school were offered, but the strata of 
opulation for which the sehools were established had little eompre- 
ension of the necessity of regular attendance. ‘‘The benevolence of 
gratuitous instruction” (thus we read in official report of 1846) “had 
ito be urged and forced upon the poorer people.” The city authorities 
were in this respect quite inexorable; they were convinced that the 
progress of the city was dependent upon good schools and the educa- ~ 
tion of the entire population. The authorities considered themselves 
in duty bound to enforce enrollment and attendance at schools of all 
ithe children that came under the law, and to do it with all the power 
at their command, even ealling in the aid of the police to arrest 
truants and bring them to school. Although in this respect the com- 
ipulsory attendance law had always been obeyed by a large majority  
-P-A-G-E-300
252 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
of the population, and both school principals and clergymen had 
aided the city authorities in finding and indicting refractory and care- 
less parents; and although the royal police authorities had given their, 
aid in securing legal school attendance, these measures had proven 
inadequate, because they acted from a distance, as it were, and because 
the city authorities were lacking the necessary truant officials for the 
execution of the law. In 1833 as many as 10 to 15 per cent of the 
enrolled children attended school very irregularly, or not at all. In 
that year 2,932 children were found who had not been enrolled. 
The law of 1839, concerning the occupation of children in factories, 
gave the authorities the necessary lever for enforcing regular attend- 
ance, and enabled them to secure regular control of the attendance. 
In 1845 State regulations were issued for controlling the attendance of 
children in school and confirmation lessons. These regulations fixed 
the punishment for absence from school. In later years these measures 
were supplemented and perfected, and to this day they form the corner 
stone of the State law which requires regular attendance at school. 
These regulations are so characteristic that their provisions deserve 
to be sketched. They provided for two measures: (1) The issue of so- 
called attendance cards, and (2) the formation of local boards as organs 
of the city school committee analogous to the already existing boards 
of charity. | 
The attendance cards mentioned served the purpose of finding chil- 
dren of school age not attending, each child attending school receiving 
such a card. They were distributed among the school children of the 
city and kept by the parents. If a member of the local boards called 
to see whether the children of the family attended school, the parents 
exhibited these cards, which was proof positive of their attendance. 
Of children who had no such cards it was presumed that they failed to 
attend school. Whenever a family moved and announced its new ad- 
dress at police headquarters, the police authorities demanded inspec- 
tion of the attendance cards. If they were not forthcoming, it was 
regarded proof positive that the children of that family failed to attend 
school. Any such case was reported to the city school committee who 
instantly appealed to the organs of the law. 
The local school board controlled the attendance of school children. 
Their members consisted and still consist of six to ten citizens each, 
appointed for three years by the house of deputies of the city council 
and confirmed by the magistrate (upper house of the city legislature) 
* to serve in the local school board, an honorary duty which is cheerfully 
performed. The members of these boards have each assigned to them 
a number of streets and houses of their district and they visit the fami- 
lies living in them at regular stated intervals. Each of these boards 
has a commissioner, who performs the office work and distributes 
among the members the business to be performed.   
 
-P-A-G-E-301
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. _ 253 
In order to facilitate the work of these boards the principal of each 
school makes a report to the commissioner of cases of nonattendance. 
Cases of justifiable absence are, of course, not reported. The member 
of the board then attempts by personal inquiries to ascertain the 
causes of the absence, warns the parents, threatens in cases of recur- 
rence, and reports to the school committee in cases wherein his influ- 
ence proves futile. The city school committee then orders immediate 
trial and is entitled to impose fines or imprisonment. Appeals may be 
taken within eight days before the upper house of the legislature, that 
is, the magistrate, but the decision of the magistrate is considered final. 
These provisions, and especially the activity of the local boards and 
their commissioners, as well as the application of fines aud imprison- 
ment, proved successful and beneficial. Within a brief period of time 
after the regulations were adopted, school attendance became regular 
and the number of nonattendants without cause decreased rapidly. 
While the local school boards controlled school attendance, the busi- 
ness of placing children in the schools was performed by the central 
committee, and the applications for attendance in free schools or release 
from paying fees and the gift of free text-books for poor children, were 
still performed by the board of charity. 
The next step taken in the progressive development of the whole 
system was the complete severance of the city school system from the 
board of charity and the management of the institutions for the poor. 
It took some time to bring this about. The main idea which was dis- 
cussed was to change the local boards into organizations which would 
perform on a smaller scale, of course, the same duties which the central 
school committee did for the entire city. However, this plan had to be 
given up because if the city school districts were made independent it 
would necessarily presuppose a severance of the parochial and the 
school authorities, and in this case the clergy insisted upon appointing 
the supervisory staff. This would seriously have weakened the influence 
of the central authority. 
Though the plan of making the local boards independent was dropped, 
their functions and authority were increased. All former duties of the 
commissioners of the poor were transferred upon the local boards and 
their commissioners. On December 17, 1868, the revised series of reg- 
ulations for the local school boards of the city of Berlin were issued. 
According to them the city was divided into forty school districts and 
each district into ten divisions for inspection. The local boards con- 
sisted of the councilmen of the respective city district or their substi- 
tutes, the principals of the public elementary and private elementary 
schools of the district, and a number of the citizens appointed by the 
city council, among whom one must be a principal of a school. 
The sphere of duties of these local boards comprises at present— 
(1) Keeping a list of all children of school age living in the district. 
The royal police office aids the board by furnishing quarterly a list of 
 
-P-A-G-E-302

all new children of school age and of all those who have moved during 
the three months past. The so-called attendance cards were aban- 
doned because unnecessary. 
(2) The proper distribution of the children within the schools of the 
district. 
(8) Control of the attendance. 
(4) The fixing of the amount of tuition fees as well as the granting 
of release from paying. 
(5) Granting of free text-books and other school appliances of 
instruction. . 
Each board appoints for each of its ten divisions of inspection a 
commissioner who conducts the office business of the board, and acts 
as a curator for the various buildings within the district. This new 
organization began April 1, 1869,.and in the course of time it has been 
subjected to slight modifications. Since 1878 the school districts have 
increased their divisions to sixteen each instead of ten. The following 
table shows how enormously large the apparatus for managing the 
schools of Berlin has become: 
  
    168 | 
The new order issued April 6, 1875, for the purpose of controlling 
the attendance in school and providing punishment for unexcused 
absence, has had a good influence upon the regularity of attendance. 
The number of indictments decreased from year to year. This result 
is all the more favorable since the number of children of school age 
has increased quite considerably. It would be still more favorable if 
the public could be generally convinced of the fact. that the termina- 
tion of the school age is not the completion of the fourteenth year of 
life, or the children’s confirmation in church, but the suecessful com- 
pletion of the course prescribed for elementary schools, 
The preparation for confirmation in church is not controlled any 
longer, but it is the duty of the principals of schools to hand in to the 
authorities at the beginning of every half yearly term a list of those 
pupils who have completed their thirteenth year of life during the 
“semester just closed, and have not received any preparation for con- 
firmation. The organization of local boards and their activity has 
been and is now the foundation of communal school management. 
That the most intense interest coupled with greatest readiness for 
pecuniary sacrifice for school purposes permeates the entire population ; 
of the metropolis of Berlin; that to-day there can scarcely be found a

‘Berlin child that escapes its duty to attend school, it may be said that 
these results are owing to the nearly two thousand men who have 
placed their time and strength into this honorary and unremunerative 
service. 
The city government had meanwhile gradually increased the pauper 
schools, had raised the salaries of the teachers, and effected improve- 
ments in exterior and interior organization of the schools. Yet the 
greater number of children up to the year 1860 were still accommo- 
dated in private schools at the expense of the city, and not until the 
middle of the sixties did the city authorities establish a greater number 
of communal schools. This had the inevitable effect of reducing the 
number of private schools. The following table will show this plainly:

unmistakable stamp of pauper schools. They accommodated the pau- 
per children who paid nothing, as well as those who were admitted at 
reduced rates. The private schools, however, were open to all children 
who could pay the tuition fee. As late as 1869 the connection between 
the school committee and the board of charity existed, for it was the 
latter-named board which fixed the tuition fees and furnished the 
appliances of mstruction, such as text-books and other things. 
The idea to change the character of the city schools—that is to say, 
take away from them the odium of being pauper schools and make them 
institutions of the civil society for all children of school age, rich and 
poor—spread quite rapidly during the sixth decade. It was borne by 
the conviction that such a change was necessary in the interest of 
justice and equality. To wipe out the difference between rich and poor, 
at least in the public schools, and to mingle the children of the poor 
and forsaken with the children of parents better situated, and thus 
promote an approach of the different classes of the people to each other 
and make a true elevation of the lower classes possible, was a noble 
undertaking, the results of which have been greater than any of its 
earliest promoters dared to prognosticate. : 
Social equality in school was the principle to be carried out, but to 
practically do so an entire abandonment of all school fees and the intro- 
duction of gratuitous instruction in all the city elementary schools 
became necessary. This principle of gratuitous school attendance has 
guided ali the measures of the city authorities with regard to the ele- 
mentary schools during the last twenty-five years with the most bene- 
ficial results.

THE COMMON-SCHOOL SYSTEM FROM 1870 TO 1893. 
(1) Abolition of tuition fees; increase of pupils—On the 22d day of 
December, 1869, the city council, upon motion of the magistrate (or 
upper house of the city legislature), resolved that ‘on the 1st of Janu- 
ary, 1870, tuition fees in the Berlin communal schools shall be abol- 
ished.” 
Article 25 of the constitution of the Prussian Monarchy, adopted in 
1850, contains the following provision: “Instruction in public elemen- 
tary schools is to be gratuitous.” This constitutional provision was not 
carried out in the city of Berlin until the year 1870. The resolution 
quoted gave to the communal schools of Berlin their present character 
of common schools for the entire population. 
The report of the city government of Berlin, embracing the period 
from 1861 to 1876, says: 
The city government has rarely ever adopted so beneficial a measure and one of 
such unprecedented boldness as gratuitous instruction; nor has there ever been in 
the entire population a pecuniary sacrifice so readily made as that which this step 
called for. 
Ever since the pauper schools became city schools the tuition fees 
had been fixed at a certain normal rate, only indigent pupils being 
exempt from the payment. The principals of the schools collected the 
tuition fee monthly and charged 10 per cent commission. In 1868 the 
sum total of expenditure for the public elementary schools amounted 
to $489,770, while the tuition fees amounted to only $46,090, or 9.4 per 
cent of the entire sum. 
It is obvious, therefore, how little the communal schools were in 
demand by the paying strata of the population; also why they were 
generally called pauper schools. The situation was not satisfactory; it 
prevented the development of the system, essentially hindering its edu- 
cational influence, because the citizens who were better situated kept 
their children from contact with the so-called pauper children by patron- 
izing private schools. 
In one of the meetings of the committee to which the question of 
gratuitous instruction was referred, it was said that the most lamenta- 
ble feature of the existence of pauper schools was the immoral influ- 
ence upon the nonpaying children because from their earliest youth 
they bore the official stamp of poverty. And the gentleman added that 
the tuition fee was a tax paid by the poorer classes. Tuition fees were 
not based upon property or income, but upon the size of the taxpayer’s 
family; they burdened him the more, the more children he had. The 
wealthier strata of society would be given an opportunity by the abol- 
ishwnent of tuition fees to aid the social needs of the people without 
giving almns, and without disturbing the economical order of social 
intercourse; hence the abolishment would be of the greatest and most 
enduring benefit to the entire community. 
 
-P-A-G-E-305
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 257 
The present common school, in which tuition is gratuitous to all, has 
to be maintained by taxes paid by all; hence it must be open to the 
children of all the citizens. Its establishment was not any longer left 
to the pleasure of the city government, but had become a necessity, a 
duty, determined by exterior factors. The duty of establishing and 
maintaining city schools had to be performed even though the number 
of children to be accommodated should increase beyond all expectation 
and prognostication. It was not enough to simply perform the duty, 
it was a matter of paramount importance to do so in the best possible 
manner; that is to say, all the communal schools which had hitherto 
been considered pauper schools had to be so improved that they could 
meet the just demands of the wealthiest members of the community and 
face the criticism of experts without fear or favor. And, indeed, during 
the last twenty-three years the common school system has changed in 
extent beyond all expectations and has claimed an amount of expendi- 
tures greatly in excess of what had been calculated; its inner and outer 
development has demanded the greatest energy from all who were 
ealled upon to manage and conduct it. In judging its results, the extent 
of the task solved within a little more than two decades must be con- 
sidered, and also the fact that it was not an establishment upon the 
virgin soil of a new state, but an organic development of existing 
institutions. If we consider this we shall see why the best intentions 
had sometimes to give way to what was absolutely necessary or merely 
attainable. 
It was very natural that the poorer population, who had felt the tui- 
tion fee as an oppressive burden, at once sought the gratuitous common 
school. Not less than 12,900 children came in 1870 and 1871 and 
demanded admission; the elementary grades of secondary schools lost 
3,500 children. That was the beginning of the transition period. The 
year 1872, the year in which the 5,000,000,000 francs from France 
poured into Germany, decreased the influx of nonpaying children, 
but their number was still 2,041. From 1873 until 1878, that is, in five 
years, the number of common schools increased from 71 to 104; the 
number of classes from 950 to 1,457; the number of children from 
55,589 to 86,652. The further development of the common school 
system, from 1878 until 1893, is given in tables at the close of this 
article. 
The population of Berlin increased within fifteen years (from 1378 to 
1893) by about 600,000. The number of common school children by 
about 100,000; the number of school buildings by about 100; the num- 
ber of classes by about 2,000. The increase per year was, on an aver- 
age, 40,000 inhabitants, 6 to 7 schools, 130 classes, and 6,600 pupils. 
The school authorities had to provide on an average for 130 class rooms 
and teachers, for the organization of the districts, establishment and 
erection of school buildings, division of classes, the control of attend- 
ance, etc. Since the year 1873 the school authorities, i.e., the city 
ED 94——17 
 
-P-A-G-E-306
    258 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
school committee, has had annually a certain sum at its disposal for 
the erection of new schools. 
The enormous extent of the work and the great responsibility is at 
once admitted, for it is one thing to annually add a few more classes to 
a system of schools and another to add the enormous number of 130. 
If we compare a small town of 40,000 inhabitants with Berlin, we see 
that Berlin has increased to an extent equal to fifteen such cities. This 
new city, as it were, added every year, was not added on the outskirts 
of the city, but these new 40,000 inhabitants spread over the entire 
extent of the city, each one seeking to satisfy his own interests with 
reference to occupation, rent, etc. And the new 6,600 children every 
year called for admission in all the schools available, so that the con- 
stant shifting of the school population made a ceaseless vigilance in 
the control of attendance necessary. 
The population, however, did not increase in the regular manner 
indicated. It varied between 30,000 in 1878 and 56,000 in 1888 and 
32,000 in 1892. The increase of the next following year could never 
be exactly foretold at the close of any school year. From 1878 until 
1885 it rose steadily until it reached the figure 52,000; in 1886 it fell to 
46,000. But even in the course of a single year the population was any- 
thing but stable, as it might be expected in acity of 40,000 inhabitants 
with a well-established industry; on the contrary, newly arising indus- 
trial enterprises caused the laboring people of one part of the city to 
move into another quarter, hence there was a disturbing fluctuation of 
the population within the eity. Experience proved that the school popu- 
latien was strongly influenced during any year following this apparent 
unrest. An important increase in the number of classes in one city 
district was at times followed by a standstill, nay, even a retrogression. 
These movements affected not only the children approaching the school 
age, but more so the children whe had already been assigned to their 
schools. Extensive changes in the number of classes and children of 
certain city wards or school districts had to be made which necessitated 
a disturbance of the even progress of the work in school. 
Consider the difficulty to accommodate this fluctuating population 
and gauge correctly the work required by these frequent increases and 
decreases, and we shall see how unreliable were the plans made for 
any succeeding year. Consider that at times it was extremely difficult 
to find the proper sites for schoolhouses, which difficulty the city shares 
with every other metropolis; think of the care needed to meet the 
pressing demands for new schoolhouses in order to avoid the use of 
rented quarters, always unsuited for school purposes; think of the many 
annoying situations arising from leasing buildings to accommodate 
temporarily the children that had to be in school by order of the law; 
think of the number of teachers who had to be selected from the can- 
didates, and it will become clear that the authorities had to strain 
every nerve. In order to make a perfect assignment of pupils to the
-P-A-G-E-307
  
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 259 
preper schools, and to secure proper grading and control of attendance 
amid such extensive changes, enormous efforts had to be made by the 
organs of the city school administration. But the heaviest duty fell 
upon‘ the teachers. They were expected to see to it that children 
shifted and shunted from district to district were properly graded 
and enabled to organically continue their studies without break or 
hindrance. 
The foregoing sketch may give an idea of the extent and complexity 
of the work that was to be performed annually; it may indicate that 
it could be done only by means of careful local and individual investi- 
gation concerning increase, distribution, and fluctuation of the popula- 
tion, concerning enrollment and attendance in each district, and their 
variations, which required the most painstaking statistical work, a 
work that could be successful only if based upon a local census taken 
at brief intervals in order to make correct calculations possible. 
(2) Census of school population, estimates for new classes and school- 
houses.—The entire work of assignment of pupils lies in the hands of 
168 local boards. Each of these boards has a limited part of the city 
to attend to; each has one, two, or three so-called district schools at its 
disposal to which it can assign children. The commissioner or secre- 
tary of that board receives semiannually from the police authorities a 
list of children who have just.completed their sixth year of age and live 
in the districts of the respective boards. He compares this list with the 
registers of attendance kept by the teachers, then assigns the new 
pupils (either born in or moved into the district) to the school nearest 
their residence, and hunts up the children who have failed to be 
enrolled. Every child assigned to a school by the respective commis- 
sioner or secretary of the local board, must be accepted by the principal 
at the beginning of the year, even though the classes be overerowded. 
The principal of the school reports te the school inspector or assist- 
ant superintendent, within three days after the beginning of the semes- 
ter, the number of pupils enrolled and the capacity of his class rooms. 
After this semiannual enrollment has taken place, the principal and 
commissioner or seeretary of the board meet with the inspector and 
determine upon the mode of equalizing the assignment according to the 
distance of the school from the pupils’ residences. New elasses are 
opened and preliminary provision is made for them. At the end of the 
first school week a so-called “ correetion conference” of all the inspectors 
or assistant superintendents meets at the city hall, hears. the reports, 
sanctions certain measures of equalization taken, eventually corrects 
errors, and determines definitely upon the new classes to be opened 
and questions of grading that may have arisen during the new assign- 
ment. This conference sometimes lasts three or four days, so that within. 
ten days after the beginning of the half yearly term the schools are in 
running order.

  260 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
On the 1st of November and on the Ist of May of every year the 
principals hand in a report, for which blanks are furnished, concerning 
the capacity of their schools, number of classes, number of pupils en- 
rolled, and the percentage of pupils coming from other districts. Then 
a summary is made of all items of statistics thus obtained, especially 
with reference to increase and decrease in certain districts, so that for 
future estimates a basis is furnished for the establishment of new schools 
or the opening of new classrooms. The results of statistics of the pre- 
vious half year are taken to measure the provisions necessary for the 
following half year. This is one of the wisest provisions of the Berlin 
school system. The following table exhibits the changes found on 
November 1, 1889:

This summary shows that generally the number of children in the 
older parts of the city—that is, the one in which commerce with its 
large stores and warehouses is carried on—decreases steadily. Rents 
in the inner portion of the city increase, and the working people and 
others of small incomes move outward toward the suburbs. For the 
above-mentioned increase of 4,801 children there were opened 81 classes 
between the date of enrollment and the Ist of April 1890; that is a 
little less than 60 pupils to the teacher. 
These estimates are carefully scrutinized and are submitted to the 
city school committee, the magistrate, and the city council, so that for 
the coming year the appropriation may be regulated accordingly. The 
executive officers are charged with the duty of assigning teachers, select- 
ing sites for new schools, erecting buildings, etc., within the extent of 
the appropriation. : 
However carefully the assignment of pupils and the enumeration 
and enrollment are made, and however exact the appropriations are

measured, they do not, as experience shows, give infallible informa- 
tion as to what will be needed the following year, since the movement 
of the population is mcalculable. A great increase in the number of 
classes in one year is not always followed by a similar increase in the 
next. If we consider that every new class costs the city per year 3,000 
marks, or $750, and furthermore that the erection of a new school 
building has to be carefully discussed, and that even after the adoption 
of a plan the building takes two years to complete it, it is easily seen 
that errors may arise and therefore the school census has a prominent 
financial importance for the city. 
In order therefore to avoid the errors which would arise from basing 
the new provisions upon a short period of six months, the authorities 
resorted to calculations upon longer periods and especially upon esti- 
mates based upon the attendance in schools where tuition fees are 
charged. 
The relation of children paying tuition fees and those who do not is 
determined by two things—first, the variations in commerce and indus- 
try, and secondly, the reputation which the common school enjoys 
among the public. How much the changes in commerce and industry 
influence the attendance was noticed during the first few years of gra- 
tuitous instruction. The year 1872 recorded a greater increase of the 
number of paying children over that of the nonpaying. The former 
was 1,400, the latter only 900. In the year 1875 the former was only 
200, the latter 782. 
The following table is of special interest as showing the stability of 
the number of paying children:

In 1879 the sum total of the first eight generations (that is, of chil- 
dren between 6 and 14) in the common schools was 86,852, in the pay 
schools 16 was 34,402; in 1885, the two numbers were 142,982 and 
35,332; hence the total of eight generations in these eight years 
increased by 57,094, and of this increase the common schools gained 
56,352, while the pay schools only gained 841. But 841 children are
-P-A-G-E-310
  262 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
about the sixty-sixth part of the total increase in the common schools. 
During the following year no change in these relations took place; the 
number of paying children remained almost the same, and since the _ 
year 1888 the new school children are almost entirely absorbed by the 
common schools. Since that year the school authorities do not, and 
need not consider the attendance in the pay schools when they esti- 
mate the appropriations for the coming year, or the erection of new 
schoolhouses. Parents who could very well afford to pay tuition fees 
for their children send them to the common school for elementary 
instruction, and thereby prove the general and deep-rooted confidence 
in the work done in these schools. 
According to the official inquiry of July, 1894, the parents of 182,347 
common school children were: 
Laborers and artisans 
Independent artisans and tradesmen 44, 155 
Subaltern officers, teachers, and military men -- 20, 162 
Engineers, merchants, physicians, high-grade officers...-....-.------------ 9, 278 
        - 108, 362 
It is plain that the level of the social strata that intrusted their 
children to the common school gradually rose, but an inevitable conse- 
quence of it was that the demands made on them became greater, 
hence the schools became more successful and better, and thus also 
more attractive to people of means and culture. But when that part 
of the population patronizes the schools their influence upon the lower 
strata rises perceptibly. In this respect the gratuitous instruction in 
the common schools has fully realized the expectations entertained by 
the advocates of gratuity. 
(3) Number of classes, school buildings, and equipment.—The measures 
taken by the authorities make it possible to follow the needs of the 
school population without delay, and to satisfy them soon after they 
arise; it is done in organic connection with existing institutions andin 
the best possible manner. Berlin possesses at present a well-organized 
school system which is evenly distributed over the entire city. The 
royal authorities state in their official report of 1886 that “according 
to minute calculation of distances and areas, Berlin of all the cities of 
the Kingdom is best provided with school facilities.” 
The normal course of study prescribed for the Berlin common schools 
provides for six ascending grades. The “mixed” schools had originally 
a department for boys and one for girls, hence 12 classes. As late as 
1874 the first 17 communal schools had each 6 boys’ and 6 girls’ classes, 
hence their school buildings were provided with 12 class rooms. 
Gradually the separation of the sexes was carried on further, by desig- 
nating certain schoolhouses for boys and others for girls, or erecting 
double buildings. 
The lower classes became overcrowded, owing to the rapid increase 
of the population and the withdrawal of pupils from the upper grades; 
hence parallel classes were arranged for the lower grades, so that in
-P-A-G-E-311

the course of time some of the schools had as many as 20 ciasses, In 
1878, 99 schools had together 1,358, or an average of 14 classes; in 1886, 
156 schools had together 2,586 classes, or on an average 17 classes. 
Meanwhile the average number of pupils per class had risen from 54 in 
1877 to 55.72 in 1886. Upon the basis of these experiences the normal 
number of classes for each school was fixed at 16, and that number was 
officially adopted in planning new buildings. 
On the occasion of sanctioning a building plan for the forty-fifth eom- 
munal girls’ school, in 1885, the question came up how many classes 
a principal could supervise without disadvantage to his pedagogical 
duties. This question was of importance, since it arose from the idea 
that an unwise economy might increase the number of classes indefi- 
nitely, so as to go beyond the capacity of the principals and injure the 
work of the schools. The central school committee decided the ques- 
tion by a resolution in January, 1886, that 20 be the maximum number 
of classes of an elementary city school, though the supervisory staff 
expressed the opinion that 16 should be the maximum. 
The following reasons were advanced by the supervisors: The duties 
of a principal (or rector, as he is called in Berlin) are: (1) He must 
know and observe those children who awaken apprehension by their 
conduct and social influence; (2) he must guide and promote the course 
of development of such pupils as are prominent in diligence and talent; 
(3) he must be well informed concerning the conduct and results of the 
teachers, and support and aid with advice especially the younger col- 
leagues; (4) he must conduct the exterior management of the school, 
the business of enrolling, must keep lists for the purpose of controlling 
the attendance, conduct the correspondence, and supervise the work .of 
the janitors. 
However, the city council decided that 20 class rooms be fixed as 
the maximum number to be supervised by one principal, although the 
magistrate favored the substitution of 16 as the maximum number. 
The question has given rise to much discussion, and is not, as it 
appears, definitely settled; it creates new discussion every time a new 
schoolhouse is to be built. At present 14 of the 200 communal schools 
have over 20 classes. 
The city authorities have of late years promoted the building of 
schoolhouses in the most generous manner. During the period from 
1882 till 1888 the enormous sum of 12,710,000 marks, or $3,024,980, 
had been expended for the erection of elementary school buildings. 
The estimate of appropriations for 1885-86 required for the five years 
following altogether 50 of such buildings, or 10 per year. After that 
it was thought that 5 new buildings per year would suffice. That was 
the plan. The actual facts are, that during the five years mentioned 
42 new buildings were erected; in 1889, 8 more; in 1890, 6 more, so that 
the projected number was exceeded by 6. During the last three years, 
1891 to 1893, again 12 buildings were found necessary, so that in the

264 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
period of 1878 till 1894 the annual increase in the number of school- 
houses built and owned by the city was between 6 and 7. 
The expenditures for new buildings during the period of 1878 till 
1893 will be found in Table 5; the sum total was 23,941,512 marks, or 
$6,698,080. To this should be added the cost of enlarging buildings of 
former periods, which amounted to 311,322 marks, or $74,095. 
The number of classes has increased from 1,264 in 1876 to 3,435 in 
1894, Table 6 gives the exact data. One hundred and eighty-five 
classes are accommodated in rented quarters and 13 classes in city 
buildings not designed for schools. 
Despite the vigorous activity on the part of the authorities in build- 
ing new schools, the annual increase in the number of pupils makes it 
necessary from time to time to rent temporarily rooms and buildings 
for school purposes. While in 1878 the city had 88 schoolhouses of its 
own and 16 schools in rented buildings, the number of buildings owned 
by the city in 1885 had increased to such an extent that only 11 of the 
schools were in rented quarters. (Compare Table 1.) At times, espe- 
cially at the beginning of a school term, so-called half-day classes are 
organized, in order to accommodate all the pupils enrolled. This, how- 
ever, is done only for a short time, until the authorities have found 
proper localities for housing the classes. 
j With the enormous increase in the number of schools and houses 
changes and improvements in the size, style of architecture, and equip- 
ment have gone hand in hand, and are now in harmony with modern 
educational demands. The high prices of the ground made it neces- 
sary to utilize the space as much as possible without violating hygienic 
and educational requirements. In the course of time certain typical 
plans have been agreed upon for sites of certain dimensions and loca- 
tion. The older buildings contain 10 to 12 class rooms, besides a dwell- 
ing for the principal and the janitor. These buildings have neither a 
large session room in which the whole school can be assembled, nor 
satisfactory conference rooms and laboratories, nor have they gym- 
nasia for physical exercises. Their fronts are plain, and have a coat 
of plaster painted. These old buildings have separate stairways and 
corridors for boys and girls. The mode of heating is very primitive, 
namely, by stoves. In later years the class rooms were built much 
higher. Hot-water heating is resorted to, ventilating shafts are pro- 
vided, and the playgrounds have each a gymnasium for physical 
exercises. 
In cases where the site would allow it a double schoolhouse was 
built, one for boys and one for girls. They do not stand back to back, 
so to speak, but are separated from each other, each one having its play- 
ground on three sides. During the last few years, after the authorities 
had become able to cope with the increase in population, and could 
find sites in the suburbs where ground was cheap, economizing in space 
has not been so necessary. The space of a class room is calculated to    
-P-A-G-E-313
  
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 265 
be 54 square meters, which will give room for 70 pupils in the lower 
grades, 65 in the middle, and 60 in the upper grades, so that each pupil 
has 0.77, 0.83, and 0.90 square meter space. All new school buildings 
have a spacious session room, an office for the principal, a conference 
reom, a museum or laboratory, and stationary washstands for’ the chil- 
dren. In most of these school buildings the principal and the janitor 
have dwellings. 
The mode of heating adopted for new buildings is that of hot water 
or air, In late years the hot-water heating is preferred. The school- 
houses common!y are four-story buildings, accessible by broad stone 
stairways. The corridors are wide and conveniently lighted. In older 
schoolhouses the corridors were rather narrow, but the new buildings 
are provided with spacious halls, which run alongside the class rooms 
of each story. The size of the class rooms is 9 by 6 meters (or about 
30 by 20 feet). Each class room is provided with three windows. In 
order to keep the air of the schoolroom pure, especially from the odors 
rising from moist wraps and overcoats, special cloakrooms are provided 
for. In order to control the movements of the pupils in the corridors 
and yards they are allowed to pass only through specially designated 
doors, while others are closed to them. This is done also for the pur- 
pose of preventing contact with strangers entering the schoolhouse to 
transact business with the principal and teachers. 
In order to obtain a proper standard of measurement for the condi- 
tions of light in the schoolrooms a number of careful investigations 
has been made during several years with Weber’s photometer. The 
results of these measurements and calculations are being used in 
planning new buildings. 
Since the year 1889 the authorities have adopted into their normal 
schoolhouse plan one special room for the purpose of serving as an 
asylum for children after school hours. This asylum is usually situated 
in the basement, provided with suitable furniture for manual work, and 
js used to occupy the time after school hours of boys whose parents 
are working in factories. Several of the new schools have this com- 
mendable feature. 
The fronts of the new school buildings are built of pressed brick 
with stone facings and terra cottaornaments. The dwellings of princi- 
pals could not well be provided for in double schoolhouses; in these 
cases a separate dwelling house is placed adjacent to the schoolhouse. 
Usually the dwelling faces the street, and the schoolhouse is situated 
in the inner court of an entire block. The gymnasium also is a sepa- 
rate building; it is commonly 19 by 10 meters in size (or about 65 by 35 
feet). Itis provided with all the necessary apparatus and appliances 
for physical exercises. 
The area of the playground is determined by the number of classes. 
It is always intended to afford the children time for play during recess; 
commonly, the play ground is calculated to require 14 square meters 
 
-P-A-G-E-314
  266 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
area for every pupil in the school. Hence, a school with 2,000 pupils 
requires a playground of 3,000 square meters. The playground for 
boys contains some apparatus for gymnastic exercises in the open air. 
A site for a double school, according to these requirements, must 
measure between 4,500 and 5,000 square meters. In the outskirts of 
the city, where the ground is cheap, larger sites are selected. 
The equipment of the class rooms comprises school benches (single 
seats are not yet considered necessary in German schools), teachers’ 
desks on platforms, cupboards, blackboards, ete., which are calculated 
to cost 550 marks ($131) per class. The pupils’ benches are arranged 
for three or four pupils each. The following are the measurements 
(in centimeters) applied in providing seats:

  Tn a few schools a more modern construction of desks and seats has 
been temporarily used, but the authorities have not as yet adopted it 
for the entire school system. 
Particular attention is given to appliances and apparatus for the 
study of physics and natural history. For physics, apparatus is pro- 
vided which is suitable for demonstration within the class room, is 
durable and strong, and guarantees the success of the experiments 
made. Preparations for natural history and charts, as well as speci- 
mens of plants (sent from the school garden during the summer months 
twice a week), and mineral cabinets for boys and girls are found in’ 
every school. In order to promote and enliven the instruction in sci- 
ences visits to the zoological gardens, the aquarium, and the urania are 
arranged for entire classes. 
Every schoolhouse in Berlin possesses a teachers’ library, equipped 
with scientific and pedagogic works of general value, but not with 
works of fiction. For the purpose of maintaining and further develop- 
ing these libraries the city school authorities include in their annual 
appropriations the sum of 54,000 marks, or $12,852. This sum is divided 
up according to the needs of the different districts. For the purpose 
of equipping the schools with the necessary stationery, the teacher of 
each new class room opened receives 60 marks; the other schools 
replenish their stock as needs arise. The appropriation is made upon 
motion of the principal through the school inspector (or assistant super- 
intendent). A conference of the school inspectors decides upon the 
books and kind of stationery to be provided for pupils and teachers. 
For the instruction in drawing a special fund is set aside, in order to 
furnish the necessary materials to indigent pupils. Text-books are     
 
-P-A-G-E-315
Re eT ee eee Ree ee ee he re ee ee ee 
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 267 
given to indigent pupils also at the central office of the school com- 
mittee, while stationery is given out by the principal of each school. 
Every school in the city receives 30 marks per annum for new books to 
be placed in the pupils’ library, while a new school receives a first gift 
of 60 marks for that purpose. For current expenses and small expen- 
ditures found necessary, such as for chemicals and the like, each school 
is provided with an extra fund. 
(4) Number of pupils per teacher.—Like other cities, Berlin has made 
it a special object to grade its common schools, so that the children of 
like age should be taught together in ascending grades. Before 1860 a 
few schools had six grades, but since 1872 every Berlin common school 
is expected to have six ascending grades; some have seven or more, and ; 
it is the intention of making the organization one of eight grades 
throughout the system by splitting the upper grades which now are 
taught in two divisions each. Though the law prescribes the maximum 
number of pupils per teacher to be 70 for lower grades, 65 for middle 
- grades, and 60 for upper grades—the schools in Berlin average a smaller 
| number per teacher. The following table shows the averages for 1878 
and 1892:

ae . 54.14    These averages do not show the actual state of affairs, for in some 
schools the lower grades are overcrowded, as they always will be. 
Some of these lower grades have as many as 70 pupils. Nonpromotion 
is one of the causes of the greater number of pupils in the lower grades, 
though it is expected that every child entering at 6 years of age will 
be able to go through the entire school within eight years, there is 
always a considerable number who do not reach the highest grade. 
Hence the question has come up how to relieve the lower grades so as  
-P-A-G-E-316
  268 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
to assure more individual work and attention to each pupil, and thus 
to enable all the pupils to pass through the entire course of study of 
eight years. 
(5) Teachers, salaries, and hours of work.—The most essential factors 
of the work of the school and its abiding influence are good teachers; 
hence to procure them has at all times been one of the chief objects of 
the administration. For, however carefully all other requirements of 
public education are fulfilled—they can not suffice unless supported by 
excellence and devotion to duty on the part of the teachers. To secure 
good teachers was possible only under one condition—by offering them 
salaries commensurate with the demands of life in a metropolis; fur- 
thermore, by securing them regular increases at stated intervals, and 
offering pensions at the time of retirement, and to their widows and 
orphans. The salaries for the city teachers have steadily increased 
during the last twenty years. 
In the common elementary schools of Berlin the class-teacher system 
is adhered to, except for certain branches in which artistic skill is 
required. The class teacher gives instruction in the main branches in 
his room, The principal, having only twelve hours per week of such 
work in his grade (the highest), is relieved by other teachers of lower 
grades whose classes have fewer hours devoted to lessons than the 
teacher has hours of duty. 
Departmental teaching is resorted to in a limited degree, owing to 
the employment of women teachers, the reduction in the number of 
duty hours for older teachers, and, lastly, to afford the teachers oppor- 
tunities for improvement in their profession. The so-called technical 
branches (music and drawing), though as a general thing required of 
every teacher, presuppose a certain exceptional skill and talent which 
makes it seem economical to employ the best talent among the staft of 
a school to teach these branches to all or many of the classes. If to 
this limited degree the teachers have become special teachers, it remains 
an inviolable rule that each class teacher shall teach the three main 
branches, religion, language, and arithmetic, to his own class. | 
The staff of a city school consists of the principal (with twelve duty 
hours in the school room per week), the class teachers, male and 
female, the assistant teachers (graduates of normal schools who have 
not as yet passed their second state examination), and finally the 
special teachers for woman’s handiwork and gymnastics. The total 
number of class teachers, including the assistants, amounted to 3,370, 
among them 1,033 women in 1893; the number of special teachers for 
handiwork, gymnastics, and drawing was 563. 
Up to the year 1863 only men had been employed. The beneficial 
influence of the women teachers in the private elementary schools 
accommodating pauper children paid for by the city, induced the city. 
administration to employ women as regular teachers in lower and 
middle grades.

After these introductory remarks it will be in place to discuss more 
minutely the salaries and other circumstances of the professional life 
of the teachers. This is a fitting occasion since a new system of regu- 
lar increase in salaries was adopted April 1, 1894. : 
Up to the year 1871 the wages of teachers were regulated by a 
“normal” or personal budget. This budget fixed the extent of increase 
.in salaries at stated intervals. For class teachers the principle was 
adhered to that the increase should be subject to the number of years 
of service. Beginning with the minimum salary of 400 thalers,! the 
income increased at intervals of three and four years until at the expi- 
ration of twenty-four years’ service a maximum of 800 thalers was 
reached. The principals at that time could reach a maximum of 900 
thalers. If at the close of the entire school year a saving had been 
made, or, in other words, if the appropriation was not exhausted, the 
remainder was divided pro rata among the teachers. 
The majority of the teachers consisted, in consequence of the enor- 
mous increase of classes, mostly of new teachers, with a brief 
period of service in Berlin, hence the lower rates of salaries were pre- 
dominant. The regulation was therefore disadvantageous to teachers 
who entered the Berlin schools at an advanced age. On the Ist of 
October, 1871, the principle of granting an increase according to 
term of service in the city was abandoned and the so-called average 
salary was adopted. The authorities adopted the following scale: 900 
thalers for principals, 600 thalers for class teachers, and 375 thalers 
for women. These sums were raised by resolution passed July 1, 1873, 
in the following manner: All salaries above 500 thalers to be increased. 
20 per cent; all salaries below 500 thalers to be increased 30 per cent. 
In 1874 the salaries of principals were raised 100 thalers, and in 1877 
a deduction of 10 per cent formerly made for rent was abolished. 
Since that year the average salaries amounted for principals to 3,540 
marks ($843), with either a dwelling free of rent or an indemnity for 
rent amounting to 600 marks per annum ($143); for teachers, 2,235 
marks ($532); for women teachers, 1,462 marks ($348). These sums 
furnished, by cel nteane them by ne, number of positions existing (the 
number of positions is equal to the number of common school classes), 
at the beginning of each school year, the exact amount to be appro- 
priated plus the estimated number of new positions created and paid 
for at the minimum Be The salaries were at first for principals of 
three classes, 3,900, 3,540, and 3,180 marks; ‘for male teachers in seven 
classes, 3,240, 2,880, 2,520, 2,340, 2,160, 1,800, and 1,560 marks; for 
women teachers in four eee 1,755, 1,560, 1,365, and 1,170 mane’ 
In 1882 twelve positions for assistants were established. This con- 
tinued for three years, so that at the close of the third year 36 of 
such positions were in existence. These were established for the pur- 
1A thaler einale about 2 eoniay or 3 marks, but its prtetnene power is greater in 
Germany than that of a dollar in the United States.

270 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
pose of giving the graduates of the normal schools in Berlin an oppor- 
tunity for perfecting themselves in the art of teaching before entering 
upon their duties as full-fledged teachers. It was required that they 
should have passed their first state examination; that they should teach 
twenty-six hours a week (later twenty-eight hours), and be at the dis- 
posal of the principal for four more hours per week. The salary of these 
assistants was fixed at 1,200 marks. Since the average salary of a 4 
regular teacher is 2,235 marks, the administration saves 1,035 marks 
every year; multiplied by 36, equals 37,260 marks, or about $9,000. 
When, after 1876, the demand for teachers became very great, and 
the number of private schools diminished, the authorities could not 
supply teachers for the vacancies from the private teachers thrown out 
of employment, a large number of teachers provided with good testi- 
monials came from other provinces of the Kingdom and applied for 
positions. They were subjected to trial lessons in the schoolroom, and 
if they proved themselves skillful teachers were called to fill vacancies. 
Thus it came to pass that while during the year 1877 eight-ninths of 
all newly appointed teachers had come from private schools in Berlin, 
in the year 1883-84 that proportion had dwindled to one-twelfth. 
Eleven-twelfths—or, to be exact—131 new teachers had come from 
outside. 
From the year 1878 to 1893 the number of teachers rose from 1,015 
to 2,340, an increase of 1,325, Presuming that about 30 new teachers 
came from the Berlin normal school and from private schools, the total 
number of new teachers was during these years 450; hence during the 
same period 875 teachers must have come from outside. It was 
required that they be not older than 35 years of age. Since the year 
1875 this age has been fixed at 28. 
The embarrassingly large number of candidates for secondary 
schools—that is, men who had gone through the university and had 
mostly acquired the degree of Ph. D., and the impossibility to accom- 
modate them all in secondary institutions—caused these candidates 
to apply for positions in the lower schools. The school authorities 
accepted many of them, and later selected from their number the 
teachers for intermediate or advanced elementary schools, called 
burgher schools in Germany. 
The principle of paying average salaries for men and women class 
teachers has been adhered to to the present day, only two amendments 
to the regulations having been adopted: First, the category of teachers 
called assistants has been abolished, and the teaching force now con- 
sists of principals and full-fledged teachers; second, that substitutes 
be paid two-thirds of the salaries for the time served. These substi- 
tutes were special teachers for gymnastics. Another saving was made 
by inereasing the hours of duty from twenty-four to twenty-eight of 
teachers of female handiwork. The enormous annual increase in the 
number of positions led at the close of the seventies to a rapid advance-
-P-A-G-E-319
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 271 
ment of salaries. After the year 1886, when the number of new teachers 
declined, the authorities were able to fill the vacancies with younger 
teachers, and thus establish a more equitable ascension in the scale of 
salaries. 2 
In 1878 the Berlin school system had 99 principals, of whom 23 were 
in the highest grade of salary, 43 in the second, and 28 in the third 
grade. In 1884 there were 137 principals, of whom 44 were in the first, 
49 in the second, and 44 in the third grade of the salary scale. For the 
teachers the scale of salaries contains seven grades. 
The average number of years of service for teachers before reaching 
the various grades was, in 1878 and 1884, as follows: 
  
Years of serv- ic 
  Grade of salary. 
  
     
    | 1878. | 1884.

In 1889 a uniform increase of 90 marks per head was granted, and in 
that year the number of principals was 177, with an average of 3,540 
marks ($843); 1,830 men teachers, with an average salary of 2,235 
marks ($532); 920 women teachers, at 1,460 marks ($348), and 36 
assistants, with an average salary of 1,200 marks ($285). 
In 1891-92 another increase was resolved upon, and the indemnity 
for rent for principals was increased from 600 to 800 marks; besides, 
an extra annual appropriation of 90 marks was made for fuel, and the 
number of grades in salary of the teachers was raised from 7 to 8, so 
that they could rise to a maximum salary of 3,600 marks, or $734, 
The foregoing sketch shows in outlines how the salaries of teachers 
had gradually increased until April, 1894, when the new schedule of 
salaries was adopted. This schedule regulates all salaries as follows: 
(1) The maximum salary in any of the elementary common schools 
is fixed at 3,800 marks. 
(2) No new teacher begins with Jess than 1,200 marks. This is 
increased as follows:

(3) The time of service is counted regardless of where the teacher 
has served, except that it must have been within the boundaries of the 
Empire, hence this does not discriminate against private schools. 
(4) The definite appointment of a teachér is dependent upon his 
reaching the second grade of salary, namely, 1,600 marks. The assist- 
ant teachers who have not as yet passed their second state examina- 
tion, can not lay claim to either definite appointment or increase of 
salary. 
(5) Teachers in orphan asylums, who have free dwelling and light 
and fuel, are reduced in salary 300 marks in order to equalize the 
salaries. 
The foregoing statements have reference only to men. For women 
the beginner’s salary is fixed at 1,200 marks, like that of the men, but 
they can not rise beyond 2,200 marks, after eighteen years of service. 
The number of hours of duty a teacher must serve, since the year 
1861, has been thirty-two for men and twenty-six per week for women. 
It has, however, not been required of the teachers to fill them all, 
because every school had as many teachers as classes, and for manual 
training, female handiwork, gymnastics, and other special instruction, 
special, so-called technical, teachers were employed. These circum- 
stances brought it about that the teachers’ time was unequally occu- 
pied, and this caused the adoption of a regulation according to which 
men were paid 30 cents and women 25 cents for every extra hour’s work. 
Female teachers.—W omen teachers were employed first, as has been 
stated, in 1863, but exclusively in girls’ schools. Natural skill, inborn 
aptitude for disciplining and teaching, ease and simplicity in impart- 
ing knowledge, but especially their capacity and talent for prompting 
the emotional nature of children and tactful conduct, all these qualities 
soon dispelled objections arising from their deficient physical capacity 
and the social position of woman. At first only well-experienced lady 
teachers were accepted. It was made a condition that she should 
be unmarried, or that she would resign in case of marriage. Her 
salary was fixed at 300 thaler, her hours of duty at twenty-six per 
week. Women were specially appointed for the lower and middle 
classes of girls’ schools. In 1875 a rule was adopted to employ for 
every 24 girls’ classes, 13 men and 11 women, but in 1879 this propor- 
tion was reversed. 
In 1863 the first trial was made with 10 women, and up to 1879 as 
many as 478 had been appinted. Of these, 87 had resigned. The 
maximum age of appointment was at first fixed at 35 years, but in 1889 
that limit was reduced to 30 years. 
There is of course a disadvantage in the fact that women teachers 
become claimants for pensions earlier than men. This financial dis- 
advantage is, however, balanced by the fact that a goodly number of 
women resign and marry, whereby they lose their claim to a pension, 
contributions to the pension fund not being returned. Rapid rotation
-P-A-G-E-321
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 273 
in office, however favorably it may affect the finances, is not promot- 
ing the educational side of the question, inasmuch as it destroys the 
possibility of accumulated experience and pedagogical insight. 
Experience showed that young teachers lost their freshness of mind 
and body too soon by teaching full time, hence the number of duty 
hours for women was reduced to twenty-two, but financial considera- 
tions and difficulties arising from the management of the schools, 
restored the former number of twenty-four. For certain branches, 
such as language, history and religion, as well as drawing, some women 
teachers displayed aptitude in the upper grades also. 
The number of female candidates increased from year to year, partly 
because a greater number of young ladies adopted teaching as a pro- 
fession, and partly because the decrease in the number of private 
schools closed avenues to an occupation formerly open. 
In order to afford lady candidates opportunities for familarizing 
themselves with the work in common schools, an arrangement was made 
in 1879, which admitted them as “ hospitants” or visitors. After three 
or four years of irregular attendance, during which they were called 
upon to act as substitutes, they were considered when new teachers 
were appointed. At the close of 1893 the city schools had 177 of such 
hospitants. For special branches, such as female handiwork, drawing, 
gymnastics, etc., hospitants are also allowed; however, their number 
has dwindled considerably of late. 
Since the year 1863, when ladies were first employed in the city 
schools of Berlin, 1,454 have been appointed; of these, however, only 
1,033 are still in service, 419 either having married, died, or were pen- 
sioned. The constantly increasing number of female teachers induced 
the authorities to inquire into their state of health, and to find whether 
the profession of teaching affected their physical strength. In order to 
arrive at an answer to this inquiry the authorities noted down the 
time of absence, day after day, for a number of years. This record was 
carefully and conscientiously kept; it stated (1) the number of days 
and half days of absences in any calendar year; (2) the number of days 
of absence in every year of life; (3) the days of absence in every year 
of service. The summaries resulted in the following statements: 
All the women teachers appointed between 1863 and 1893, or within 
a period of 30 years, had together served 9,858 years, and within that 
time 83,129 days had been days of absence from duty; so that each 
teacher was absent on an average of 8.4 days per year. Now, if we take 
the year to have an average of 250 school days, the days of absence 
amounted to one-thirtieth of the time; hence, of 1,033 teachers, about 
34 had constantly to be provided with substitutes. 
Observations made with’ reference to the age of service and absence 
of lady teachers show that the average number of days of absence dur- 
ing the first four years’ service is below the general average; during 
later years it surpasses the general average, and after 14 years of serv- 
ED 94, 18  
-P-A-G-E-322
274 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
ice a maximum of 225 days absence per year is reached; after that, 
the time of absence decreases. If the women teachers are ranged 
according to their years of life, it is found that the average of absence 
remains below the general average before they have reached their 
twenty-ninth year of age. With those of 30 years it is 84 days; then 
it decreases, but from the thirty-fourth to the forty-second year of age 
the time increases to 15.8 days. These numbers, of course, are sub- 
ject to various accidents owing to the brief period of observation. Con- 
sidering all this, the authorities have arrived at the conviction that 
exaggerated apprehension concerning the time of absence from duty of 
lady teachers need not be entertained. 
Pensioning teachers of communal schools is done in accordance with 
the pension law of March, 1872, amended March, 1882, which law is 
applicable to all State officials. For the teachers a specific law was 
passed in July, 1885. According to the latter law a teacher’s pension 
is partly paid by the State and partly by the community. The State’s 
part amounts to 600 marks. 
It is hardly necessary to mention the many aid societies and pension 
funds started, managed, and maintained by private enterprise. It suf 
fices to show in round numbers what one of these societies does in 
aiding teachers’ widows and orphans:

  The special women teachers giving instruction in female handiwork 
and gymnastics in girls’ schools are permitted also to teach drawing, 
provided they have the necessary qualifications. The oldest of these 
teachers were only examined in handiwork. A small number of them 
had been appointed definitely before the year 1874, but without claims 
to pensions. All those appointed since have no definite appointment. 
Their number of hours of duty was fixed at eight per week, and the 
salary at 327 marks per year. Since the introduction of gymnastics 
and the possibility of passing an examination in drawing exclusively, 
the requirements for these special teachers were increased, making it 
necessary for them to be proficient either in handiwork and gymnastics, 
or in handiwork and drawing. The number of duty hours has been 
reduced to six per week, and they can not be dismissed except by giv- 
ing them four weeks’ notice. If such a teacher teaches more than six 
hours per week she can claim pay for extra work at 25 cents per hour. 
(6) Supervision, school districts, and school boards—The common 
school system of Berlin is subordinate to the royal provincial school 
authorities, who are in the same relation to the city schools as the State

EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 275 
superintendent, or the State board of education, is to the city schools in 
most of the United States, the provinces standing for States, The city 
supervisory authorities consist of the central school committee, the city 
school councilor, and the principals of the schools. In the rules and 
regulations of 1852 they were considered head teachers merely, in those 
of 1863 the principal of a school was called the “conductor of the 
school,” and in those of 1870 he was termed “immediate superior of the 
class teachers.” The rules and regulations adopted in 1875 termed the 
principal “the responsible conductor of the school, and the nearest 
superior of the men and women teachers employed in said school.” 
From these quotations we see that their functions have greatly increased. 
in the time mentioned, A natural consequence of this was that by reso- 
lution of the authorities, passed in April, 1878, only such teachers should 
be called to the principalship who had passed the required principal’s 
or rector’s examination. The official title these principals bear is that 
of rector. Since the year mentioned all principals had that title. 
Previous to March, 1872, each communal school had its school super- 
intendent, who was also royal school inspector; his office was an honor- 
ary one, and was usually filled by the clergyman of the parish who 
performed the duties pertaining to the schools only as supplementary 
duties. An uninterrupted intercourse between these men and the cen- 
tral authority was impossible, nor is a regular inspection of the schools 
under their charge. These men, who were only in rare cases practical 
educators and teachers, did not maintain any regular exchange of 
ideas—i. e., did not meet in council—and hence their Iocal arrange. 
ments frequently clashed, since they were made according to no fixed 
principles agreed upon. 
In the interest of a safe development of the entire school system a 
change in these relations was found necessary. The city authorities, 
after protracted deliberations, concluded, in October, 1877, to appoint 
city school inspectors whose number should be limited, but who must 
be theoretically and practically experienced schoolmen; their office 
should be to inspect the schools, represent them before the other city 
authorities, and regulate and conduct the teachers’ meetings. The 
introduction of these official school inspectors into the organism of 
self-government and their position with reference to the State govern- 
ment, caused at first some difficulties which were, however, cheerfully 
solved by the royal authorities in a manner satisfactory to all parties 
concerned. It was decided that the city authorities should enjoy inde- 
pendence, in so far as the laws do not contradict the measures taken. 
The principles of the new arrangement were found in the legal enact- 
ments concerning school supervision. Paragraph 3 of the law pertain- 
ing to school supervision says: “This law does not interfere with the 
school supervision of communities that have regularly appointed 
organs for that purpose.” The royal provincial school authorities 
finally raised the school inspectors, or, as we call them, the assistant 
superintendents, to the rank of royal officers.
-P-A-G-E-324
  276 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
The question whether this State commission was for a given period 
or for life was decided by the royal minister of education in favor of 
the given period. But these school inspectors as executive organs 
of the city authorities are also communal officers, and it is provided 
that the two commissions, or the two offices, should not be identical, 
since the latter, that is, the communal office, is one for life. The ques- 
tion is a mere theoretical one, so long as there is no occasion for the 
State authorities to interfere. 
The qualifications of a city school inspector are that he be a protes- 
sional teacher who has the scientific preparation of a principal of a 
normal school and head master obtained ina university. The minister 
of education determined upon these qualifications and the city adopted 
them. The city was then divided into six school districts, and for each 
a city school inspector was appointed and confirmed by the royal 
authorities. Being State officials as well as city officers, these school 
inspectors have the inspection and management of all elementary 
schools within their district, be they city, State, or private institutions. 
The rapid increase of the school system during the following year 
soon made an increase in the number of school inspectors necessary; 
it was done in October, 1881, and the number of districts and inspectors 
increased to eight. In October, 1893, a redistricting of the city and 
an increase to ten districts and inspectors took place. Whether this 
number will suffice for the future it is as yet too early to surmise. 
Since experience in local supervision had not been gathered in the 
city of Berlin, it was at first difficult for the six school inspectors to 
know exactly how to proceed and what to do; everything depended 
upon the men who with circumspection and tact entered upon their 
duties and conscientiously tried to follow the intentions of the royal as 
wellas the city authorities, and meet the justifiable demands of practical 
school work, as well as the teachers themselves. Their work was 
essentially lessened by relieving them of dry routine office work, which 
was left to the clerks at the central school office. The chief work of 
the school inspectors is now to periodically inspect and examine the 
schools under their charge, and to report to both the city and royal 
authorities; to examine all the private schools; to hold conferences 
and meetings with principals and class teachers; make brief visits to 
all the classes; arrange for local changes immediately necessary at the 
beginning of the year; finally, consulting both with the local school 
boards and the central school committee as to changes in the appoint- 
ment of teachers and the opening of classes. This college of assistant 
superintendents holds conferences every week with the royal school 
councilor or general superintendent as chairman. AI] questions of 
principle and technical execution, as well as questions of management 
and promotion, are here discussed and decided upon. Since the year 
1886 the school inspectors have also been charged with the revision of 
the courses of study, that is to say, with thetdeviations from the normal 
 
-P-A-G-E-325
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 277 
course prescribed, so far as these changes pertain to local require- 
ments and needs. They are furthermore charged with the distribution 
of stationery and books within the sum appropriated by the central 
authority; and lastly, they are charged with arranging for leaves of 
absence, substitutes, and decisions in cases of contest concerning dis- 
cipline. During the meetings of the central school committee (the 
authority which in American cities is commonly called the school 
board), the inspector represents all the measures with which his 
immediate superior, the school councilor, or general superintendent, 
charges him. 
Since the appointment of school inspectors in 1877, the number of 
questions intimately related to school education requiring profound 
study and careful comparison with institutions in foreign countries 
has gradually increased; the extensive field of hygienic measures, the 
question of kindergartens, children’s asylums, playgrounds, manual 
training, domestic economy, and other topics, claim much attention and 
interest. 
The central school committee has to face these questions and needs 
expert advice. The committee refers these questions, as they come up, 
to the supervisory staff. The school inspectors, having a seat in the 
school committee but no vote, are desirous of having the privilege of a 
vote on all questions on which they themselves report. The city legisla- 
ture, that is, the lower house of it, the city council, has, however, disap- 
proved the plan. Of the original six school inspectors appointed in 
1877, three have accepted other positions, one has died, one is pen- 
sioned, and only one is still active. Concerning the work of the super- 
visory staff the report of the magistrate, embracing the period from 
1877 to 1881, contains the following sentence: 
The secure development which the communal school system has had was possible 
only with the cooperation of these officers; they have grown within a short time to 
be essential factors of the system, so that their authority is as firmly rooted and their 
sphere of activity as circumscribed as though supported by ancient tradition. 
The introduction of school inspectors led to a change in the local 
boards. Their membership was made to consist of three members, 
namely, a school inspector, one member of the school committee, and 
the rector or principal of the school. Their duties are well defined, as 
follows: The school inspector is the chairman and represents the cen- 
tral school committee in pedagogical questions; the member of the 
committee, who is also the superintendent of the building, attends to 
all affairs concerning enrollment and control of attendance, repairs, 
etc.; the rector has the immediate duties of supervision within the 
house and grounds, but the class teachers, being full-fledged teachers, 
are not hampered or influenced in the methods of teaching they may 
choose to select. The private schools also have «a local board; in place 
of the former ecclesiastical member the city school inspector acts as 
supervisor. 
   
-P-A-G-E-326
278 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94, 
The general principle has been followed that ecclesiastical school 
inspection was replaced by secular supervision; but for the supervision 
of religious instruction, somewhat different measures had to be taken. 
It was agreed to make a clear distinction between supervision and 
direction of that instruction. The former was delegated to the school 
inspectors, the latter was left to the religious congregations or their 
delegates, the clergymen. 
This course was necessary, because in 1866 the city government had 
entered into an agreement with the church dignitaries of St. Hedwig 
by virtue of which the six Catholic elementary schools of the city had 
been incorporated into the city school system on the condition that 
they should be placed under city supervision and be opened for pupils 
of other denominations. The matter was settled by the minister of 
education and the provincial school authorities by adopting the follow- 
ing rules: The clergymen designated for the purpose shall have the 
right (1) to visit the schools during the hours when religion is taught; 
he may also examine the pupils; (2) he may demand that the course of 
study and the programme of topics be shown him, and he may question 
the teacher concerning them; (3) he is not allowed to give orders, but 
must consult the school inspector; (4) the hours devoted to the instruc- 
tion in religion are to be made known to the respective clergymen; (5) 
the clergymen may be present during the examination for promotion so 
far as it concerns the study of religion. 
It may be stated with satisfaction that the good feeling existing 
between the supervisory staff and the clergymen designated to direct 
the religious instruction has never been seriously disturbed. Only the 
difficulty of arranging the hours for confirmation lessons leads to con- 
siderable disturbance in the regular school instruction. 
(7) Course of study, length of sessions, division of time, and examina- 
tions for promotion.—The aim of the Berlin common school is like that 
of every elementary school—to accustom the children to serious mental 
labor, and to lead them through strict discipline to order, diligence, 
and obedience. The education and training is done through instruc- 
tion, and the school practices educative influence in precisely the same 
measure in which it conducts its instruction earnestly and suceessfully. 
The instruction embraces branches, the selection of which is deter- 
mined partly by the child to be educated, partly by the ethical commu- 
nity in which it lives, moves, and has its being. The selection of 
branches of instruction can not be essentially different from those pre- 
scribed for all elementary schools of the country; and yet a rural school 
» near the Polish boundary or the sand dunes of the Baltic coast, even 
though it be fully graded, has a different task of civilization from 
the six-grade common school of Berlin. The peculiarity of life in a 
metropolis demands of a city school an education fitting a child of the 
metropolis, and an amount of knowledge that will secure to the future 
citizen a possibility to support himself, and ability to aid in solving 
problems arising from close community with others. ~

    -EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 279 
The child coming from small, inconvenient tenement rooms will find 
in the large, light, airy schoolrooms, and in the extensive playgrounds 
what the parental dwelling fails to give. Vigorous gymnastics supple- 
ment the physical wants of a child by means of bodily occupation, 
systematic and manifold exercises for strengthening the muscles and 
the nervous system. The danger of too much liberty resulting in 
flightiness and distraction, is met by a strict school discipline and by 
the demand for concentration of thought upon different problems. The 
boys’ propensity for loitering and idleness is met by the demand for 
home work, and the inclination for amusement and frivolity is counter- 
acted by a strong emphasis upon ideal pursuits and ethical points of 
view. 
The child of Berlin, growing up between high brick walls, has little 
opportunity for movement in the open air and observation of nature’s 
life and action. It’s comprehension of natural evidences and phe- 
nomena within its own horizon is often too limited; the city school will, 
therefore, furnish a small compensation by the study of plants and cut- 
tings sent weekly from the botanical gardens, and by periodical visits 
to the zoological garden, the aquarium, and the urania. By means 
of more extensive matter and a different kind of instruction than is 
offered in a secondary school, the vivacious city child, whose later life 
will perhaps be passed amid commercial, industrial, or trade pursuits, 
the school will give ample nourishment—mental food—that will inter- 
est him, awaken spiritual aspirations, and create that skill which equips 
him for the struggle for sustenance that is sure to await him. 
These few observations will make it obvious why the demands upon 
the elementary institutions of learning in the city must be peculiar 
with reference to locality, course of study, and appliances for teaching; 
but above all with reference to the teachers and their methods. 
To meet these peculiar demands has been the constant care of the 
administration, especially since the year 1878, when the consolidation 
and organization was completed, and special tasks and problems could 
be taken up for the purpose of improving the interior work of the 
school. The first thing done was to scrutinize the courses of study and 
more carefully grade the matter of instruction and fix the limits of 
work for each grade. In many conferences of the school inspectors, 
principals, and teachers of both city and private schools, all branches 
of study were discussed, and the points of view were fixed from which 
the selection of the matter and best method of teaching them could 
be determined upon. Thus a basis was gained for the purpose of fram- 
ing special courses within the frame of the prescribed normal course 
which, while considering the special needs of localities, would not 
destroy the unity and extent of the course, nor change the treatment 
of each branch. Rules and regulations were agreed upon in confer- 
ences of the supervisory staff and submitted to the central authority. 
For all these revisions teachers, principals, and supervisors were given
-P-A-G-E-328
280 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. - 
opportunities foran exchange of opinion concerning questions of method 
and educational principles. 
The length of daily sessions and the hours of work were submitted 
to discussion and the following points were agreed upon: 
(1) Instruction in the two lower grades, both in boys’ and girls’ 
classes, is to be given in the forenoon. Whether the school begins in 
the summer at 7 or at 8 o’clock, and in winter at 8 or at 9 o’clock, was 
left to be determined by local considerations. 
(2) Instruction for the middle grades in boys’ schools shall also be 
given in the forenoon, but gymnastics as well as special branches may 
be given in the afternoon for one or two hours. Whether one or two 
afternoons per week would be needed for these studies was left to the 
decision of the principals and teachers of each school. The instrue- 
tion for girls in the middle grades was also to be given in the forenoon 
only, except female handiwork, to which two hours for two afternoons 
per week were assigned. 
(3) Instruction in the upper grades, both in boys’ and girls’ schools, it 
was decided to arrange in the forenoon and leave free as many after- 
noons as possible. The rule was established, however, that no afternoon 
instruction should begin before two hours had elapsed after the close of 
the morning session. Usually the morning session has five hours, from 
8 till 1; but when the afternoons are used the morning session closes 
at 12. 
The revision of the course of study was of grave importance for the 
internal development of the schools. Previous to the adoption of the 
famous regulations of October 1, 2, and 3 of 1854 a normal course of 
study had been framed by the city authorities for communal, parochial, 
and private schools. This normal plan was changed in 1855 to make 
it harmonize with the ministerial requirements of 1854. The entire 
change and great external development of the schools during the fol- 
lowing decade and the more liberal tendency of the time caused certain 
demands to be made upon the schools, which found expression in 1864 
in an amended normal course for all elementary schools under the charge 
of the city school committee. This amended course gave evidence of a 
more liberal elementary education than was prescribed in the minis- 
terial regulations. It provided for a seventh grade called ‘selecta.” 
When, under Minister Dr. Falk, in October, 1872, the former regula- 
tions of 1854 were abolished and “general directions” were issued by 
the Royal Government which gave expression to principles and methods 
that had long been practically tried in the Berlin schools, itwas easy 
to frame within the limits of these directions of the minister a new nor- 
mal course for the elementary schools of Berlin. How the time was 
distributed upon the different branches and what changes have taken 
place within the last fifty years may be seen from Tables 9 and 10 at 
the close of this article.
-P-A-G-E-329
  
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 281 
The normal course adopted gave for each branch only the end in 
view, that is, the amount of knowledge to be imparted; hence the schools 
needed special courses, which required the approval of the authorities. 
These special courses were tried, both for each grade and each branch, 
and thus a final decision was reached. Their temporary application 
was necessary owing to great fluctuations of the population, which 
required a certain elasticity of the course. 
In September, 1875, rules for the examination for promotion were 
adopted, and they are now in force. These regulations permit a survey 
of the instruction and its results. The order of examinations is fixed 
by the principal, who also presides, though the class teacher himself 
examines; it is done orally, but the written work done during the year 
is inspected. After that a conference of the teachers of the school, 
with the principal in the chair, takes place, in which cases of difference 
of opinion concerning the promotion of pupils are discussed. The 
teachers, both men and women, who during the year taught in the class 
have the right to vote; in cases of a tie the principal has the deciding 
vote. In cases where the principal objects to the promotion of a child 
the school inspector decides the question. All decisions concerning 
the promotion of children from class to class are entered upon the 
minute book of the conference. No child is promoted on trial and 
children may be returned to a lower grade if found wanting. Children 
who can not keep pace with the work of the class are reported to the 
school inspector, and all those who come from other city schools are 
assigned to the grade to which they are entitled by their standing in 
the former schools. 
In 1893 the college of school inspectors conferred concerning the 
changes in the examinations for promotion. These changes had refer- 
ence to a more minute statement of the limits of each grade and a 
division of the upper grade into two yearly divisions. 
The regulations then adopted designated the minimum of what a 
pupil must know at the close of a year’s work, except for the highest 
grade, because that question is dependent upon various factors. Gen- 
erally it is accepted that a pupil having passed through the course is 
‘expected to “read fluently and with good emphasis, write orthograpic- 
ally, distinguish between high German and provincial idiom, know 
the etymology of his language, and be able to analyze a sentence, He 
must be able to repeat in writing a brief narrative or give a descrip- 
tion, and know something of the lives and works of poets such as 
Gellert, Schiller, Goethe, Arndt, Uhland, Chamisso; he must know the 
outlines of their biography and have memorized some of their poems. 
In arithmetic he must be able to operate with decimal and common 
fractions, solve problems by the rule of three, and understand the 
eustomary busiress rules. In geometry he must be able to prove the 
axioms of the congruence of triangles and angles within a circle, to 
compare planes bounded by straight lines, and have had practice in
-P-A-G-E-330
  
  282 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94, 
simple construction. Some characteristic forms of plants and animals, 
as well as the most familiar minerals, elementary observation of nature, 
and experiments with the most common physical apparatus are the 
limits for nature studies. The pupil must know the geography of 
Europe and a little of all the other continents, but thoroughly the 
physical and political geography of Germany. He must know the 
important dates and personages of German history.” 
This is merely the minimum of what is required of the elementary 
child ready to leave the common school; but the city provides in 
advanced private schools for more than was sketched in the foregoing. 
The pupils are offered, since 1876, a superior education, for which the 
city is ready to pay, so that they may enter secondary schools belong- 
ing to the city where they are free of tuition fees. In order to offer 
talented pupils a practical education for industrial pursuits some of 
the city elementary schools contain so-called select classes, or supple- 
mentary classes, in which twenty-four weekly hours are devoted chiefly 
to nature studies, physics, and drawing, but only pupils who have 
finished their elementary course at the age of 12 can enter these 
“selecta.” Since the year 1884 the city has opened a number of sec- 
ondary schools without Latin, which receive the pupils after they have 
completed their elementary course. 
Atter these general remarks a consideration of the separate branches 
of study may follow. 
Religion: (This being a subject excluded from the course of study in 
American public schools, the details of the course in Berlin are here 
omitted.) 
Language: Instruction in the mother tongue (reading, writing, spell 
ing, and grammar) follows the normal course of 1873. During several 
years following 1873, orthography and the grammatical terminology 
were repeatedly diseussed in the meetings referred to in a foregoing 
paragraph. It was decided that the readers should be the basis of the 
spelling exercises and that in grammar the Latin terminology should 
be applied only in the upper grades. In 1879 a test in penmanship and 
orthography was ordered for all the schools. Each teacher should. 
select the three best pupils of his class and dictate to them a piece of 
three foolscap pages. Many of these papers were found to contain not 
a single mistake in spelling; the six best pupils received prizes. 
These tests have taught several lessons to the teachers and have been 
repeated in girls’ schools as well. 
A definite decision concerning the rules of pecan was reached 
by the adoption of the new rules and word list prepared with the 
approval of the minister of education, which expressed the results of 
the famous conference for the simplification of German orthography, a 
conference which consisted of the most noted German philologists and 
authors, and which met under the auspices of the Royal Government. 
All text-books used had to be revised in order to comply with the new 
rules of spelling. 
 
-P-A-G-E-331
  
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 283 
In 1878 a motion for a change of readers led to a number of confer- 
ences concerning the requirements of a good reader. It was agreed 
that too great a uniformity, such as would be. caused by the adoption 
of one single series of readers for all the schools of the city, should be 
avoided; hence a limited number of series were adopted for certain 
parts of the city. In compliance with this rule the following series 
were introduced and are now found in use: Engelien and Fechner, 
Bohm and Liibeky, Berthold and Reinicke, Schmidt and Schillmann, 
Wetzel and Biittner. For children who move into school districts 
where other readers are used, exchange depots are arranged, so that 
they may change their readers without cost to the parents. 
Arithmetic and geometry: As early as 1868 a ministerial order was 
earried out with reference to the teaching of decimal fractions and the 
metric system, so that the pupils might be enabled to apply the metric 
system, shortly to be introduced generally. It was arranged to intro- 
duce decimal fractions not only in the upper but also in the middle 
grades. Of course, it was done in an elementary way. Reduction of 
common fractions to decimal fractions and addition and subtraction, 
partly also multiplication and division, of decimals were taught in the 
middle grades, while multiplication and division, reduction and the con- 
venient uses of decimal fractions in practical problems were taught in 
the upper grades. Within a few years from the date mentioned it was 
found that problems in simple proportion with easy common and deci- 
mal fractions were not practiced enough. In order to test this conclu- 
sively, in the year 1882 a trial was held in each school, to which three 
pupils from each room were admitted. This trial confirmed the appre- 
hension which dictated it, and more attention has since been given to 
routine exercises. 
In geometry the old rules of 1873 are still in force, according to 
which this branch is taught by means of immediate observation, i. e., 
sense perception, and in close relation with instrumental drawing. In 
the upper grades instruction in geometry is separated from drawing, 
and embraces, besides plane geometry, mensuration of solid bodies, 
The treatment this branch receives is not the systematic method of 
Euelid, although several problems are treated as he treats them. AII 
preblems are brought into connection with circumstances from civil 
and industrial life—that is to say, they are not abstract and hypothet- 
ical, but concrete and practical exercises. 
History: In order to secure good results of instruction in history in 
the upper grades, a guide was prepared for the Berlin city schools, in 
which information was given concerning aim, selection of matter, and 
method of teaching. A new stimulus was given to this branch by a 
ministerial order of May, 1889. According to this order the history of 
the Fatherland should (a) be continued to the date of the ascension of 
Emperor William II; (5) it should begin in the middle grades with 
pupils of 10 years of age, and not be confined to the upper grades (12  
-P-A-G-E-332
284 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
to 14 years); (c) it should dwell particularly in the upper grades upon | 
the efforts the Prussian Kings have made in promoting the welfare of 
the people; (d) wherever a shortening of the course becomes impera- 
tive, it should not be done at the expense of modern history, but in that 
case a later historic date should be chosen for a beginning. 
These new rules coming from the Royal Government necessitated a 
recast of the daily programmes in order to make room for the increase 
in history study, and also a rearrangement of the matter of instruction. 
As usual, conferences were held, and it was finally determined (1) that 
in the lower of the two middle classes instruction in history should be 
combined with geography; (2) that in the upper of the middle classes 
two hours per week of the instruction devoted to language should in 
future be devoted to history, with this provision that one and the same 
teacher should teach both branches; (3) in the girls’ classes two of the 
hours hitherto devoted to female handiwork should be devoted to his- 
tory. These changes, and the proposed distribution of the matter of 
historic study, were submitted to the Royal Government and approved 
June 20, 1891, without alteration. 
Geography: Since history had been introduced into the middle grades, 
and since history can not be taught without accompanying instruction 
in geography, a change in the course of geography was found neces- 
sary, which was determined upon in 1892, 
The “normal plan” of 1873 prescribed only twenty-eight hours per 
week for the middle grades of girls’ schools; geography did not begin 
till the third grade was reached; in later years this was changed, so 
that two hours were added per week, and these were devoted to geog- 
raphy. The new plan of 1892 transfers some parts of the geography 
of Germany to the third grade and prescribes for the highest grade a 
review of the geography of Germany with special reference to com- 
merce and industry, and also prescribes elements of mathematical geog. 
raphy. 
Nature studies: The course in natural history was revised in the year 
1880. The general outlines prescribed by the Royal Government is too 
sketchy to be followed in a graded school, nor did the Government 
intend to prescribe any more than outlines, expecting that each school 
system should carefully grade the matter of instruction to suit local 
needs and peculiarities of each section. The Berlin schools had to 
further divide the time assigned to natural history, inasmuch as the 
local course of study required physics, and since the distribution of 
the work was different for boys’ and girls’ schools, it became necessary 
to clearly define the limits of each branch. 
The former “normal plan” required for natural history in boys’ schools 
two hours per week in the two middle grades, two hours for the lower 
of the higher grades, and three hours for the highest grade. For girls’ 
schools it had been the same, except that nature studies begin one 
year later. 
 
-P-A-G-E-333
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 285 
With reference to the fact that instruction in physics should not be 
confined to the highest, but be taken up in the one below, and that 
botany should be taught in the summer, the following course was 
determined upon: 
A. In boys’ schools, beginning in the third year of the course, zool- 
ogy in winter, botany in summer, two hours a week; physics in the 
grade below the highest in winter, two hours per week, while in sum- 
mer the time between Easter and the summer vacation be devoted to 
botany. After the vacation till the close of fall, zoology should be given 
two hours per week. In the highest grade all through the year physics 
is to be favored with two hours a week, while natural history receives 
one hour a week, the year being divided to suit the requirements of 
that study. 
B. In girls’ schools the study of natural history begins one year later, 
and two hours a week are given to it. In the grade below the highest 
this study is continued, but it does not share its time with that devoted 
to physics, as in the boys’ schools. In the highest grade in winter the 
girls study physics two hours a week; in spring, summer, and fall they 
continue their study of botany and zoology. 
After this scheme was adopted, the inspectors, principals, and teach- 
ers decided what subjects should be taken up in the various grades, 
and they were selected with special reference to boys and girls. Ob- 
servation of natural bodies and phenomena, demonstrations and experi- 
ments with suitable apparatus—in fact, the entire course in nature 
studies has of late years greatly changed in extent and interest, both 
among teachers and pupils. 
Drawing: Since April, 1878, drawing has been extended to the lower 
grades, so that all grades from the lowest to the highest have instruc- 
tion in drawing. Formerly it was done entirely by the class teachers; 
later, the most talented teacher in a school undertook to teach the 
drawing in all the grades of that school. The development with refer- 
ence to method and plan of study remained a probiem until in 1887 
the minister of education published a guide for the teaching of draw- 
ing in the public schools of three or more grades. This guide caused 
a change in the course of the Berlin schools, since it shortened the 
course by beginning drawing in the second year instead of the first, 
thus giving back, in the first year, to language study the two hours 
hitherto devoted to drawing. Other changes were found unnecessary, 
since the plan followed in the city schools of Berlin was almost identi- 
cal with the guide published by the minister, and thus proved that the 
authorities of Berlin had been in touch with the latest improvements 
in the study of drawing. 
(The auithor here goes very much into details and touches upon text- 
books and various methods in drawing, all of which may be here 
omitted, since many technical terms would be required, not generally 
understood.)

    286 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
Singing: Concerning the position and treatment of instruction in 
singing in the city schools a number of lectures were delivered before 
the teachers, men and women, during the years 1877 and 1878. After 
several conferences concerning the number'of church hymns to be 
learned, the royal authorities in 1889 determined their number to be 30. 
They were carefully selected and distributed among the six grades of 
the school. 
Female handiwork: As early as the year 1840 the school authorities 
introduced this branch into the girls’ schools, which had at that time 
only four grades. Eight hours per week was the time devoted to it. 
It was confined to knitting, darning, sewing, and marking linen. In 
the year 1850 this instruction was confined to the two upper grades. 
In 1853 a reorganization of that branch in the city schools was begun, 
and in 1854 it was determined to have it taught in the three upper 
grades. Four afternoons each week, between 2 and 4 o’clock, were 
devoted to female handiwork. The instruction aimed at skill in female 
occupations, without reference to the pupils’ grading in other branches. 
For indigent pupils each school had a small fund to defray the expenses 
for obtaining material. Since 1863 an appropriation for all the schools 
for that purpose is regularly made by the central authorities. 
In 1853 experienced women were called upon to inspect this instrue- 
tion. Since 1860 the duties of these supervisory ladies were regulated 
by special instructions, and these instructions are still in force, but not 
applied vigoreusly, owing to the improved professional preparation of 
the teachers of that branch. Since 1858 a teacher of female handiwork 
has to prove her ability to teach that branch, a special city board of 
examiners granting certificates. In 1861 the communal schools had 49 
of such teachers, who received a salary of 60 thalers each. 
In 1872 instruction in female handiwork was regulated by minis- 
terial decree, which made it an obligatory branch of the public school. 
Absence from the lessons in handiwork was punished as well as 
absence from other school lessons. Female handiwork extends over 
the four upper grades, with six hours per week. With the introduc- 
tion of history in the middle grades of the girls’ schools handiwork 
was curtailed by two hours. In order, however, not to let this branch 
suffer it was resolved to employ two teachers for each class at the same 
time. 
From the irreducible funds of the former industrial schools the sum 
of 45,000 marks, or about $11,000, has been set aside, the interest of 
which is used for prizes for diligent pupils in female handiwork. These 
prizes are not large, but they suffice to give an impulse to the study, 
especially since a private bequest of 1,500 marks per annum has 
increased the available means. The first prize may be as high as 125 
marks in one half year. Pupils have the choice to either take the prize 
or have their expenses defrayed for three years. The first prizes were 
distributed in 1879 in consequence of a sewing test.

  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 287 
Gymnastics: Exercises in physical culture were introduced as early 
as 1854. At first only the recess and noon hour were devoted to these 
exercises, and Ling’s system was followed. After a ministerial order 
of May, 1860, gymnastic exercises had been made an obligatory branch 
of the course in elementary schools. The Berlin city schools were at 
first provided with the required apparatus in the playgrounds. The 
arrangement of the yards and the preparation of teachers were given 
over to the care of a city gymnast, whose appointment was confirmed 
in 1864, and since 1877 the entire supervision of gymnastics in the city 
schools is left to him. Gymnastics properly so called began with two 
hours a week in the summer of 1862 for boys in the middle and upper 
grades of twenty-two schools. In the winter it had to be abandoned, 
because the apparatus was not under roof, but since that time every new 
‘schoolhouse built has been provided with a suitable gymnastic hall. 
The older ones of these halls were really only sheds, that is, roofs sup- 
ported by columns, but later ones were built with walls. Since Octo- 
ber, 1868, gymnastics were continued all through the winter, and in 
1876 thirty-one commodious and spacious gymnastic halls were in use. 
The chief gymnast prepared the teachers of gymnastics in accord- 
ance with the guide published by the minister of education for Prus- 
sian schools. The teachers are paid 1.50 marks per hour. 
In girls’ schools gymnastic exercises are conducted according to 
Spiess’s method, and in October, 1876, forty-two classes received regu- 
Jar instruction. As the school system developed and better school- 
rooms and gymnastic halls were provided for, this branch was made to 
share in the general improvement. A new course for girls’ gymnastics 
was prepared by Schettler in 1883, and officially adopted. 
Up to the year 1889 instruction in gymnastics extended only over 
the middle and upper grades of the school. The faulty positions of 
school children in the lower grades when writing at their desk led to 
the introduction of gymnastics in the lower grades also, so that at 
present gymnastics is a regular branch of the course for all the grades. 
In the lower grades it is confined to suitable exercises in calisthenics 
and marching. Gymnastics on apparatus is confined to the middle 
and upper grades. Though the number of gymnastic halls greatly 
increased in course of time, the number of classes to be accommodated 
grew faster, so that it is necessary often to accommodate two classes 
in one hall. The year 1893 saw the completion of the ninety-first 
gymnastic hall connected with elementary schools. 
Besides gymnastics, the play of the children is carefully observed 
and supervised, playgrounds for the children attending school are set 
aside in both the Friedrichs and Humboldtshain in the Treptow Park 
and the Tempelhofer Field. The children congregate there at specially 
designated hours in summer and go through a number of games and 
plays conducted by the teachers. Similar efforts are made in the play- 
grounds of the city schools.  
-P-A-G-E-336
288 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
Domestic instruction: The society for the welfare of children who 
have passed through the schools petitioned the magistrate in 1893 for 
the use of suitable rooms in the school buildings for the purpose of giv- 
ing instruction in domestic science to girls during the last school year. 
The magistrate, with the sanction of the chamber of deputies or city 
council, granted the request and placed at the disposal of the society 
suitable rooms in several new schoolhouses. Instruction began in the 
winter of 1893. Since this branch is not obligatory, it is taught only 
on afternoons not occupied by school work. The girls who choose to 
enter these classes are excused from attendance upon lessons in handi- 
work for two hours per week. The attempt has proven eminently sat- 
isfactory and a motion to continue and extend this department has 
been made, and is likely to be supported by the authorities. 
School gardens: The fact that it becomes more and more difficult in 
a metropolis to provide for the necessary number of plants fer instruc- 
tion in botany led to the establishment of a school garden in 1869. 
The commission of parks and gardens was authorized to arrange it, and 
in the year 1875 the first plants were distributed among six schools. 
During the following year forty-nine schools could be supplied, and ever 
since 1877 every public school of Berlin is regularly supplied. Since 
1881 the private schools of the city are also supplied, as well as the 
royal institutions, if they pay a small sum of $10 to $20 per year for 
100 or 200 plants or cuttings twice a week. 
During the summer at 6 o’clock in the morning two large wagons 
start from the school garden loaded with cuttings packed and labeled, 
which are delivered to the different schools. All the city schools are 
divided into. three groups, each group receiving its cuttings on two 
days, the lessons in botany being arranged accordingly. Every packet 
contains one species. On an average every city school receives four 
different species, in secondary schools six species, per week. Every 
packet has between 150 and 190 cuttings. During vacation, of course, 
the supply ceases. In order that the superabundance in summer be 
not followed by a scanty supply in the fall, annuals are chiefly raised, 
and it is done so early that the blossoms are obtained long before the 
very hot season sets in. This is necessary, owing to the fact that the 
plants have to be cut on the evening previous to their delivery. In 
order to acquaint the teachers with what they may expect from the 
school garden during the following week, the daily papers have regular 
announcements, and since 1887 a list of the plants raised is submitted 
to the special teachers, who consult with the gardeners as to what may 
or ought to be sowed or planted. Teachers in botany are permitted to 
take their classes into the school gardens and give a lesson in the open 
air, where they are aided by the gardeners who cut the specimens. 
But the plants thus placed at the disposal of the teachers are not 
the only ones observed and studied, for the playgrounds of every 
school has flower beds; shrubbery and trees are maintained which offer    
   
-P-A-G-E-337
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 289 
opportunity for observation, and pot plants kept by teachers and 
pupils give aid im the same direction. All these arrangements for a 
rational teaching of botany have proven eminently beneficial. 
(8) Continuation of teachers’ studves.—If the common school has a 
thoroughly prepared corps of teachers it would seem sufficient to 
secure success, but the demands each branch of instruction makes are 
so great that only a continuous occupation and study will make it 
possible to completely master them and thus secure the success in the 
schoolroom which is so much to be desired. Teachers must have 
opportunities, besides those commonly offered in the metropolis, for 
self-culture, the extent and direction of which meets the desires and 
the free determination of the individual. The authorities have felt 
this and have been ready to meet the demand. Teachers’ libraries 
and the city school museum, with its valuable collection of books and 
appliances for teaching, are open for teachers of both sexes. Then 
there are regular continuous courses and scientific lectures, for which 
the city government cheerfully defrays the expenses. Special opportu- 
nity is given for study in the natural sciences in the school garden, 
the urania, the zoological garden, and the aquarium. 
The city school museum has occupied the session room of the 
seventy-second common school since 1877. It contains a library of 
“about 13,000 bound books, has an annual appropriation of $1,000 for the 
purchase of new books, which are selected from new publications on 
the theory and practice of teaching. Private bequests have increased 
the stock of appliances and the collection of objects for natural history 
study, as well as the physical apparatus, which collections are very 
valuable. The books and collections are open for inspection and use 
on Saturdays between 3 and 6 and on Sundays until 1 p. m.; books 
may be obtained also on Wednesday between 3 and 4 p.m. The num- 
ber of books borrowed and returned, as well as the number of visitors, 
has grown from year to year. In this museum the continuous lecture 
courses for young teachers are held. 
Other courses, such as for drawing, have been held ever since the 
year 1874, and since 1880 the drawing from solids has been made a 
special feature; these courses are given in the school for artisans. 
The school inspectors have held, since 1878, a great number of pro- 
fessional conferences or teachers’ meetings, each one in his district. 
All the branches of instruction have been treated extensively with 
reference to matter and method, and since 1879 there have been added 
scientific lectures on mathematies, physics, history, and literature, 
which lectures are gratuitous and attended by a great number of zeal- 
ous teachers. Under the presidency of the chief gymnast of the city 
a conference of gymnastic teachers is held during every term. 
Side by side with all these institutions for self-culture, there are a 
number of private institutions maintained by the Berlin Teachers’ 
Association; lecture’ courses, for eee and a separate school 
museum. :

CONCLUSION, 
The foregoing memorial was intended to show the main features of 
the development of the Berlin common school system during the last 
fifteen years. It has considered only the primary or elementary schools, 
and left entirely out of consideration, as not germane to the question, 
all the other city schools devoted to secondary instruction, nor has it 
touched upon the city institutions for the blind, deaf-mutes, orphans, 
and idiots, nor the reform schools. All these institutions, numerous as 
they are, lie outside the subject under consideration. 
From the facts given—and naturally this memorial deals with facts 
only—anyone may form an opinion concerning the institutions called 
the “Berlin common schools.” It is easily seen that the entire popu- 
lation nurses and loves its favorite child, the common school, and holds 
its protecting hand over it,so that it may grow steadily.. Yet no one 
within or without these schools will deny that there is still room for 
improvement in various directions. 
At present very essential questions are laying claims to the attention 
of the school administration. Especially pressing are the questions 
of internal development. The present organization of six ascending 
grades has during thirty years been able to furnish secondary schools 
with but a small fraction of pupils. Most of these latter institutions 
have elementary and preparatory schools of their own. How to do 
away with these and raise the elementary school to such a degree, that 
they may be the preparatory institutions for secondary schools, is one 
of the burning questions. 
The organization of schools with more than six grades is one of the 
means of raising the standard of education with the great mass of the 
population. A school organization is the better the greater the per- 
centage of population it accommodates, and the greater the number of 
children who pass through all the grades of the school from the lowest 
to the highest, and thus obtain an education for life commensurate with 
the demands of owr modern time. This is best attained by reducing 
the size of the school and by a better grading. Organization, quality of 
pupils, and the number of pupils are in closest correlation. Equaliza- 
tion in attainments is best secured by grading the children into eight 
grades analogous to their ages from 6 to 14. A recent resolution of 
the central school committee has added one grade to the already exist- 
ing six grades, by dividing the sixth into two grades. But a better 
grading is likely to follow in the near future. 
We conclude this memorial with the words of the annual report of 
1876, which, though published nearly twenty years ago, are still 
applicable: 
It is the intention to establish over the entire city a complete net of elementary 
schools organized alike, large enough to admit all the children of the city gratui- 
tously, and effective enough to deserve the general confidence of the population; a 
system of local school boards extending over all the districts, and consisting of citi-
-P-A-G-E-339

zens who act without pay, being acquainted with their neighbors, and who will insist 
upon the children fulfilling the duty of attending school, tolerating no unnecessary 
absence; a central school committee (‘‘ central administration”) endowed with 
authority and provided with all the necessary technical assistants so as to meet the 
needs of schools in every part of the city, as soon as they arise; and Jastly, a corps 
of teachers thoroughly prepared, faithful to duty, and with aon otion to the profes- 
sion of teaching, breathing life into the elementary institutions of learning. 
That was, and is still, the intention, and it will remain an object of 
solicitude among all the strata of society in the city of Berlin.

  298 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
ATTENDANCE IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS FOR BOYS IN GERMANY. 
In an appendix to the exposé on the universities in Germany, the 
annual report of this Bureau for 1891-92 contained a summary (p. 368) 
which has served as a basis for comparisons with other States. The 
imperial secretary of state at Strasburg, Dr. George von Mayr, a 
noted statistician, subjects the sources of that table, published by 
Prof. Dr. C. Rethwisch for the Chicago World’s Fair, to a criticism 
which reveals most interesting details, and he brings out features of 
secondary school attendance in Germany which are particularly wel- 
come in this country at a time when high schools and colleges are tak- 
ing an inventory of good intentions and results. 
In presenting this statistical material it is necessary to reiterate that 
the tables show only the number of boys studying in secondary schools, 
not of girls. The boys in Germany who are predestined by their par- 
ents to pursue higher studies must begin at an early age—say at 10 or 
ll years. For girls who aim at entering upon higher studies, ample 
provision in the form of public preparatory secondary schools is not 
made as yet in Germany, though there are numerous private institu- 
tions of that kind. Efforts are being made of late to establish publie 
gymnasia, or classical schools, for girls, and the Government has the 
question under advisement. Dr. Mayr, in summarizing the material 
furnished by each State, arrives at the following totals for the year 
1890:

This is about 3 per cent of the school-going population. 
The separate States show remarkable differences in the attendance 
in the three classes of schools. While in Prussia and in Bavaria the 
classical schools have still the majority of students, States like Saxony, 
Wiirtemberg, Baden, aud Hessen display an opposite tendency. 
The confessions or religions of the students are mentioned separately, 
both in totals and in ratios, as is seen from the following paragraphs. 
The numbers are not quite correct, owing to the fact that two States 
make no returns concerning the denomination of their students. 
Germany has 1 student in secondary schools to every 199 of its 
inhabitants; that is, 1 Protestant student to every 181 Protestant 
inhabitants; 1 Catholic student to every 307 Catholic inhabitants; 1 
student of other Christian confessions to 204 of such inhabitants; 1 
Jewish student to-every 30 Jewish inhabitants. A computation of 
the attendance in the three categories of schools with reference to the 
religion or confession can be made only by leaving out the numbers 
from Wiirtemberg and Oldenburg. The result is as follows:

This mode of computation involuntarily leads to the opinion that 
small numbers presuppose a numerous participation, while large num- 
bers presuppose a small participation, in secondary studies. This cer- 
tainly is correct, but it does not give as adequate a statement as ratios 
would. For that reason the table is repeated here, displaying the 
number of students to every 10,000 inhabitants.

In all the three classes of secondary schools we find the Jews more 
numerously represented than the Christians. This is equally true in 
classicaland modern high schools. The Protestant population alsomakes 
use of the opportunities for secondary education much more frequently 
than the Catholic, but there is quite a difference between the number 
of those in classical and those in modern high schools (so-called Real- 
schulen). © These differences in the participation of the different dcnom- 
inations are so great that a more minute statistical comparison than the 
one presented in the foregoing table (see p. 299) would not materially 
alter the result shown in these ratios. Absolutely correct comparison 
would be possible only if the entire number of students in secondary 
schools could be viewed according to religious denomination and age, 
and compared with the male population divided in the same manner— 
that is, with reference to their religion and age. This isimpossible, since 
neither the school statistics nor the general German census offer the 
material. The latter particularly, as far as the total for the Empire 
comes into question, suffers from a want of combination. Not even 
the most elementary distinction between the confessions, namely, that 
according to sex, is given. Thisis owing to the want of detailed enumer- 
ation in sore States. German statisticians therefore earnestly desire 
that the next census may reveal the facts necessary for this and similar 
 
-P-A-G-E-349
  
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 301 
comparisons. As far as the numbers go, the participation of the four 
groups (Protestant, Catholic, other Christians or dissenters, and Jews) 
| in secondary education as given in the table must suffice for the present. 
The facets which the foregoing ratios reveal are not in any way sur- 
prising, since estimates based upon Bavarian statistics, and upon those 
of a few other States, had revealed similar proportions yearsago. Thus, 
\ for instance, the classical schools—that is, the so-called gymnasia in 
Bavaria—had some years ago among their pupils 36.5 Catholics, 46.3 
Protestants, 86.7 Israelites of every 10,000 of the inhabitants. For 
1890 Bavaria exhibits the following ratios of students to the total pop- 
ulation (distinction as to sex being missing): Catholics, 28.8; Protes- 
tants, 36.5; Jews, 151.0, for every 10,000 inhabitants. Hence, the Jews 
in Bavaria, as was shown in 1863, have increased their ratio of students 
in gymnasia enormously—that is, nearly 100 per cent within about 
thirty years. The extraordinary increase in the participation of Jews 
in the secondary schools without Latin—that is, in the modern high 
schools, or Realschulen—is even greater. 
Professor Von Mayr quotes in this connection a paragraph from 
Volume I of his Bavarian Statistics of Education (1873, p. 49), with 
reference to the attendance in classical high schools. He at that time 
remarked: 
  I should like to warn my readers not to draw immediate conclusions from the 
relative proportion of the different confessions upon the talent or inclination of the 
students, or the confession to which they belong. There are other considerations 
that determine the real participation in any branch of education besides talents 
and inclination, and among these are the ease or difficulty of attending certain 
schools, These are dependent upon the habitation of the parents and the location 
of the schools. Doubtless the population of any place or city furnishes the compar- 
atively greatest contingent of students. Now, it must be considered that the Jew- 
ish population is nearly always found in large cities which have a variety of schools 
beyond the scope of the elementary schools. Hence, we find the Jewish children 
more frequently in secondary schools, while the Catholics are chiefly agriculturists, 
farmers, and the like, and live in hamlets, villages, and small towns, which do not 
offer opportunities for secondary cducation as large cities do. Similar proportions 
are found where the members of one confession are preferably grouped in larger 
cities, as, for instance, the Protestants in Upper Bavaria, where the participation of 
Protestants in secondary schools is comparatively larger than in Lower Bavaria, 
where they are found both in the cities and in rural districts.    
What Dr. Mayr said twenty years ago is, in a measure, still applica- 
ble to-day, though it may not be possible to control it statistically. 
The statistics of the Empire fail to go into details on the subject of con- 
fessions with regard to the locality in which they are represented. If, 
however, Prussian statistics, which are very minute, are taken as a 
standard of measurement, we find (1) that the Jews form 1.2 per cent 
of the entire population of Prussia; (2) that they form 2.6 per cent of 
the city population; (3) but only 0.3 per cent of the rural population; 
and (4) 2.8 per cent of the population in cities of over 20,000 inhabitants, 
From this it is obvious that the Jews have better opportunities for 
attending secondary schools. Their present strong participation in such  
-P-A-G-E-350
    802 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
schools, is, however, not explained by this objective relation only; aside 
from this there must be a subjective tendency. This tendency is nursed 
doubtless by the choice of profession and occupation common among 
the Jews, they being found chiefly among the merchants and profes- 
sionals, but not among mechanics and farmers. 
Though it may be of interest to record similar statements from edu- 
cational statistics of the United States, it can not be considered essen- 
tial, since the undenominational character of the schools in this country 
precludes any reflections such as Professor Mayr was able to make for 
Germany. His reflections and ratios concerning denominations are not 
the essential features of his summary (see p. 3), but the proportion 
of students in the various classes of schools regardless of their denom- 
ination is of supreme importance, since it shows an enormous increase 
of pupils in the schools without Latin, and only a moderate increase in 
those with Latin. In viewing the table we must constantly bear in 
mind that the total of very nearly a quarter of a million pupils in see- 
ondary schools represents only the boys. If we add the number of girls 
attending secondary schools not enumerated here the total number 
would be increased to half a million. One-half a million of 50,000,090 
inhabitants is 1 per cent. This is a very extraordinary percentage, for 
it means that of every 100 men, women, and children, one is in the see- 
ondary schools. If we abandon the total number of inhabitants and 
take the total number of school-going age, 6 to 20—namely, about 
10,000,000—the proportion in secondary schools would be 5 per cent, a 
proportion not reached by any other country. 
CourRsES oF Srupy IN History Founp IN VoGUE IN EUROPE. 
Prof. Joseph Baar, Ph. D., published in a supplement to the annual 
catalogue of his school (a progymnasium in Malmedy, Germany, 1893) 
an essay in which he subjects the courses of study prescribed for the 
study of history in secondary schools in several European countries 
and the United States to a rigorous comparison. He then summarizes 
the various courses in such a way that the amount of time and matter 
prescribed may, at a glance, be seen. The matter is of supreme impor- 
tance to teachers in this country, where universal history has remained 
a subordinate study, being reserved, as it were, to grace the high- 
school course. 
The author starts out with this weighty remark: 
Whether the study of history will bear fruit for life, or whether it remain mere 
text-book knowledge accumulated for examinations, or both, or neither; whether it 
develops the whole soul life of the pupil, clears the intellect, and fills the emotions 
and the heart with noble sentiments, or whether it will leave the heart cold, the 
head empty, causing confusion—all that depends principally upon the scientifie and 
ethical personality of the teacher. Good text-books can only aid him in his work. 
Prescribed courses of study determining the aims and methods of his instruction 
 
-P-A-G-E-351

may promote or retard him; they can do nothing else. If we wish to sketch a per- 
fectly true picture of how history is taught in foreign countries we should have to 
know above all who the teachers are that give the instruction and how they do it. 
As a matter of self-evidence, sources of such information are lacking. All we can 
do is to show what is intended by the authorities and adequately fix the rank in 
which the study of history is placed in the different countries by stating how much 
time is devoted to it and what matter is to be gone over. 
The interest in this inquiry is a threefold one—a scientific, educational, and polit- 
icalinterest. For the principles according to which the courses are framed, the text- 
books chosen, the selection of matter, and the distribution over the several years of 
the course determined, and lastly the method employed are all dependent upon the 
question: Why is history studied? (1) For the historian the science of history has 
its own aim. He desires to gain as extensive and thorough a knowledge as possible 
of historical facts. (2) It is different with the educator; history tohimisa means to 
an end; he wants to give his pupils an intellectual and ethical education which is 
most desirable for life. Hence, he will select the matter of instruction to that end 
and form it in content and extent according to the capacity of his pupils. (8) The 
third and in most countries decisive motive power, the State, has the same purpose, 
but aside from that it has a political end in view. It emphasizes love of country, 
adherence to the existing form of government, and a general comprehension of gov- 
ernmental relations. According to this purpose the State schools will of necessity 
occupy themselves with home history, and according to the existing form of gov- 
ernment the study of history will result in a history of princes or a history of the 
people—that is to say, it will be supported either by a monarchic-dynastic spirit or 
by-arepublican spirit. In private or denominational schools of Belgium and America 
other considerations, such as dictated by the church, come into play besides the 
political. 
The author then subjects the courses and methods pursued in France 
Russia, and the United States, and compares them with those generally 
adopted in Germany, Austria, Italy, and other countries. (See sum- 
mary at the close of this article.) With reference to the United States, 
he points out that here the authorities do rarely more than prescribe 
the countries and epochs to be gone over; method and distribution of 
matter are left to the teacher. He says: 
Nevertheless there are a number of uniform features in the teaching of history in 
America which show clearly that all the schools of the various States, though not 
ruled by a centralized power, are following a general, well-understood motive, that 
of amalgamating the foreign clements and making the population of the Union 
homogeneous in sentiment and aspiration. The aim of the study of history in the 
United States is more than in monarchical states—a political one. It is to prepare 
the young to a self-active participation in the life of the State by giving them the 
requisite historical knowledge and by training them in true American sentiment. 
This explains why the grammar schools generally confine themselves to American 
history. This home history is taught very thoroughly during the last two years of 
the elementary course (thirteenth and fourteenth year of life), and also in form of a 
review in the high schools. Ancient history, on the other hand, is taught only in 
the high or other secondary schools, and very superficially at that. English history 
is all that finds a little attention besides ancient and home history. 
The author then subjects various text-books and courses of study to 
a critical analysis, quotes the course of study followed in the Baltimore 
City College, and finally places the various courses in juxtaposition. 
This summary is very interesting, and is here reproduced in full and 
very minute translation:

  STATISTICS OF THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES IN EUROPE. 
There have been recently published a number of authentic books on 
the origin, management, spirit, and present status of European uni- 
versities, notably on those in Germany. The report of the Bureau of 
Education of 1891-92 contains an English rendition of the most authori- 
tative of these books, that of Professors Paulsen and Conrad, which is 
remarkable for its historical and statistical reviews. But none of these 
publications gives much information concerning the libraries of these 
famous seats of learning. Dr. R. Kukula, the author of Minerva, Jahr- 
buch der gelehrten Welt, has undertaken to gather the information 
desired, and presented it in an article published in the Academische 
Revue (March, 1895), the substance of which is here reproduced, Dr. 
Kukula, says: ‘ 
Among the appliances for teaching which every university offers its 
teachers and students the library takes the front rank. <A statistical 
summary of the number of volumes in the libraries of universities in 
the large States of Europe, their annual expenditures, and, so far as 
possible, the number of books used in a given year, would throw light 
upon the degree of scientific equipment of the various institutions, and 
_ offer a ratio of comparison for the countries represented.
-P-A-G-E-357
  EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 309 
Of course it would be erroneous to draw far-reaching conclusions 
from the facts gathered, such as judging the importance of an institu- 
tion of learning from the extent of its library. Several large and valu- 
able libraries are found preserved in unimportant but formerly eminent 
centers of culture. The data offered in the following tables are chiefly - 
derived from the fourth volume of Minerva. They permit the con- 
clusion that in some countries the importance of higher education may 
be gauged by the importance bestowed upon the university libraries. 
However, for most countries this would not hold good, since many of 
them possess, aside from great state, church, and private libraries, 
certain renowned scientific central libraries. In the following sum-. 
maries these are not considered, and this fact should prevent the 
reader from hasty conclusions. 
The Royal Library in Berlin; the Royal Court and State Library in 
Munich; the British Museum in London; the Bibliotheque Nationale 
in Paris; the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale in Florence; the Imperial 
Publie Library in St. Petersburg; the Royal Libraries in Stockholin, 
The Hague, and Copenhagen, are unquestionably the largest and most 
important libraries of their respective countries. Nevertheless they 
are here purposely omitted, since it was the object to give the status 
of libraries specifically intended for university use. If the possessions 
and expenditures of such eminent institutions as the British Museum 
and others mentioned above were counted in, they would naturally 
change the order in which the countries appear. 
Before turning to the tables, it is necessary to state that the data 
collected with reference to the number of books, ete., are for the calen- 
dar year 1894; the data concerning expenditures or appropriations for 
the fiscal year ending in 1894, and the data referring to the frequency 
with which the books have been used or loaned (so far as it was possible 
to obtain the information) for the school year 1893-94. 
Germany, as a matter of self-evidence, stands at the head of the list, 
because its university libraries have always been the chief sources of 
information for learned men in that country. The character and extent 
of higher education in Germany has ever been closely connected with 
and dependent upon the universities, and erudition outside of universi- 
ties is rarely acknowledged, except by drawing it into the universities. 
Paulsen says in his recent work on the German Universities: 
Learned man and professor are synonymous terms in Germany. When a great 
scholar is mentioned there, the question at once arises, In what university is he 
active? Andif he is not in a university, it may be confidently expected that he feels 
this official disregard. Again, when a professor is mentioned, the question is asked, 
What has he written? what are his scientific achievements? The consequences of 
this relation have been most significant for the formation of the entire German 
intellectual and scientific life. 
To this may be added that this relation of erudition to the higher 
seats of learning has been decisive for the development of the great 
libraries of Germany. This explains the vast aggregations of books in  
-P-A-G-E-358
  
    310 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
the centers of culture, while in England and America quite an oppo- 
site tendency has made itself felt. In these countries many large and 
influential libraries are established and maintained by the people, and 
they in turn influence the people; they are public, democratic institu- 
tions, while the German university libraries are exclusive institutions. 
Of course this statement is only relatively true, since the German 
university libraries may be used by the public also. But the needs of 
the university are considered first in the purchase of books, not the 
needs and demands of the reading public, which would, as experience 
shows, run to books of fiction. 
After Germany come Italy and Great Britain, the classic countries of 
bibliophiles. Trance, the centralized government of which called into 
existence the University of France, has neglected the libraries of the 
so-called “facultés,” and since the Bibliothtque Nationale is excluded 
from the following list, France appears to be ‘ranking low, but in fact 
it far outranks Austria and Russia, being but slightly behind Italy and 
Great Britain:

This order is changed, however, if we rank the countries with refer- 
ence to the amount of money paid for the maintenance of their univer- 
sity libraries: 
   
      Germany - ~ $122, 520 
Great Britain. - 78,050 
France 60, 527 
Austria-Hungary -- 51, 959 
Ttaly 27, 611 
21, 499 
14, 540 
6, 079 
  It would hardly be fair to rank these countries with reference to the 
frequency in the use of the library books, since the rules and regulations 
are different in the various institutions and the conditions and accom- 
modations peculiar to each university.

  CHAPTER VIII. 
PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN ITALY. 
By B. A. Hinspa.e, Ph. D., LL.D. 
Professor of the Science and the Art of Teaching in the University of Michigan. 
PREFACE. 
The last twenty or thirty years have seen extraordinary progress in 
popular education all over the civilized world, and notably so in Eng- 
land, France, and Italy. With what has been accomplished in the first 
two countries the American public is measurably familiar, But even 
scholars and educators generally have little knowledge of the educa- 
tional work that has been going on in Italy at the same time. This fact 
is the reason for the preparation of the present monograph. 
As the reader will see, the writer treats the subject quantitatively 
rather than qualitatively. A critical estimate of Italian education 
would require a more intimate knowledge of the subject than he can 
lay claim to. His main object has been to present in outline the system 
of public instruction that has been evolved in Italy since the establish- 
ment of the Kingdom. 
The writer expresses his obligations to His Excellency Count Puilet, 
under secretary of state for public instruction of the Kingdom of Italy; 
to Prof. C. F. Restagno, the Count’s secretary, and to Signor Lucigi 
Cippitelli, inspector of schools of Rome, for documents and other valu- © 
able information. His thanks are especially due, however, to Dr. Egisto 
Rossi, of the Italian statistical bureau, author of a monograph on 
education in the United States, for documents and other substantial 
assistance.

THE UNIFICATION OF ITALY. 
The eloquent words with which Sismondi closes his History of the 
Italian Republics have often been quoted as a fitting characteriza. 
tion of the State of Italy in the period following the Treaty of Vienna 
and preceding the first events of the series that led immediately 
to Italian freedom and union. “Italy is crushed, but her heart still 
beats with a love of liberty, virtue, and glory; she is chained and 
covered with blood, but she still knows her strength and her future 
destiny; she is insulted by those for whom she has opened the way 
to every improvement; but she feels that she is formed to take the lead 
again; and Europe will know no repose till the nation which in the 
dark ages lighted the torch of civilization with that of liberty shall be 
enabled to enjoy the light which she created.” Politically, however, the 
period was more tersely characterized by Prince Metternich, when he 
said so cynically, “Italy is a mere geographical designation.”! ‘ 
Not to go further back, Italy had been trampled under the feet of 
foreigners from the close of the fifteenth century to the close of the 
eighteenth—the French, the Spaniards, the Germans, and the Aus- 
trians. It was divided into numerous States, all weak, all small, all 
despotisms; only two, Sardinia and the Popedom, having Italian rulers, 
and most of them more or less dependent upon foreign powers. Italian 
patriots could find no language too strong to describe the hopeless deg- 
radation of their country. When Napoleon came he overthrew nearly 
all of the existing States and made the major part of Italy immediately 
dependent upon France, or rather upon himself; still, by sweeping 
away ancient abuses and confusion, and introducing many. much 
needed reforms in legislation, in administration, in judicial practice, in 
the fiscal system, in education, in means of communication, he strength- 
ened the sentiment of union, and contributed to the development of a 
real national life. But with his downfall the new régime came, at least 
seemingly, to an abrupt end. 
It was the aim of the diplomatists who at Vienna rearranged the 
map of Europe practically to restore the state of things existing in the 
peninsula before the French Revolution; but they did not reckon 
with the progress of thought, of which the revolution was in part a 
cause and in part an effect.2. In the years intervening between 1815 
and 1859 powerful causes were silently undermining the numerous 
potenates who ruled in Italy, with the sole exception of the King of 
Sardinia. The country below the Alps is a geographical unit. The 
1 Since the fall of the Roman Empire (if not even before it) there had never been 
a time when Italy could be called a nation any more than a stack of lumber can be 
called a ship.”—Forsyth, quoted by Marriott, The Makers of Modern Italy. 
2“ The Italy of 1815 differed Lut little from the Italy of 1748; but in 1815 there were 
hopes which had no bemg in 1748. Italy was divided on the map, but she had made 
up her mind to be one.”—Dr. E. A. Freeman: The Geographical History of Europe.

  PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN ITALY. B2T 
people of the twelve or fifteen States all stood in a similar relation to 
the great name of Rome. Mentally and morally, they constituted one 
people—the Italians: They all used the language in which Dante wrote 
his immortal poems; they all participated in that marvelous growth of 
democratic ideas and shared in that ardent desire for national life, 
which are such powerful elements in recent history. Accordingly, 
nothing but favorable external conditions, such as actually existed in 
1859-1870, were necessary to enable the Italians to achieve the sub- 
stance of the dreams of their prophets and patriots for many hundreds 
of years. A recent writer has well said that Italian unification is the 
most romantic if not the most important exemplification of “the con- 
solidation of kindred and contiguous States, or rather bundles of States, 
on the basis of the vital principle of nationality.2, And still another: 
“The rapid creation of the present Kingdom of Italy, after her long 
and bitter oppression, is one of the marvels of modern history, and 
evidences how much may be done by the courage and wisdom of a 
comparatively few master minds, and how true is the motto of the 
patriot, ‘never to despair of the Republic.’””> 
THE EDUCATIONAL STATE OF ITALY IN 1861. 
But the political unification of Italy, necessary as it was to that end, 
by no means realized the Italian ideal. Of itself alone, it could not 
even permanently endure. While physical force may overthrow and 
wholly destroy those ideas and sentiments that assume the form of 
objective political and social facts, it can not, save indirectly and in the 
long run, alter men’s convictions or change their modes of thinking and 
tones of feeling. Force put an end to English rule in the Thirteen 
States, and crushed slavery in our civil war; but some other and higher 
form of power was needed to blend those States together in a vital fed- 
eral union and to make the emancipated slaves fit for the rights and 
duties of freemen. Garibaldi’s sword could overthrow the Bourbon 
dynasty in the Two Sicilies, but it was a powerless weapon against the 
ignorance and superstition that had so long been startling social facts 
in that Kingdom. It was essential that the mental and moral life of 
the people should be cleansed at its fountain. This fact the best of 
  
1Napoleon said at St. Helena: ‘(Italy is one sole nation, The unity of customs, 
of language, of literature, in some future more o7 less distant, will unite all its 
inhabitants under one sole government. * * * Rome is undoubtedly the capital — 
which one day the Italians will select. * * * It is necessary to the happiness of 
Europe that Italy should form one sole State, which will maintain the equilibrium 
on the continent between France and Austria, and on the sea between France and 
England.” 
Count Cayour said in Parliament but a few months before his untimely death: 
“The choice of a capital is determined by high moral considerations. It is the sen- 
timent of the people that decides. Rome unites all the conditions, historical, intel- 
lectual, moral, which form the capital of a great state.” ©

the Italian leaders understood perfectly well. Mazzini, the republican 
idealist, who defined democracy as “the progress of all through all under 
the leadership of the best and wisest,” placed equal stress upon educa- 
tion and instruction as means for accomplishing his purposes. Massimo 
@Azeglio, who was a man of a much more practical mind, although an 
artist and man of letters, used to say, “Before forming Italy we must 
first form the Italians.” D’Azeglio “endeavored to educate the youth 
of Italy in a higher political creed than the assassination of tyrants,”! 
including in the programme that he laid down in 1848, the promotion of 
education and the establishment of schools. It is no disparagement of 
Cavour, of Victor Emmanuel, and of Garibaldi to say that the value 
and permanency of their work waited upon the school-teacher with his 
primer. 
“In the matter of education, the Kingdom of Italy at the time of 
its formation might almost be described as a desert, broken here and 
there by an oasis of matchless fertility and luxuriance. The learning 
of the learned was high, and the ignorance of the ignorant profound.” ? 
The writer might have added that the learned were few, the ignorant 
many. This conjunction of high learning and profound ignorance was 
due to two conspicuous causes. From early times the Italian univer- 
sities had maintained high standards of culture; the public authorities 
had most grievously neglected popular education. Touching the second 
of these facts, the ordinary tests are decisive. 
By the end of 1861 the Kingdom of Italy, as it now exists, had been 
formed with two important exceptions: Venetia continued subject to 
the Austrian Emperor until 1866, and Rome to the Pope until 1870. 
The census of 1861, back of which the Italian authorities do net com- 
monly go in presenting educational statistics, accordingly does not 
embrace those important provinces. It may be added that in 1871 they 
contained 3,647,000 of the 26,801,000 people of Italy.

read, or were, as the Italians say, analfabeta. 
To a person accustomed to study such statistics, this table is full of 
interest. The relative number of illiterate persons is very large. The 
difference between the number of illiterate men and women is much 
too great, while the per cents of illiteracy in the several periods are

comparatively uniform. In well-educated countries the years from 6 
to 12 and from 12 to 20 are school-going years, and the relative num- 
ber of persons of such ages able to read, especially of those from 12 
to 20, is larger than the relative number of such persons of all ages. 
Of the men who married in 1866, 59.96 per cent, and of the women 
78.97 per cent, or 69.465 per cent of both sexes, signed their marriage 
papers with a cross. Of the total number of conscripts drawn for the 
army the same year, 64.01 per cent were illiterate. 
The statistics showing the educational backwardness of the Kingdom 
at its formation become still more impressive when considered with 
reference.to geographical distribution. Any person having a general 
familiarity with Italian history and current life may find matter of 
serious instruction in the following table. It shows most conclusively 
that those parts of the Kingdom were best educated where govern- 
ment had been best, and the people freest where industrial, commercial, 
and moral life were most active, where national sentiment was strong- 
est—in a word, where modern progressive ideas had taken deepest 
root.

Once more, 68.19 persons in every 100 of the male population 6 
years of age and upward, and 81.27 of the females, were illiterate. 
From 20 years of age and upward the corresponding ratios were 65.47 
and 81.52 to the 100. Such was the educational condition of Italy in 
1861—the country in which the Renaissance was born and in which it 
attained its fullest development! Plainly, the Italians stood in need of 
a mental and moral regeneration. Besides, although powerful forces 
had been working in the direction of unity for a half century, there 
were also particularistic or divisive influences at work. The people of 
the old states needed to be welded together and be made to respond 
still more strongly to the national spirit. Nor could any other cause 
contribute so powerfully to both these ends as a really national system 
of education that should reach all classes and conditions of men.

  330 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
THE DAWN OF THE NEW ERA. 
Fortunately a new educational era was already dawning. It is an 
interesting fact that the Casati law, with which the new era opened, 
was enacted by the Sardinian parliament the very year that saw the 
first practical step taken in the direction of political unity. It bears 
the date Turin, November 13, 1859. The battles of Magenta and Sol- 
ferino, which freed Lombardy from the Austrians and secured her union 
with Piedmont, were fought June 4 and June 24 of the same year. In 
1860 Tuscany, Parma, Modena, the Roman legations, the Marches, and 
the two Sicilies were united with the northern provinces, and in 1861 
Vietor Emmanuel was proclaimed King of Italy. Venetia took her 
place in the new Kingdom in 1866 and Rome hers in 1870. In the mean- 
time the system of education inaugurated im 1859, with modifications, 
was applied to the several provinces immediately on their becoming 
free and taking their places in the national system. 
The fact is, however, that the law of 1859 was not an abrupt begin- 
ning of the new order of things. The following summary, prepared by 
another hand, reveals a long series of steps leading up to it: 
MEMORABLE DATES. 
1729 and 1772. Establishment of famous royal constitutions by princes of the 
house of Savoy, through which the eontrol of secondary education was taken away 
from the religious orders, and the Collegio delle Province, with one hundred free 
scholarships, was established with the aim of preparing, in connection with the 
university, teachers qualified to give this instruction. Schools of methods were 
established to prepare teachers for primary schools, and with the title of Magistrato 
della Reforma, the germ of a well-organized council of public instruction appeared. 
1786. Reorganization of rural schools in Lombardy, the decree stipulating for the 
schools of the poor. 
1802. Sub-Alpine republics decreed that all communes should establish elemen- 
tary schools. 
1808. Schools reorganized in parts of Italy under French domination. Academies 
established at Turin, Genoa, and Pisa as integral parts of the University of France. 
1813. Reorganization of public instruction in Rome. 
1818. New school law promulgated in the Lombardian-Venetian kingdom, which in 
1822 became the code of education for that part of Italy. 
1844. Establishment of ‘‘Asili d’ Infancia,” infant schools, in Piedmont, which 
were the beginning of the well-organized school system. 
1847. (Decree of November 30.) Office of minister of publie instruction created. 
1849. Establishment of ‘‘Societ& a’ Instruzione e d’ Educazione” in Lombardy- 
Venetia, which has been of great assistance in the organization of the present public 
school system. 
1859. Promulgation of the ‘Legge Casati,” or school law, named from the min- 
ister of public instruction at that date, which forms the basis of the present school 
system, as it provided that each commune should maintain an elementary school, 
that teachers should have certificates of capacity, that there should be great strict- 
ness in university examinations, ete. 
1867. Religious corporations abolished and their schools classed as private. Other 
modifications of law of 1859 made. 
1877. Instruction made obligatory for children between 6 and 9 years of age.  
-P-A-G-E-379

1878. Gymnastics placed on school programmes. 
1881. Legal enactments reorganizing higher council of education and making 
changes in school supervision. 
1886 and 1888. Legal enactments bearing upon teachers’ salaries and teachers’ 
licenses.! 
As will be seen, a few dates subsequent to the Casati law are inserted. 
in the summary. 
Tt is instructive to note the prominence of northern Italy, and par- 
ticularly of Piedmont, in this series of memorable dates. 
GENERAL POLITICAL FACTS. 
The area of Italy is 114,410 square miles. The population at the 
census of 1881, the last taken, was 28,459,628; it is now estimated at 
something more than 30,000,000.2, The Kingdom is divided for different 
purposes—historical, political, administrative, and judicial—in different 
ways. The only divisions that we need to consider are the provinces, 
the largest administrative divisions, of which there are 69, and the 
communes, the smallest, of which in 1889 there were 8,256.* 
The constitution, or statuto, granted by Charles Albert in 1848, which 
made Sardinia a constitutional monarchy, is to-day the fundamental | 
law of the Kingdom of Italy. It vests the legislative power in the 
King, in the Senate appointed by the King from certain designated 
classes of persons,‘ and the Chamber of Deputies elected by the people. 
Tt vests the executive power in the King, who reigns by the grace of 
God and the national will. The King exercises his executive functions 
through responsible ministers. The parliamentary system prevails in 
practice, ministers or the Government being dependent upon the vote 
of the Chamber of Deputies. The provinces have each a provincial 
council and commission; the communes, 2 communal council, a munici- 
pal council, and a syndic, or mayor. Such are the general features of 
the Government as far as we are concerned with them. 
THE CASATI LAW. 
The Casati law, which took its name from M. Gabrio Casati, minister 
of public instruction at the time of its passage, consisted of 5 titles and 
380 articles. These are the several titles: (1) The administration of 
public instruction; (2) Superior instruction; (3) Secondary classical 
instruction; (4) Technical instruction; elementary instruction.

an unlimited number of members above 40 years old, who are nominated by the 
King for life, a condition of the nomination being that the person should either fill 
a high office or have acquired fame in science, literature, or any other pursuit tend- 
ing to the benefit of the nation, or finally, should pay taxes to the annual amount of 
3,000. lire, or £120.” (The Statesman’s Yearbook, 1890.)

Article 1, however, recognizes but three branches of education: 
Superior, secondary classical, and technical and primary. All these 
subjects are dealt with comprehensively, and some of them with much 
detail. A closer analysis of this celebrated law is not called for, nor 
is it necessary to follow in order the numerous changes and modifica- 
tions to which it has been subjected. My task is to describe the prin- 
cipal features of the existing system. Such dates as ave of chief 
importance will be given by the way. It is, however, important to 
understand that this celebrated statute is the base line from which all 
subsequent school legislation is to be measured. 
THE ADMINISTRATION OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. 
We are now to describe the various organs or authorities that exer- 
cise eduéational power and responsibility. 
(1) All general legislation in relation to the subject is enacted by the 
national legislature. How the legislature has used its power so far 
_ as we are concerned with it, will appear as the exposition proceeds. 
(2) The King is the supreme educational executive. His relations to 
the department of public instruction are not different from. his rela- 
tions to the other executive departments. That is, the King, subject to 
the laws, acts through the minister of public instruction. 
(3) The minister of public instruction is a member of the cabinet, or 
Government, and like his fellow ministers, although appointed by the 
Crown, is responsible to the popular branch of the legislature. He 
may be considered under two aspects: He is the agent through whom 
the King acts in discharging those educational duties committed to 
him; he performs a great number of official acts that the laws devolve 
upon him directly. 
(4) The superior council of public instruction consists of 24 ordinary 
and 7 extraordinary members, all appointed by the King for the term 
of seven years, and all persons of high competency and repute. A 
large majority of the councilors hold other educational appointments, 
as professorships in universities; but five of them must be chosen from 
among persons not engaged in educational work. Only the ordinary 
councilors receive compensation; and as most or all of these draw 
salaries from the Government for other services rendered, a small com- 
pensation is deemed sufficient, one that little more than covers their 
expenses while acting as councilors. 
The superior council holds a regular meeting every six months. The 
minister of instruction is the president, and calls special meetings when, 
in his judgment, they are necessary. The minister and the council are 
assisted in the performance of their duties by a legal counselor, who 
gives advice as to the interpretation and application of the educational 
laws and regulations. 
The superior council prepares and examines all projects of laws relat- 
ing to public instruction, and renders judgment on matters regarding 
the instruction and administration of the schools. It examines and
-P-A-G-E-381
  PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN ITALY. 333 
presents to the minister for his approbation books and treatises for use 
in the public schools and the programmes of instruction. The judg- 
ment of the council is required: (1) When the claims of aspirants to 
vacant professorships in the universities are to be considered; (2) when 
questions of competency between conflicting scholastic authorities are 
to be decided; and (3) when questions of scandal or failure in the dis- 
charge of duties on the part of professors of secondary and higher 
schools arise. At the end of every five years the superior council pre- 
sents to the minister a general report of the condition of each branch 
of national education, with appropriate remarks and proposals. For 
this purpose annual reports are sent to the council by the general 
inspectors and by other scholastic authorities. 
For the better performance of its duties, the superior council is divided 
into three sections, or committees, corresponding to the three branches 
of public instruction. Assignments to these committees are made by 
the minister. 
The powers and duties of the committee on technical and elementary 
instruction should be more particularly noticed. At its head is an 
inspector-general, who has the assistance of 9 central or general inspect- 
ors and 69 circuit or provincial inspectors, one from every province in 
the Kingdom. Acting through these assistants, the inspector-general 
sees to it that the communes fulfill their obligations relating to educa- 
tion according to law, and that the elementary schools are carried on 
in accordance with the programmes and regulations emanating from 
the central authority. These inspectors are appointed by the King 
and must be persons who are reputed competent by reason of educa- 
tion, professional attainments, and moral authority to perform their 
responsible duties. : 
While the main permanent features of the central administration are 
as now outlined, numerous minor changes appear from time to time. 
These are made by the minister of instruction, the more important of 
them subject to the approval of the superior council. As respects these 
details of direction and administration, very much depends upon the 
minister for the time being. Mention should be made of the giunta, an 
executive board or committee appointed as above mentioned, which 
exists for its own special purposes. 
In 1891 the central scholastic administration was organized as follows: 
The minister secretary of state. 
The under secretary of state. 
The cabinet, consisting of 8 persons. 
The general secretary’s office, consisting of 14 persons. 
The superior council of instruction, consisting of 32 members. 
The board (giunta) of the superor council, 14 in number. 
The secretary’s office of the superior council, comprising 3 persons. 
The general direction of antiquities and fine arts, consisting of 28 persons. 
This committee has charge of openings and excavations of antiquities, muse- 
ums, pinacoteche, galleries, the preservation of monuments, academies and 
institutes of fine arts, rewards and subsidies for artists, artistic congresses, 
expositions of fine arts, societies for the promotion of fine arts, the schools 
of recitation, conservatories and institutes of music.
-P-A-G-E-382
    334 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
The permanent committee of fine arts, embracing painters, sculptors, and 
architects, with 12 members. 
The permanent commission of musical and dramatic art, divided into two sec- 
tions, composed of 6 persons each, 
The office of the antiquities and monuments of Rome and the suburbs. 
The division for superior instruction, embracing universities, institutes of 
superior instruction, astronomical observatories, academies of science and 
letters, historical institutes, deputations and societies of national history, 
consisting of 27 persons. 
The division for secondary classical instruction, embracing lyceums, gymna- 
siums, national boarding schools, the college of examiners for lyceum 
licenses, and provincial scholastic councils, 25 in number. 
The division for technical instruction, having charge of technical and nau- 
tical institutes and technical schools, composed of 21 persons. 
The division for primary and popular instruction, having oversight of primary 
and popular instruction, normal schools, female teachers, institutes of the 
blind and deaf and dumb, asili, educational exhibits, popular libraries, 
scholastic inspectors and delegates, pensions, subsidies, etc., comprising 37 
- persons. 
Accounts, 23 persons. This committee relates to such topics as estimates, 
expenses, inventories, property sequestrations and cessions, the registration 
of decrees and the publication of the Official Gazette. 
(5) Every province has a provincial school council, composed of the 
prefect, who acts as president, of the provincial inspector, who acts as 
vice-president, and of ten councilors. This council has a general over- 
sight of elementary, normal, and secondary schools within the province. 
It gives attention to school laws and regulations, sanctions the appoint- 
ment of teachers, gives advice in regard to the educational budget and 
subsidies. It inspects private schools in regard to hygiene and morals, 
but not in respect to studies. The provincial inspector is the connect- 
ing link between the provincial council and the ministry of education 
at Rome. He has particular charge of classical, scientific, and normal 
instruction. District school inspectors, who must hold certificates of 
eapacity, inspect the elementary schools twice a year. There are also 
subdistrict delegates, nonsalaried officers, appointed by the King for 
three years, who lock after the elementary and secondary schools as 
representatives of the council. 
To illustrate, the scholastic administration of the province of Ales- 
sandria was organized as follows for the year 1891: Councilors, includ- 
ing the president of the lyceum and the director of the female normal 
school, 10 in number, the royal inspector of studies, 6 scholastic 
inspectors, 70 scholastic delegates. 
It should be added that the provincial council, or legislature, may 
vote, and sometimes does vote, subsidies to the elementary schools, 
although it is not responsible for their financial support. 
(6) The part taken by the local governments, communes, municipali- 
ties, or cities in carrying on public instruction is extremely important. 
The elementary schools and many others, as will appear hereafter, are 
immediately under their charge. Upon them rests the principal burdens 
of popular education. As far as possible the school administration is 
 
-P-A-G-E-383
PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN ITALY. 835 
devolved upon the authorities and officers charged with the general 
administration of local government. The school board is a committee 
of the local legislature. The syndic, or mayor, is also intrusted with 
certain educational duties. 
The foregoing will answer for a general account of the educational 
administration from top to bottom. It will be seen that it is much 
more elaborate, centralized, and rigorous than the administrative 
organization that any one of our States has yet ventured upon, not to 
say the United States. But this is in perfect harmony with continen- 
tal ideas of governmental administration in general and educational 
administration in particular. In France and Germany we find an 
administration quite as strongly centralized. 
THE ASILO. 
The Kingdom of Italy presents to our consideration a considerable 
scope of elementary instruction and a considerable variety of schools. 
At the foot of the ladder we find the asilo, the Italian infant school, 
so called. Most asili are conducted after the Aporti method, which 
takes its name from the Abbate Ferrante Aporti, who founded it in 
1847. The name is suggestive; the asilo is partly an asylum and partly 
a school; un poco troppo scuola i troppo asilo. But some asili, and an 
increasing number, are conducted according to Erébel’s system. The 
Baroness von Marenholtz-Biilow introduced the kindergarten into Italy, 
founding the first one at Venice in 1868, and a model school for the 
training of teachers at Florence three years later.. The Hon. George P. 
Marsh, for many years the American minister near the King of Italy, 
also assisted in the work. However, the name “kindergarten” has 
never been naturalized. The asilo course covers the years 4 to 6, 
inclusive, and while mainly devoted to developing the child’s body 
by gymnastics, his moral nature by examples, and his perceptive 
faculties by observation, it also introduces him to the use of books. 
The asili are carried on by the communes, by private citizens, or by 
associations. Admission to some is gratuitous, but to enter others a 
tuition charge must be paid. 
For a time asili increased rapidly in number and in pupils, but 
recently less rapidly. Fora time, too, the public asili increased rapidly, 
while the private ones fell off, but of late the first have relatively been 
losing ground. Witness the following:

-P-A-G-E-384
  336 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
The asili are most numerous in those parts of the Kingdom where 
the people are most intelligent and popular schools are best established. 
Of the total number, 1,253 are found in Piedmont and Lombardy alone. 
DAY ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
Above the asilo stands the elementary school. However, those chil- 
dren who have not attended the asilo for any reason, or have not else- 
where received preliminary training, receive their first instruction in 
the elementary school, to which purpose the first year, if necessary, is 
accommodated. 
The elementary school years are 7 to 11, inclusive, and are divided 
between two courses—an inferior course of three years and a superior 
course of two years. The school year is ten months, beginning the 
middle of October and closing the middle of August, with numerous 
holidays. The school week is five days and the school day four hours, 
with a half hour’s recess. 
The courses of study or programmes are prepared, in conformity to 
law, by the superior council of instruction, and are issued by the min- 
ister. They are uniform throughout the Kingdom. The following are 
the two courses, inferior and superior, published in the Calendar of 
Elementary Schools for the Province of Rome for the Scholastic Year 
1891-92, over the name of the royal inspector of studies. But it may 
first be observed that text-books are selected by the local authorities 
from lists of books approved by the superior council of instruction. 
They are furnished at public expense for the use of the very poor. 
Thus, in the schools of Rome the visitor will find books bearing the 
stamp, “S. P. QR.”

are those of the regular schools. ‘The Roman Calendar” contains also 
the unique or rural course (unico. rurale) as follows: 
PROGRAMME OF THE COUNTRY SCHOOLS. 
In the first and second sections of the country schools the teaching and exercises 
are the same as in the corresponding two classes in the city schools, only the master 
should as a rule omit, with the chance exception of more intelligent pupils, the 
recitation of poetry by heart. In the second section he also leaves aside all gram- 
matical teaching, and should endeavor to supply its place by exercises in speaking 
and writing. With this notice of the first two sections, we give here only the pro- 
gramme of the third. 
Section 8.—The Italian language. Fluent reading, making the pauses according 
to the punctuation. Call upon the pupil frequently to explain briefly what he has 
read. Exercise in dictation, the marks of punctuation and including orthography. 
Correction of the writing by use of the slate, and then reading of the writing cor- 
rected by the pupil. 
Short and easy compositions, in the first half year from copies, and in the second 
from a given theme with explanations and suggestions from the master. In the 
second half year the master should prefer compositions in the form of letters, and 
subjects connected with domestic affairs, such as the pupils might hear spoken of in 
the family. In regard to grammar, the master should limit himself to explaining 
and accustoming the pupils to point out in the extract which has been read the sub- 
stantives, adjectives, and verbs. 
The object lessons and practice in observation should be, as to method, the same as 
that adopted in the city schools, except that, in the choice of things, the master 
should endeavor to adapt his lesson to the requirements of the country and to the 
local customs. 
Geography.—Points of the compass, with practice in the school and courtyard. 
Drawing on slates the streets of commerce, pointing out the situation of the best 
known buildings. Drawing the map of Italy, pointing out the principal rivers of the 
division or province in which the school is situated, or of any large city. 
History.—Short lessons on the principal events in ancient history, and on those 
circumstances which led the way to the unification of Italy. 
Arithmetic.—Easy exercises in the first four rules in whole numbers and decimals, 
Practical ideas on the metrical system, avoiding the use of multiples, such as are 
not in common use, and if possible giving the pupils practice in weighing and 
measuring, with the help of the standard weights and measures. To give an idea 
by way of example of common fractions and the mode of writing them and forming 
them into decimals. 
Duties.—Without making the subject of their duties a special matter of study or 
examination, the master should not neglect opportunities for making his pupils sensi- 
ble of the duties which they owe toward God, toward their neighbors, and toward 
themselves; seeking above all to inspire them with a respect for justice and to culti- 
vate such sentiments as constitute the most precious patrimony of civilization, and 
may conduce to an orderly, peaceful, and progressive state of society. It may be 
said that there is no branch of teaching which can not be led in this direction. In 
particular the master must not neglect to avail himself of the lessons in geography 
and history, in order to make the pupils understand what sacrifices have been 
required to make the constitution of Italy such as it is to-day, and how Italians can 
hope for no security but in the maintenance of the national unity.

There are also private elementary schools that are grouped by the 
statisticians with the regular public schools. These have the same

    As observed further on, the small number of pupils in the superior 
course, while it helps out the ratio of school attendance to the number 
of children from 7 to 9 years of age, still shows how limited the aver- 
age elementary instruction is in its range.

    an 1801-92 there were 49,217 public day schools, with 50,819 teachers and 2,266,593 pupils. Private day schools, 8,395; teachers, 8,937; pupils, 187,346.   
This table does not contain the statistics of the irregular public 
schools, which for some reason do not appear in the reports until 1884, 
If we add the 2,815 schools of this class with their 84,690 pupils, we 
have the same totals for 1887 as before, 54,192 schools and 2,279,090 
pupils. 
It appears from the above showing that while private schools have 
little more than held their own in thirty years, the public schools have 
more than doubled in numbers and in pupils. Then in Italy, as in the 
United States, a large majority of the pupils in private schools are 
girls. The ratio has not materially changed. In 1862 it was 51 boys 
to 71 girls; in 1887 it was 61 to 113.  
-P-A-G-E-389
  PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN ITALY. 341 
The ratios of the pupils in elementary schools to the 100 of the 
total population, and the ratio to the 100 children of legal school age, 
show steady and healthy growth, as witness the following table:

Still, it must be remarked that these ratios are to some extent mis- 
leading. The base of the computation changes but once in ten years, 
while the percentage changes every year. In other words, the number 
of children of legal school age is obtained from the decennial census, 
while the attendance at the schools is furnished by the teachers’ 
registers. 
Again, it is well known that in societies where education is back- _ 
ward a smaller proportion of girls than of boys attend school. This 
is the case in Italy. But it will be observed that the girls are steadily 
gaining ground. In 1862 the ratio of girls to boys was, practically, 
33 to 52; in 1872 it was 64 to 88; in 1882, 84 to 100; in 1887, 92 to 109. 
Or, to put the case in another way, while in 1862 but 32.8 per cent of 
the girls from 6 to 12 years of age were enrolled in elementary schools, 
53.3 per cent were enrolled in 1876 and 62.7 per cent in 1887.   
EVENING AND HOLIDAY ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
The day elementary schools, public and private, are supplemented 
by evening and holiday schools. These are similar to the continuation 
schools of Germany—that is, they give students who can not go, or 
who do not wish to go, to the secondary schools an opportunity to 
expand and supplement their elementary school studies. They also 
afford certain advantages to persons whose elementary instruction has 
been for any reason defective. The holiday schools are held, as their 
name (festive scuola) implies, on religious holidays, of which the num- 
ber in Catholic countries is very large. The following table shows for 
the year 1886-87 the most important facts relating to these two classes 
of schools:

in the holiday schools, 707 men and 3,690 women. 
In all, 347,847 students were instructed in the evening and holiday 
schools. The statistics show a considerable fluctuation at different 
times. These schools culminated, both in number and in pupils, in 1879.

THE TEACHERS OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
The Casati law demanded of teachers certificates of qualification. 
Now, the policy is to require of them a normal school training as well. 
Yor normal teachers in the lower grade elementary schools, this train- 
ing is two years; in the higher grade schools, three years. The lower 
grade certificate covers the catechism and Bible history, the Italian 
language, reckoning, the metric system, penmanship, and pedagogy. 
The higher grade certificate takes a much wider range: Religion, com- 
position, history of literature, arithmetic and bookkeeping, elements of 
geometry and of natural science, history, geography, penmanship, and 
pedagogy. Private school teachers must hold certificates equal to 
those held by teachers of corresponding position in the publie schools. 
Of holiday school teachers these requirements are not made, 
Teachers in the public schools receive their appointments from the 
communal council, subject to the approval of the provincial council. 
No person under 18 years of age can receive an appointment. Some- 
times a probation of six months is prescribed. Until the age of 22 is 
reached, the appointment is for one year only; after that it may be two 
years or even permanent. Appointments in private schools are made 
by the manager or managers, but subject to the confirmation of the 
provincial inspector. 
The wages of public school teachers are fixed by the communal coun- 
ceil, subject to certain legal regulations. The law of April 11, 1886, 
establishes minimum limitations which are uniform throughout the 
Kingdom. Salaries can not fall below the limits fixed in the following 
table:

On January 30, 1892, there were employed in Rome and its suburbs 
582 elementary teachers, 188 men and 394 women. The 9 male city 
principals (direttori) received each 3,000 lire per annum, the 6 rural 
principals each 2,200 lire. Of the men teaching in the city, 71 received 
2,400 lire; 54, 2,200; 14, 1,900; 31, 1,600 lire. Of the men teaching in 
the suburbs, 1 received 1,800 lire; 7, 1,600; 7, 1,200, and 3,720 lire. 
The 14 city women principals (direttrici) received each 2,000 lire, and 
the 8 rural principals 1,800 lire per annum. Of the women teaching in 
the city, 49 received 2,100; 44, 2,000; 65, 1,800; 74, 1,500; 134, 1,200 lire; 
19 teachers on trial, 800 lire, Of the women teaching in the suburbs, 
2 received 1,400 lire; 6, 1,200; 1, 1,000, and 9 assistant teachers from 360 
to 480 lire. In Rome salaries in general are subject to an increase 
every five years. 
The relative numbers of male and female teachers is worthy of inves- 
tigation. The figures are given in the following table:

er ste 56, 895 
@ The total in 1891-92 was 59,771: Public school teachers, 50,819; private, 8,395. 
The ratio throughout the Kingdom is 23.221 men to 33.674 women, or 
practically 2 to 3. In Lombardy the ratio is 26 to 52. In six com- 
partments in the southern part of the peninsula and in Sicily there 
are more men than women. The disparity between the northern and 
southern provinces is owing no doubt to causes similar to those that 
make the relative number of men teachers in New England so much 
smaller than those in the Southwestern States and Territories. In 
well educated, prosperous, and wealthy communities teachers’ salaries 
are less inviting to men; society being more civil and orderly there is 
less need of the muscular virtues; there is less prejudice against 
women teachers or possibly a prejudice in their favor, while there is an 
adequate supply of well-qualified women anxious to engage in the work. 
SCHOOL SUPPLY AND COMPULSORY EDUCATION. 
The law strictly defines the minimum duty of the city, town, or com- 
mune in respect to providing elementary instruction. It must maintain 
a sufficient number of schools to accommodate the children of legal 
school age seeking their advantages. More definitely, the rules are 
these: 
(1) Every town must maintain at least one school of the lower course or grade for 
boys and one for girls. 
   
-P-A-G-E-392
344 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
(2) Every town of more than 4,000 inhabitants, or a town of any population where 
a normal school or a secondary school exists, must also maintain a school or schools 
of the higher grade. 
(3) No school having but one teacher shall contain more than 70 scholars. Where 
a school has more than that number for a month, the authorities must open another 
school in a different locality. 
The Casati law required heads of families to provide for their chil- 
dren as much instruction as is covered by the inferior elementary 
course. This law not proving effective, a more stringent one was 
enacted in July, 1877, to.take effect at the beginning of the.ensuing 
scholastic year. The compulsory years are 7, 8,9, but if the minimum 
of instruction required is not obtained in those years, then the period 
may be extended to 10 or even 12 years. The provisions relating to 
eompulsion are contingent upon the provisions relating to school sup- 
ply. They may be formulated as follows: 
(1) Children of the stipulated ages must be sent to school when living in towns 
of less than 5,000 inhabitants, having one school of lower grade for every 1,000 
persons. 
(2) They must also be sent when living in towns having a population of from 
5,000 to 20,000, supporting an elementary school for every 1,200 persons. 
(3) Also when living in the larger communes, maintaining a school for every 1,500 
persons. 
Parents have, however, the option of sending their children to pri- 
vate schools, or of educating them at home, provided the instruction 
given is equal to that of the public schools. This last fact the State 
by its rules in relation to teachers and instruction seeks to ascertain. 
The penalties for disregarding the law are pecuniary. The fine is 50 
centimes (10 cents) a month for each child for absence for the first 
three months of the scholastic year; after that it is increased to 3 
francs a month, and may be increased to 10 francs ($1.93). The school 
authorities are authorized to consider the reasons for noncompliance 
with the law, deciding whether they are sufficient or not. 
At the end of the scholastic year 1886-87 the supervising authorities 
reported that 8,178 communes in a total of 8,257 were meeting the 
legal conditions of school supply. But it does not, therefore, follow 
that the law requiring school attendance is observed in all the com- 
munes of the Kingdom but 79. In Italy, as in other countries, the 
enforcement of education depends upon certain well-known conditions: 
The reasonableness of the compulsory provisions ; the vigor of the central 
and local authorities; the economical condition of the people; the intel- 
lectual level, and the educational spirit of communities and individuals. 
Unfortunately, we have no adequate means of determining how gen- 
erally the law is complied with. 
According to the last census, taken in 1881, there were 3,440,000 
children of legal school age, 7 to 11, inclusive. The school registers for 
the scholastic year 1886-87 show that 2,279,090 children of those ages 
were enrolled in schools of elementary instruction. This is about 68 
per cent of the total number of school age, and .7.60 per cent of the
-P-A-G-E-393
  
    PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN ITALY. 345 
total population reported in 1881. The two dates involving the com- 
parison are six years apart; but, it must be remembered, that popula- 
tion in Italy increases slowly, as measured by American standards. 
The same year the youth of compulsory school age were 1,808,129 in 
number; that is, youth between the ages of 7 and 9, both inclusive. 
Some light is thrown upon the subject by certain statistics already 
given for another purpose. Of 2,279,090 pupils enrolled in elementary 
schools in the year 1886-87, only 169,709 were in the superior course. 
In other words, the vast majority of the pupils, as measured by their 
school standing, fell within the compulsory years. But while this 
fact helps out the ratio of the school attendance to the total number of 
children within the compulsory years, it still makes a bad Bho for 
elementary education as a whole. 
Competent judges tell us, what indeed we should antecedently expect, 
that in those communes where the conditions are most favorable the 
law is well executed, but that in communes where population is unsta- 
ble, the people poor, ignorance dense, or education but lightly esteemed, 
the-law is not very effective. Still more is this true in communities 
where two or more of these conditions exist. 
“J. W. M.,” writing in The Nation, gives a graphic account of life in 
the Sicilian eaphae mines, and particularly of the degradation of chil- 
dren. The following may be quoted: 
Attempts have been made by benevolent citizens not interested in mining gains to 
better their condition. Evening schools are opened, and it is wonderful how many 
tired, wretched children frequent them. Mutual aid societies, for pay during illness 
and for burial expenses, you find here and there, but these are poultices on cancer, 
and nothing more. Here we want missionaries—a Mazzini, a Lloyd Garrison, Mrs. 
Fry, Lucretia Mott, the Rochdale pioneers—to get hold of ‘the children—of their 
mothers; to stir up public opinion until, while the “sacred rights of property” are 
Peeoediod: the sacred rights of netics shall not be openly, flagrantly, brutally 
violated. Here, indeed, the young men who spout at clubs and twaddle in news- 
papers might find a grand field for labor; find an ‘‘ideal” which they complain is 
wanting to their generation. Communal, provincial, State authorities are called 
upon by these “reformers” to mend all; but they can do next to nothing until the 
mining populations combine to ‘will an altered state of things—not by partial, use- 
less, and lawless strikes, seeing they save not a farthing for the time when they are 
out of work, but by bringing their wants and wills, their sufferings and their 
wrongs, to bear on the absentee proprietors and the sweaters, etc. The time will 
come, is coming; but now one can only exclaim, with wrung heart and harrowed 
soul, ‘‘ How long, oh Italy! how long!” 
NORMAL SCHOOLS.! 
In 1887-88 there were in Italy 134 normal schools—36 for male and 
98 for female students. These schools may be classified both with 
respect to their support and management and their degree or rank. 
Divided in the first way, 82 are Government schools and 21 equal 
to Government schools (pareggiate). Of the latter,15 are provincial 
pohools,# communal, 1 endowed, and 1 private. ae 8 other normal 
1Jn 1891-92 there were 149 normal schools—36 inferior, 113 superior, or or 24 for men 
and 125 for women. Students numbered 18,029 (men, 2,135; women, 15,898).
-P-A-G-E-394
  | 346 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
schools are described as not equal to the Government schools (nonpareg- 
giate); 4 of these being supported by provinces, 2 by communes, and 9 
by endowments, while 16 are private. These nonequal schools arrange 
their own courses of study. 
The 134 schools are also divided as superior and inferior. The first 
class consists of 108 schools—28 for males and 80 for females; the second 
class of 26 schools—8 for males and 18 for females. The superior 
schools cover six years of instruction—three preparatory and three 
normal; the inferior, five years of instruction—three preparatory and 
two normal, The studies are the same in both courses, but differ in 
quantity and somewhat in distribution, the main difference being in 
the normal instruction proper.

practice work are found in connection with the normal schools. Can- 
didates for admission to the normal grades, if males, must be 16 years 
of age; if female, 15 years. They are subjected to a preliminary exam- 
ination, oral and written, in grammar, arithmetic, the catechism, and 
Bible history. They must also present certificates of moral character 
and physical health.

Fifty-eight of the 69 provinces contain one cr more normal schools 
each; 21 contain 2 or more, while 6 have 3. To the support of these 
schools the State, in 1889, contributed 1,813,000 lire, the provinces 
632,000, making a total of 2,445,000 lire. ($671,885).

It will be seen that the girls have increased much more rapidly than 
the boys. This fact has an important bearing upon the relative num- 
‘ber of the sexes employed as teachers, to which topic attention has been 
drawn in another place. 
The Government schools have also increased more rapidly than the 
non-Government. In 1871-72 there were 59 of the first to 56 of the 
second; in 1887-88 the ratio was 83 to 54. In 1882 there were 5,440 
pupils in the Government schools and 3,325 in the non-Government 
schools; in 1887 the ratio was 7,808 to 3,252. 
The qualifications of teachers, supposing the examination tests to 
have remained the same, have also been steadily improving. If, as 
is probable, the tests have become more severe, the improvement has 
been still more marked.

  Elaborate regulations for normal schools of gymnastics were issued 
in 1890. The programme of the school for men embraces the theory of 
gymnastics, the novitiate and school of command, practical gymnas- 
tics, military exercises, anatomy, physiology, and hygiene, the peda- 
gogy and history of gymnastics, drawing and choral singing. The 
programme for women includes the same subject matter, with the excep- 
tion of military exercises and drawing. 
SECONDARY CLASSICAL SCHOOLS. 
Gymnasiums and lyceums (ginnast and licei)—The full period of 
secondary classical instruction is eight years, five in the gymnasium 
(ginnasio) and three in the lyceum (liceo). The gymnasium is again 
divided into an inferior course of three years and a superior one of 
two years. Only boys are admitted to these schools, The gymnasium 
receives them from the elementary school, and they pass from the 
gymnasium to the lyceum. 
Some of the gymnasiums and lyceums belong to the Government and 
some do not, and those that do not are divided into the pareggiate and 
the nonpareggiate, or those that are equal and those that are not equal 
to the Government schools. The pareggiate are divided into the com- 
munal and the endowed; the nonpareggiate into the communal, the 
endowed, the episcopal, and the private. The following table shows 
the status of the gymnasiums and lyceums in respect to rank and 
maintenance in 1887. It should be premised, however, that the pro- 
vision of secondary schools and attendance upon them are wholly 
optional. The only compulsory education in Italy is that given in the 
inferior elementary course.

aIn 1890-91 there were 350 public gymnasiums with 36,482 pupils, 388 private gymnasiums with 
20,255 pupils. Lycoums, 143 public, pupils 10,360; 167 private, pupils 4,654. 
The large number of episcopal schools shows that the church has a 
vigorous hold of secondary education. There were enrolled in the 
various episcopal gymnasiums 14,056 students, in the lyceums 2,874, or 
16,930 in all. The ratio of outsiders to boarders in these schools is also 
quite significant—3,582 of the first class to 13,348 of the second. Almost 
any afternoon in the school season a passenger on the streets of Rome 
will see one or more groups of boys in uniform taking a constitutional, 
or rolling over the pavement in an omnibus, who belong to some church 
college, in charge of the person in ecclesiastical attire. The name 
“college” occupies a distinctly lower place in the Italian educational 
vocabulary than in our own. It is.applied, popularly at least, to boys’ 
and girls’ schools of elementary and secondary learning. The Collegio 
Romano or Roman College is a gymnasium and a lyceum combined under 
a common management. 
These schools are scattered over the Kingdom. Every province has 
at least one of each kind. Naples has the largest number of any 
province, 59 gymnasiums and 35 lyceums, but they are nearly all of the 
nonpareggiate class. Grosseto alone has a single school of each kind, 
but 10 other provinces have only a single lyceum each. The following 
table shows the distribution of the secondary classical schools by

All the schools are subject to the Government inspection. The 
courses of study in the Government and pareggiate schools are prepared 
by the superior council of instruction. The professors and teachers in 
the Government schools are appointed by the minister. The pupils are 
divided into two grand classes, boarders (convittori) and outsiders 
(esterni). The distinction is somewhat but not altogether like that 
between the interns and the externs of the monastic schools of the 
Middle Ages. The boarders are accommodated in establishments called 
convitti, in which elementary schools for fitting pupils for the classical 
schools aré also carried on.

The secondary schools, as a rule, are small. The gymnasium of 
average size contains but 68 pupils; the average lyceum but 42. The 
average number of instructors per gymnasium, counting all the classes, 
ranges from 5.10 to 7.07; per lyceum, from 3.70 to 7.04, It will be 
seen, therefore, that the teaching force is. relative to the number of 
students, very large. 
The salaries in the public secondary schools are fixed by law. The 
professors are divided into two classes, titular and regent. The former 
are appointed by the King on the recommendation of the minister, the 
latter by the minister. The titular professor is selected by competition 
from persons who hold the degree of university doctor in the seience 
or department of study for which they are competing, or he must hold 
other legal certificate. A previous examination is not necessary in the 
case of the regent if he bold a suitable normal diploma, but he can 
not be promoted to the higher grade without it. .

The mathematics taught in the superior gymnasium and the lyceum 
is rational arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and plane trigonometry. 
The philosophy taught in the lyceum is descriptive psychology, formal 
logic, and ethics. 
It will be seen that in the secondary classical schools 45 hours are 
assigned to the national language and literature, 43 to Latin, and 15 to 
Greek, making 101 to such studies; 21 to history, 11 to geography, 16 
to mathematics (dividing the six hours assigned to arithmetic and 
natural science equally), 6 to philosophy, and 19 to science. This 
makes 176 hours in all, not counting the optional studies, which make 
16 hours more. Religious instruction is not given in the public second- 
ary schools. 
The tables published by the Government do not give as full a view 
of the history of secondary classical instruction as we could desire. We 
know the number of Government schools and the attendance upon 
them year by year since 1862, but we have no similar information of the 
other secondary schools previous to 1880. From 1862 to 1879, inclusive, 
the Government gymnasiums increased from 93 to 109 and the lyceums 
from 67 to 83; in the same period the students attending these schools 
increased from 7,221 to 11,603, and from 3,005 to 5,775, respectively. 
Since 1879 the general movement is shown below. 
Number of gymnasiums and lyceums and the number of pupils in the same at different

  A more careful analysis would show that in this period the Govern- 
ment and pareggiate gymnasiums increased from 179 to 226, the episco- 
pal from 221 to 255, while the public nonpareggiate diminished from 146 
to 106, and the private from 148 to141. In the Government, pareggiate, 
and episcepal schools the pupils increased about 50 per cent. The Goy- 
 
-P-A-G-E-401
PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN ITALY, 353 
ernment and pareggiate lyceums increased from 105 to 131, the episcopal 
from 104 to 123, the private lyceums gained 5 and the public nonpareg- 
giate lost 8. The movement of students corresponded to the movement 
of schools. 
Upon the whole, the Government, the pareggiate, and the episcopal 
secondary classical schools appear to have attained a practical relative 
equilibrium. 
SECONDARY TECHNICAL SCHOOLS. 
Schools and institutes—Formerly there was small opportunity in 
Italy, as in other countries, for students to carry on studies outside of 
the traditionary lines, in which the main emphasis was placed on the 
Greek and Latin classics. But in response to the demands of the more 
modern spirit there has been developed a complete system of technical 
or scientific instruction, running parallel with the old secondary schools 
and with the university. This system consists of the superior technical 
institutes and of the secondary technical institutes. 
The secondary schools serve two main purposes—they prepare stu- 
dents for the more advanced instruction of the superior institutes, and 
they give others who are not able to pursue the higher instruction, or 
who do not wish to do so, a much-needed discipline, and a preparation 
for practical life that they could not secure in any other way; and in 
one point of view it is an encouraging fact that the second class is 
much the larger of the two. 
These institutions are of two kinds—the technical schools and the 
technical institutes. The organization of both is as old, at least, as the 
Casati law. The technical school is intended for boys from 11 to 14 
years of age; it sends some students to the secondary institute, but a 
larger number immediately to practical life. Candidates for admission 
are examined in the elements of arithmetic, in penmanship, and in the 
Italian language. The following table shows the studies taught, and 
the number of hours weekly in each study, on the basis of the class:

It will be seen that Class III is twice given. Students who pass for

those who pass for a license, the work in the next column. The first 
two years are common in both courses. The studies peculiar to the 
second course are chosen with especial reference to practical life. 
The technical institute presents five courses of study—physico- 
mathematical, land surveying, trade and computation, agriculture, and 
industry. For the first two years the studies in the five sections are the 
same; in the third and fourth years the different courses differ widely, 
although containing studies in common. 
The physico-mathematical section prepares pupils for the faculty of 
mathematics and science in the universities, for certain higher institu- 
tions of scientific instruction, and for the naval school at Genoa. Grad- 
uates from the other sections are fitted for the practical pursuits that 
their names suggest.

  The commissioned teachers in the institutes receive an annual sti- 
pend proportionate to the work that they actually perform. 
The professors titular in the Government schools and institutes are 
appointed by the King, on recommendation of the minister of public 
instruction ; the professors regent, by the minister. But there are no ~ 
competitive examinations to test the fitness of candidates as in the 
classical schools. 
In the technical schools and institutes we meet again the esterni and 
convittori, terms that were explained in dealing with classical instruc- 
tion. But the first are now relatively far more numerous than the 
second. In the schools the ratio is 26.025 to 2.911; in the institutes it 
is 5.397 to 2.91. Here, too, we find a class called auditori, persons who 
attend lectures but are not considered proper pupils. These hearers 
are not included in the above ratios.

Every province had at least one technical school, while Naples 
reported 35, In the compartments and provinces where but one sec- 
ondary technical institution of a kind is found, it is invariably a Gov- 
ernment institution. 
Naturally, secondary scientific instruction has grown more rapidly 
in recent years than secondary classical instruction. In 1863 there 
were 42 technical schools, with 2,200 students; in 1879 the correspond- 
ing numbers were 63 and 7,070. None but Government schools are 
reported for this period. In 1863 there were 32 institutes, with 1,789 
students; in 1879 the numbers were 68 and 7,613. Since the last- 
named year we have full reports. The more important facts are sum- 
marized in the following table:

The Government schools have continued to grow. In 1880 there were 
* 63, with 6,990 pupils; in 1888, 143, with 14,652 pupils. All the other 
schools have fallen off in numbers, or in pupils, or in both. More and 
more this important department of education is passing into the hands 
of the national Government. The church influence is here extremely 
small. 
THE UNIVERSITIES. 
It was on Italian soil that the first modern institutions of learning 
to bear the name of university appeared. Definite dates it is impos- 
sible to give. Nor, when we consider all the facts and circumstances 
attending their origin, could we expect to find it otherwise. The order 
of evolution was something like this: One or more teachers, alone or 
supported by a patron or patrons, attracted a group of scholars; other 
teachers came to the assistance of the first ones, followed by more 
scholars; rules were formulated to govern instructors and students in 
their scholastic relations; private individuals and Government lent 
their encouragement; the school, which at first depended wholly or 
mainly upon the teachers, acquired an independent momentum, status, 
and character; and, finally, the conferring of a charter by the Pope, 
or some other authority, gave it a distinct institutional organization 
and life. Ata later day this order was often reversed; many of the 
universities took their rise from a formal act of institution or founda- 
tion, but the early ones grew up and were not founded. Sometimes 
the University of Salerno, that came to an end in 1817, is said to have 
originated in 1150. The medical school that became the University of 
Salerno considerably antedated that time. The year 1200 is often
-P-A-G-E-407
  - PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN ITALY. 359 
assigned to Bologna. That famous seat of learning celebrated what 
she regards as her eighth centennial in 1888. Such dates as these are 
more or less arbitrary, standing, perhaps, for some formal act, as the 
conferring of a charter, or for sudden internal growth or expansion. 
There were numerous schools in medieval Italy that may be called 
candidates for university honors. Some perished, some that lived 
never reached that dignity, but of those that did reach it Salerno and 
Bologna were the first. 
Originally these institutions were rather special schools than schools 
of general learning. Salerno, which received a strong impulse from 
Arabian science, was long the most celebrated school of medicine in the 
world. Bologna, under Isnerius and the Glossatores, was equally 
famous for law.! The expansion of special schools into schools of gen- 
eral learning was due to one of the most important facts in the intel- 
lectual history of the modern world. 
It was in Italy that the Renaissance was born and also attained its 
fullest growth. There, in the times of Petrarch and Dante, men began 
to read once more the great masterpieces of Latin antiquity and to be 
molded by them. There, on the fall of Constantinople into the hands 
of the Turks in 1453, came the Greek scholars who fled to the West, 
greatly stimulating, if they did not actually introduce, the study of the 
Greek classics. While the Renaissance came after the universities, it 
still affected them profoundly in three respects: (1) It gave them a 
powerful stimulus; (2) it widened their field of teaching and made 
them in fact universities; (3) it determined, almost to our own times, 
the subject-matter of the first of their faculties, and, indeed, of all lib- 
eral education. The specializing tendency by no means disappeared. 
Salerno continued famous for medicine, Bologna for law, and Paris for 
theology, while also cultivating the whole circle of knowledge. The 
university organization made specialization easy; nothing more was 
necessary than to emphasize some one of the four faculties, viz, phi- 
losophy, jurisprudence, theology, or medicine. But the characteristic 
  
1Baedeker, speaking from the local standpoint, thus summarizes the history of 
Bologna: ‘‘ The university, said to have been originally founded in the fifth century, 
acquired a European reputation as a school of jurisprudence under Isnerius, who intro- 
duced the study of Roman law about 1088, and his successors, the Glossatores. Stu- 
dents streamed to it not only from all parts of Italy, but also from the countries of the 
North. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries their number was generally 3,000 to 
5,000, and in 1262 it is said to have increased to nearly 10,000. The study of med- 
icine and philosophy was introduced at a later period and a theological faculty 
established by Pope Innocent VI. The anatomy of the human frame was first taught 
here in the fourteenth century, and galvanism was discovered here by Joseph Gal- 
vani in 1789. It is a remarkable fact that the university of Bologna has numbered 
members of the fair sex among its professors. Thus in the fourteenth century 
Novella d’Andrea, a lady of great personal attractions, who is said to have been 
concealed by a curtain during her lectures; and at a subsequent period Laura Bassi 
(mathematics and physical science), Mme. Manzolina (anatomy), and more recently

work of the universities, as a whole, was liberal teaching; they were 
the homes of humanity. These three things Italy may therefore fairly 
claim as her own—the university, the Renaissance, and that union 
of the two which has so largely shaped modern education, and, more 
broadly, modern intellectual life. 
Itis not at all necessary to go into the organization and manage- 
ment of the Italian universities under the old régime; to do so would 
be out of place. It suffices to say that they had their several charters 
and statutes, their governing and teaching bodies, their endowments 
and revenues, and. that they experienced the vicissitudes incident to 
such institutions down to the final disappearance of the old political 
order of things and the unification of the Peninsula. Soon after that 
end was consummated in 1870 the State “took over the universities,” 
as it is called—that is, appropriated their property and assumed their 
management, or, in other words, the State nationalized the universi- 
ties, making them the crown and summit of the system of public 
  
    
  
             
  
  instruction that was now created for the Kingdom of Italy. The fol- 
lowing table will introduce us at once to their present organization, 
condition, and work:

There were also registered 310 auditors. 
Besides the Government universities, there are 4 free universities— 
Camerino, founded in 1727; Ferrara, 1391; Perugia, 1276; and Urbino, 
1564. These institutions had a total of 83 instructors of all grades and 
371 students—96 in jurisprudence, 16 in science, and 259 in medicine. 
Together they conferred 16 degrees and 60 diplomas. The free univer- 
sities are supported by municipalities or by their own funds, and as 
they do not contain philosophical faculties, they are universities only 
in name.
-P-A-G-E-409
  
  PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN ITALY. 361 
Mention should also be made of the university courses annexed to 3 
of the lyceums, founded in 1812-1817. These courses represent 21 in- 
structors and 70 students—15 in jurisprudence and 55 in medicine— 
and 25 diplomas. 
Of the 1,415 instructors in the 17 universities 509 were ordinary 
professors, 216 extraordinary professors, 155 were commissioned and 
supplied, 6 were teaching without any university grade, and 529 by 
private assignment as free docents. 
The ordinary professors are appointed by the King without limit of 
time; the extraordinary by the minister only for the course. Appoint- 
ments are made with reference to scholastic and professional standing; 
or the superior council may appoint a commission to conduct a com- 
petitive examination of candidates; or, again, the question as between 
competitors may be decided upon printed theses. 
The regular professor’s salary is 5,000 lire; but 10 per cent of this 
sum is added to it at the close of each period of six years of service. 
Formerly studies were distributed according to the traditionary uni- 
versity method, but modern conditions and needs have wrought some 
important changes. The theological faculties, which were recognized 
by the Casati law, have been dispensed with, leaving theological 
instruction to other agencies than the State. In the meantime instruc- 
tion has been materially strengthened on the modern side. Commonly 
we find four faculties—jurisprudence, mathematics and natural and 
physical science, letters and philosophy, and medicine and surgery. 
Sometimes, however, mathematics and science are separate faculties, 
Faculties are divided into groups, but not according to any uniform 
method. 
At the head of each university is a rector appointed by the King. 
He is assisted by an academical council, composed of the presidents 
of faculties and the heads of some principal schools or groups. The 
council of Naples consists of 12 men, including the rector; of Bologna, 
11. The central educational authority at Rome marks out the broad 
lines to be followed, but the usual university freedom is allowed to 
faculties and professors. 
The regular courses in the several faculties are four years, with the 
exception of medicine and surgery, where itis six years. In the schools 
of pharmacy it is four or five years, according as a diploma only or a 
degree is sought. The university year is nine and one-half months in 
length, beginning some time in November. It opens with a formal 
inauguration, the principal feature of which is an address delivered by 
a member of one of the faculties. 
The specializing tendency, or perhaps it would be better to say the 
emphasizing tendency, is quite pronounced. The University of Naples, 
for example, which is the largest of all the universities, emphasizes 
science and medicine. The stato del personale of Naples for the 
scholastic year 1890-91 was as follows:

ology and general histology, 4; meteorological observatory of Vesuvius and cabinet 
of terrestrial physics, 8; cabinet of geodesy, 2; cabinet of general chemistry and 
school of practice annexed to the cabinet, 7; cabinet of comparative anatomy, 5; 
cabinet of anthropology, 3; school of mathematics and drawing, 5; scuola di 
magistero in scienze, a director. 
The faculty of philosophy and letters: Professors, 20; honorary professors of the 
university, 7; free teachers, 21; scuola di magistero in lettere, 1 director; pedagog- 
ical museum, 2. In addition the library employed 23 persons. 
Other institutions distribute their faculties according to their special 
needs, thus widening the whole field of university instruction. Thus, 
we find special schools, museums, cabinets, clinics, ete., for veterinary 
medicine, archeology, gynecology, Mount Etna, procurators and nota- 
ries, applications of engineering, zoology, zootomy, anatomy of domestic 
vertebrate animals, zootechny, astronomical observatories, descriptive 
geometry, geography, mental diseases, partnerships, infinitesimal cal- 
culus, cryptogamic botany, numismatics, animal surgery, agriculture, 
economic administration, nose and larynx diseases. 
To many minds the most interesting statistics contained in the above 
table will be those showing the number of students in the different 
faculties. They will bear repetition: 
    Jurisprudence 
Science and mathematic: 
Letters and philosophy. 
Medicine and surgery -. 
No facts could show more demonstrably than these the direction in 
which the educational tide is setting in Italy. Not only was Italy the 
native home of the Renaissance, but no country has held more loyally 
to the classical tradition. As already remarked, until within a brief 
period, secondary instruction consisted mainly of the humanities; and 
yet, in the year 1887-88, but 624 students out of 15,193 found in the 
national universities were pursuing letters and philosophy.
-P-A-G-E-411
  
  PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN ITALY. 363 
In these statistics we recognize the play of familiar forces. The only 
eareer to which the third faculty directly leads is teaching. The gym- 
nasium and lyceum professors must have studied in this faculty. But 
the old chairs are full; new schools appear but infrequently; so that, 
practically, the only openings for new men are made by the death, 
resignation, or retirement of old ones. In 1887-88 the whole number 
of these teachers was 5,133. Apparently the attendance upon the 
philosophical faculties is quite sufficient to recruit the depleted ranks. 
The same year the 579 technical schools and institutes were taught 
by 4,277 professors. If we add the 1,360 teachers in the agricultural 
schools and the industrial and commercial schools, a very large number 
of whom, at least, must have received a scientific training, we have a 
total of 5,637. There still remain the professors of the universities and 
of the superior scientific institutions. Everything considered, itis fair 
to conelude that the present demands for teachers in the two kinds of 
schools are about equal. It is hard to say whether the two have yet 
reached a state of equilibrium, but the future appears to belong rather 
to the modern school. 
But teaching is by no means the only career to which scientific 
instruction leads, as witness the numerous openings to scientific men 
in civil, industrial, and commercial life. Considering these openings, it 
is not surprising that the disparity between the two numbers should 
be so great. 
An interesting comparison lies between the students in the secondary 
classical and the secondary scientific schools. They were, respectively, 
63,860 and 35,775 in number. The lyceum examined 5,259 and licensed 
3,210 students. The technical schools examined 4,450 and licensed 
3,248, Why should the ratio of classical students to scientific students 
be 63 to 35 in the secondary schools, while it is only 6 to 12 in the uni- 
versities? The answer is that university students in jurisprudence 
and medicine proper, as well as those in letters and philosophy, must 
receive a classical preparation; in other words, all students but those 
in science and mathematics. Were it not for this rule the classics 
would no doubt lose more ground in Italy than they have already lost. 
To be admitted as a student to any faculty, the candidate must have 
received a certificate of graduation from a secondary school leading up 
toit. He registers at the beginning of the year for the course that he 
intends to pursue, but he enjoys large liberty after registration. The 
maximum limit of study is thirty hours a week, and the minimum 
eighteen hours; in medicine the maximum is thirty-six hours. The 
royal universities are open to women on the same terms as to men, but 
the statistics of superior instruction do not show to what extent women 
avail themselves of their opportunities. 
It will be seen that diplomas and degrees are both named in the table. 
The doctor’s degree is given on compliance with all the conditions relat-

  The students examined for degrees were 2,006 in number. Of the

Still more light is thrown on the question of studies by the distribu- 
tion of the professors and other instructors. The list includes the free 
as well as the royal universities:

It has been stated that the Government appropriated the property of 
the 17 universities and assumed the sole responsibility of their manage- 
ment. While in general the incomes from the productive funds for- 
merly belonging to a university is a measure of the appropriations now 
made to it, it is by no means closely followed. A much larger sum 
is expended each year for higher education than the aggregate such 
funds produced. ‘The ordinary expenses of the 17 universities for the 
scholastic year 1888-89 were 7,963,837 lira; the extraordinary, 751,747; 
total, 8,715,584 lire, or $1,743,117, counting the lire at 20 cents. If the 
money were equally divided, which of course is not the case, the univer- 
sities would enjoy an average income of about $100,000. 
The statistics for a term of years show a healthy growth of interest 
in higher education. The students and auditors attending the univer- 
sities, royal and free, and the university courses annexed to lyceums 
stand thus for the four periods named:

THE SUPERIOR INSTITUTES. 
The institutions that bear this name, 11 in number, stand to the 
technical schools and institutes in a relation similar to that in which 
the universities stand to the gymnasium and lyceum. They are. of 
late origin and sprang, of course, from the recent growth of interest 
in scientific knowledge. Their names, together with the dates of their 
foundation, form an interesting chapter of educational history: 
Bologna: School of Application for Engineers, 1887. 
Florence: Institute of Superior Studies and of Perfecting, 1859. 
Milan: Academy of Sciences and Letters, 1859. 
Milan: Superior Technical Institute, 1859. 
Milan: Superior School of Veterinary Medicine, 1859. 
Naples: School of Application for Engineers, 1810. Reorganized in 1863. 
Naples: Superior School of Veterinary Medicine, 1856. 
Pisa: Superior Normal School, 1846. 
Rome: School of Application for Engineers, 1873. 
Turin: School of Application for Engineers, 1859. 
Turin: Superior School of Veterinary Medicine, 1796. Reorganized in 1860. 
  The names of these institutes directly suggest their character. They 
are all Government institutions. The central authority lays down gen- 
eral rules for their regulation, but the professors enjoy much the same 
liberty as the university professors. Together they had in 1887-88 
235 professors and instructors and 1,959 students and auditors. The 
students were distributed among the three faculties, as follows: 
Mathematics and science. 
Letters and philosophy -

                    THE SUPERIOR SPECIAL SCHOOLS. 
These schools are also 11 in number, and their names, with the dates 
of their foundation, are matters of interest: 
Bari: Superior School of Commerce, 1886. 
Florence: School of Social Science, 1875. 
Florence: Superior Institute of Work for Women,! 1882. 
Genoa: Superior School of Commerce, 1884. 
Genoa: Superior Naval School, 1870. 
Milan: Superior School of Agriculture, 1870. 
Portici: Superior School of Agriculture, 1872. 
Rome: Superior Institute of Work for Women,! 1882. 
Turin: Museum of Italian Industry, 1862. 
Vallombroso: Institute of Forestry, 1869. 
Venice: Superior School of Commerce, 1868. 
In 1887-88 these schools had a total of 147 professors and instructors 
and 789 students and auditors. These students were distributed in 
courses as follows: Preparatory and common, 145; literature, history,      
  
1These are normal schools of a high grade (vide report of the Commissioner of 
Education for 1890-91, Vol. I, p. 328).

geography, pedagogy, and mathematics, 179; agriculture and forestry, 
161; industrial chemistry, 15; industrial mechanics, 61; engineering, 
etc., 9; ornamentation, 21; various courses, 27. One hundred and 
seven students received diplomas. 
The growth of the superior special schools has not been very vigor- 
ous. In 1872 there were enrolled in them 509 students; in 1882, 397; 
in 1888, 789. The Museum of Italian Industry at Milan, which was 
long the foremost school of this class, reported but 81 students in 1888. 
MISCELLANEOUS SCHOOLS. 
The Italian system of public instruction has now been traced out in 
its main features. There remain, however, several groups of schools 
supplementary to the institutions of elementary, secondary, and supe- 
rior instruction that may be brought together under the general head 
of miscellaneous.

The instruction given in these institutes relates to marine construc- 
tion and mechanism, and to fitting commanders of vessels for their 
duties. 
Special schools and practical schools of agriculture—Of the 8 special 
schools of agriculture 5 are devoted to vine culture, 1 to olive culture 
and oil making, 1 to pomology and horticulture, and 1 to zootechny 
and cheese making. In 1889-90 these schools had 47 instructors and 
assistants, 232 students, and they issued 62 licenses. 
The practical schools of agriculture were 21 in number, with 63 
teachers and assistants and 566 students. They issued 109 licenses. 
In all there were 29 agricultural schools, with 160 teachers and 798 
students. The oldest of these schools was founded at Treviso in 1876, 
the last at Bergamo in 1887. 
Schools of mines.—These are 4 in number, 1 founded in 1862, 1 in 
1867, and 2 in 1871. Together they had 23 teachers and 53 pupils and 
issued 12 licenses.

  PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN ITALY. 369 
Schools belonging to this group are found in 54 of the 63 provinces. 
Academies and institutes of fine arts—The 14 schools and institutes 
of this description had 176 teachers, 376 pupils, and they issued 31 
diplomas. The oldest of them, the Institute of Fine Arts at Florence, 
was founded in 1350, the Academy of Carrara in 1769, the Academy of 
Milan in 1776, the Institute of Modena in 1786, and the Institute of 
Parma in 1756; the uthers fall within the present century. 
Musical institutes and conservatories.—The 6 institutions devoted to 
the cultivation of music contained 154 teachers and 826 pupils, and 
they issued 48 diplomas. The College of Music at Naples, the oldest 
of them, dates from 1806. Of the 826 pupils 511 were men and 315 
women. 
Annexed to the conservatories of Naples and Parma are normal 
schools of choral singing. The course of study is two years and 
embraces, besides the theory and practice of singing, elementary har- 
mony and practice on the keys of an instrument, anatomy, physiology, 
and hygiene, and their applications to singing. 
Military institutes and schools of marine.—In 1888 there were in 
Italy 12 military institutes, the 2 oldest of which, with one exception, 
those of Modena and Milan, were founded in 1859, The single excep- 
tion is the Military Academy of Turin, which dates from 1669. Several 
of these schools emphasize particular features of the art of war, as the 
use of artillery and military sanitation; 1 is a normal school of infan- 
try and another of cavalry. The 12 institutes and schools had 405 
instructors and 3,039 pupils, and 1,201 pupils were promoted at the end 
of their courses of study. 
The Naval Academy at Leghorn was founded in 1881; the School of 
Pupil Machinists at Venice in 1862. Together they had 75 instructors 
and 460 pupils. 
GOVERNMENT LIBRARIES. 
The 32 Government libraries in 1888 contained 1,019,498 books and 
manuscripts, the largest, the National Library at Naples, containing 
125,296; 2 others contained more than 100,000 each. In the year named, 
there were 766,153 readers, the largest number, 89,095, being at the 
National Library of Turin. The oldest of these libraries, which is 
also the smallest, dates from the end of the sixteenth century; 3 date 
from the seventeenth century; 7 from the eighteenth century; 2 fall 
within the present,century. The dates of the others are not given. 
TWENTY YEARS OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN ROME, 
Previous to 1870 such a thing as a system of public schools was 
wholly unknown to the Romans, and the very idea and name were 
strange. The Pope ruled the city and provinces, and his civil and polit- 
ical agents were ecclesiastics. Education, which was absolutely in the 
  
‘Tn 1891 this number had increased to 943,903.

hands of the priests, was small in quantity and poor in quality.. But on 
the incorporation of the papal territory into the Kingdom of Italy the 
system of public instruction that Italian statesmen and educators had 
been developing the ten preceding years was immediately introduced, 
and it has since been in operation, subject to such changes as naturally 
attend a new and imperfect system in a time of great educational 
activity. Although the difficulties to be overcome were great, the 
results attained the first year were anything but discouraging. They 
are summed up in the following table:

Such was the work done in the public schools of Rome in the scho- 
lastie year 1870-71. Since that first year great progress has been made 
along two lines of development: First, the variety of schools main- 
tained or the range of the instruction provided has been greatly 
increased; secondly, the number of schools of all kinds and the number 
of classes and pupils have increased also in a much greater ratio. If 
the reader will compare the tables following, compiled for the scholas- 
tic year 1889-90, with the one given above, he will see the progress 
that has been made along the two lines of movement:

The terms employed in this table haye been explained on previous 
pages. The suburban and rural schools’ lie outside the city walls. 
Particular attention may be drawn to the greatly inereased facilities 
for the education of girls. The last school on the list was established 
in 1888 or 1889, It takes the girl at the age of about 14, and carries 
her through a three years’ course of practical studies, including two 
modern languages, with a view of fitting her for a clerk or an account- 
ant in business life. The professional schools for girls are professional 
only in a domestic and industrial sense, They give instruction to girls 
and young ladies in literary and practical studies. In addition to read- 
ing, writing, composition, geography, arithmetic, literature, drawing, 
and French, dressmaking, shirt making, washing, ironing, cookery, the 
making of artificial flowers, embroidery of several kinds, knitting, and 
other domestic and artistic studies are taught. The studies are 
arranged in courses, and a certain liberty of choice is given to pupils. 
They are most interesting schools, full of promise for the future of a 
large number of Roman women. 
The record of the Roman schools is so interesting as to justify the 
introduction of another table, showing the number of schools, classes, 
pupils, etc., year by year:

From every point of view this is an instructive and encouraging 
table. The figures are just such as inspire confidence in an educational 
statistician, revealing, as they do, continuous normal growth. If some 
of the columns halt and even fall back a little toward the end we find a 
ready explanation in the severe financial embarrassments of the Roman 
and National Governments the last few years. It will be seen that the 
number of classes has increased more than fivefold, and the number 
of pupils fourfold. For a New England or Western city of 400,000 
people 624 classes and 26,149 pupils in elementary schools may not be 
a large showing, but for Rome it is a most gratifying one.

The cost of a system of schools at different terms is still another 
gauge of its growth. The cost of the Roman system at intervals of five 
years is as follows:

  Most of the public schools of Rome are found in buildings erected 
for other than school purposes. Many of these buildings are old and 
inconvenient. The same is true throughout the Kingdom to a greater 
or less degree. The reason is twofold: The confiscation of church 
property, such as convents and monasteries, swept into the possession 
of the State a multitude of buildings, the Kingdom over, that could be 
used for school purposes, while the insufficiency of revenue has pre- 
vented the erection of a suitable number of better structures. But many 
new buildings have been erected. Rome prides itself on its new school- 
houses. The school Queen Margherita, beyond the Tiber, for example, 
is an admirable schoolhouse, thoroughly modern in all its appoint- 
ments. It is well constructed, ventilated, warmed, and lighted, and 
the halls and cloakrooms are well arranged. The steps of the prin- 
cipal flights of stairs are of marble; the rooms are well furnished with 
maps and other illustrative appliances; there are gymnasiums for boys 
and girls, also wash rooms, and a bathroom for boys with a half dozen 
douche baths; the carpenter shop is well furnished with tools, models, 
and materials; a pretty garden is found in the rear of the building, 
and a picture of King Humbert hangs in every room. The building 
accommodates about 1,500 pupils and 30 or more teachers. The classes 
are of moderate size. The girls’ classes are taught by women, and 
some of the boys’ classes also. A director presides over the boys’ 
department, and a directress over the girls’ department. Provision is 
made for industrial training in both departments. The order and dis- 
eipline are excellent, and much attention is paid to instruction in 
patriotism, decorum, and politeness. The severest criticism that can 
be made on the building is that economy of space and money was not 
sufficiently consulted in its construction. The distribution of the 
pupils in this school is shown in the following table:

American and English residents in Rome say the public schools are 
good, and the limited observation of the writer confirms their judg- 
ment. The teachers give evidence of cultivation and of devotion to 
their duties. Their work is full of promise for the youth of the city.

  PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN ITALY. 373 
FINANCE—TEACHERS’ PENSIONS. 
The cost of public education.in Italy is divided between the State, 
the provinces, and the communes, the State and the communes bearing 
the principal burden. The rule is that the communes shall support the 
elementary schools, but the State frequently assists by granting subsi- 
dies, especially to the poorer communes. The law provides that the 
communes shall support the gymnasiums and the technical schools, but 
in many cases the State bears a great part of the cost. In normal 
schools and lyceums the State pays the professors’ salaries and for 
scientific material. The local authorities defray the remainder of the 
expense. The State also undertakes to pay one-half the salaries of the 
professors in the technical institutes. In some cases provinces defray 
the cost of scientific material used in the universities, but the burden 
of their support falls directly upon the State, which has assumed the 
management of the university property, as explained more fully in 
another place. The higher special schools are supported by the joint 
contributions of the State, the provinces, and the communes, with occa- 
sional assistance from local chambers of commerce. 
To be more definite, the contributions from the State comprehend 
subsidies for primary instruction, for the construction and repair of 
schoolhouses, for the expense of teachers’ salaries, for the pension 
fund of elementary teachers, and for the orphans of certain teachers. 
The contributions of the provinces embrace subsidies to the communes 
for elementary instruction and for teachers’ salaries. The contribu- 
tions of the communes include salaries of teachers and janitors of 
elementary schools, the cost of obligatory gymnastics, the supply and 
maintenance of school buildings, subsidies for the teachers’ pension 
fund, rent of school buildings, apparatus and furniture, the cost of the 
asili, the evening and the holiday schools, prizes, books and maps for 
poor children, and the expense of school festivals. The following 
table shows the amount of the contributions made by the State, the 
provinces, and the communes for elementary instruction, obligatory 
and optional, ordinary and extraordinary, at the different dates given:

  For the scholastic year 1888-89 the cost of the public normal schools 
was 2,445,000 lire, of which the State furnished 1,813,000 and the 
provinces 632,000 lire.

It will be seen that this statement does not include all the items of 
expenditure for public instruction. It does not embrace, for example, 
the cost of the central administration. Nor are the materials for an 
exhaustive statement at hand. It will answer the present purpose to 
say that the total is about 100,000,000 lire, or $20,000,000. This would 
be a small sum to expend for the education of 30,000,000 of people in 
the United States, but it is a large sum for Italy. 
» Instruction in the public elementary schools is free. In the second- 
ary schools taxes range from 5 lire for an admission examination, 10 
lire for annual registration, and 5 lire for a license examination, in 
gymnasiums and technical schools, to 45, 60, and 75 lire for the same 
purposes in lyceums. The fees charged by the universities for matricu- 
lation, registration, examination, and diploma differ in different facul- 
ties and special courses. In jurisprudence, medicine and surgery, 
mathematics and its applications to engineering, they amount to 860 
lire; in physical and natural science and mathematics, chemistry and 
pharmacy, and philosophy and letters, to 450 lire; in the courses for - 
notaries and procurators, to 200 lire; in veterinary medicine and agri- 
culture, to 168 lire; in obstetrics, to 89 lire, and phlebotomy to 57 lire. 
  
1Signor Bodio, director of the royal statistical bureau of Italy, states that the 
total annual expenditures for education by the Government and local authorities 
may be reckoned as amounting to 122,948,809 lire, or $23,729,200., (Report of the 
Commissioner of Education, 1890-91.)

PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN ITALY. 375 
Teachers’ pensions.—Formerly teachers did not share in the provision 
that the laws made for pensioning public servants, owing to the fact 
that they were regarded as employees of the communes or municipali- 
ties and not of the State. This omission being generally thought an 
injustice, Parliament in the year 1878 created a special system for the 
benefit of teachers of asili and elementary schools. This system, 
known as monte della pensione, is supported with funds derived from 
the following sources: (1) Gifts and legacies by private persons; (2) 
contributions by the State and provinces; (3) yearly contributions by 
the towns or municipalities; (4) percentages of teachers’ salaries that 
are held in reserve. 
Teachers who have served twenty-five years are entitled to the bene- 
fits of the fund, the amounts that they receive varying with their ages. 
Monte della pensione is a young institution, and as yet there are no 
results of value to be reported. All professors of gymnasiums, lyce- 
ums, universities, and other Government schools are entitled to receive 
pensions according to their years of service and their respective ages. 
THE WARFARE UPON IGNORANCE. 
In stating the pressing need of a mental and moral regeneration of 
the Italian Nation at the founding of the Kingdom, statistics were 
presented that show the appalling illiteracy of the people at that time. 
In tracing out the development of the system of public instruction that 
may be said to have originated with the Casati law of 1859, numerous 
occasions have arisen to speak of the educational progress since made 
in various directions. At the close of this review it is necessary to 
sum up the results of the whole effort that has been put forth to raise 
the standard of national education. As before we must resort to the 
statistics of illiteracy.

Unfortunately, no census has been taken since 1881, but there is an 
abundance of proof that had the census been taken in 1891, as it would 
have been but for the financial embarrassments of the Kingdom, the 
former rate of diminution would have been shown. Witness the two 
following tables:

That is, the percentage of persons contracting marriage unable to 
write fell from 69.47 per cent in 1866 to 50.83 per cent in 1889, and the 
number of illiterate military conscripts from 64.01 per cent in 1866 to 
42.04 per cent in 1889.

That is, in Calabria, for example, only 1,374 men in every 10,000, and 
only 936 in every 10,000 entering into the marriage relation in 1889, 
could write their names. Still, this table, compared with the corre- 
sponding one on an earlier page, shows commendable progress. 
Dividing the Kingdom into four divisions, the per cents of illiterate 
persons in 1881 were as follows:

An inquiry into the cost of public instruction for the whole period 
covered by this review would lead us to the same general conclusion. 
Unfortunately, the materials are not at hand for making as complete a 
showing as could be desired. The present view must be limited to the 
elementary schools since 1873.

  Italy is still in a very backward condition compared with well-edu- 
eated countries. The statistics brought together in the following table 
do not all relate to the same year, but they are the last at hand relat- 
ing to the several subjects; moreover the dates are so near together, 
and the statistics are of such a nature, that the discrepancies in no way 
affect the value of the comparison :

378 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
This is not all; the average level of the educated class is low. The 
State provides but five years of elementary instruction, and only three 
of these are compulsory, while the best-educated States, like Saxony 
and Prussia, provide eight years, and all are compulsory. 
Such facts as these, valuable as they are for the purposes of the com- 
parative statistician and as a lesson for Italian statesmen and educa- 
tors, do not answer the question that is most important in this inquiry. 
That question is not how Italy compares with other countries to-day, 
but how she compares with herself in former times. It is not a ques- 
tion of status, but of movement. Taking into account all the facts— 
the political, social, and economical condition of Italy in 1859, and par- 
ticularly its educational condition; the establishment of the new King- 
dom, and the embarrassing questions that it has been compelled to 
confront—it must be admitted on all hands that good progress, if not, 
indeed, extraordinary progress, has been made in the work of educating 
thenation. It may well be doubted whether in any other country the 
number of illiterate persons contracting marriage was ever reduced 
18.64 per cent, or the number of illiterate men drawn for the army 22 
per cent, in twenty-three years’ time. 
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION. 
It is believed that the numerous facts brought together in this mon- 
ograph have been so stated as to suggest the main conclusions to which 
they lead. However, it will be well at the close to make a formal state- 
ment of the more important of these general ideas. 
(1) The first of these ideas is that the new political Italy was ac- 
companied by a new educational It®ly. The men who created the 
Kingdom understood thoroughly that the better education of the nation 
was essential to its greatness and even to its perpetuity. This is but 
one of many instances in modern history of important educational 
movements following hard upon great political crises. Parallels may 
be found in Prussia, where the foundations of the educational system 
that is so closely connected with her recent greatness were laid in the 
disasters of 1806; in the United States, where the civil war and the 
emancipation of the slaves greatly stimulated the extension and 
improvement of schools and education; in England, where the spread 
of democratic opinions and ‘the repeated enlargements of suffrage 
have led to remarkable educational developments; in France, where 
an extraordinary expansion of educational activity followed the great 
reverses that the nation underwent in 1870-71. In fact, we have 
become so accustomed to this sequence that the work of Mazzini, 
Cavour, Garibaldi, and Victor Emmanuel would have seemed incom- 
plete had the unification of Italy not been attended or followed by an 
educational renaissance. 
(2) The system of education that has been built up in Italy is a 
thoroughly national system. It is national, first, because it was born
-P-A-G-E-427
  PUBLIC -INSTRUCTION IN ITALY. 379 
of the national spirit; secondly, because it is coextensive with the 
national territory; and thirdly, because it provides for all classes of 
society, from the lowest to the highest. 
(3) This system is distinctly modern in allits aspects. Here the first 
fact to be noticed is that it is a state or secular system, as opposed to 
one that is religious or ecclesiastical. The Italian school is the civil 
school, in its origin, in its support and management, and in its aims 
and spirit. 
(4) That the system is modern in its aims and spirit appears in the 
fact that it seeks to prepare the youth of the country for modern life. 
Attention may be particularly drawn to its completeness and univer- 
sality; elementary instruction, ancient letters, modern letters, science 
in its numerous divisions, philosophy, mathematics, art in its various 
branches, the learned professions, and industrial and practical subjects 
are all carefully provided for. This completeness and symmetry, so 
characteristic of the so-called Latin nations, contrasts strongly with 
the empirical and one-sided educational development that has been 
going on at the same time in England. 
(5) Still closer attention may be drawn to the emphasis that is laid 
on scientific instruction, and in fact on the so-called modern studies 
generally. This emphasis is seen even more strikingly in the universi- 
ties than in the higher institutes and special schools of science. It is 
the more noteworthy because it declares itself in the land of the Renais- 
sance, where also the classical tradition was always strong. Still it 
must not be forgotten that a thorough classical training in the gymna- 
sium and lyceum is required of students entering the university for 
degrees in jurisprudence and medicine and surgery. 
(6) While the former work in the fields of secondary and higher 
education has been continued and extended, the great endeavor has 
been to educate the common people. Much space has been given to 
this topic in the preceding pages, and it is not necessary to recapitu- 
late or even to summarize the facts in this place. This is the most 
interesting and important aspect of the whole subject. 
(7) The functions of the teacher are duly recognized. Witness the 
great number of normal schools and the legal provisions in relation to 
the qualification of teachers. 
(8) Considering the Italian system of instruction as a movement ~ 
directed to the reduction of the appalling ignorance of the country, we 
must say that it has been marked by intelligence and energy, and that 
it has been attended by very gratifying and reassuring results. If Italy 
shall go on for the next generation as she has gone on for the last 
one, she may plead good reason for being considered a well-educated 
country. 
(9) Finally, the Italian system of public instruction is marked by the 
salient features of all public administration in the Latin countries—per- 
haps some would say continental countries. It may be said of Italy, 
 
-P-A-G-E-428
380 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
as it has been said of France, that ‘“‘she has been strongly impregnated 
with the Roman civilization, and derives from the Latin genius an exag- 
gerated respect for abstract logic, an excessive love of simple principles, 
and a dangerous passion for uniform solutions.” No doubt this respect 
for abstract logic, this love of simple principles, and this passion for 
uniform solutions have had something to do with the completeness and 
symmetry that have already been remarked upon. Taken together, 
they also constitute the main cause of that strong centralization which 
is such a pronounced type of the Italian system, as compared with 
that of England, and still more'as compared with the systems of the 
United States. However, the practical issue of centralization versus 
decentralization is never a question of abstract logic. Because in the 
United States it is wise, and even necessary, to commit large educa- 
tional functions to the local authorities and to the people, it does not 
follow that it would be necessary or wise to do so in France or Italy. 
In those countries the local authorities and the people have never been 
accustomed to exercising such powers, and so are not prepared to exer- 
cise them. Even in our best-educated States the legislatures do not 
leave such matters as the studies to be taught in the elementary schools, 
the lengthof the school year, and compulsory attendance to local option. 
Still less could this be safely done in Italy. Hence the centralization 
of the system is not only thoroughly Italian, but it is also strictly neces- 
sary. There is a double reason, therefore, why the programmes of 
instruction in the primary and secondary schools should emanate from 
the central authority, and also why the ultimate supervisorial power 
should be held by the same hands. Had the Parliament left the com- 
munes or provinces to move in the matter of popular education at their 
own time and in their own way, many of them would not have moved 
to this day, while still others would have moved but slowly and ineffi- 
ciently. The only way in which popular education can be secured in 
large parts of the Kingdom, as in southern Italy, is for the national 
Government to set up and then enforce the standards. However, this 
is not peculiar to Italy; general education has commonly come from 
above, rarely from below. The instances are very few in which it can 
be said that the masses have educated themselves.

ters and to discuss the budget and expenditures; (2) the Ruling Senate, established

in 1711, with functions of a deliberative and executive character; (3) the Holy 
Synod, established in 1721, which superintends the religious affairs of the Empire; 
(4) and the committee of ministers, eleven in number, who superintend affairs in 
their own special departments of the public service. 
The Empire is divided into general governments (or vice-royalties), governments, 
and districts. In European Russia there are 68 governments and 635 districts; in 
Asiatic Russia, 4 general governments (Caucasus, Turkestan, the Steppes, the Amur), 
with 16 governments, 13 territories, and 3 districts. A governor-general, represent- 
ing the Czar and controlling both military and civil offices, is at the head of each 
general government; a civil governor and a council of control (a military governor 
in frontier provinces) aid in the administration of local affairs; the mir,! a village 
community system, prevails in European Russia and in some parts of Siberia; the 
voloste, or cantons (a union of village communities), have their affairs presided over 
by an elder, elected at the cantonal assembly, which is composed of the delegates of 
the village community in proportion of one member to ten houscholds. 
The zemstvos,? governmental and district assemblies (composed of representatives 
elected by peasants, householders in towns, and landed proprietors), administer the 
economical affairs of government and district to some extent and supplement the 
acts of the ruralcommunity. Cities and towns have municipal*® organizations with 
similar power. 
STATISTICAL DATA. 
Viewed from the scholastic side, the Czar’s dominions are divided 
into 14 educational districts, namely, St. Petersburg, Moscow, Kazan, 
Orenburg, Kharkoff, Odessa, Kieff, Vilna, Warsaw, Dorpat, Caucasus, 
Turkestan, West Siberia, and East Siberia. Each of these districts 
or circuits has a curator in charge, whose jurisdiction extends over all 
branches of instruction; the centralization of control at St. Petersburg 
is portrayed on page 391. The statistics relative to education in Russia 
are difficult to obtain, the educational authorities of the districts of 
Caucasus, Turkestan,’ and the Grand Duchy of Finland® being the 
1The affairs of the mir are discussed and regulated in general assembly of all the 
heads of families. Each mir elects its own elder as executive to carry out its deci- 
sions. European Russia has 107,493 of these communities. 
2During the years 1883-1894 the zemstvos existed in 361 of the 635 districts of 
European Russia. 
3A law of 1894 reduced the power of the municipal government and placed it 
almost entirely under the governors nominated by the Czar. 
4In Caucasus, in 1892-93, according to the report of the school administration, there 
were 19 lyceums, gymnasia, and realschulen, 5 normal schools, 16 lyceums and gym- 
nasia for girls, with a tetal of 11,338 pupils (6,737 boys, 4,601 girls) ; 36 town schools, 
7,052 pupils; 7 professional and 3 naval schools, with 740 pupils; 5 schools for moun- 
taineers (595 boys); 89 private schools, with 2,828 boys and 979 girls; 914 elementary 
schools (46,889 boys, 12,869 girls); 147 Armenian schools; 434 various schools; 1,866 
Mussulman and Jewish schools. 
®Turkestan had, in 1893 (exclusive of Mussulman schools), 2 gymnasia (1 boys’ and 
1 girls’), 1 teachers’ seminary, and 87 various schools (11 for girls and 38 mixed), 
having a total of 258 teachers and 4,124 pupils (1,361 girls); 260 children were taught 
trades. There were besides evening classes for the natives (400 pupils), and village 
schools were opened in 54 Russian villages out of 79. Some schools in towns are for 
Russians and natives alike.

only ones who have published detailed information since 1887. Dor- 
pat—now called Zurier or Jurjew—an advanced educational center, 
does not present educational information outside of its university work. 
More than this, the data which reach the general public of other nation- 
alities, through French, German, and English sources, present the vari- 
ous grades of instruction for different years, and hence it seems 
necessary to formulate estimates. According to statements made in 
the last decade by the minister of public instruction, the school system 
comprises elementary or people’s schools (narodnoe-uchilis-ché), second- 
ary, higher, and special schools. As the tabulated elementary statistics 
are for 1887 and those for secondary and higher institutions are in part 
for 1890, 1891, and 1893, an estimate is made, based upon a population 
of 97,500,000, as an average for these years, and with estimates of pupils 
of the different grades. Thus one finds in schools below the univer- 
sities 2,457,921 students, or 2.5 per cent; in elementary schools, 2,243,566, 
or 90 per cent of the whole number enrolled ; in secondary schools, 214,355 
students, or 8 per cent. The universities have 13,870 students, an 
increase of 3,510 since 1884; in special schools are 4,627 pupils. Tak- 
ing the whole population of the Empire, or 118,014,187, then the ratio 
of enrollment in elementary schools is 1.90 to the entire population, 
while only 20 per cent of the recruits are able to read and write. The 
ratio of children in and out of school in 1875 and in 1888 are thus 
approximated in the Rouski calendar and other semiofficial documents: 
1875.

00.0 | 100.0 | 100.0 | 100.0 | 100.0 
  Presenting the elementary schools under their various subdivisions 
there are the parish schools, one of which is supposed to be established 
in each parish, and the district | schools (uyezdnoe-uchilis ché), one for 
each administrative district, and the city or town schools, with one 
school to every 1,000” inhabitants. Then there are the schools con- 
trolled by and reported upon by the Holy Synod, which formulates its 
own programmes and charges tuition fees to pupils who are not of the 
Orthodox-Catholic faith. These and a few other groups were reported 
as follows by the minister of education (or of popular enlightenment) 
in 1887: 
1These are higher grade elementary schools which are gradually being transformed 
into urban schools; that is, graded schools. 
2To 1,000 inhabitants there are about 50 children between 8 and 10 years of age.

aClassed under elementary schools are Sunday schools for adults, and in outlaying sections there 
are ambulatory schools, the teachers of which after a few weeks’ instruction moye to other places. 
In the lower clementary grades girls and boys are often educated together, but girls of a higher class 
of society receive their earliest education at home. Lower grade technical schools rank with the 
elementary grades. Tho State elementary schools are open to all classes—ranking first in point of 
attendance are the schools in charge of the zemstvos, next those in charge of the communes, then 
those directly under the control of the ministry. Figures for Dorpat (Jurjew) educational district 
wanting. 
} This office has no means of ascertaining the reason for the discrepancy between the sum of the 
several items and the totals printed beneath them. 
In European Russia there is one elementary school for every 2,500 
inhabitants; in Siberia one for every 3,345 inhabitants (1,446 schools 
and 49,118 pupils). 
The elementary schools of the Empire are maintained by the State, 
which accords to village schools about 14 per cent of the amount of its 
‘school expenditures by the zemstvos, which give 17 per cent for 
education of the aggregate expenses of the zemstvos (amounting to 
$2,648,347! for education in 1887) and by the communes or mirs. 
According to an annual statement of the financial budget, revised by 
the “Central Administration” and presented in the Statesman’s Year 
Book for 1895, the schools of the Holy Synod in 1892 received $613,252! 
from the imperial budget, while the synod itself contributed $2,412,073.! 
But these amounts doubtless include what is- intended for both the 
secondary and elementary grades under the control of the synod, their 
numbers not being specifically stated. Assuming, however, that the 
$613,252 was only intended for elementary pupils, it would give $1.17 
per capita of enrollment as the State contribution for synod schools. 
The total amount contributed for elementary education by the differ- 
ent ministries? in 1894 was $2,543,475, but as the pupils in the various 
the nominal standard. 
It is well to state here that the greater proportion of educational institutions are 
controlled by the minister of public instruction and receive the State funds through 
that medium. But attached to the ministry of war are military schools, schools 
of civil engineering and artillery, cadet schools, and military gymnasia for the 
sons of officers, schools for engineers and subofticers, topographical and pyrotechnic
-P-A-G-E-437

schools connected with these ministries are not reported, nor the 
amount contributed by zemstvos or mirs, it is impossible to state the 
whole amount expended per capita of population or enrollment with 
any degree of accuracy. 
However, if one takes the enrollment in the elementary schools as 
presented in the table one finds $1.13 to be the per capita as given by 
the State. 
The secondary schools, including gymnasia, progymnasia, real 
schools (realnaya skhola), and institutes for girls are maintained by 
the State, which contributes 25 per cent of the aggregate expenditure, 
about 30 per cent of the remainder being made up by fees and the rest 
by grants from the zemstvos and municipalities. The universities are 
maintained in part by the State and in part through funds accruing 
from tuition fees, donations, etc. The amount contributed by the 
ministries in 1894 was $6,910,401 for secondary schools, or $32.19 per 
capita of enrollment, and $2,574,948 for universities. For the total 
number of pupils reported in all grades of instruction the per capita 
of population was 12 cents—that is, if the State contribution simply 
includes the amount given by the different ministries, $14,642,076, 
with the population 118,014,187 taken as a basis.

navy and public works. The ministry of the imperial household has charge of 
schools training for the dramatic profession.

  390 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94, 
The State maintains only 1 school for 9,078 inhabitants in the gov- 
ernments where there is no zemstvo, 1 for 46,555 inhabitants in the 
territorial subdivisions which have a zemstvo, and 1 for 163,116 
inhabitants in the Baltic provinces, so that it will be easily understood 
that the zemstvos are the principal source of maintenance for the public 
schools. The governments where there is no zemstvo furnish about 
69 per cent of the total funds for education. 
Serving to complete the school system are many special schools,! 
most of which are establishments of the State. Among them are poly- 
technic schools, forestry schools, institutions for the study of mining, 
bridge and road making, schools of veterinary surgery, the institute 
of oriental languages, lyceum of jurisprudence, naval and military 
schools of higher and lower grade. The centralization of authority 
over these schools is found at St. Petersburg. 
Among the special schools? the Polytechnicum, at Riga, reported 50 
professors in 1892-93 and 949 students. Studying rural economy were 
139; chemistry, 293; school of engineering, 83; school of mechanical 
engineers, 264; of architecture, 26; of commerce, 144. Seventy-five 
students obtained final diplomas. The expenditures for the polytech- 
nicum were $141,798. 
The Imperial Academy of Medicine (military), according to a late 
decision, only admits pupils to its second class who are provided with 
a diploma (first class) received at the State examinations in physies 
and chemistry. Of 278 candidates for admission in 1894 only 145 were 
suitably prepared. Two candidates having the requisite diploma 
entered the second class at once. This academy, located at St. Peters- 
burg, has 21 “ordinary” professors, 11 “extraordinary,” 67 private 
docents, and an extensive corps of other officials connected with it. 
Among its docents are specialists in anatomy, physiology, histology, 
and legal medicine. 
The Historico-Philological Institute, established at St. Petersburg, a 
sort of normal school to prepare teachers for secondary establishments, 
had 70 pupils in 1894, most of whom received stipends from the Gov- 
ernment. . In the last year of the course they have exercises in-practice 
teaching, and are expected to give instruction in the gymnasial classes 
connected with the institute. At the close of the year 1893-94, 6 
pupils obtained graduation diplomas, 2 for history and 4 for the clas- 
sics. All were provided with positions. 
LENGTH OF SCHOOL YEAR AND AGES OF PUPILS. 
The length of school year is not specified for the schools of elemen- 
tary grades, but a general statement is made by the authorities report- 
ing in regard to education in Russia that the common schools are never

closed except for the summer holidays, i.e., from May 25 to August 
20, on Sundays, and other public holidays. 
In the secondary schools, or gymnasia, the school term is from 
August 16 or thereabouts to the middle of June. The holidays include 
a fortnight at Christmastide, the same at Easter, sixteen church holi- 
days, and Sundays. 
The ages of pupils throughout the different grades of schools are not 
definitely stated in any of thy authoritative documents cited, but the 
city schools are, generally speaking, for pupils between 7 and 12 years 
of age. 
At 10 years boys are presumed to be prepared for the gymnasia, and 
at from 10 to 11 years of age girls enter the institutes. In the military 
schools instruction commences with the tenth year. The gymnasial 
student is supposed to be prepared for entrance into the university at 
18 years of age. 
GENERAL SUPERVISION OF SCHOOLS. 
As is stated by Jean Fleury,! lector in the University of St. Peters- 
burg, and by Gustave Lejeal,” the school system of Russia is essen- 
tially under control of the State. In each of the 14 educational circuits 
a curator has extended jurisdiction, and he reports in regard to all 
educational institutions of the circuit to the minister of public instruc- 
tion in St. Petersburg, and he in turn to the Czar. The minister, as 
the central authority, is aided by a scientific council whose duties 
include the adjustment of questions appertaining to elementary educa- 
tion. A special division in the ministry has charge of technical and 
industrial schools, and connected with the ministry is a board of exam- 
iners to investigate the qualifications of persons desiring to teach who 
may not be graduates from training schools. As aids to each curator 
are one or more governmental or district inspectors; then there are 
school councils to look more closely after local educational interests. 
In governments where there is no zemstvo the directors of the gym- 
nasia have general control of schools. The gymnasia and progymnasia 
are under the immediate jurisdiction of the curator, whether these 
establishments are for girls or for boys. In this grade of schools for 
girls the directress is appointed by the curator and confirmed by the 
minister. The gymnasia for girls have also administrative and peda- 
gogical councils,’ the latter composed of the director of the boys’ gym- 
1See Buisson: Dictionnaire de Pédagogie et d@’Instruction primaire. 
*See Revue Encyclopedique, décembre 1891: La Russie. 
8The council of administration is composed of persons of both sexes chosen by 
the corporations and societies supporting these schools; their duties are to choose a 
curatress and directress to examine as to requisite resources, to watch over the 
expenditures, to regulate employment of amounts allowed to the school, to limit 
tuition fees and indicate when there should be exemption therefrom, and to have 
general charge of the institution. The pedagogical council chooses the teachers, 
who are confirmed in their position by the curator of the district. 
   
-P-A-G-E-440
  392 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
nasia or real school and the directress and other officials of the girls’ 
school. City schools are under the direct control of an inspector, who 
is appointed by the governmental inspectors, by the zemstvos, or by 
the municipality, if either of these last-mentioned authorities maintains 
the schools. Private schools are subject to visits from the inspectors, 
local or governmental; parochial schools are, as heretofore stated, 
under control of the Holy Synod. The universities come under the 
jurisdiction of the curator and governmental inspector, the latter being 
vested with a part of the rights held by the rector to date of 1885. 
The Czar appoints the rector of the university, the minister of public 
instruction appoints the deans of the different faculties; a university 
council confers degrees, regulates programmes, distributes prizes, and 
reports upon any infringement of rules. Governmental boards of 
examiners—subdivided into the historico-philological,! the physico- 
mathematical, the legal, the oriental, and the medical, and whose 
chairmen are appointed by the minister of public instruction—decide 
as to the pedagogical status of the graduates; the preparation for 
academic degrees and the preparatory examinations from class to class 
are left, however, to the university authorities. Thus it will be observed 
that the greater proportion of educational institutions are under the 
direction of the minister of public instruction, which position has been 
filled for a number of years by Count Delianow. Yet there are, as 
heretofore stated, many schools attached to the other ministries, there 
being a complete system connected with the ministry of war. For 
more complete details reference is made to page 203 of the Report of 
the Commissioner of Education for 1890-91. 
TEACHERS. 
Preparation, appointment, salaries, and pensions.—The reports pub- 
lished by the ministry of public instruction in 1879-1884 indicate that 
persons who desire to become teachers (ouchiteli) in elementary grades 
are generally trained in pedagogical institutes, or in pedagogical semi- 
naries; in the former for the higher elementary grades, in the latter for 
the lower grades. The latest reports give 78 of these institutions, with 
5,586 students and 822 teachers giving instruction. The students of 
pedagogical institutes are generally recruited from graduates of elemen- 
tary grades who have acted as assistant teachers for one year and who 
are at least 16 years of age. The pedagogical seminaries admit per- 
sous from 18 to 22 years of age who are exempt from military service. 
The individuals who receive governmental stipends are pledged to 
serve at least four years as teachers of elementary grades. Persons 
desiring to teach in secondary schools find numerous private institu- 
tions open to them for such training. But the teachers of secondary 
aud higher institutions are usually recruited from those who have 
obtained degrees from the universities. There are training schools for   
1Die Reform der russischen Universitiiten nach dem Gesetz vom 23. August 1884. 
 
-P-A-G-E-441
EDUCATION IN RUSSIA. 393 
teachers of infant and maternal schools, and also pedagogical confer- 
ences which give opportunities for practical talks and discussions on 
educational subjects. 
A commission connected with the ministry of public instruction has 
charge of examining candidates of either sex who, without being grad- 
uates of a training school, desire to teach. Two kinds of diplomas are 
given, one entitling to the position of teacher in a public school, the 
other in a private school. Foreigners desiring to teach in Russia must 
pass an examination before this commission, no matter what diploma 
they may have from their own country. 
Appointments to elementary schools are authorized by the local 
inspector after the required examinations are passed, to the gymnasia 
and scientific schools by the curator, to the schools of the Holy Synod — 
by sanction of the bishop of the diocese. 
Salaries vary in rural districts, but according to a statement made 
by M. Dimitri Protopopof, secretary of the committee on primary 
education in St. Petersburg, the teacher of a rural school averages 
about 25 rubles (silver, $8.82; gold basis, $19.30) per winter. These 
rural schools are often located in peasants’ huts, where both lodging 
and food are given the teacher. Salaries for rural schools vary in the 
different governments. In the St. Petersburg government rural 
teachers average $78 annually, says Jean Fleury,! lector in the Uni- 
versity of St. Petersburg; in the Kieff government, $41 a year; in the 
Saratov and Samara governments the salary varies from $87 to $105; 
for all Russia the average is $67. According to statements made by 
M. Lejeal,? the teachers (ouchiteli) of urban and district—that is, 
graded—schools have free lodgings, and their salaries are between 
$386 and $482 a year. 
Pensions are allowed to all holding positions under State authority 
in accordance with fixed laws for a requisite term*® of service. In 
addition to pensions accorded by the State, the teachers in divers 
governments and large cities have banded together during the last few 
years for mutual‘ aid during term of service, during long illness, in 
case of accident, or for the benefit of widows and orphans of members 
of their profession. The plans of the different aid societies differ in 
some particulars, for in some the members aim to find places for 
teachers, or have established libraries and reading rooms for teachers 
or governesses, but the main object seems to be a general amelioration 
of the teacher’s position when ill or disabled. The pension funds 
created by the monthly or annual payments of members of these 
organizations are allotted as follows:

COURSES OF sTUDY.! 
Schools which rank below or with the elementary grades, such as 
maternal or infant schools, asylums, ete., aim first to train the powers 
of observation, to give the necessary elements of knowledge, and to 
ineulcate religious and moral ideas. The elementary schools of village 
or hamlet may have one, two, or three classes, in which are taught read- 
ing, writing, elements of. arithmetic, and singing. In cities, the higher 
grade elementary schools have six-year courses, completion of which 
entitles the pupil to enter the governmental service without additional 
examination, or a four years’ course leads to the gymnasia.. There are 
often technical divisions in these schools, so that trades may be learned. 
The district schools, now in process of transformation, include in their 
course of study religious instruction, addition, subtraction, multiplica- 
tion, and simple fractions, the elements of history, geography, and 
natural history. At the close of the third year the pupils aspiring to 
a certificate for elementary studies appear before the inspector for 
examination. Technical and industrial schools have courses parallel 
to those of secondary and elementary grades. The lower grades aim 
to train artisans for domestic and village industries. 
The schools of the Holy Synod give prominence to religious instruc- 
tion, reading, writing, and arithmetic coming next in point of order. 
In each important town or city there is to be one or’more gymnasia, 
which institutions, in their eight classes, aim to be a continuation of 
the higher elementary schools, and, subordinating other studies to the 
classics, to prepare for the universities. The progymnasia have courses 
similar to the gymnasia, but without the ancient languages. The real 
schools prepare for practical life, hence natural sciences and mathe- 
matics lead. The eight-year courses of study in the gymnasia for girls 
and three years in a progymnasia are, by regulation of May 24, 1870, 
rendered uniform with the gymnasia and progymnasia for boys. 
State institutes, with a six years’ course of study, admit daughters 
of the territorial nobility, and are presided over by widows of higher 
State officials, who are aided by inspectresses as directors of studies. 
The prerequisites of admission are reading, writing, arithmetic, French,

instruction in 1879-1884, from the articles by MM. Jean Fleury, lector of the Uni- 
versity of St. Petersburg, and Gustave Lejeal; also from the Encyclopaedie des 
Erzichungs- und Unterrichtswesen.

and German. Other establishments for girls, open to all irrespective 
of rank, are under the supervision of the minister of public instruction, 
and have classes parallel with the schools for boys. The passing of 
the graduation examination in gymnasia and institutes admits women 
to courses given by university professors and to special courses in 
medicine. 
The universities differ somewhat in methods in the different localities, 
and their courses of study were fully described on pages 221-226 of 
the Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1890-91, but it may 
be said that the passing of an examination before the commissior. of 
the faculty to which accredited entitles to a diploma of first or second 
grade. In the medical faculty the first-grade diploma, that of a physi- 
cian, gives the right to practice and to present one’s self for the doctor- 
ate degree. The conditions of admission of students to the University 
of St. Petersburg in 1892-93 are here presented (reported in the Revue 
Internationale de Enseignement). Students may be admitted if they 
haye followed the course of a gymnasia in the St. Petersburg educa- 
tional circuit and have obtained the graduation diploma, which is to be 
accompanied by a certificate of good habits from the gymnasial author- 
ities. Admission in special cases is granted to those outside of the 
university ‘“ circonscription,” providing they have the requisite gymna- 
sial diploma of their immediate vicinity, accompanied by a similar evi- 
dence of good character. The minister of public instruction adds to 
the above regulations, which emanate from the rector of the University 
of St. Petersburg, that Hebrews are to be admitted only in limited 
numbers, the proportion not to be over 3 to the 100 of the total number 
of students. The students must pay 25 rubles ($8.82) for entrance to 
the university, and for each course there are fees in accordance with 
university regulations. Request for admission must be sent to the 
rector between July 15 and August 10, in which request the faculty. 
and course must be indicated. Appended to the request must be the 
gymnasial certificate, dates of birth, baptism, and confirmation; the 
passport permitting the person to quit the commune where he is a 
resident; the certificate indicating accomplishment of military duties; 
three photographs of himself to be deposited with the authorities, as 
required; also a certificate of good moral character. Should any of 
these documents be in a foreign tongue, they must be translated into 
Russian by a competent translator. Fees must be paid in propria 
persona, and not forwarded by mail nor brought by another person. o    
EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
At the date of the first presentation of education in Russia no data 
were available regarding the defective classes, beyond the mere fact — 
that there were thirteen schools for the deaf and four for the blind. 
Since then a report, published by the authorities at St. Petersburg for 
the Columbian Exposition, has been received which gives the following 
information: 
   
-P-A-G-E-444
  396 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
The Imperial Society for the Education and Relief of the Blind 
opened its first school for the blind in St. Petersburg in 1881, and 
since that date 14 schools have been opened and 400 blind pupils 
educated. The Alexander-Marie School, with 100 pupils, has been 
developed into a model institute, and, since 1889, is located in a finely 
constructed building with all modern appliances. The provincial 
schools for the blind are situated at Kief, Reval, Kazan, Kostronia, 
Voronege, Chaskoff, Odessa, Moscow, Perm, and Smolensk. Trade- 
homes have also been established by the society, and publications con- 
taining useful information, translations, etc., have been placed within 
reach of the students. Preventive measures against blindness have 
been encouraged by the society, through the establishment of beds in 
the eye infirmaries in Charkoff, St. Petersburg, Moscow, and Novot- 
cherkask. An eye ambulance was started in 1891 at Taschkent 
(Asiatic Russia), and a second is to be established at Tiflis, the 
object being to transport poor persons suffering from diseases of the 
eye to the nearest infirmary. 
CURRENT MOVEMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS. 
Briefly stated such may be said to be the main features of the Rus- 
sian school system to date. For more explicit and detailed account, 
with an expansion in the line of school methods and management, 
courses of study, reform movements in universities, the trend of indus- 
trial and technical development, and the supplementary aids to educa- 
tion, reference is made to the presentation of the Russian school system 
in extenso, found on pages 195-262 of the Report of the Commissioner 
of Education for 1890-91. 
It may be well to add here, however, a brief summarization of the 
current movements and discussions along educational lines, as gleaned 
through the press and from new books which have appeared within the 
last eighteen months. The general trend of educational affairs is 
toward a modification of existing conditions. In the frontier districts 
the tendency is to more thoroughly Russianize the schools so that the 
youth growing up to be citizens may become more patriotic and a more 
thoroughly national feeling may be inculeated. 
Instruction in both horticulture and agriculture has been officiaily 
introduced in the primary schools; private individuals and the pro- 
vincial authorities freely giving grants of lands to schools and to 
teachers’ seminaries for fields and orchards. Many schools have plots 
of arable land and gardens cared for by the pupils, which schools 
become centers of education in these branches. 
The committees engaged in the discussion of educational questions 
generally consider that more attention should be given to the formation 
of a stronger religious and moral basis, and that such teachings should 
enter more fully into the course of study, for they concede that “a 
development of the intellect without religious and moral teachings 
does not tend toward the highest cultivation of the mind.”
-P-A-G-E-445
EDUCATION IN RUSSIA. 397 
A determined effort is being made to enforce compulsory education 
throughout the Empire, and the school officials of several of the goy- 
ernments have been called to St. Petersburg to discuss the probabilities 
of such enforcement in their own special divisions. In the govern- 
ments of Charkow, Poltawa, Kursk, and Woronesch it has been decided 
by the curators of school circuits to enforce obligatory attendance from 
the beginning of 1895-96. 
An effort is being made to carry out the suggestions of the congress 
for the study of technical and industrial education, so that village 
industries may be increased and the instruction of the people in the 
outlying governments of Russia may be better suited to the needs of 
the rural populations. The authorities and citizens naturally hope to 
advance the interests of the villagers and to still further develop man- 
ual training in the schools of the Empire. At present manual training! 
is taught in 4 teachers’ colleges, 15 seminaries for teachers, 6 civil gym- 
nasiums and schools, in 18 military colleges, in 11 temporary manual 
training courses for teachers, and in about 150 town schools and village 
elementary schools. According to the opinion of the Russian peda- 
gogue, manual training “must be taught in a thoroughly systematic 
manner; it must awaken the interest of the children for physical exer- 
cise; it must accustom the children to order, punctuality, and cleanli- 
ness; it must correspond to the physical and intellectual powers of 
children; it must develop the esthetic feeling; it must serve as a 
recreation for children when they are tired by their intellectual work.” 
In fact, manual training in Russia is “ considered to be more an object 
of general education than one of a special professional character,” and 
its course forms a series of successive lessons. 
The gradual transformation of “ middle schools” into complete gym- 
nasia, especially in the Baltic provinces, is still going on. The Russian 
Government proposes the founding of professorships of ‘folk music” 
in some of the Russian universities. In connection with the secondary 
schools the subject of the advisability of modifying the study of Latin 
and Greek on the school programmes is being discussed, as is also the 
aim and method of teaching modern languages in these grades. 
The conditions and requirements in the universities are being grad- 
ually modified, in consonance with the suggestions of the commissions 
which have discussed the subject since 1884. (See pp. 221-225 of the 
Report of the United States Commissioner of Education for 1890-91.) 
The main object seems to be to more thoroughly nationalize the univer- 
sities, to bring about a more practical line of work with fewer studies 
and less cramming for examination, and to require a higher grade 
examination for admission. As is stated in the Revue Internationale 
de ’Enseignement, instruction in the universities is gradually being 
limited to that given by professors of Russian nationality. In Dorpat

University a Russian inspector has been installed in place of the rector, 
liberty of study has been curtailed, and the student corporations have 
been gradually done away with during 1894. Restrictive decrees tend 
to more thoroughly Russianize this university, and, in accordance with 
the new methods adopted since the abolishing of the functions of 
a rector, the plans and forms which have heretofore governed the 
university, and which emanated from German sources, have gradually 
disappeared during the year 1894. 
In Poland the educational questions under discussion, as indicated 
in the Przeglad Pedagogiczny, include the best methods for inculeation 
of moral teachings; different methods of teaching geography, arith- 
metic, religion, domestic and agricultural economy, and also, the best 
plans to be used in the giving of historical instruction. Educational 
movements in other countries are also chronicled in this same peda- 
gogical review, as the editors seem to consider it desirable that the 
people haye cognizance of pedagogical questions in the United States, 
in Prussia, in Austria, and elsewhere. 
In the Caucasus, as indicated by late publications! from Tiflis, the 
questions under discussion, or requiring discussion, are those pertain- 
ing to the study of the Russian language and literature; how Latin 
should be taught in the first and second classes of the gymnasia; what 
is needed in schools connected with military institutions; needed 
improvements in the study of ancient and modern languages, geogra- 
phy, and mathematics in the schools of that subdivision of the Empire; 
the need of an organization of pedagogical institutes for the prepara- 
tion of teachers in gymnasia and real schools, with the object of bene- 
fiting the teacher mentally and physically. It is stated that each 
student should have opportunities for teaching in a practice school 
attached to the institution where studying, and that the diplomas of 
doctor and licentiate in pedagogy should be required of the graduates 
who desire to become teachers. What is most needed is a corps of 
teachers well versed in the science of education and not limited to 
special branches. The subjects of study in elementary schools and the 
length of school hours throughout the different grades are being dis- 
cussed. The individual development of pupils in educational estab- 
lishments, generally speaking, and in secondary schools in particular, 
is a question which receives due consideration. Physical training also 
becomes a subject for discussion, for as the physical condition affects 
the mental, so from the earliest age care of the body should be taken, 
but all methods of physical culture should be in accordance with the 
natural strength, so that no abnormal conditions be developed.

EDUCATION IN RUSSIA. 399 
The education of girls receives greater consideration by the authori- 
ties since it is understood that in some villages “there is only 1 girl to 
6 boys in school.”! One outcome of this decision was the opening of 
a new school, on Grand Duchess Xenia’s birthday, for the daughters of 
impoverished noblemen. This school accommodates 350 half orphans, 
has a regular course of study, and gives instruction in practical — 
industries. 
A commission is studying the subject of elementary education’ as 
carried on in other countries, with a view to the establishment of 
public elementary education throughout Russia. This commission or 
committee is connected with the Imperial Society for the Investigation 
of Economic Questions. According to the ‘‘ Notice sur les travaux et 
Je personnel du Comité de Vinstruction primaire pres la Société im- 
périale libre économique,” the members studying educational questions 
numbered 644 on January 1, 1894, and there were eight subcommittees. 
Fifty-three members took part in the committee meetings; seven 
formed the council. During the year there had been seventeen gen- 
eral assembly meetings and twenty-two sessions of the council. The 
work of the committees is indicated in part by their titles, i. e., (1) 
committee on publication of books for the people; (2) committee on 
editing asystematic résumé of school literature; (3) library committee; 
(4) ways and means committee; (5) committee on aid to pupils of rural 
schools in famine-stricken districts; (6) statistical committee inyesti- 
gating the conditions of instruction and need of enlightenment of the 
people; (7) committee charged with publication of the works of Kolt- 
zoft—a popular poet; (8) committee to obtain funds for the establish- 
ment of the A. N. Engelhardt school (to be named in honor of a 
professor of chemistry and a promoter of agricultural studies). 
Among the questions which came up for discussion were the advis- 
ability of the study of elementary agriculture in rural schools, and the 
foundation of statutes for societies for popularizing education. The 
committee on elementary education placed themselves in communi- 
cation with the zemstvos and offered to aid them in bringing about an 
improvement of educational conditions: (1) By suggesting the best text- 
books; (2) by suggesting the formation of school libraries. The result 
of the interchange of educational ideas brought a request for an appro- 
priation of 25,000 rubles to help establish 16U school libraries—at the 
rate of 250 each—in the zemstyos which were endeavoring to create 
such aids to learning. The discussions concerning the study of agri- 
culture in normal schools culminated in the decision that the people of 
rural districts did not need military gymnastics, sacred hymns, and the 
elements of agriculture, nearly as much as they needed to know how to

Reports bearing upon the status of education in the United States are under 
study by this committee. The intention is to ameliorate existing conditions, and, 
if possible, to establish a national system of education throughout Russia.

read, and to read in the most elevated diction. The committees decided 
that to teach the elements of agriculture and horticulture technically 
trained teachers are required, and while it would be an excellent matter 
to give such instruction, the people had other and greater needs at 
present, and, consequently, professional (that is, technical or industrial) 
education should be kept quite apart from elementary education. The 
committee for elementary education was the means of purchasing and 
distributing 48,992 books to schools; gifts of books to the committee, 
6,348; total distribution, 51,500 books to 446 places. 
The distribution extended over 59 provinces, and 86 per cent of the 
total came into the possession of the governments of Central Russia, 
where there are zemstvos—these local governments having schools 
which give general instruction to the pupils. The committee also 
acted as agent for the tormation and forwarding of small school 
libraries, in accordance with requests from societies, institutions. ete. 
The committee in charge of publication of books for the people engaged 
men well known in science and pedagogy in Russia to aid them, and 
“popular scientific works in all branches of science” are to be pub- 
lished this coming year, while 61 of the best examples of the literature 
of Russia and other countries have been analyzed within seven months 
and 27 chosen for publication. The committee having in preparation a 
résumé of school literature has already published eight parts contain- 
ing 1,650 entries, with a description of each subject, such as pedagogy, 
the national language, history, geography, medicine, and hygiene, gym- 
nasties, singing, drawing, and manual training. The library committee 
reported 7,915 books and 3,597 engravings at beginning of the year and 
1,823 additions during the year. This collection contains books on 
school legislation, official documents, and reports of ministers of edu- 
cation from Sweden, Norway, France, Germany, Roumania, Servia, 
and the United States, and forms the embryo of a valuable pedagogical 
library. : 
The committee in charge of the tenth anniversary celebration of 
schools, held on Sunday in the suburbs of the capital for the benefit 
of workmen employed in factories, etc., reported that 5,042 pupils had 
been under instruction—their ages varying from 15 to 40 years; even- 
ing classes, lectures, illustrated by magic lantern, and a library have 
added to the interest of the work. Seventy-two teachers give their 
time gratuitously. Methods are discussed at the general assembly of 
the teachers; at the close of the year reports are made to the inspector 
of the people’s schools of the district of St. Petersburg, who presides 
at the examinations. The special evening classes, opened in 1889, 
have instruction in catechism, Russian language, history, geography, 
arithmetic, geometry, physics, chemistry, mechanics, and drawing. 
The pupils. pay 50 kopecks a month. Most of the pupils come into 
these schools for two hours of study aud instruction after twelve 
hours of labor, and sometimes they decline the emoluments for extra 
hours so that they may attend these evening classes.

  EDUCATION IN RUSSIA. AOL- 
EDUCATIONAL AND CHARITABLE WORK. 
A short historical sketch of the Marie educational and charitable 
institutions, which are under the immediate patronage of their Majes- 
ties the Czar and Ozarina, was prepared for the Columbian Exposition 
at Chicago. The value and amount of work accomplished by these 
institutions since their earliest beginnings (under Catherine IT, 1762- 
1796), the present conditions (in 1892), and the completeness of detail, 
seem to render this sketch of value to the student, hence the main 
facts are presented: 
From the remotest time up to the accession of Peter the Great the social organi- 
zation of Russia was based on the patriarchal idea, and thus necessarily involved 
the strict exclusion of women from all participation and share in public life. 
So long as this state of things continued women were naturally denied all such 
instruction as, while developing their intelligence, would at the same time enable 
them to superintend and direct the first and most elementary education of their 
children. 
Education, even of the most limited kind, was regarded as a privilege to be zeal- 
ously reserved to men, and if from time to time we find a few rare exceptions in the 
ease of brilliantly endowed and widely instructed women, such exceptions were 
exclusively peculiar to monastic and conventual life. * * * 
With the accession to the throne of Catherine I, the worthy successor of Peter the 
Great, commences a new epoch in Russian social life. The sovereigns of the country 
now began to take a direct and special interest in the education of the women of 
Russia. 
Among the very few of her counselors who were disposed or able to aid her in 
this great work, the philanthropist Betski occupies the first and most prominent 
place. He understood that the education of women could only have a healthy 
influence on the social development and general welfare of the country. One of the. 
most highly cultured men of his age, he believed it possible to ‘create a new race 
of fathers and mothers.” It was with this object that he proposed the establish- 
ment of boarding schools in which girls of noble birth might be brought up and 
educated in strict isolation from the outer world. 
Accordingly, on the 5th of May, 1764, the Empress issued her royal order for the 
establishment of an educational home for girls of noble birth; and the buildings 
of the Convent of the Resurrection were by her express command made over to the 
new school. 
Scarcely a year had passed when, at her initiation, a branch establishment, 
designed for young girls of the middle class of society, Was opened in the same 
building. 
Parents, on making application for the admission of their children into one or the 
other of these institutions, were required to give in a written pledge to the authori- 
ties that, save in cases of dangerous illness or proved incapacity for school work, 
the children should not be withdrawn till they had completed the full and entire 
course of studies. 
The age at which pupils were admitted was fixed at 5 and 6 years, the whole 
course of studies extending over a period of twelve years. In each of the two 
schools there were four classes. The programme of studies for the first class 
included religion, the Russian and three foreign languages, arithmetic, music, draw- 
ing, dancing, sewing, and knitting; that for the second class further included his- 
tory, geography, and the elements of rural economy. Architecture and heraldry 
forme the additional subjects for the third class, while a course of reading in his- 
tory and literature served to familiarize the pupils with leading events in the social 
ED 9426 :

and intellectual progress of the world. The repetition of all that had been taught 
jn the lower divisions formed the principal item in the programme for the fourth 
class. We may add that in the Educational Home for Girls of Noble Birth particu- 
lar attention was paid to instruction in etiquette and the observance of the laws of 
polite society. 
The course of studies pursued in the school for girls of the middle class was, as 
we might expect, more limited in its extent, special attention being given to all 
kinds of needlework. The rules laid down for the fourth class required the girls to 
be well trained in household economy, and they were therefore exercised in all 
manual work necessary for the proper management of a home, and particularly in 
cooking, sewing, knitting, weaving, etc. 
The immediate administration of these two establishments was intrusted to a 
directress, assisted by an inspectress; besides whom, four persons were appointed to 
supervise the scholastic and domestic affairs of the institutions. The latter were 
chosen either from among the members of the Imperial Senate or from among those 
directly nominated by the Empress herself, and fulfilled the duties of their office 
gratuitously. Their functions were of a purely honorary character, and consisted in 
the due examination of the titles to nobility of all candidates who presented them- 
selves, and in the general administration and control of the establishments. 
But while thus busied with laying the foundation of a practical education for 
“future mothers,” the Empress did not neglect or forget those unfortunate children 
who from their very birth had been deprived of a mother’s love and care. It was for 
this purpose that the Empress, in accordance with a plan previously drawn up by 
Betski, opened in 1763 two large foundling hospitals, one at Moscow and the other 
at St. Petersburg. They were placed under the direct control of two tutelary coun- 
eils that were created especially for this purpose in either capital, Each council 
was originally composed of six members, who received the title of guardians and 
assistant guardians, but the number was subsequently reduced to four. According 
to a regulation, which, however, up to 1798, was not strictly followed, they were 
expected to fulfill their duties gratuitously. 
Imbued with a profound love for mankind, Betski placed these foundling hospitals 
on as firm and secure a basis as circumstances allowed him. Not possessing adequate 
funds to realize his plans, he before long succeeded in obtaining donations sufficient 
to cover the expenses of constructing the first and most necessary portions of the 
buildings. » 
In 1772 he organized auction and saving banks in St. Petersburg and Moscow, the 
revenues of which guaranteed to the foundling hospitals a permanent existence. As 
a further contribution to.their support, a tax was-laid on all tickets of admission to 
public places of amusement, and they were accorded an exclusive monopoly in the 
manufacture and sale of playing cards. At the same time numerous legacies were 
made in their favor by private persons, and subyentions were granted in their sup- 
port by the Empress and Csarevitch. 
Not long after Prince Demidoff contributed 205,009 rubles toward the establish- 
ment of a commercial school for a hundred boys belonging to the mercantile class. 
This school, founded in 1774 and annexed to the Moscow Foundling Hospital, was 
the last of the charitable institutions established by Catherine II. * * * 
On November 12, 1796, the Empress Marie Feodorovna! assumed the immediate 
direction of the Educational Home for Girls of Noble Birth and its branch school 
for girls of the middle class of society. 
1The Empress Marie. Feodorovna, daughter of the Duke of Wiirtemburg, was 
born at Stettin, October 5, 1759, was betrothed to the Grand Duke Paul, July 12, 
1776, and arrived at St. Petersburg August 31 of the same year. The marriage of 
their Imperial Highnesses was celebrated September 26, the Grand Duke Paul sue- 
ceeded to the throne November 6, 1796, and the coronation of the Emperor and 
y Empress took place at Moscow April 5, 1797.
-P-A-G-E-451
  EDUCATION IN RUSSIA. 403 
The assumption of this post on the part of the Empress was signalized by several 
munificent contributions to the support of these establishments. On the day fol- 
lowing her nomination she endowed the institutions with an annuity of 15,000 
rubles from her private purse; and this sum formed the nucleus of the so-called 
“casket capital,” which rapidly increased and during the life of its founder reached 
the total amount of 1,300,060 rubles. 
‘The Empress further effected several salutary teforms in the general plan of edu- 
cation hitherto adopted in theseschools. In the higher school the number of pupils 
was considerably increased, the age of admission was raised to 8 and 9 years, and 
the term of studies was reduced to nine years. At the same time foreign languages, 
music, and dancing were excluded from the programme of studies in the branch 
school, the entire course of instruction was limited to six years, and the age of 
admission was raised to 12 year: 
In May, 1797, with the Emperor's sanction, Her Majesty assumed the supreme direc- 
tion of the foundling hospitals, the saving banks, and the commercial school. * * * 
Certain defects in fhe organization of the tutelary councils required correction. 
In order to bring the activity of the different charitable institutions into full 
harmony, and to secure their due and proper control, the Empress proposed that the 
members of the councils should either individually undertake the management of 
one establishment, or share with one or more of their colleagues the genera] man- 
agement of all the establishments. With this object the tatelary councils were 
reconstructed, December 23, 1797, on a basis that but slightly differed from the plan 
already in existence. The members of the council, formerly called guardians and 
assistant guardians, now took the title of honorary guardians, and were to be 
chosen from among the nobility by the reigning sovereign. They were expected to 
serve gratuitously and to perform their duties from “a love for their country and 
humanity.” Their number remained the same as before, and, over and above their 
responsibility for the general administration, each one of them was also individually 
responsible for the superintendence of the particular section intrusted to his care. 
In the spring of 1798, when Senator Alexander Protasoff, one of the honorary 
- guardians, was appointed curator of the commercial school, the Empress proceeded 
to a thorough revision of its statutes. From a close and minute study of the past 
history of this school, Her Majesty perceived that it had in no way fulfilled the 
object with which it had originally been established. During the first twenty-five 
years of its existence not more than 12 of the pupils on leaving the school obtained 
places as accountants, the rest being engaged as ordinary copyists or junior clerks 
in the different chancelleries. With the view of restoring the school to its primary 
destination, the Empress had new regulations drawn up, and these received the 
Imperial sanction on May 10,1799. By virtue of these revised statutes, the number 
of Demidoff scholars, which was out of proportion with the interest from the capital 
invested, was restricted to 55, the age of admission was fixed at 8 and 9 years, and 
the course of studies was limited to nine in place of twelve years. 
In October, 1800, the school was removed from Moscow to St. Petersburg, since, to 
quote the words of the Empress in her circular addressed to the council, “the situ- 
ation of the capital and its two ports, those of St. Petersburg and Cronstadt, offers 
greater facilities to the practical study of commerce.” Four years later the Moscow 
merchants established a new commercial school on their own account. 
By her indefatigable activity, ameliorating and perfecting the organization of the 
then existing establishments, the Empress inaugurated a whole series of new edu- 
cational and benevolent institutions. Thus, in 1798 and in 1802, the number of 
educational institutions was increased by the establishment of the St. Petersburg 
and Moscow Catherine Institutes. In 1807 the Military Orphan Home, afterwards 
called the Paul Institute, was placed under her direct patronage and from that year 
received a government annnity of 3,000rubles. The Kharkof Institute was founded 
in 1817, and its statutes, which were drawn up in general conformity with the proj- 
ects of Betski, but were of wider extension, authorized the admission not only of 
     
-P-A-G-E-452
    404 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
girls of noble birth, but also of merchants’ daughters, as well as of paying and non- 
paying scholars. The superintendents of the institute were expected both to find 
places for those scholars who had successfully finished their course of studies, and 
to aid them, as far as possible, in any dispute that might arise between them and 
the families in which they served, and further, if necessary, to defend any appeal 
that they might be advised to make to the law tribunals. 
The leading features of these statutes, originally drawn up for a provincial insti- 
tute, but subsequently applied to the other schools, have been maintained with - 
slight modifications up to the present time. 
Nor did the Empress in her numerous works of philanthropy forget the daughters 
of her soldiers and sailors. In 1820 and in 1823 two schools were opened for the 
daughters of soldiers belonging to the guards, and in 1826 two more schools were 
founded for the daughters of sailors, one in Sebastopol and the other in Nicholaieff. 
In the year 1806 the Empress founded a school on her estate at Pavlovsk, in the 
neighborhood of St. Petersburg, a school for the deaf and dumb of both sexes, and 
this school, which four years later was removed to St. Petersburg, was the object of 
her special and untiring care throughout her life. A capital of 156,000 rubles was 
deposited in one of the savings banks to found a scholarship fund for pupils placed 
at the school in Her Majesty’s name. - 
In 1802 the Empress established a third foundling hospital, and took upon herself 
to defray all expenses necessary for its maintenance and support. 
But among the more important benevolent institutions founded by the Empress 
and still existing, we must not forget to mention the St. Petersburg and Moscow 
widow homes. These homes, or asylums, designed for the widows of soldiers and 
clerks in the civil service, were established by means of funds provided by the 
foundling hospitals, and at the same time the Empress contributed to each a sum of ~ 
1,500 rubles. Finally, in 1828, the Empress created a board of trustees for the 
administration of all institutions dependent on the commission of public charity, and 
these institutions were placed under her direct and immediate protection. At her 
death in 1828 all the institutions under her supervision were grouped under the 
general name of the Marie institutions. 
Immediately after the death of the Empress Marie Feodoroyna, an imperial mani- 
festo was issued, placing all the establishments formerly in care of the deceased 
under the charge and protection of His Majesty the Emperor. At the same time a 
secretary of state was appointed director of Her Majesty’s chancellery, which was to 
be called for the future the fourth section of the privy chancellery of His Majesty 
the Emperor. Moreover, most of the educational establishments formerly patron- 
ized by the late Empress were, conformably to her wishes, placed under the direct 
authority of the Empress Alexandra Feodoroyna. Nearly all these establishments 
were now located in the two capitals, and consequently the Emperor Nicholas con- 
sidered it necessary to establish schools, homes, and institutes for girls in the prov- 
inces; the more so, as the pecuniary resources at his disposal were amply sufficient 
to allow his scheme to be carried out. 
Between the years 1829 and 1845 institutes for girls of noble birth were opened in 
the cities of Odessa, Kazan, Kieff, Bielostock, Novo-Alexandrowsky (near Tiflis), 
Astrachan, Kertch, Tiflis, Nijni-Novgorod, Novotcherkask, Tamboff, Orenburg, Sara- 
toff, Poltava, and other towns in the interior of Russia, as well as in some of the 
more distant cities of the Empire. 
‘The number of Government schools for girls had thus increased so largely that in 
1845 it was deemed necessary to create a supreme council of the educational estab- 
lishments for young girls and which formed a special and distinct department of the 
ministry of public instruction. It was subsequently, in 1873, annexed to the tute- 
lary councils, but still continued to be presided over by Prince Peter Oldenburg, 
and was exclusively composed of state officials who were well known equally for 
their erudition and for their zeal in all matters concerning the promotion of educa- 
tion among the different classes of Russian society. 
   
-P-A-G-E-453
EDUCATION IN RUSSIA. 405 
But without doubt the most important of the many charitable works inaugurated 
by the Emperor Nicholas was the establishment of orphan homes. Owing to the 
cholera epidemic in the years 1830 and 1831, and the cruel ravages caused by the 
wars immediately preceding this terrible visitation, the number of orphans requir- 
ing immediate relief and help increased so rapidly that the existing institutions 
were quite unable to meet the demands made on them. 
Two of these orphan homes were established by the Emperor in 1834; they were 
attached to the foundling hospitals, and were designed to receive each 60 orphan 
children, 
At this time the programme of studies pursued in the schools attached to the 
foundling hospitals included Latin and French, and these languages were taught 
with the object of enabling the boys who had passed through the Latin classes to 
enter either the university or one of the military academies, while the girls who 
had gone through the French classes were, qualified to enter private families as 
governesses. In giving such an advanced education to their pupils, the foundling 
hospitals no longer corresponded with their primary destination, and the Emperor 
wisely decided to change these conditions. 
In 1837 the Latin and French classes were abolished, and in their place special 
schools were opened for the orphan children of soldiers and clerks in the civil serv- 
ice. The orphan home at the Moscow Foundling Hospital originally consisted of 
two divisions, one for 300 boys, and one for an equal number of girls; but in 1847 
the boys’ division was transformed into a cadet corps, and thus became excluded 
from the group of the Marie institutions. Moreover, the number of girls received 
into the home at St. Petersburg was raised to 700, and the Moscow home increased 
the number of its inmates to 800. At the same time a third home was opened at 
Gatchina, so that altogether no less than 2,000 orphan boys and girls were in this 
way provided for. 
In 1834 the Alexandra Orphan Asylum, intended for children of the middle class 
of society, was established. At first children of both sexes, to the number of 340, 
were admitted, but from 1840 the asylum was restricted to girls. Two years later 
it was placed under the direct administration of the Orphan Institute. In the 
same year the Imperial Alexander Lyceum was removed from Tsarkoe Selo to St. 
Petersburg and annexed to the Marie institutions. 
On January 4, 1854, after the death of M. Longinoff, secretary of state, the estab- 
lishments founded by the Empresses Elisabeth Alexeievna and Alexandra Feodo- 
rovna, the superintendence of which had been intrusted to him, were also included in 
the group of the Marie institutions. These consisted of the Patriotic Institute, the 
Poltaya and Tamboff institutes, the asylum for children, and the schools attached 
to the St. Petersburg Patriotic and Moscow Benevolent societies; in all, about 175 
institutions. In the last year of the reign of the Emperor Nicholas the number of 
these educational and charitable institutions amounted to 365. In the former 9,534 
boys and girls were being brought up and educated; in the hospitals 37,609 patients 
were receiving medical care and treatment, and no less than 60,898 young children 
and old people found help and relief in the foundling hospitals and asylums. 
All these establishments continued to be under the direct patronage of the Empress 
Alexandra Feodoroyna up to the day of her death, October 20, 1860, though the 
direction of the institutions had, after the death of her husband, been divided 
between herself and the Empress Marie Alexandrovna, who, on November 6, 1860, 
assumed all the rights attached to the post so long held by the late Empress. 
The year 1860 forms an important turning point in the history of the Marie insti- 
tutions, as it opened a new era in the extension of a liberal education to those classes 
that had hitherto been excluded from the sphere of their activity. 
But it was impossible to enlarge the area of public instruction unless the number 
of schools was considerably increased, for only in this way could the primary 
requirements of the poorer classes.be adequately met or a solid education be given 
to children who did not possess the privileges of rank qualifying them to enter any 
 
-P-A-G-E-454
    406 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-91. 
of the existing institutions. They were consequently obliged to content themselves 
with the education given in private schools, or had to be intrusted to the care of 
governesses and tutors, who were themselves often entirely uninstructed and had 
never received any pedagogical training. 
Yor the first time since the establishment of Government institutes for young girls 
the wisdom and practicableness of Betski’s fundamental principle that a girl can only 
be well and thoroughly educated in a boarding school began to be doubted and 
questioned, and before long it was decided to reform altogether the system that had 
hitherto prevailed. 
The first public day school admitting girls of all conditions and reiigions was 
established April 19, 1858, according to a plan drawn up by Professor Visehnegradski. 
The success attending this first trial encouraged many towns to solicit permission to 
establish like schools entirely at their own expense and without receiving any sub- 
sidy whatever from the Government. These petitions became so numerous that in 
July, 1869, an imperial decree was issued ordering that only those public schools 
which received subsidies from the administrative council would be included in tho 
number of the Marie institutions, and that all schools established and carried on by 
private persons would be placed under the direction of the ministry of public 
instruction. From the year 1870 the number of public schools for girls had invariably 
been greater than that of schools for boys; but they were found to be still sadly 
inadequate, and accordingly merchants of any guild and families, noble or otherwise, 
were allowed to place their daughters in any one of the Marie institutions on pay- 
ment of certain fixed fees, the only exceptions being the Educational Home for 
Girls of Noble Birth, the St. Catharine, the Patriotic, and the orphan institutes, 
which still preserved the privilege of admitting only girls of noble parentage. Day 
scholars and half boarders were also admitted into some of the institutes on pay- 
ment of a small fixed annual fee. 
The operations of the loan and savings banks, which in 1828 reached the sum of 
354,000,000 rubles, at this time covered a sum of not less than a milliard rubles. 
The revenues of these banks, which may be calculated to have been about 5,000,000 
rubles, were appropriated to form an alienable capital, not only for the maintenance 
of the foundling hospitals and some of the other Marie institutions, but also for the 
partial support of the cadet corps. 
Tt was in the same year, 1860, when the questions of the emancipation of the serfs 
and the reorganization of the imperial credit institutions had come to the front, that 
the loan and saving banks were brought under the direction of the ministry of 
finance, but on condition that all the Marie institutions should continue to be fur- 
nished with funds sufficient for their due maintenance and support. 
The central administration also underwent several important changes, the St. 
Petersburg and Moscow tutelary councils and the supreme council being merged into 
one department under the name of the tutelary council of the Marie institutions. 
The council was divided into two principal sections, one for each of the two capi- 
tals, and, as reorganized on new bases in 1878, was invested with discretionary pow- 
ers in all matters relating to their management, direction, and finances. The rights 
and functions of the honorary members, chosen and nominated by the .Emperor 
himself, were further considerably enlarged. 
The general direction of the establishments dependent on the privy chancellery of 
the Emperor was delegated to a director in chief, the control of the finances and all 
property belonging to the institutions being intrusted to a special department created 
for that purpose. 
After the death of the Empress Marie Alexandroyna the Marie institutions were, 
by an imperial rescript dated May 29, 1880, placed under the protection of the Grand 
Duchess Tsarevna Marie Feodorovna. 
This reseript was one of the last acts performed by the Emperor Alexander IT 
on behalf of the Marie institutions, which at that time embraced 459 educational ° 
and charitable establishments. The number of boys and girls being brought up
-P-A-G-E-455
  EDUCATION IN RUSSIA. 407 
and instructed in the different schools exceeded 20,000, while 68,161 persons ~vere 
being treated in the hospitals and 80,963 poor children and adults were inmates 
of the foundling hospitals and asylums. 
The present position (in 1892) of these establishments, which are actually under 
the direct protection of their Imperial Majesties the Emperor and Empress, show 
that they are conducted in strict adherence to the sacred aim with which they were 
originally founded—to succor the homeless, helpless, and forlorn, and to bring up 
the young in the principles of true religion and love to their neighbor. 
The foundling hospitals have received since their foundation 103,043 children. 
There are now 107 primary and normal schools attached to these hospitals, in which 
a solid elementary education is being given to 3,293 boys and girls. The result of 
concentrating the work of these hospitals in the two capitals has been the amass- 
ing of a large number of children in one or two buildings, and a consequent large 
and abnormal rate of mortality. The first steps toward the decentralization of 
these hospitals were taken in 1891. In celebration of the silver wedding of their 
Majesties considerable sums were raised both by public bodies and by private per- 
sons for the establishment of créches in the provinces, and they are now in full work 
in the towns of Vologda, Poltava, Ekaterineslaff, Morschansk, and Petrosayodsk. 
The modest aim of the asylums for children is to feed and look after children 
whose parents are engaged all day in outdoor work. The children are instructed in 
the rudiments of the orthodox religion, reading, and writing, and in the asylums to 
which orphan homes are annexed there are also technical trade classes. The num- 
ber of children received during 1891 into the 131 existing asylums was 13,645, of 
whom 4,420 were taken into orphan and boarding homes. 
The pupils of the Deaf and Dumb School for Boys and Girls are taught by the 
oral system, the sign and manual system being used for those who are disinclined to 
follow the former method. In addition to this, they are instructed in religion, the 
Russian language, arithmetic, and the necessary trades. The school consists of 105 
boy boarders and 65 girl boarders, besides 32 boys and 28 girls as day scholars. Of 
the 230 pupils, 138 are taught by the oral system. 
Institutions for the relief of the blind.—In 1881 a small circle of persons belonging 
to the highest society of St. Petersburg, on the initiative of M. Grot, secretary of 
state, and under his presidency, established an association for the relief of the blind 
in Russia, which was called, in memory of the constant interest the late Empress 
had taken in helping the poor blind, Association for the Relief of the Blind, founded 
in memory of the Empress Marie Alexandroyna. In 1883 it was annexed to the 
Marie institutions. 
The main object of the association consists in the establishment of schools for 
blind children and of trade homes for blind adults. Extending its aid to persons of 
both sexes, without any restriction as to the religion professed by those it suecors, 
schools have already been started in the towns of St. Petersburg, Moscow, Kieff, 
Reval, Kazan, Kostroma, Kharkoff, Voronege, Odessa, Perm, Smolensk, Toula, 
Samara, Chernigoff, and Oupha; public workshops have Ween established at Kame- 
netz and Oupha; asylums for the aged blind have been founded at St. Petersburg, 
Voronege, and Perm, and ophthalmic hospitals have been opened at Tiflis and Tash- 
kent. All these establishments are supported by the members of the association 
and by public subscriptions. The resources of the association, with already 600 
blind pupils in its schools, were augmented by a memorial gift of 1,000,000 rubles on 
the part of the late Emperor, Alexander II, immediately after the death of Her 
Majesty Marie Alexandroyna. 
In the 39 hospitals the total number of persons who have received medical treat- 
ment is 350,154, of whom 326,395 have been out-patients and 23,759 have been indoor 
patients. 
The institutes for girls, or boarding schools, with a course of education extending 
over seven years, teach all that is necessary for every educated woman in the fulfill- 
         
-P-A-G-E-456

ment of her home duties. The programme of studies followed in these schools con- 
sists of religion, the Russian, French, and German languages, geography, history, 
mathematics, zoology, pedagogy, caligraphy, drawing, music, singing, gymnastics, 
and dancing. Some of the schools have special pedagogic classes in which particu- 
lar attention is paid to the study of foreign languages and to proof lessons for 
training the pupils in the art of teaching. The pupils, on passing the final exam- 
inations, are entitled to receive a diploma qualifying them to act as teachers in 
schools or as private governesses, and those who have received the highest possible 
marks during the whole course are also awarded “ chiffres”—that is, bronze medals 
pearing the initials of the founders and attached to a silk ribbon—gold or silver 
medals, and books. There are in all 32 institutes, and the total number of scholars 
amounts to 7,680 girls. 
The public schools for girls are chiefly day schools, though to some of them board- 
ing schools are annexed. 
Their programme of studies, with the exception of music, which is not taught 
them, is identical with that adopted in the institutes. Diplomas qualifying for the 
post of private teacher are granted those pupils who have duly passed the final 
examinations, the gold or silver medal being awarded on the same conditions as in 
the institutes. The schools at St. Petersburg have also special pedagogic classes, 
with a course of studies extending over a period of three years, the last year being 
devoted to practical training in teaching, for which purpose a progymnasium of four 
classes is intrusted to them. On finishing this course pupils have the right to 
receive a diploma qualifying them as teachers in the higher classes of public schools 
and institutes. 
In 1891 the 30 public schools, together with the progymnasium and pedagogic 
classes, were attended by 10,664 scholars. 
The programme of studies for the primary schools for girls is of a more limited 
kind than that adopted in the institutes and public schools. 
These schools, organized in 1882 on the personal initiative of the Empress and 
called by her name, the Marie schools, were established to give a sound elementary 
education which should qualify girls for the pursuit of a business or professional 
career. In the Marie schools are taught religion, the Russian language, arithmetic, 
the history und geography of Russia, the rudiments of zoology, caligraphy, draw- 
ing, singing, and needlework. The full course of studies extends over a period of 
four years, during all which time particular attention is paid to needlework of every 
kind, with the aim of training the pupils for the calling of cutters and makers of 
clothes. They are three in number, two being at St. Petersburg and one at Vishni- 
Volotschock. In one of the former there is a special class for practical instruction 
in plain and fancy needlework. The primary schools are 71 in all, and are attended 
by 6,244 children of both sexes. 
The educational institutions for boys are four in number—the Imperial Alexander 
Lyceum, two commercial schools, and the Nicholas Orphan Institute at Gatchina, 
The lyceum, with its university course of studies and juridical faculty, is a high 
school designed exclusively for the sons of nobles; the other two are secondary 
schools. The number of scholars educated in these four establishments amounts to 
2,066 boys. 
Thirty-six hospices aided 3,849 men, women, and children in 1891. 
This sketch may be summed up by stating that during the year 1891 498,108 
persons were aided and relieved by the Marie institutions, of which number 
120,587 fell to the share of the foundling hospitals, the hospices, and the asylums; 
350,154 to the share of the hospitals, and 27,417 to the share of the educational 
establishments. 
The budget of the 472 institutions for the same year amounted to 11,244,105 rubles 
($3,969,169). The resources for their support are drawn from capitals previously 
formed, from donations granted by the imperial family, from payments made by 
scholars, from a subsidy of 5,000,000 rubles accorded by the State treasury, and, 
finally, from pubhe contributions. 
   
-P-A-G-E-457
  EDUCATION IN RUSSIA. A09 
These contributions, amounting in twelve years to a capital of 10,000,000 rubles 
($3,530,000), amply testify to the intimate conviction of the Russian people that the 
administrative authorities, being under the direct control of their Imperial Majes- 
ties, will employ all the large resources at their disposal in promoting the cause for 
which the institutions intrusted to their care were first founded. They further 
afford a brilliant and incontrovertible proof that the Marie institutions, by the 
numerous and varied good works they foster, have succeeded in carrying out the 
humane and large-minded view that inspired their illustrious founders. 
In this connection citations from “ L’ceuvre de la femme & Moscou,” 
a work prepared for the Columbian Exposition, are of value. This is 
an account of feminine activity in education, in philanthropy, and in 
industries, bothrural and urban, of the Moscow district. Societies! have 
been established for training women in practical pursuits by which they 
can earn a livelihood if necessary. Cooking, cutting of garments, 
skilled handiwork generally, and an intelligence bureau enter into the 
work. Especial effort is made to interest individuals in the science of 
education, and many women are trained for the position of teacher. 
Municipalities appoint women of the territorial nobility as patronesses 
of the urban schools, and those desiring to be instructresses for rural 
districts receive regular training in the public schools, with additional 
training in pedagogical courses. Many private institutions, under the 
auspices of ladies of the court, prepare their pupils for professions, such 
as nurse, modiste, milliner, housekeeper, cook, ete. The organization 
of philanthropic institutions in Moscow and other large cities includes 
hospitals for children and adults, public charities, homes for incurables, 
training schools for women physicians, for sanitary inspectors in man- 
ufactories, aid societies, organized help for those detained in prisons or 
reformatories, houses of refuge, asylums, etc.. In manufacturing indus- 
tries women take active part, in the Moscow government alone 36,912 
women and 317 children being actively engaged in working in cloth, 
metals, wood, printing, canning cereals, fruits, ete. Rural industries, 
which are a special feature of Russian life, are often carried on in the 
homes, but there are many intermediate agents, and the general coop- 
eration of women is obtained. In the Moscow government there are 
62,164 industrial establishments and 141,339 persons engaged in the 
work. The industries include basket making, chair seating, manufac- 
turing playthings for children, making furniture, pottery work, porce- 
lain faience, combs, hats, and caps, leather work, lace making, knitting, 
making edging, fashioning undergarments, rolling cigarettes, fabri- 
eating fringes and other trimmings, knitting slippers, making Straw 
hats, ete. : 
For persons who have aspirations beyond these industries for the 
people there are higher places for work, such as decorative art, techni- 
cal drawing, the study of music and dramatic art, training for artistic 
careers, such as painting and sculpture, in all of which the woman of the

period in Russia is steadily advancing toward a position where she 
may gain her livelihood, if she desires, or rank equally with those who 
have had opportunities since time immemorial to cultivate their talents. 
In St. Petersburg the Ladies’ Patriotic Society! (1812-1893) has under 
its management 16 day and boarding schools, with 2,362 pupils. In 
addition to the usual studies found in schools of this class, instruction 
is given in sewing, cutting, embroidery, washing and ironing, artificial 
flower and Jace making, in embossing leather, and in painting on porce- 
lain. At graduation the pupil receives a diploma from the board of 
trade in St. Petersburg entitling the graduate to become an assistant 
mistress. 
MEMORABLE DATES. 
Ninth century: To Cyrille, a Byzantine Brother, an alphabet of 
thirty-eight letters is due, which alphabet, originally adopted from the 
Greeks, was modified to suit the Slavs, Bulgarians, and Servians. The 
Russian and Servian alphabets of the present day are derived from the 
Cyrillique. : 
Tenth to seventeenth century: The ravages of the Tartar hordes 
checked the efforts of the Byzantine Brothers to disseminate a knowl- 
edge of reading and writing. With the fifteenth century came the first 
notable Roman Catholic influence, introduced into the country by the 
Poles. Schools were founded by them which greatly extended the 
Jesuit influence. The famous Greco-Latin Slavonic school at Kief, 
which is generally considered to be the embryo of Kief University, dates 
from 1588, and became in 1633 an academy under a famous defender 
of the Greek Church, Archbishop Peter Magila. In 1629 another 
school was founded in Moscow, to which the more learned monks of 
Kief were brought as teachers. The more advanced education’ of the 
Kief monks was due to the Polish influence. These schools aimed to 
instruct in two languages, philosophy and theology. The embryo of 
Dorpat University dates from 1652; that of Helsingfors from 1640. 
1689-1725: The earliest efforts to educate the Russian people are gen- 
erally conceded to Peter the Great, for he brought Russia into relation 
with other nations and invited learned men to come to his domain to 
instruct in different branches of learning. He established special 
technical schools for engineers and for naval science, also military and 
naval schools. He created people’s schools, founded schools for the 
clergy, for nobles, and for civil servants.? To him is due the extended 
German influence and the establishment of famous German schools, 
which exerted great influence for over a century and which now rank as 
gymnasia, and are subject to rules laid down by the ministry of public 
instruction. 
  
1Brief Historical Review of the St. Petersburg Ladies’ Patriotic Society. 
2 The hierarchic scale established by Peter the Great comprises fourteen classes of 
civilians, called tchinovniks. The first three classes have the title ‘highest excel- 
lence,” the fourth ‘‘excellence;” from that to the eighth ‘‘vycokorodnii,” or the 
hereditary nobility, and the remainder the title “blagorodni,” or well born.

EDUCATION IN RUSSIA. 411 
1741-1761: During this period are noted the encouragement by the 
Empress Elizabeth of the study of the French language and literature, 
the founding of the Academy of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg in 1787, 
which, by bringing French artists to Russia, greatly enhanced French 
» influence, and the establishment of Moscow University in 1755. 
1762-1796: Within these dates are chronicled the establishment of 
popular lay schools in districts and towns during the reign of Cathe- 
rine IT; the founding of gymnasia for secondary instruction; the estab- 
lishment of institutions for the secondary education of young girls of 
noble families—the famous eonvent school of Smolna dates from the 
reign of Catherine II. Plans were laid for the establishment of uni- 
versities, as there was no real vitality in the institutions for superior. 
instruction already referred to. In 1782 a commission was appointed 
to take the necessary measures for the organization of elementary edu- 
cation; from 1786 on, the right of opening and teaching school was 
only accorded to those who could give proof of capacity. 
1802-1803: An advancement of educational matters was perceptible 
in the beginning of the nineteenth century. In 1802 the first adminis- 
trative organization was attempted through the creating of the office 
of minister of public instruction and through the division of the Empire 
into school circuits, and centralization was further aided by the appoint- 
ment of officials representing the minister in the educational circuits. 
_ In 1803 commenced the transformation of middle-grade communal 
schools into gymnasia. 
1804-1825: Establishment of the universities of Kharkof, Kazan, 
and St. Petersburg; decree that no person could become a civil servant 
(tchinovnik) unless he had passed through a gymnasia; school fees 
introduced which were used for teachers’ salaries, to furnish awards for 
study and conduct, and for pensions. 
1828-1858: Regular organization of secondary schools, which date 
from 1762 to 1796; reorganization of universities (law of 1835) so that 
they became teaching bodies rather than administrative bodies; schools 
placed under control of curators of school circuits; opening of first 
gymnasia for girls in 1858, 
1860-1864: The emancipation of the serfs in 1860 caused a demand 
for more schools; a general plan received imperial sanction in 1862; in 
1864 an elementary school law was promulgated which created three 
grades of education—elementary, secondary, and superior. 
1867-1874: Supervision of elementary schools given to the zemstvo, 
and a school board formed in every district; in 1871 training schools 
for teachers were established; in 1872 real schools were organized to 
more thoroughly train students for practical life; in 1874 school councils 
were placed under direct charge of the ministry, the central authorities 
thus assuming control of education throughout the Empire. 
1875-1884: Few changes are noted until, in 1883, a technical division 
was formed to carry out a plan of establishing industrial and technical

schools throughout the Empire; in 1884 parochial schools were reorgan- 
ized and placed under the direction of the Holy Synod, 
1888-1891: A scheme for technical schools was elaborated in 1888; a 
scheme for commercial and industrial schools had been introduced since 
1889; a decree of April 24, 1890, transferred the “middle” schools of 
the Baltic district into gymnasia; a decree of December, 1889, deprived 
Dorpat University of its privileges of self-government; later decrees 
serve to more thoroughly Russianize this institution. 
1891-1894: Establishment of a commission to study the subject of 
elementary education; decrees promulgated that private schools in 
Dorpat district can only be taught in the Russian language; efforts 
are being made to extend compulsory education throughout all divisions 
of the Czar’s dominions. In the early part of 1895 it was stated that 
the subject of the patriarchal form of government of the mir was 
awakening discussion. It was considered that the mir might be inimical 
to the possibilities of a nationalization of the Russian governmental 
service.

Population and administration.—The Grand Duchy of Finland has an area of 144,255 
square miles, with a population of 2,380,140 (in 1890). The capital, Helsingfors, has 
a population of 61,530. Finland is annexed to Russia, but not incorporated in it. 
Ceded to Russia by the treaty of Frederikshamn, Sweden, on September 17, 1809, it 
retains portions of its ancient constitution, which was originally adopted in 1772, 
remodeled in 1789, and modified in 1869 and 1882. There is a national diet, which 
discusses schemes of laws proposed by the Czar, who has also the right of veto. 
Proposed laws are elaborated by the “‘State’s Secretariat? of Finland, which sits in 
St. Petersburg, and consists of the state secretary and four members nominated by 
the Crown (two of them being proposed by the Senate).” The Senate, which sits at 
Helsingfors, is under the presidency of the governor-general, and is the superior ad- 
ministrative power in Finland. It consists of two departments, justice and finance, 
which have the administration of various divisions of the internal affairs of Finland. 
The military department is under charge of the Russian ministry of war. Foreign 
affairs are under the charge of the Russian chancellor. 
THE SCHOOL SYSTEM AND STATISTICS. 
The school system of Finland is distinct from that of Russia, and 
resembles in its main features that of Sweden, to which country it 
belonged until 1809. According to statements presented by the cen- 
tral bureau of statistics (Statistiska Centralbyran) and by the higher 
school board (Ofverstyrelsen for Skolvisendet) in Helsingfors, which 
board centralizes the control of schools for Finland, the system con- 
sists of elementary (fasta folkskolor), secondary, and professional (ele- 
mentarskolor and realskolor), normal schools (folkskolliirare och 
lirarinneseminarier), higher and special schools. The system was 
  
'Prepared by Miss Frances Graham French, specialist in the school systems of 
northern and eastern Europe.

established by decree of April 19, 1858, and definitely organized! by 
decree of May 11, 1866. This decree required each town to provide a 
sufficient number of schools for all children between 7 and 14 years of 
age, with a division into lower and higher elementary schools, the latter 
for youth between 10 and 14 years of age. Atadlater date the school 
age seems to have been extended to 16 years, and the statistics pre- 
sented are from 7 to 16 years of age. In rural communes the earliest 
instruction is to be given in the family; if not there, attendance is 
required in either stationary (fasta folkskolor) or in ambulatory 
schools (flyttande folkskolor)—that is, schools whose teachers move 
from district to district every two or three months instructing the 
scattered schoo! population. In 1891-92, according to the Statistisk 
Arsbok fér Finland, there were 177,886 pupils in ambulatory schools, 
which gives a ratio of 7.47 to the 100 of population of 2,380,140; and 
57,663 in stationary schools, or a ratio of 2.41 to the 180 of population. 
There were 1,628 teachers—men, 753; women, 875. Preceding the ele- 
1 The Rey. Uno Cygnaeus is generally conceded to be the reorganizer of the Finn- 
ish school system. Being commissioned by the authorities to visit different coun- 
tries for the purpose of studying educational questions, he introduced new ideas, 
and prepared ‘a combination of literary, scientific, and industrial studies” for the 
schools. He filled the position of inspector-general of common schools during the 
period of reorganization. The general development of the school system prior to 
this reorganization is presented at the close of this chapter. Uno Cygnaeus, the 
patriot and the promoter of elementary education in Finland, was bern October 12, 
1810, in Tavastehus. Entering the university in his seventeenth year, he received 
his doctor’s degree in 1836. Ordained as pastor at Viborg, he soon joined a colony of 
Finns in North America, and became their pastor at New Archangel (Sitka), in May, 
1840. The first Finnish elementary school was started here. During the long voy- 
age around Cape Horn, Cygnaeus gave much thought to the moral and intelectual 
education of man, and he determined to consecrate his life to the education of future 
generations. After staying five years in America, he went to St. Petersburg in 
1846, remaining there until 1858 asa pastor for the Finnish people. About that 
date Alexander II, Emperor of Russia and Grand Duke of Finland, visited that 
island and announced in the Senate that he intended to give Finland a complete 
and modern school organization. According to the customs of the times, the matter 
was brought before the people, discussions of the subject being requested. Pastor 
Uno Cygnaeus, as author of Thoughts on the Future of the Primary School of Fin- 
land, was authorized by the Senate to present a study on the subject of education 
in other countries. 
The principles announced in this work, “Nigra ord om folk-skoleviisendet i Fin- 
land,” caused Cygnaeus to be appointed inspector in chief of elementary schools and 
director of the normal school at Jyviiskylii, so that he was able to carry out his 
pedagogical views. According to the ideas of that period his modern pedagogical _ 
views seemed impracticable. He had learned to comprehend both Pestalozzi and 
Fribel. He understood that elementary instruction was gradually being deflected 
from its essential goal; that is, its purpose should be to elucidate or to educate by 
degrees, each step gradually unfolding and leading to a new idea. Cygnaeus did 
not present new ideas, he simply revived the art of educating, and he applied this 
art to each and every institution in its turn. He soon saw that many educators did 
not comprehend the Pestalozzian spirit, nor had they been able to apply his ideas. 
Pestalozzi believed essentially in the common sehool for rich and poor, for the sons

The budget for 1893 contained $326,259 for elementary and normal 
schools, which gives a per capita of enrollment of $5.65, and a per 
capita of population of 13 cents. It should, however, be observed that 
the income for school purposes is not limited to the governmental subsi- 
dies, for the communes aid in the matter of school maintenance. In 
1891 the expenditures of the communes for rural schools was $130,008, 
Assuming this amount to be for the ambulatory schools (177,886 pupils) 
and for the higher grade elementary pupils (38,097) of rural districts, 
then the per capita of enrollment would be 59 cents. 
        
of a president and for those of the w alee et should be equal and receive an 
equal education. Cygnaeus added to this that education should be based upon 
piety and morality, that these were more important than a variety of studies. He 
also insisted upon physical training; and for this and other reasons he insisted that 
sloyd should be given a principal place in the school course, and he was the first per- 
son in Finland to insist upon sloyd being a part of the course of study of elementary 
and nermal schools. The education of women—the future mother—interested him 
greatly, and he introduced what were called rational methods of education. He 
suggested that créches be established near the schools, and that girl pupils aid in 
caring for the littie ones left there by their mothers during the day. In fact, Uno 
Cygnaeus created the elementary school of Finland, and, practical in his views, he 
perfected methods of education both for elementary schools and for the proper 
training of teachers in normal schools or teachers’ seminaries. His writings on 
educational subjects are not numerous, but he conversed freely on that subject, and 
by correspondence, and especially by deeds, carried out his views. His power as an 
educator consisted in his thorough comprehension of the efforts of his predecessors 
in pedagogical fields, with the executive foree to carry out such ideas. Religious in 
the best conception of the term, clear-headed, energetic, friendly in intercourse with 
others, he really created the school system of Finland, which, in its present flourish- 
ing condition, is a fitting memorial of his efforts to present and future generations. 
While developing his pedagogical ideas Uno Cygnacus visited Denmark, Sweden, 
Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands; he became acquainted with well-known 
educators of those countries, and on his return to Finland he embodied in his plan 
such of their ideas as seemed feasible for the needs of the people of Finland. (Otto 
Salomon in Mexico Intelectual, July 31, 1894, pp. 46-50; and Uno Cygnaeus, by G- 
F, Linnbeck.)

The secondary schools, asis also the case with the elementary grades, 
are subdivided into schools for the Swedish,! and schools for the Finnish 
school population, According to an enactment of 1872 the real schools, 
lyceums, and higher schools for women are classed under the heading 
“Hlementarliroverken”; the real schools receive pupils from 9 to 12 
years of age, and prepare them for special schools; the lyceums include 
the old gymnasia (the first founded in 1630) and lead in their eight-year 
courses directly to the university or to special schools.

The complete schools are those of 7 classes; the incomplete of 4 classes, which are in a measure preparatory to the seven-class lyceums. _elneluding 708 boys. 
The State and the communes cooperate in the maintenance of these 
secondary schools. The amount included in the budget in 1891-92 
was $408,591, which gives an expenditure of 17 cents per capita of 
population and $38.52 per capita of enrollment. The university and 
polytechnic school (Universitet och Polyteknikum) had 1,881 students 
(1,750 in the former anid 131 in the latter) in 1893. The State expendi- 
ture for both institutions was $182,155.

schools, it should be stated that 85 per cent of the inhabitants of Finland are Finns 
and 14 per cent Swedes. Each nationality has a certain proportion of schools, where 
the instruction is given in either the Swedish or Finnish tongues, and hence the term 
Swedish or Finnish schools; in still other schools both languages are used. These 
two peoples, 98.05 per cent of whom are Protestants, have lived together for seven 
hundred years and form a single nation. The Swedish, or more aristocratic element, 
is found in the greatest numbers in Aland, Wyland, Wasa, and a part of the Archi- 
pelago of Abo.

  EDUCATION IN FINLAND. 417 
In Finland stress is laid upon training for industrial, commercial, 
and agricultural pursuits. As is stated by the director of the central 
bureau of statistics, there are 7 industrial schools (industriskolorna), 
with 48 teachers and 333 pupils; 7 higher grade manual training 
schools in cities (hégre handtverksskolor i stiderna), with 38 teachers 
and 226 pupils; 31 of lower grade (ligre handtverksskolor i stiiderna), 
with 92 teachers and 1,096 pupils. State expenditure for manual train- 
ing was $5,005; communal expenditure for the same was $8,264. Com- 
mercial schools (handelsskolorna) are 8 in number, with 70 teachers and 
472 students and 179 graduates in 1892-93; State expenditure, $10,402. 
In rural districts there are 14 agricultural schools (landtbrukslirover- 
ken), with 52 teachers, 375 students, and 151 graduates; State expendi- 
ture, $42,575; also 19 dairy-farm schools (mejerilaroverken), with 37 
teachers and 175 women students; graduates, 95; State expenditure, 
$10,537. For the purpose of teaching those who desire to enter the 
marine service there are 7 navigation schools (navigationsskolorna), 
with 146 students in 1892-93. The State expenditure was $14,706: 
Under the heading of “ Abnormskolorna” are grouped the 5 schools 
for deaf and dumb (défstumsskolor), with 31 teachers and 283 pupils; 
State expenditure, $21,127; the 2 schools for the blind (blindanstalter), 
with 17 teachers and 68 pupils; State expenditure, $11,988; and the 2 
private schools for idiots (idiotanstalten), which, however, received 
$5,790 from the State; teachers, 9; pupils, 44. 
The length of the school year in the different grades of school is not 
definitely stated, but in the elementary grades instruction must be 
given at least thirty hours a week for thirty weeks. Secondary schools 
are kept open from September 1 to December 20, and from January 14 
to May 31; the university from September 15 to December 15, and 
from January 15 to May 15. The term of the remaining scholastic 
institutions is not specified. 
STATE AND LOCAL SUPERVISION. 
The central control of the school system at Helsingfors is vested in 
a higher school board (Ofverstyrelsen for Skolviisendet) which is an 
adjunct of the Imperial Senate of Finland, and especiaily connected 
with the administrative section of ecclesiastical affairs and public 
instruction. This central organization has supervision of State ele- 
mentary, secondary, and special schools, and also of private schools 
which may be subsidized by the State; it regulates the school pro- 
grammes and controls the apportionment of school material. An 
inspector in chief, appointed by the Czar, on the nomination of the 
board, attends more especially to the needs of elementary and normal 
schools; reports from the local inspectors are brought to his attention. 
The university is controlled by the academic authorities, but no modi- 
fication of its organization may be attempted until the matter has been 
referred to the Senate and has finally received imperial sanction. In 
ED 94——27
-P-A-G-E-466
  418 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
each territorial subdivision (lin) there is a local inspector of elementary 
schools who has general supervision of that grade throughout the liin. 
The local supervision of secondary schools is intrusted to a council of 
state of 3 to 5 members appointed by the higher school board. 
SCHOOL ORGANIZATION AND METHODS. 
The teaching force is recruited from the graduates of normal schools, 
who, after passing the examination at the close of the four years’ course, 
are entitled to a certificate of qualification to teach. The normal 
schools have kindergarten and infant schools connected with them; 
the fourth year of the course is generally devoted to practice teaching. 
The central school board appoints the teachers, and it is to the State 
that they look for payment of salary, although the local authorities 
provide lodgings, containing at least two rooms and a kitchen, with 
ground for gardening and pasturage for a cow. The salaries of ele- 
mentary grade teachers range from $116 for women to $154 for men per 
annum; in real schools (in 1873) the salaries reported were from $463 
to $579; in lyceums from $540 to $887; in secondary schools for girls 
from $579 to $772 for male teachers and $307 to $463 for women, lodg- 
ings being allowed in allcases. Whether these amounts have increased 
or decreased since that date is not known. 
Organization and plans of study.—In Helsingfors, and also in some 
other cities, the school buildings are constructed according to modern 
methods, and are arranged with well-ventilated rooms, and have exten- 
sive grounds. The ambulatory schools, however, have to depend upon 
rooms in the homes of peasants or wherever they can best be accommo- 
dated. Instruction is insisted upon by the authorities, but there is 
latitude in regard to enforcement of school attendance. The Statis- 
tisk Arsbok for Finland indicates that in 1891, out of a school popula- 
tion of 470,382, there were 207,813 children receiving instruction at 
home or in schools held on Sunday, while only 21,523 were reported 
as having no schooling at all. The central or higher school board at 
Helsingfors regulates the school programmes from the pedagogical and 
technical side, but there is great liberty of action left to the teacher. 
The very latest improvements are investigated, and adopted when 
feasible. The elementary (primary) schools have a four years’ course, 
divided into lower and higher grades of two years each, instruction 
being both oral and by text-books. The studies include religion, the 
mother tongue, arithmetic, drawing, singing, gymnastics, and manual 
training for boys and girls; in the higher grade, elementary history, 
geography, elements of plane and descriptive geometry, and natural 
sciences are added. Manual training occupies about five hours a week 
in each class. Corporal punishment is not allowed in the schools; the 
teacher places the pupils upon their honor to obey the rules. Formerly 
boys and girls were taught separately, but since 1883 coeducation has 
been attempted in some schools of both elementary and secondary 
 
-P-A-G-E-467
  
  EDUCATION IN FINLAND. 419 
grades, and it is stated that 5 coeducational’ institutions (4 Swedish 
and 1 Finnish) have been created since that date. Institutions whose 
course of study is of an elementary character include also manual train- 
ing schools, city evening schools (with 773 pupils in 1891-92), and 
schools for the defective classes. 
The secondary schools form three groups, as heretofore stated. The 
studies, which vary somewhat according to the group, include religion, 
Swedish, Finnish, Russian, German, French, and English, the classics, 
history, geography, botany, zoology, physics, mathematics, drawing, 
singing, and gymnastics. Large halls for gymnastic exercises are con- 
nected with the better class of buildings. 
Four normal schools prepare those desiring to fill a teacher’s posi- 
tion. Two of the normals are mixed schools—that is, both sexes fol- 
low the courses—three are for the Finnish population, and one for the 
Swedes; pupils under instruction, 436. 
Training for practical life-—The comparative prosperity of the people 
of Finland may be said to be due in part to the fact that the benefits 
of education have been brought within the reach of even the humblest 
citizen. Then, too, an impetus has been given to agricultural pursuits 
by the foundation of schools of higher and lower grade for the study 
of agriculture, dairying, and forestry. Numerous agencies, societies, 
and individuals aid in the improvement of the poorer classes by the 
establishment of household schools, where girls are taught the main 
elements of domestic economy. Commercial schools (handelsskolor) 
train those whose aim is toward a business life. Prizes are offered to 
stimulate the peasant class in developing the best methods of carrying 
on agricultural pursuits. Agricultural societies have ramifications all 
over the country and enroll hundreds of active members. Trade   
1«Of these private coeducational schools, one at Helsingfors,” says a writer in the 
Journal of Education, London, “had 200 boys and girls in 1893 who were receiving 
similar instruction. There were 11 classes, 2 of them elementary for the younger 
children, who are received from the sixth year on. They may remain until the twen- 
tieth year, and if the examination is a satisfactory one they may enter the univer- 
sity. The course of study includes English, French, German, Finnish (optional), 
Russian, and Latin. Geography is taught from the fourth year of the course. 
Manual training is taught to both sexes, and this includes sloyd, sewing, embroid- 
ery, and knitting. Drawing is an optional branch, while all study singing, unless 
prohibited by physicians’ orders, or because they have no voice for singing. Gym- 
nasties is taught two or three hours each week; in the lower classes the boys and 
girls are trained together; in the upper classes separately. The school year com- 
mences in September; there is a month’s vacation at Christmas, a week at Haster, 
and several days at Whitsuntide; and the longest vacation is from June to Septem- 
ber. Each day’s schooling is from 8 to 11, and from 1 to3 o’clock. Every hour there 
is ten minutes’ recreation, and every half hour four minutes’ change of occupation. 
During the summer months botanic studies are pursued, and each pupil has his (or 
her) herbarium, and classifies and describes the new plants placed therein. Each 
pupil pays $50 a year, and the Government is called upon for a subsidy, if required, 
although it is stated that the Government does not desire to subsidize coeducational 
institutions.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-468
  420 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
schools are established, and there are ambulatory instructors who 
travel from point to point and instruct in carpentering, smitheraft, fish 
curing, and horticulture. General training for life work does not stop 
here, for there are schools of horticulture, farriers’ schools, agriculturo- 
chemical and seed stations, stock farms for cattle breeding, and divers 
other means of improving the people. By means of these aids to a 
general education profitable occupations are given to those remote 
from urban centers, so that during the long nights of the northern 
winter the peasantry retain their interest in some one or more avoca- 
tions, and with the return of the spring comes the incitement to new 
endeavor. Statistics of these and other special schools have already 
been given, as far as obtainable, and the Government’s interest is 
indicated by subsidies. 
UNIVERSITY AND POLYTECHNICUM—HOW ORGANIZED. 
The university at Helsingfors, originally established at Abo and 
removed to Helsingfors in 1827, has a consistorium, composed of the 
rector and regular professors, which attends to the management of its 
internal affairs. By decree of 1852 the government of the institution 
rests with the chancellor and the consistorium, but any modification of 
its organization must be refenred to the Senate and then receive im- 
perial sanction before its provisos can be carried out. The four faculties 
are of theology, law, medicine, and philosophy, entrance to either of 
which requires the passing of the final examination in a lyceum, and 
an examination conducted by professors designated by the academic 
authorities. 
The university has also the subdivision into six “nations,” each of 
which indicates from what part of the duchy the student comes. Each 
of these bodies has an inspector at its head, and its members are taxed 
for special and general purposes. The disciplinary power of the “na- 
tion” is such that a refractory member may be suspended for not more 
than a two years’ period. To obtain a professorship in a given faculty 
requires the holding of the degree of doctor of that faculty, and the 
presentation of a thesis on the subject to be taught. A doctor’s degree 
necessitates, first, that of M. A., and the passing of a second examina- 
tion. Candidates for the position of private docent or instructor, are 
also required to hold satisfactory credentials.

422 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94 
HISTORICAL RESUME! 
In Finland, to date of 1611, the church authorities controlled educa- 
tional institutions, the few schools being annexed to Catholic monas- 
teries. The Lutheran Church neglected to do anything for public 
instruction until the reign of Gustavus Adolphus (1611-1632); but 
special activity is noticed during Queen Christina’s reign (1632-1654), 
and the university was organized in 1640. 
In 1686 an edict of Charles XT required the clergy to hold an annual 
examination to ascertain whether children could read, and whether 
they knew their catechism; it prohibited the marriage of parties who 
failed in the above and who had not been confirmed. 
A law of 1649, amended in 1724, regulated public inséruction for a 
considerable period. Latin was the principal subject of study at that 
date, and the language most generally used. 
The schools were generally controlled by the clergy, and consequently 
varied in organization, in accordance with the wishes of the bishops in 
different dioceses. Elementary instruction was left almost entirely to 
the families, but the Lutheran Church exercised control even over this 
instruction. In 1792-1809 the university, in point of instruction and 
professors, reached a degree of excellence which it has hardly surpassed 
since. 
During the wars which brought about the annexation, in 1809, of 
Finland to Russia as a grand duchy, the attention of the people was 
diverted from any attempts at special educational progress, but in 1812 
three navigation schools were established, and from 1825 to 1855 public 
instruction developed materially while general conditions greatly 
improved. In 1837 agricultural institutes were first referred to; in 
1843 a new school law, tending toward specialization in study, was 
promulgated; in 1847 the polytechnic school was established. 
In 1858 the subject of elementary education was agitated; rural com- 
munes were required to establish stationary schools and governmental 
aidwas promised. The school organization was not definitely regulated, 
however, until eight years later. From 1858 on the first measures to 
extend the use of the Finnish language were adopted, Swedish having 
been the only language for general use permitted by law of 1843. A 
Finnish school and a school for deaf and dumb were established in 
1858. In 1863 the first association of teachers was formed, and a nor- 
mal school was created in 1863-64. 
The beginning of a withdrawal of all schools from ecclesiastical 
authority dates from 1865, and this change from clerical to lay authority 
culminated in 1869, when the higher council of education was created 
at Helsingfors. 
In 1866 the school system was definitely organized, and governmental 
subsidies were to be withheld if its provisions were not carried out by

the local authorities. In 1871-1830 several normal schools were created 
for one or the other sex. 
In 1872 the real schools, lyeeums, and high grade schools for women 
were classified under the term “elementar-liiroverken,” the object 
being to continue elementary education and to prepare for special 
schools. Among the private lyceums are five where boys and girls 
receive instruction in common preparatory to university studies. 
In 1888 Parliament decreed the establishment of lyceums for girls to 
prepare them for university courses, and by reason of this and other 
legislative measures the social and political status of women has been 
greatly benefited during the last few years. Woman may now fill a 
number of positions in administrative offices, and, although she is not 
considered eligible as a voter, she has acquired the right of voting in 
the commune. Much of this progress is attributed to the efforts of the 
Woman’s Society of Finland, established in 1884, 
Another element of progress within the last quarter of a century is 
the gradual equalization of the use of Finnish and Swedish languages. 
In 1858 there was only 1 Finnish school of a secondary grade; in 1891-92 
the number of schools in which Finnish is the language of instruction 
included 13 lyceums, 10 real schools, and 6 secondary schools for girls; 
of elementary schools the number is not stated. At the present date 
there are 58 Finnish journals and reviews (12 more than in Swedish), 
and the Finnish and Swedish languages are equally used in all adminis- 
trative and educational offices. So that it may be seen that the strug- 
gle between the “Svécomanes” and “Fennomanes” is diminishing by 
degrees. 
In the matter of manual and physical training and in that of the 
construction of a superior class of school buildings, arranged accord- 
ing to the most approved hygienic methods, the inhabitants of Finland 
take an excellent position. Gymnasties is obligatory for both sexes in 
institutions of all grades, and the youth of secondary and higher grade 
schools are encouraged to learn to swim, to ride horseback, to skate, 
to ride bicycles, to row, and to manage sailboats, ete., and they are 
encouraged to'take part in competitive athletic sports. 
Helsingfors is the center of scientific, literary, and artistic effort, 
while other cities also have many courses and conferences tending 
toward the instruction and material benefit of the public. 
Temperance! associations are organized, and many pamphlets deal- 
1A lady of Finland, Fréken Alli Trygg, has, since 1888, established a working- 
men’s home and a people’s kitchen, so as to do her part toward the elevation of her 
fellowmen. Living in a suburb of Helsingfors, largely inhabited by men of that 
class, her endeavor has been in the People’s Kitchen to firnish the men with health- 
ful, nourishing food, and through the invention of a new fermented beverage, with 
almost no alcohol in it, she hopes to keep them from drinking beer and brandy. Her 
appeal to the Finnish Senate brought her a grant of 60,000 marks ($11,580) for the 
Workingmen’s Home. A kindergarten and nursery are found in the home; there is 
a hall for gymnastics and music, a loan library, a free reading hall with papers and 
periodicals, a larger hall for lectures on Sundays and evenings when the men are at 
liberty. Fréken Trygg resides in this institution and devotes herself to its welfare.

ing with this and other subjects are annually distributed, the object 
being to discuss questions which will lead to the general advancement 
of the people both in urban and rural districts. 
It is well said that the people of Finland “have a great desire for 
culture” and that their intellectual and industrial progress is such as 
to awaken the interest of individuals of larger and more favored 
nations, speaking from the geographical and historical standpoints.

CHAPTER X. 
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIVAL! 
[For previous article on the subject seo chapter on Child Study, Report 1892-93, vol. 1, pp. 357-391.] 
TOPICAL OUTLINE.—Chief events in the movement during the year 1893-94; societies 
formed; periodicals isswed—Interdependence of the different methods of investiga- 
tion— University equipment for psycho-physics and courses in child study—Results of ~ 
the new psychology applicable to education—Addresses and citations from reports, 
articles, etc. 
  Among the intellectual movements of the time none has greater 
importance for education than the revival of interest in pSychology 
During the year under review the agencies concerned in this move 
ment have been increased by the formation of the American Psycho 
logical Association and the publication of the Psychological Review. 
whose first issue bears date January, 1894. Edited by Profs. J. Mark 
Baldwin, of Princeton University, and J. McKeen Cattell, of Columbia 
College, with the cooperation of a large body of distinguished special- 
ists, the comprehensive and scholarly character of this periodical is 
assured. 
The interest aroused and maintained by specialists in the leading 
universities has naturally extended to the great body of teachers, many 
of whom have pursued courses of psychology in the universities, and 
a still larger number similar courses in normal schools. <As in the 
case of other movements affecting education, the strength of this, which 
had been silently developing for some time, was first signally mani- 
fested at Chicago. Noneof the department congresses held during the 
memorable suinmer of 1893 had larger or more enthusiastic audiences 
than the psychological. As regards numbers, at least, this was particu, 
larly true of the department congress of experimental psychology in 
education under the presidency of Dr. G. Stanley Hall. As to Dr. 
Hall, more than to anyone else, is due the credit of having aroused 
teachers to a sense of the value of this subject as a part of their pro- 
fessional equipment, it is natural that they should follow particularly 
the directions in which he has led. In one of these directions, namely; 
the systematic observation of children, the cooperation of teachers is

  426 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
helpful; indeed it may be said indispensable. By his efforts to secure 
this community of work, Dr. Hall has called into existence a national 
association for child study; this in turn has given rise to local or State 
societies, by means of which exact direction may be given to the work 
of individual observers or groups of observers. 
In New York a division of child study has been created in the 
department of public instruction under the direction of Prof. Charles 
H. Thurber, A. M., of Colgate University. Blank forms are issued to 
teachers by the use of which systematic records may be kept of their 
observations upon children. Bulletins are also issued containing gen- 
eral directions and useful hints for the work, with accounts of individ- 
ual studies, bibliographies, ete. 
The Iowa society for child study was formed at the meeting of the 
State teachers’ association held in Des Moines, December, 1894. 
An account of the initial meeting of this society will be found among 
the papers appended. 
The Mlinois society for child study, formed this year (1894), has had 
phenomenal growth. Comprising as it does teachers, parents, kinder- 
gartners, physicians, specialists in neurology, psychology, and physi- 
ology, the society typifies the reciprocal relations of all those whose 
work concerns the welfare of children. 
The Child Study Monthly, the first number of which has just 
appeared (May, 1895), will undoubtedly prove a valuable auxiliary to 
the work. It is edited by Dr. W. O. Krohn, assistant professor of 
psychology in the Illinois University. 
Dr. Hall, whose interest in the subject never flags, has added to the 
many helpful suggestions for teachers and parents previously issued a 
series of syllabi for child study. These cover fifteen topics, including 
emotions, as anger, love of animals; emotional expression, erying, 
laughing, habits, experiences, etc. It is interesting to note in this con- 
nection that Dr. James Sully, of London, following the American prec- 
edent, asks the cooperation of parents and teachers in collecting facts 
that bear on the characteristics of the childish mind. What he espe- 
cially desires is first-hand observations carried out on children during 
the first five or six years of life. The points to which observation is 
particularly directed are grouped under specific heads, as fancy, self: 
feeling, ete. 
There are certain evils incident to an exaggerated interest in child 
psychology that have not escaped the attention of leaders of this 
movement. Childhood is but a fragment of a great whole; considered 
by itself, the incidental and unimportant may be unduly exaggerated, 
moreover adult life alone furnishes the interpretation of many phenom- 
ena of the developing mind. It is to be remembered, also, that the 
value of observation depends largely upon certain qualities in the 
observer that mark the specialist. These are not characteristic of 
the great body of teachers, and in so far as close observation tends to
-P-A-G-E-475
  THE PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIVAL. 427 
the suppression of the personal element or “equation,” to speak technic- 
ally, it is not desirable that they should be. Free, spontaneous action 
of thought and feeling is a power in human intercourse and of great 
consequence when the purpose of the intercourse is the stimulation of 
thought and feeling. The observing attitude and the stimulating 
activity of mind are in a measure opposed to each other. It should be 
considered, also, that many of the investigations in progress require for 
their best results the use of instruments of precision; in other words, 
they belong to the laboratory. These considerations indicate the ulti- 
mate unity of all psycholegical study, whether its method be that of 
observation, of laboratory research, or of introspection. Only when 
the various results are correlated can their true value be determined. 
This idea of unity is emphasized by Dr. Alexander Bain in a discus- 
sion of the respective spheres and mutual helps of introspection and 
psycho-physical experiments in psychology. (Mind, January, 1893, 
42-53.) 
In the introduction he says: 
The resources at our disposal in imparting to psychology a scientific character 
are now numerous. At the head must still remain introspection, or the self- 
consciousness of each individual working apart. This is the method principally 
employed since the first beginnings of the science in Greek philosophy. It does not 
exclude and never has excluded (as we see in Aristotle) references to objective 
facts and appearances, deriving from thence a great addition both of insight and of 
certainty. 
In the enumeration of means now available for the study are included observa- 
tions (and experiments) directed upon infants, upon abnormal and exceptional 
minds, upon animals, and upon the workings of society, or collective humanity. 
To these are added physiology, and, last but not least, psycho-physical experiments.’ 
He concludes as follows: 
By the nature of the case the initiative, in the more fruitful lines of inquiry, 
will be most frequently taken by introspection, which also, by its powers of analy- 
sis, will still open the path to the highest generalities of our science. 
The mutual dependence of laboratory work and schoolroom obser- 
vation is dwelt upon by Prof. W. L. Bryan, of the University of 
Indiana, in an article on “Child study, systematic and unsystematic,” 
citations from which are given among the papers appended. 
The most important contributions that the “new psychology” bas 
made to our knowledge of mental phenomena have come from labora- 
tory investigation into the structure and functionings of the nervous 
system. Jor this work our country has unsurpassed facilities, a fea- 
ture which is dwelt upon in all foreign accounts of our university equip- 
ment. In many of the leading universities systematic studies in child 
life are also carried on pari passu with the laboratory work. The 
reputation of the professors who lead in this matter, not less than the 
appliances which are at their disposal, augurs well for the outcome. 
Particular instances will serve better than general statements to show 
the plane upon which this department of study is placed. For example,
-P-A-G-E-476
428 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
at Columbia College Prof. J. M. Cattell conducts the department of 
experimental psychology. The catalogue for 1894-95 gives the follow- 
ing particulars as to the laboratory equipment: 
The psychological laboratory is situated on the fourth floor of the building known 
as the president’s house, and consists of a lecture room and general laboratory, and 
three smaller rooms for special research, including a dark room for work on vision. 
The small rooms allow students to work alone and without interruption at all hours 
during the day. The laboratory has windows to the north, east, south, and west, 
and is supplied with electric light for experimental purposes and electric power. 
‘The collection of psychological apparatus is, perhaps, not surpassed by any in this 
country or in Europe. Three thousand five hundred dollars have recently been 
appropriated for this collection by the trustees of the college, and, in addition, appa- 
ratus which cost $1,200 is in use. The apparatus has been secured with a view to a 
series of experiments such as is carried out by the students attending the introduc- 
tory course, and with a view to special researches. 
The exceptionally fine collection of apparatus belonging to the department of 
physiology is also available for the use of students in this department. 
Students of education have opportunity for the personal observation 
of children in the Horace Mann School, maintained by the Teachers’ 
College as a model practice school. 
At Clark University the president, Dr. G. Stanley Hall, is also pro- 
fessor of psychology. He is ably seconded by the assistant professor, 
Dr. E. ©. Sanford, and by the professor of physiology and neurology, 
Dr. ©. F. Hodge. The fellowships in psychology bring to their aid a 
company of trained specialists. The course in education is kept in 
close relation with that in psychology and anthropology, and in part is 
based on them. It need hardly be added that child study is a promi- 
nent feature of this course. 
At Yale University the subject of physiological and experimental 
psychology is in charge of Dr. E. W. Scripture. The course, which is 
very elaborate, includes on the educational side ‘Child study on a 
scientific basis.” The similar department at Harvard is under the 
conduct of Dr. Hugo Miinsterberg. The course in experimental 
psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, in charge of Prof. L. 
Witmer, includes— Hours per week, 
      
    1. Systematic course in experimental psychology 14 
2. Special topics for class experimentation .. 14 
3. Seminary for the study of child psychology - 1}

At Princeton the course of mental philosophy includes experimental 
psychology. The laboratory for this class of investigations, founded 
at the beginning of the academic year 1893-94, is equipped “ with the 
standard pieces of apparatus for demonstration and research, together 
with illustrative models and charts.” The work is in charge of Dr. J. 
Mark Baldwin, whose contributions to the literature of psychology are 
well known. . 
The foundation of the Susan Linn Sage School of Philosophy secured 
to Cornell University ample facilities for psychological research. In

the instruction of this department all sides of philosophy are repre- 
sented. Furthermore, as stated in the announcement of the school, 
Every method of discovering truth—observation, experiment, historical investiga- 
tion, reflection, and speculation—is welcomed within its appropriate domain. 
* The apparatus for the psychological laboratory was made in Germany under the 
personal supervision of the professor, There is already a full equipment in some of 
the most important lines, and additions will be continually made as required. AIL 
the philosophical journals published both at home and abroad are taken. The 
library is also well supplied with philosophical works, and books not on hand are 
ordered as soon as called for. In the new library building there is a large seminary 
room set apart for the exclusive use of advanced students in philosophy. This room | 
contains complete sets of the more important philosophical journals—American, 
English, French, and German—and a carefully selected collection (which is being 
constantly enlarged) of books necessary for special study and independent research. 
Another room in the library building has been assigned to the school as an editorial 
room for The Philosophical Review. This Review marks another function of the 
school, namely, the publishing of the results of investigation. It appears once in 
two months, each number containing from 112 to 128 pages. A large part of the 
material of the Review is contributed by the professors, fellows, and graduates in 
the Sage School of Philosophy. 
  Dr. E. B. Titchener is professor of psychology, with direction of the 
laboratory. 
The principal universities of the Western States are fully in line 
with this movement. At Michigan University, psychology, under Pro- 
fessor Mead, is kept in close relations with philosophy, under Dr. John 
Dewey.! At Illinois University elaborate courses in psychology are 
conducted by Prof. W. O. Krohn, Ph. D.; at Wisconsin University by 
Dr. Joseph Jastrow, whose researches have thrown great light upon 
the whole province of child study and of race psychology. 
At the Indiana University Dr. W. L. Bryan, professor of philosophy, 
maintains also courses in psychology. The laboratory for experimental 
psychology, established in 1888, has recently been enlarged and sup- 
plied with new apparatus. Educational psychology forms a special 
feature of the department of pedagogics. 
At the University of California a graduate seminary for the system- 
atic study of child life is maintained in the department of pedagogy, 
under the immediate charge of Dr. BH. E. Brown. Professor Bailey 
also lectures on the biological aspects of education. 
The more recent foundations—i. e., University of Chicago and Leland 
Stanford Junior University—have also made large provision for psy- 
chology, both rational and experimental, At the latter institution a 
vigorous work in child study and anthropological psychology is main- 
tained under the conduct of Prof. Earl Barnes. 
In the colleges exclusively for women similar courses are offered. 
At Wellesley general and advanced courses are maintained by Dr. 
Miles and Prof. Mary W. Calkins. At Bryn Mawr psychology is coor- 
!Dr. John Dewey having accepted a call to Chicago University, his relation with 
Michigan University ceased with the close of the scholastic year 1893-94.

dinated with logic and philosophy under the direction of Dr. D. 8. 
Miller. All the main divisions of psychology are treated “by lectures, 
illustrative demonstrations, reports of abnormal cases, and discus- 
sion.” Randolph-Macon Woman’s College announces courses of psy- 
chology, theoretical and experimental, in connection with pedagogy. 
The classification and scope of these university courses is very clearly © 
set forth in a recent article by Dr. G. Stanley Hall, citations from 
which will be found among the appended papers. 
Not the least important outcome of the present interest in psychology 
_is the relation it has established between university professors, teach- 
ers of secondary and elementary schools, and school officials. Teachers 
and supervisors are not likely to lose sight of the practical bearings of 
the subject upon their professional work. On the other hand, univer- 
sity men will naturally keep in mind the wider relations of the subject. 
This relativeness is incidentally suggested in many of the inquiry 
schemes and study directions issued for the work, the bearing given 
being generally scientific rather than philosophical. Thus a scheme 
for the study of temperament gives hints of the theory current among 
anthropologists that the key to racial vigor is to be found in the skull 
formations (long heads versus broad heads). Some understanding of 
this theory,! of the arguments for and against it, would be helpful, if 
not indispensable, in the mere act of recording data. Thus the natural 
outcome of the teacher’s interest in a specific line of observation would 
be a wider range of reading and clearer understanding of his own par- 
ticular field of inquiry. It is noticeable that in university circles the 
new psychology is kept in close relation with the old; investigation 
into the effects of mental phenomena as manifested in the action of 
muscles and nerves redoubles interest in the introspective view. Asa 
natural result the past few years have seen notable contributions to the 
literature of rational psychology. 
The educational bearing of psychology has long been a fruitful subject 
of study in normal schools and in the pedagogical department of uni- 
versities. The question now arises as to what practical results, what 
guiding principles applicable to school work have arisen from the new 
psychology. These questions are discussed directly or indirectly in the 
papers on this division of the subject appended. It may be well to 
note here a few principles that are ‘listinctly recognized by those who 
lead in the matter. 
Dr. Hall has repeatedly called attention to the periods of physical 
growth and their relation to mental growth or activity. 
It has been found that children grow tall in spring and stocky in fall; further, 
that different parts of the body have different periods of best growth. Times of 
physical growth are also times of mental growth in acquisition, though children 
then are not able to systematize well. Hence, in time of great acquisition ease up 
the constraint of methods. 
For a valuable discussion of the pros and cons of the theory referred to see La 
Psychologie des Penples et L’Anthropologie, by Alfred Fouillée. Revue des Deux 
Mondes, March 15, 1895, pp. 365-396.

    THE PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIVAL. 431 
Dr. Hall warns us also against applying the methods suggested by 
the study of defective or abnormal children to the instruction of the 
average child. He would rather “Jet the bright children set the pace.” 
He adds: 
An experiment was made a few years ago in Paris which showed that methods 
adapted for bright children enabled a class of average boys to complete the six years, 
course of the lycée in a little over two and one-half years, although no extra time 
was given. By such means I am confident we can work twice as fast with the 
brighter half of our classes. This is not theory; I have tried it. 
Dr. Hall, Dr. Burnham, of Clark University, and other investigators 
in this province lay stress on three principles derived from the observa- 
tion of the formative development of the body. Says Dr. Burnham: 
The first pedagogical principle settled beyond controversy by this broad study 
of children is that no development is possible without the fanctioning of the nerv- 
ous system. * * * It follows that the laws which express the development and 
activity of the nervous mechanism must determine pedagogical principles. 
Among these laws one of prime importance is the following: The fundamental is 
developed before the accessory. * * * This law of the child’s nervous system is 
the basis of a most importanteducational principle. First the fundamental, then the 
accessory. This applies not only to the various forms of motor training, manual 
training, gymnastics, and the like, but, in general, first a strong healthy develop- 
ment of the fundamental nervous processes is necessary, then may follow more deli- 
cate and complex acquisitions. A reversal of this order, the imposition of delicate, 
subtle, and complex occupations in the kindergarten or primary schools, may please 
parents and committees, but it is contrary to a law written in the child’s nerve 
centers. 
Again, all parts of the body do not develop at the same time. Each organ has its 
peculiar nascent period. Moreover there is a close relation between the function of 
any organ and its development, and the highest degree of skill in the use of an 
organ can often be acquired only during the period of growth. 
The acquisition of language, for example, is probably a case in point. If, during 
the period the vocal organs and the corresponding nerve centers in the brain are 
developing, attention is given to educating some other part which is not ready for 
training, twofold loss is likely to be the result—waste of energy or injury in caso 
of the latter, loss of opportunity in case of the former. So, too, if manual training 
be neglected in early life, during the nascent period of the motor centers, great 
skill can seldom be attained afterwards. 
Corresponding to the nascent periods of the motor organs are the periods of inter- 
est in the child’s mental growth. This year your boy has the collecting mania; 
next year it will be baseball or the secret language; a third year it will be the debat- 
ing society, or he may be hunting and stuffing birds and snakes. These interests 
are sacred. Some of them should be turned into new channels, others should be 
made permanent as a part of character. But in all cases the time of interest is the 
time of opportunity, and here opportunity seldom comes twice. Special studies 
have shown the sequence of children’s interests. 
The importance of a due understanding of the symptoms and effects 
of fatigue is generally recognized. Dr. W.O. Krohn states the matter 
concisely as follows: 
Some of us know, and evory teacher should know, that the degree of fatigue varies 
with the condition of mind and body. Thus the child tires sooner when the work 
is distasteful or when the organs are unhealthy or when poorly nourished, and the 
body seems wearied quicker when the mind is tired and the mind more quickly 
 
-P-A-G-E-480
  4382 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94, 
when the body is tired. The child tires more easily at one season than at another. 
The condition of the atmosphere, the weather, the time of day, all these affect 
normal power of endurance. Also rapid growth diminishes one’s power of endur- 
ance. Thechild that has grown up quickly tires easily. Fatigue causes the child’s 
mind to be less sensitive to interest or novelty. Also one order of studies fatigues 
the child more than another order of studies would. 
Itis obvious that whatever modifications are justified by the dis- 
coveries of the new psychology, they should not be left to hazard nor 
to the isolated action of individuals. The principles so far deduced 
have to do with pathology and neurology rather than with mental con- 
ditions in themselves considered; hence these principles reenforce the 
demand for the medical inspection of schools and school children. It 
is significant that this is exactly the result attained in Boston through 
the efforts of Dr. E. M. Hartwell, director of psychical training. Dr. 
Hartwell has approached the subject from the physiological stand- 
point, but with due appreciation of the psychical standpoint. In sup- 
port of this statement, it is enough to refer to his discussions of the 
interrelation of mental, moral, and physical training in his report to the 
Boston school board for 1894, The report is a notable contribution to 
the vital statistics of the country, embodying the results of the most 
careful study that has yet been made as to the bearings of school 
life upon the health of school children. The extracts from this report 
included among the papers appended reiterate in an effective manner 
the very conclusions reached by specialists in psycho-physics. 
Looking back over the history of the psychological awakening, it is 
perhaps no exaggeration to say that next to the initial impulse the 
most important incident of the movement is the recent return to the 
idea of unity. 
The tendency in this direction is illustrated in the exercises at the 
annual meeting of the Massachusetts Schoolmasters’ Club, the report 
of which is received just as this survey goes to press. The theme 
treated was psychology, and representative men had been invited to 
present their views on the relations of the old to the new pyschology. 
Dr. Larkin Dunton, of the Boston Normal School, presented briefly 
the conception of mind and of its operations with which the students 
of the old psychology are familiar and emphasized particularly their 
applications to the teacher’s work. The addresses of Dr. Harris and 
Dr. Miinsterberg which are given here in full covered the double 
aspect of the subject. Unfortunately Dr. Hall’s contribution to the 
discussion was not reduced to writing and hence was only preserved 
in a very fragmentary form.

    THE PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIVAL 433 
THE OLD PSYCHOLOGY v. THE NEW. 
By W. T. Harris, LL. D., United States Commissioner of Education. 
[Delivered at the Massachusetts Schoolmasters’ Club, April 25, 1895.] 
I understand it to be the intention of those who proposed this ques- 
tion for discussion to include under the term “new psychology” only 
two classes of investigation, namely, what is known as “ physiological 
psychology,” dating from the discovery of Broca in 1861, and what is 
known as “child study,” including the researches of Professor Preyer 
and of Dr. Stanley Hall, their coworkers and disciples. 
All other studies of mind, from ancient times to the present time, 
whether based on induction or deduction, whether a priori, as rational 
psychology, or a posteriori, as empirical psychology, should be called 
the “old psychology.” It seems to me that both of those psychologies 
are of immense importance; that neither is a substitute for the other 
or to be neglected by the teacher who wishes to know scientifically the 
mind that he is supposed to educate. For I must hold that there is a 
constitution of the mind common to all rational beings—a rational 
nature which may be discovered by introspection and distinguished 
from the transient and variable characteristics which are determined 
in large manner by environment and conditions of development. 
I would name as by far the most important knowledge from this 
source the distinction of the soul into several stages, as that mani- 
fested in plant life, called by Aristotlethe nutritive or vegetable soul; 
the soul as active in sensation and locomotion, or the animal soul; the 
rational soul manifested in imagination, memory, reflection, and in pure 
thought. The distinctions of active and passive reason made by Aris- 
totle in his famous treaties on the soul, and so often rediscovered or 
verified by profound thinkers in the history of philosophy, is the prin- 
ciple of this classification of soul-activities. On it is founded the 
philosophical doctrine of the immortality of the soul. In fact, not only 
the doctrine of immortality, but also the doctrines of theism and the 
freedom of the will are based on this rock of the old psychology, devel- 
oped by Aristotle out of the hints of Plato or Socrates. God, freedom, 
and immortality are the three good gifts of philosophy, according to 
Novalis. They are all derived from the insight that finds in pure 
thought the independent self-activity of the soul and sees in it the 
only possible type of being for a first principle of the world—a Crea- 
tor. The idea of self-activity is, moreover, the basal idea of free will. 
The very concept of willis impossible on the basis of empirical think- 
ing. For the understanding, as Coleridge defined it, deals with rela- 
tions between objects, and finds causal relation everywhere, but not 
self-activity or will. It tries to explain each thing through its environ- 
ment, and it never rests until it has traced the phenomena of an object 
to a ground in something else outside. 
ED 94 28    
-P-A-G-E-482
434 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
That the fundamental condition of introspection is the admission of 
this idea of self-activity is evident if we consider that the world of 
self-consciousness contains only feelings, volitions, and ideas. Each 
one of these is twofold, implying subject and object. There are two 
poles toeach. Feeling is nothing unless it has a subject that feels and 
unless the self that feels is the object of the feeling. So volition 
implies a self that acts, and, moreover, a determination or limitation 
of the subject issuing in an objective deed; a volition has the twofold 
aspect of subject and object. So, too, an idea is always thought as a 
determination of the self which thinks it or defines it—it is conceived 
by the mind; it, too, involves subject and object. 
Now, by no possibility can external observation discover any such 
twofold objects in space and time. All objects are dead results or in a 
process of becoming so through some external cause. If we discrimi- 
nate dead objects from living objects, and recognize plants, animals, — 
and men before us, we do it because we interpret the forms, shapes, and 
movements before us as indicative of a self-determining soul within the 
object. We transfer to the object by an act of inference an internality 
of life, feeling, volition, or thought such as we know directly only by 
introspection, and can only know thus. 
To expand this theme, one would show the importance of these dis- 
tinctions of Aristotle, Aquinas, and Leibnitz in making an account of 
the spiritual life of man, an inventorying the principles of his civiliza 
tion and making clear and consistent his views of the world. 
- To live is one thing, but to give a rational and consistent account of 
one’s life is a different and difficult matter. The old psychology suc- 
ceeded in doing this by these fundamental distinctions, and all-new 
attempts at psychology either prove abortive, or else soon fall into line 
with the old psychology, so far as these essentials are concerned—they 
end in affirming self-activity as more substantial than material things 
and in the admission of various grades of realization of this self- 
activity or soul. 
Another very important step in this recognition of the contents of 
self-consciousness which the German thinkers have added to the old 
psychology is the recognition of the characteristic of universality and 
necessity as the criterion of what is in the constitution of mind itself, 
as contradistinguished from experience or empirical content. By this, 
time and space, the categories of quality and quantity, the laws of 
causality, identity, and excluded middle, the ideas of ‘self-activity, 
moral responsibility, and religion, all transcend experience, and are 
formed by introspection. 
It is their application which constitutes experience, and experience 
would be impossible unless the mind had in itself these powers a 
priori, for these powers make experience possible. If we could not 
furnish the intuitions of infinite space and time, we could not perceive 
objects of experience, nor, unless we could furnish the category of 
causality could we refer our sensations to objects as causes.
-P-A-G-E-483
  THE PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIVAL. 435 
Universal and necessary ideas are furnished by the mind itself and 
not derived from experience, although our consciousness of them may 
date from our application of them to the content of experience. 
Formal logic, with its judgments and syllogisms, its figures and 
moods, should be regarded also as a part of rational psychology in so 
far as it reveals to us the forms of action of thinking reason. 
All these contributions of the old psychology are of priceless value, 
as giving us the means to understand the place we occupy in the uni- 
verse with our ideals of civilization. They furnish us directive power, 
they give us the regulative ideals of education, religion, jurisprudence, 
polities, and the general conduct of life. 
But if the old psychology has furnished these substantial things, it 
has not furnished all that is desirable. 
There is a realm of conditions which must be understocd before 
man can be made to realize his ideals. The product of nature is an 
animal and not a civilized man. How can man react upon nature; 
how can he ascend out of his own natural condition; how can he rise 
from the stage of sense perception to that of reflection; how from mere 
reflection to mere thought; how can he put off his state of slavery to 
the category of thing and environment and rise to the category of self- 
activity? This is to ask how he can ascend from a mechanical view of 
the world to an ethical view of it. Certainly he must know the bodily 
conditions that limit or enthrall the soul. He must be able to recog- 
nize what activity tends to fix the soul in lower order of thought and 
action and what exercises will tend to lift it to a higher order. 
* To enumerate some of these enthralling conditions through which 
the soul passes necessarily, if it ever comes to the highest, we must 
name the influences and attractions of one’s habitat, its climate and soil, 
its outlook, its means of connection with the rest of the world. Then 
next there is the race and stock of which one comes, black, red, yellow, 
or white—northern or southern European—inheriting all the evil tend- 
encies and all the good aspirations. Then the temperament and 
idiosynerasy of the individual, as his natural talents or his genius— 
how deep these all lie as predetermining causes in his career. If he is 
alone the efficient cause or the free wiil—at least these conditions of 
habitat, race, and stock furnish the material that he is to quarry and 
build into the temple of his life—a parthenon, a pantheon, or only a 
mud hut or a snow house. Then come other natural elements to be 
regarded—those of sex—the seven ages from infancy to senility, the 
physical conditions that belong to sleep and dreams and the waking 
state, the health and disease of the body, the insane tendencies, the 
results of habits in hardening and fixing the life of the individual in 
some lower round of activity. 
OF all these the laws of growth from infancy to mature age especially 
concern the educator,
-P-A-G-E-484
  436 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
There is for man, as contrasted with lower animals, a long period of 
helpless infancy. Prof. John Fiske has shown the importance of this 
fact to the theory of evolution as applied to man. Basing his theory 
on some hints of Wallace and Spencer, he has explained how the differ- 
entiation of the primitive savage man from the animal groups must 
have been accomplished. Where psychical life is complex there is not 
time for all capacities to become organized before birth. The pro- 
Jongation of helpless infancy is required for the development of man’s 
adaptations to the spiritual environment implied in the habits and arts 
and modes of behavior of the social community into which man is born. 
He is born first as an infant body. He must be born second as an 
ethical soul or else he can not become human. The conditions are of 
extreme complexity. This is the most important contribution of the 
doctrine of evolution to education. Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler has 
pointed out that the Greek philosopher Anaximander, more than two 
thousand years ago, spoke of the prolonged period of infancy as a 
reason for believing that in the beginning man had an origin from 
animals of a different species from himself. The Greek did not per- 
ceive the relation of this prolonged infancy to the adjustment of 
the complex physical and spiritual activities of the child to his 
environment. 
In the light of this discovery we may see what an important bearing 
the results of child study and physiological psychology will have on 
education; for is it not evident that if the child is at any epoch of 
his long period of helplessness inured into any habit or fixed form 
of activity belonging to a lower stage of development the tendency 
will be to arrest growth at that standpoint and make it difficult or 
next to impossible to continue the growth of the child into higher and 
more civilized forms of soul activity? A severe drill in mechanical 
habits, of memorizing or calculating, any overcultivation of sense per- 
eeption in tender years, may so arrest the development of the soul at a 
mechanical method of thinking and prevent the further growth into 
spiritual insight. 
Especially on the second plane of thought, that which follows sense 
perception and the mechanical stage of thinking, namely, the stage of 
noticing mere relations and of classifying by mere likeness or differ- 
ence, or even the search for causal relations, there is most danger of 
this arrested development. The absorption of the gaze upon adjust- 
ments within the machine prevents us from seeing the machine as a 
whole. The attention to details of coloring and drawing may prevent 
one from seeing the significance of the great work of art. 
The habit of parsing every sentence that one sees may prevent one 
from enjoying a sonnet of Wordsworth. Too much counting and cal- 
culating may at a tender age set the mind in the mechanical habit of 
looking for mere numerical relations in whatever it sees. Certainly, 
the young savage who is taught to see in nature only the traces that
-P-A-G-E-485
  
  THE PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIVAL. 437 
mark the passage of a wild animal, or perhaps of a warrior foe, has 
stopped his growth of observation at a point not very much above that 
of the hound that hunts by scent. And yet all these mechanical studies 
are necessary in the course of study. They can not be replaced except 
by others equally objectionable in the same aspect. The question is, 
then, where to stop and change to other and higher branches in time 
to preserve the full momentum of progress that the child has made. 
Professor Woodward has pointed out that the educational effect of 
manual training is destroyed by having the pupils work for the market. 
It turns the attention toward the training in skill, and the educational 
effect which comes of first insight is afterwards neglected. The first 
machine made is an education to its maker; the second and subsequent 
machines made are only a matter of habit. To keep the intellect out 
of the abyss of habit, and to make the ethical behavior more and more 
a matter of unquestioning habit, seems to be the desideratum. 
Child study will perhaps find its most profitable field of investigation 
in this matter of arrested development. If it can tell the teacher how 
far to push thoroughness to the borders of mechanical perfection, and 
where to stop just before induration and arrest sets in, it will reform 
all our methods of teaching. And it can and will do this. The new 
psychology, in its two phases of direct physiological study of brain and 
nerves and its observation of child development, will show us how to 
realize by education the ideals of the highest civilization. The pro- 
longed infancy of man will be in less danger of curtailment through 
vicious school methods. 
The orphaned and outcast child becomes precociously worldwise. 
But the school can scarcely reclaim the gamin from the streets of Paris 
or New York. He has become as cunning and self-helpful as the water 
rat, but not in ethical or spiritual methods. He should have been held 
back from the bitter lessons of life by the shielding hand of the family. 
He would then have become a positive influence for civilization 1m its 
height and depth. As a gamin he can live a life only a little above that 
of the water rat, and is good only to feed the fires of revolution. 
THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY. 
By Prof. HUGO MUNSTERBERG. 
[Address before the Massachusetts Schoolmasters’ Club.] 
I wish to thank you heartily for the extreme kindness of your invita- 
tion; but the more I appreciate the honor of this opportunity to speak 
to you the more I am sorry that I can not offer you anything but a 
most informal talk, with most informal use of the English language, 
and, still worse, that every word of it must disappoint your pedagog- 
ical expectations. You asked me, as a psychologist, to tell you how 
important psychology is for the teacher; you ask me, as a physiolog- 
ical psychologist, toe tell you how necessary the study of the brain and
-P-A-G-E-486
438 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
of the nervous system is for the pedagogue; you asked me, as an ex- 
perimental psychologist, to tell you how the educational future will 
depend upon experiments on children; and all that I have to say out of 
my deepest heart is simply, I do not believe in it! 
I do not believe in it, and that overwhelming movement toward 
psychology among the elementary teachers seems to me a high tide of 
confusion and dilettanteism, and the only thing about which I am doubt- 
ful is which of the two necessary results is the worse—the results with 
the superficial teachers or the results with the earnest ones. The 
superficial teachers torture the poor children with experiments and 
deceive themselves with empty phrases about reaction times and psy- 
chophysic laws. The earnest and sincere teachers feel very soon that 
all those woodeuts of pyramidal ganglion cells and pendulum chrono- 
scopes do not help them a bit, and they then become disappointed, lose 
their confidence in their own ability, and try and try again with the 
ganglion cells, till they are tired and till their natural teachers’ instincts 
are scattered and ruined. Call me conservative, call me reactionary, 
eall me ignorant, but Iadhere to my belief, that the individual teacher, 
for his teaching methods, does not need any scientific psychology, and 
that tact and sympathy and interest are more important for him than 
all the twenty-seven psychological laboratories of this country. 
Do I mean, therefore, that psychology is an unimportant study, or 
that the new psychology is wrong compared with the old one? I think 
it is not necessary for me to defend myself against the first supposition. 
I am the director of the large psychological laboratory of Harvard Uni- 
versity. For twelve years I have spent the greatest part of my work- 
ing time in psychological experiments, and most of my publications 
deal with them. Certainly I can not prove more clearly how deeply I, 
for one, believe in the importance of psychology. And with regard to 
the old and the new psychology, I do not recognize such a difference at 
all. Psychology is a careful observation, description, and explanation 
of mental phenomena. Will you say that this careful observation is a 
modern invention? Dear old Aristotle seems to be, then, more up to 
date than many contributors of the latest magazine. Or do you think 
that a careful observation is only possible by experimental methods? 
Are astronomy and geology not exact sciences because their objects can 
not become material for experiment? Of course, the methods of obser- 
vation are steadily improving in psychology, just as in every other 
science, and so it was a great progress when, twenty years ago, the 
methods of observation became improved by the systematic introduc- 
tion of the experiments. To be sure, the experimental method brings a 
degree of exactitude into the observation of mental facts, which is 
related to the observation without experiment, just as the microscop- 
ical study of plants is related to the observation of plants in walking 
through the fields and forests. And, above all, the artificial conditions 
of the experiment reduce the vhenomena to simple schematic forms
-P-A-G-E-487
    
  THE PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIVAL. 439 
which aliow a much better understanding than the complicateu proc- 
esses of the daily life. The naturalist who wishes to study the move- 
ment of the water does not go to the ocean and look out for the waves, 
but he takes a little tank full of water and produces there simple move- 
ments; and if he wishes to study the electric discharges he does not wait 
for a thunderstorm, but produces in his laboratory electric sparks. So 
the psychologist to-day does not study the mental facts, if possible, in 
the chance events of his daily life, but he introduces artificial condi- 
tions to influence the mental facts, and gets in this way sensations 
and perceptions, attention and memory, space judgment and time 
sense, feelings and emotions, reflections and will, and so forth, in the 
simplest schematic form in his laboratory. Certainly that is'a great 
step forward in the careful observation of mental phenomena but it is 
not at all a break with the past. Improvements in the methods of 
careful observation are brought out constantly; with the same right, 
you may call the psychology of last year the old one compared with that 
of to-day, which is the new one only till to-morrow’s new improvements 
are proposed. 
But you will say, perhaps, the old psychology was based on self- 
observation, the new one not. But just that is a mistake—an entire 
mistake. Our experimental work itself is based on self-observation, 
and even the interpretation of the physiological processes is guided by 
self-observation. The so-called old psychology was often enough in 
danger of having its self-observation overwhelmed by the claims of 
arbitrary definitions; the new psychology restored to self-observation 
its full rights. If I had to describe shortly our work in the Harvard 
laboratory, in which now two dozen young investigators devote their 
time to psychological experimental research, I should say: Self-obser- 
vation! to be sure, self-observation under artificial conditions; but, 
above all, self-observation. All those psychological experiments in 
which self-observation is displaced by methods of indirect observation, 
as experiments with hypnotized persons, or with the insane, or with 
babies, or with animals, are excluded from our regular laboratory work, 
and are in any case only accessory parts of experimental psychology. 
All the equipment of our institutes and all the instruments for our 
investigations would be just as useless without self-observation as a 
mnicroscope would be without an eye to look through it. Self-obser- 
vation is, therefore, for the new psychology not less important than for 
the old. 
But, finally, you may say: The old psychology was full of philosoph- 
ical speculations about the soul; the modern keeps to the empirical 
facts only. Well, that is true; but that is only a question of names. 
Those speculations about the mind are still just as important and just 
as necessary to-day as in the old times, only we call them to-day phi- 
losophy, and reserve the name psychology for those problems of the 
older works which had to do with the empirical facts. There is plenty
-P-A-G-E-488
  440 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
of that, too, in the older works. The older works represented, there- 
fore, under che title of psychology, after our modern terminology, psy- 
chology plus philosophy, while the modern is only psychology without 
philosophy, and, I am sorry to say, often enough psychology minus 
philosophy! The modern psychologist is indeed too often proud of the 
fact that the chief thing which he has added to the old psychology is 
that he has no philosophy. It reminds me of an educational experience 
Thad in the West. I visited an extremely poor university, and asked 
the president why they called themselves so proudly a university, as 
the institute of the neighboring town was called only a college. “Oh,” 
he answered, “we have much more than they have!” “What have 
you more?” I asked; “have you a graduate school?” “No!” “Have 
you a law school?” “No!” “Have you a medical school?” “No!” 
“But what have you, then, more than the others?” ‘We have no pre- 
paratory school!” 
1 think our modern nomenclature is right. Philosophy of the mind 
has nothing to de in text-books of psychology, just as philosophy of | 
nature does not come into the text-books of physics. Physics and psy- 
chology confine themselves better to the physical and psychological 
special facts, and take for granted all those general presuppositions 
_which are necessary for the belief in the existence of those facts. But 
all the more is it indispensable that another doctrine—we may call it 
philosophy or epistemology—should examine and criticise just these 
presuppositions. Physics has to presuppose that the pysical facts go 
on in space and time and matter; philosophy has to study how far we 
have the right to take space and time and matter as real. And the 
same is true with the presuppositions of psychology. A philosophy of 
the mind is just as important a supplement of psychology to-day as it 
was in the past, and, therefore, here also there is no sharp limit between 
old and new. 
But, old or new, what has psychology to do with the teacher? I 
think in three directions very much indeed. At first, and above all, a 
teacher is a man of broad interests, and, like every educated man, he 
ought to know about such an important side of human knowledge. As 
he is interested in plants, and stones, and stars, how much more must 
he be interested in the laws of mental life? Broad education has no 
more inspiring subject, and no subject which is more nearly connected 
with the theoretical understanding of the social world in which we live 
and of which we are a part. Secondly, the teacher ought to be able to 
teach psychology. I believe that the order and lawfulness of mental 
life can not be brought early enough before intelligent pupils. Of 
course, I do not mean the details of modern specialistic investigations, 
but the chief facts of seeing and hearing, attention and memory, per- 
ception and imagination, feeling and will, dreams and illusions, could 
become an extremely important and suggestive part of the school 
education, not as a special branch of the school curriculum, but sprin-

kled into the whole school work. The reading lesson and the drawing 
lesson, history and literature, physics and geometry offer endless oppor- 
tunities for a good teacher. I wish that every boy who tries at home 
to-day his little electrical or chemical experiments would try in future, 
also, the elementary experiences of experimental psychology, perhaps 
tactual or acoustical experiments, or optical illusions or associations. 
And, thirdly, the teacher who is a careful observer may furnish to the 
psychologist valuable material by the continual observation of children. 
The extremely interesting and important collections of such material 
which my friend, President G. Stanley Hall, has brought together, give 
the best and most encouraging illustration of such cooperative work. 
The teacher has so many chances to see events in the child’s mind 
which would escape the official psychologist if he could not rely on the 
teacher’s help, just as the biologist collects the reports of hunters, who 
have chances for observation which the biologist in his laboratory 
never can have. In special cases the teacher may introduce even sim- 
ple experiments to bring out more details about his material. But I 
add this with some hesitation, as I know how extremely difficult it is 
to bring out, especially with poor instruments, and in a schoolroom, 
really reliable material from experiments on children, and unreliable 
results are, of course, worse than no results at all, as they push forward 
misleading conclusions. Above all, it seems to me that the facts of the 
undeveloped mind which can be brought out by experiments do not 
throw so much light on the psychological processes and laws as the 
observation of the natural development itself and of the experiences 
under natural conditions. The development in the child of imitation, 
of language, of will, of emotions, of the idea of personality, etc., are, for 
the student of psy aielog ZY, mon more important than any results of 
experiments in classes which teachers could do. But, in any case, I 
repeat the teacher can supply the psychologist with valuable and inter- 
esting material. 
To be sure, these three points I have mentioned are very important 
points of contact between the work of the psychologist and the func- 
tions of the teacher, but I can not see that point of contact which the 
world emphasizes: I can not see that the modern psychology can help 
the teacher in his teaching profession, and there is the point of my 
disagreement. 
My first objection results from the necessary narrow limitation of the 
psychological knowledge which the average teacher can get. He gets 
bits and ends, and I am sure if he relies on them and transforms them 
into practical applications after his own prescription, the outcome must 
be harm and confusion. A physician who knows about one inner organ 
only,and treats it without regard to all the other parts of the organism, 
isa dangerous quack. But our mind is certainly still more a unity, and 
is not divided into chapters, like a text-book of psychology. Every 
special mental function exists in its isolation only as an abstraction;
-P-A-G-E-490
  442 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
the totality is the reality. And this situation becomes the more 
dangerous the greater the tendency is, under the influence of this 
newest fad for most modern psychology, to give the attention either 
to the emptiest generalities or to the most specialistic details which 
have not even an indirect bearing on that which could be important 
for the teacher. I see it again and again; the women come into my 
laboratory and ask, casually, either, ‘‘ Doctor, do you think that we 
have a soul?” or they ask me to show them the electrical details of a 
chronoscope for measuring the time of mental acts in thousandths 
of a second. They may have seen a woodcut of it in the last Sunday 
paper, or have read of it in the last illustrated magazine, and as they 
wish to be “modern” teachers they must know all about it. They 
come and look around, listen to the rattling of some instruments, and 
go away after half an hour, assuring me that they have learned very 
much indeed, and, what is worse, they really believe it. If a scientitic 
pedagogue takes as theoretical study the problem how to get from the 
modern psychology suggestions for the methods of teaching, all right; 
his results may be useful hints for the teacher, but the individual 
teacher who has picked up no more psychology than the few crumbs 
which have fallen from the table, and thinks that his own psychological 
studies can control his teaching, is misguided. 
But I go further. Even for the scientific student of pedagogics, 
whose profession it is to look out for educational suggestions, even for 
him, the outcome of experimental and physiological psychology is 
relatively still small, because psychology itself knows still too little. 
It is often said that psychology is to-day in a state in which physics 
was in the sixteenth century. Does not that in itself suggest modesty? 
And the necessary characteristics of a science in so early a stage is 
the quick change of opinions. A famous physiologist said once that 
he got secretly the statistical result; that every important new physio- 
logical discovery has an average life of four years. It seems to me 
that the new discoveries in modern psychology have often an existence 
of only four months. That is no opprobrium; just the contrary. For 
the development of a science it is the most healthful state when many 
new ideas grow up as working hypotheses, with provisional character; 
they help to find new facts, but the new facts demand a change of the 
ideas, and so every discovery is only a new step, which is left as soon 
as possible for the next step. That is a splendid state for psychology, 
but it is no state in which practical conclusions from such new discov- 
eries can upset the mature experience of good teachers. 
But it seems to me, if I speak sincerely, that all arguments in opposi- 
tion of this kind, the arguments of the narrow limitation of individual 
knowledge and of the narrow limitation of psychology itself, do not 
touch more than the surface of the problem. There is another and 
deeper point, which is to me far more important, and which is the real 
motive of my unmodern attitude. I cannot hope to bring it out ina
-P-A-G-E-491
  
  THE PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIVAL. 443 
convincing way in such a short talk, but I must show at least the direc- 
tion in which it lies. 
To be sure, all phenomena of the world are physical or psychical; the 
physical ones are described in physics and chemistry, the psychical 
ones in psychology, and there can not be a phenomenon which is, as 
such, not an object for physics or psychology. But it seems to me the 
mistake of our time—more than that, the disease of our time—to believe 
that the full reality can be understood asa phenomenon. The world is 
a series of physical and psychological phenomena, if we think of it as 
an object of perception, outer and inner perception; but the personality 
is not only a perceiving subject; it is, above all, a willing subject, and 
the object of this subject is, therefore, not only a world of phenomena, 
put a world of objects of the will; that is, a world of values, of appre- 
ciation, of duties. The world of phenomena is causal, the world of 
values is teleological; the one is atomistic, the other seeks the reality, 
not in the parts, but in the unity of the whole; the one is the world of 
physical and psychical laws, the other is a world of freedom; in the 
one everything exists for itself, in the other all reality is given by its 
relation to us. And this world of freedom is the primary, as it is a free 
act itself to think of the world as an unfree world in the categories of 
phenomena, and the world appears as existing phenomenon only if we 
think the objects of our will independent of our will, and cut loose from 
it. When I talk to you, to be sure, you can take it as a series of phe- 
nomena. Physical phenomena are the nervous processes in me, and 
the air vibrations which go to your ears, and the nervous processes in 
you; and the psychical phenomena are the psychical elements which 
are together in this moment in my consciousness and the contents of 
your consciousness; but if we describe all these physical and psychical 
phenomena, even in the most exact way, we describe the experience of 
this moment in terms which have nothing to do with that reality which 
really interests you and me. My words may interest the physicist and 
psychologist as phenomena; for you and me they do not belong to the 
world of phenomena, because we have not cut them loose in this moment 
from our will; a responsible free personality expresses its intentions and 
its convictions to other free personalities. We donot care how all this 
appears to a perceiving personality; we ask only what it is to willing 
personalities and what it is to them, is just as much reality, and even 
more than all that it is to the perceiving subject; that is, as phe- 
nomenon. When I speak I do not think about the phenomena which 
are going on in me, in you, in the air; I do not think of them, and the 
thought of them would not help me. If I should think of them I 
could not speak at all. I do not produce sounds and, indirectly, asso- 
ciations by psychophysic laws, but I express a meaning to judging 
personalities; organisms underlie the laws of physics and psychology; 
personalities obey the laws of logics and ethics, and the relation 
between teacher and pupils has not to be thought of as a relation of 
psychophysical organisms, but as a relation of free personalities.
-P-A-G-E-492
444 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
To be sure, our time is full of that confusion everywhere. The ideas 
of law and responsibility get mixed with the psychophysical concep- 
tions of anthropological criminology, the political and economical and 
social ideals are controlled by ideas about phenomena after the scheme 
of social physiology; we hear even that philosophy has to be looked on 
from an anthropological point of view, and now comes pedagogics and 
wishes to become a part of physiological psychology! Not one of you 
doubts that I have a serious interest in psychological observation and 
experiments. I have at home two little children, but I have never 
made a single experiment on them. Not because I think it harmful 
for them, not at all; I should not say anything against it if other 
psychologists should like to make little experiments on my children. 
More than that, I do not even observe them from a psychological 
point of view, which would be certainly harmless for them. I do not 
do it, and I may say freely I can not do it, because the reality of those 
two children is for me, not their existence as a series of psychological 
phenomena, and they are no phenomena for me, because I can not cut 
them loose from my will, from my attitude, from my personality. They 
are for me not phenomena, not objects of perception, but values; 
objects of my will, of my love, of my duty. You may artificially train 
yourself to fluctuate between the two attitudes, and observe in one 
moment what you loved in the moment before, but the one will always 
interfere with the other; to acknowledge the existence of a phenom- 
enon means just to be convinced that it is independent of our attitude. 
I wish that the teachers may not give up so easily their attitude of 
willing subjects, and may not go over so easily to the position of per- 
ceiving subjects; that they may love their pupils instead of observing 
them, and that they may not hunt for bits and ends of psychology, and 
lose over it the responsible personality. 
If I were a professor of chemistry or mineralogy, and an artist, a 
sculptor, came to me and told me that he wished to create a marble 
statue, and that he came to study chemistry and mineralogy because 
marble is a stone and a chemical substance, what would I tell him? I 
should say: ‘Dear friend, chemistry is an extremely important science, 
and you may study it as an educated man, but as an artist you have 
nothing to do with it. To be sure, you must have a general idea of the 
marble, and of its difference from clay or plaster, but a real, exact, 
chemical study of the marble as substance in the laboratory is not your 
business. If you wish to create your work of art, ask Phidias and 
Michael Angelo, and, above all, ask your own genius.” I think the 
teacher is an artist, too, who has to create his ideal of an educated 
personality out of the material which the psychologist studies. Butif 
he comes to me as a psychologist, I must say to him, too, psychology 
is a very important study, take part in it as a man of broad interests, 
but as a teacher let it go—it is not your business. If you wish to go 
to work, ask your Phidiases, ask your Michael Angelos, and, above all, 
ask your own genius, ask your own conscience, ask your own heart.

THE PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIVAL. 445 
PSYCHOLOGY IN UNIVERSITIES. 
{In his article on the new psychology as a basis of education, which 
appeared in the Forum for August, 1894, Dr. G. Stanley Hall, after 
sketching the development of logic, ethics, and the history of philosophy 
as subjects in the college course, gives the following account of the 
later development of courses in psychology.—Ed. | 
The fourth and last movement began in this country at the Johns 
Hopkins University only thirteen years ago, when the first chair of ex- 
perimental psychology was established. The beginning was extremely 
modest, and with a less bold and sagacious leadership of that univer- 
sity might perhaps to this day never have been made. The history of 
this departure shows, better than any other I know of, one of the best 
sides of our American institutions, viz, readiness to recognize a good 
thing when seen and to adopt it. Although the second American chair 
in this department has not been established ten years, an American 
association of between two and three score instructors is now nearly 
two years old. Instead of the first lack of text-books, there is now 
almost an excess of them; and transforming effects in this oldest and 
most conservative department are incalculable. Two journals, one 
founded in 1887, and the other in 1894, are devoted exclusively, and 
eight or ten others partially, to this work. A score of psycho-physic 
laboratories, with more men and apparatus than can be found in all 
Europe combined, and with a reputable output of original work, are 
now in operation. A glance at the chief fields, now cultivated by a 
complete university department of psychology, will show how trans- 
forming for other philosophical disciplines, how all-conditioning for 
education, and how full of promise for religion this regenerate “science 
of man” is now fast becoming. 
I. First came the laboratory or experimental work. Perhaps in no 
department will a very little money do so much, as a few even of the 
normal schools have lately found out to their great benefit. Experi- 
ments on the senses, motion, time of psychic actions, fatigue, pain, 
rhythm, etc., now take most of the vital problems of perception, associa- 
tion, attention, and will, into the laboratory; they quadruple the power 
of introspection while obviating all its dangers; they shed new light 
in many dark corners, and they have already reconstructed many old 
doctrines. Dr. Sanford is embodying the results of this development 
in a course of about three hundred and fifty experiments hardly less 
valuable for logic than psychology. 
In the modern laboratory conditions, whether of a bit of nerve fiber 
or cell of a normal human being, are varied indefinitely, and really 
enlarge human experience. Men sleep on balances with apparatus 
that records the slightest change of pulse, respiration, circulation, and 
heat; they test themselves with mild doses of narcotics and other 
nervines; they multiply or reduce air pressures over the entire dermal
-P-A-G-E-494
446 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
surface; they select a square inch of skin, and with every known test 
educate it for months; they fatigue definite muscle groups; they meas- 
ure the exact time and force of memory and will; they register diurnal 
and eyen mognthly periodicities; they explore the hypnotic state; they 
apply the various forms of electricity, light, heat, and sound with 
chemicals for taste and smell. 
Fruitful and important as all this is, if by no means covers the 
ground of the old college philosophy. It has little ethical power in it, 
and for the average student it is not, perhaps, always idealizing. 
Hence it is all the more to be regretted that a few of the new psy- 
chologists go no further, but are content only to make methods more 
exact and results more refined. Although they are hardly open to 
the charge of teaching “ psychology without a soul,” which is some- 
times made, they certainly represent only a single section of the new 
psychology. 
IL. Another field is that of comparative psychology. The more we 
know of animal life, the vaster becomes our conception of instinct. 
How philosophy treats this, Schelling once said, is one of its best tests. 
Broadest and lowest are the instincts in the vegetable world, such as 
the movements by which a root penetrates the soil with sagacity as if 
its tip were a tiny brain; the tricks of carnivorous and climbing 
plants and fertilization; the movements of bacteria, infusoria, and from 
these up to earthworms, ants, bees, trapdoor spiders, and the higher 
mammals—all these studies shed light upon the nature, and often upon 
the genesis of what is a priori and innate in man. Neither the instine- 
tive nor the conscious should be allowed to become the key or type by 
which to explain the other. The psychologist who can surround him- 
self with every form of animal life until his sympathy and insight into 
its ways are as deep as that of Audubon, or White, of Selborne, and as 
reverent as that of St. Francis, can not fail of a deep religious feeling 
that the world is rational to the core. Instinct will seem larger and 
deeper though not so high as reason. The joy of finding traces of pur- 
pose and design beneath us will become a kind of atonement between 
consciousness in its unconscious basis. The boundless plasticity 
which fits every condition and fills full every possibility of life shows a 
wisdom beneath us which we can not escape if we would, and on which, 
when conscious purpose and endeavor droop, we can fall back with 
trust as on everlasting arms. 
III. Anthropology, which is very lately coming into some of our 
American colleges, is never, in fact, so large as its name. In older and 
theological institutions it designated the processes in the fall and 
redemption of man. For some itis mainly anthropometry, the Benedict 
school having refined some hundred measurements of the skull alone. 
For others its means the study of primitive man, cave dwellers, and 
the like. The psychological side which interests us here is devoted to 
myth, custom, and belief. If psychology is truly historical, it goes 
back of all finished systems to their roots in the primary thoughts,
-P-A-G-E-495
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIVAL. 4A7 
sensations, and feelings of early man, which grow more sacredly secret 
and hard to extract as tribes lose their ethnic originality. These must 
often be elaborated from words, folklore, rites, maxims, and social 
organizations. This higher anthropology seeks for such primeval 
notions as a naturalist seeks for new species, and it has a passion for 
“pooling” sentiments, opinions, and views. 
When, in the development of a race, such material shoots together 
into cosmogonies, national epics, or ethnic bibles, the psychic basis for 
a period of culture is laid, a spiritual cosmos begins. Of this same 
mother-life, philosophy at its best is but a more elaborate organization. 
Thus constituted it labors to start from the common vulgar standpoint 
and to dignify homely commonplace things and duties as Socrates did. 
It is always saturated with local color; and, instead of being gasp- 
ingly thin and abstract, as it appears to those who in periods of strong 
discipleship and little originality study the great systems from the 
texts, ignoring the psychic environment whence they sprung, it always 
seems the most warm and condensed of all the manifold expressions of 
man’s needs and ideals. With a different ethnic basis all systems 
would have been different. Thus, foreigners can never represent a 
philosophy that is indigenous, while the “exhaustion method” that 
works by thought possibility always has to have its work done over 
again. 
Greece first ripened its traditions into philosophy which was freely 
determined by all the past, and was as homogeneous as the Greek blood. 
Plato combined the old philosophemes with a deeper insight of his 
own day, and sought moral regeneration by infecting men with a pas- 
sion for his ideal. It was national, and it was literature at its highest 
and best, and became dogma only in its decline; and it was ethically 
inspired. 
Here, too, belong the studies of childhood from the sentiment of love 
in the parents on to birth and up to maturity. The soul and body of 
the young child is freighted with potencies and reverberations from a 
past we know not how remote, and was, for Plato, of all things in the 
world, most worthy of love, reverence, and service. To Compayré it is 
“the most attractive of the new fields of study opened by modern 
science,” and Le Conte says, “It is impossible to overestimate the 
importance of these studies;” while Garbini has just published a first 
study of the infant’s voice. The first center of the child’s psychic life, 
the mouth, toward which everything and every motion goes; the ex- 
traordinary sensitiveness of touch with all the organs of the adult skin 
concentrated on one-sixth the space; the slow development of the ego 
within, as distinct from the nonego, which includes all outside the 
bounding dermal surface; the slow development of the seeing power 
till it becomes a passion; the gradual coordination of the elements of 
speech and motion—all these are full of lessons for, the psychologist. 
The centers for eye, ear, motion, seem to develop in relative independ- 
ence, and plenty of play and even selfishness appear to be necessary in 
   
-P-A-G-E-496
448 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94, 
order to associate these elements of the ego, or self, into a unity so 
complete that shock or even hypnotism can not decompose it. The first 
six years of childhood are marked by growth so amazing as to suggest 
the six days of creation, while such problems as personality, the origin 
of language, character, temperament, will probably never have any solu- 
tion unless they are found in the study of infancy, the growth of which 
epitomizes under our eyes the history of the race, each day sometimes 
representing, perhaps, the race development of centuries. Other 
aspects of this topic I presented in The Forum for December, 1893. 
Adult psychology, which is chiefly taught, even to teachers, while it 
does not disqualify them for their work, is a very different thing from 
these, practical yet scientific researches into the genesis of the human 
soul. Thus, it is not strange that so many recent associations, centers, 
and studies, almost by the score, upon nearly every aspect of child life 
and adolescense, now promise to make every stage of education more 
scientific than ever before. 
IV. For the fourth field of the new psychology I know no better 
name than studies of decadents. Morel first treated insanity as a form 
of human degeneration; Striimpel first developed pedagogical pathol- 
ogy, and Lombroso the criminal types of decadents; while the study 
of idiots, paupers, tramps, blind, deaf, and other defective classes, and 
even monstrosities, is represented now by a vast and rapidly growing 
body of literature. Beginning with the more marked abnormalities, 
these studies proceeded to less marked cases—from idiots to dullards; 
from the deaf to cases of defective hearing; from insanity to slightly 
reduced mental responsibility—until now we have a growing body of 
criticism that applies the refined discriminations of normal and morbid 
to current tendencies in literature, art, education, religion, and even 
politics. Modern psychology is thus coming to utilize not only inmates 
of institutions, but institutions themselves, and the whole wide field 
of history and life, for clinical and diagnostic purposes; and the word 
“health” is again approaching its old and larger Biblical sense of 
holiness. 
All human degeneracies, whether individual or inherited, are being 
substituted, in the world’s great algebra of morals, for the almost 
unknown symbol, sin. Painstaking monographs on the morbidities 
of love show not only its dominance but its plasticity, and how every 
manifestation of it, divorced from its natural object in the other sex, 
may be evoked in the most literal and physical way toward almost 
any object or act. All the periodicities, so marked in many forms of 
lunacy, are traced up into normal life. Epilepsy shades down to 
2 hiccough; aphasia, to hesitation for a word; mania, to momentary 
excitement; so that disease almost shows us our normal life with each 
phenomenon and tendency magnified. 
None of the many text-books yet combines these four standpoints; 
and I have found three years of daily work with advanced and select 
men not too much time to cover it. In every part it palpitates with    
-P-A-G-E-497
  THE PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIVAL. 449 
human interest. To teach itis a joy, nay, a passion. However labori- 
ously or even well it may be done, there is always the bitter-sweet 
feeling that one is here staking out one of the world’s great academic 
highways, and that a pioneer will soon be forgotten in the flood of 
larger life in which every scrap and detail will be mined and minted 
and soon become part of the circulating medium of the intellectnai 
world. It may be that the relations of the new psychology to the old 
philosophy are to be somewhat as the latter were a century ago to the- 
ology; that psychology will never be a finished system, but a natural 
history of mind, dealing with the larger human logic in which all sys 
tems move. As is sometimes said of the two Testaments, so, perhaps, 
we may say of philosophy and psychology, “In the Old the New lay 
concealed, in the New the Old stands revealed.” It is no crisis or revo- 
lution, but a slow and necessary growth. 
Every stage of human development has been marked by its own 
special form of productiveness and creation. At one stage man’s origi- 
nating powers developed family and tribal life; later, perhaps, Max 
Miiller’s one hundred and twenty-one original Aryan roots were struck 
out; now, God’s creative prophets go up to meet him above the region 
of eternal frost, and bring down his law from the wild elements and 
mysteries of nature “to the line of commercial value, leaving it there, 
knowing that the world will make it useful and profitable, while they 
go back to resume their original search.” Just in proportion as evolu- 
tionary views prevail, all the fields it affects focus their interest and 
product upon man, and the older static views yield to the dynamic. 
* * * * ¥ * * 
The one chief and immediate field of application for all this work is 
its application to education, considered as the science of human nature 
and the art of developing it to its fullest maturity. It is especially 
opposed to low views of higher education, which are so prevalent often 
in higher places. It regards all the real history of the world, from 
protoplasm up, eliminating all stationary and retrograde movements, 
as educational. The philosophy of education, of history, and of life 
are one. Every institution, nation or period, subject, and man, is 
judged by its service to education in this large sense. Philosophy in 
our colleges has often gone into by and forbidden ways; its only justi- 
fication is the service it can render to education. So far from this 
being an application of it to utilitarian ends, it is its highest consecra- 
tion; for, wuen we say of anything that it is good, true, or beautiful in 
itself, we mean it is purely educational. It suggests a new devyelop- 
ment of ethics in some city of Hygeia on the basis of health which is 
already well begun and which can always be appealed to by all classes. 
It suggests that sociology must be based on biology and psychology as 
above described, or it will “ride so high a horse that it can not see the 
ground under it;” it will teach only the dynamics of selfishness unless 
it has understood the history of the world as a love story, somewhat in 
Drummond’s sense, only more adequately treated.

  450 _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
SUGGESTIONS ON THE STUDY OF CHILDREN. 
By Witr1am L. Bryan, Ph. D. 
Common sense agrees with all the pedagogies that you should know 
as much as possible about the children you have in charge. The fol- 
lowing suggestions are intended to help you do this. Do not expect too 
much from these suggestions. There is no magic in them to make you 
know anything of value. Do not suppose that these or any plans for 
child study can take the place of a common-sense use of what you 
already know of human nature. Do not suppose that any kind of 
systematic child study will make unnecessary an intimate personal 
acquaintance with the children you have in charge. On the contrary, 
the main value of such plans of study as are here proposed is to help 
you toward such an acquaintance. Do not suppose that you must 
choose between the direct observation of children and a study of text- 
books on psychology. Rather will such observations and such reading 
valuably supplement each other, in proportion as both are well done. 
Above all, do not suppose that any good whatever ean come to you 
from perfunctory study. Here, as everywhere, the conditions of getting 
good are the deeper interest which does not require to be entertained 
all the time by tin-rattle discoveries; patience to burrow for long times 
with little light; faith to wait undismayed in a seeming chaos of facts 
for a view of the order in them. Here, as everywhere, to get valuable 
insight means to become initiated through a long and devoted noviti- 
ate. Neither philosophy, nor art, nor ethics, nor any sort of science can 
get through you to the children in sealed packages. Truth must be 
reborn in you before it is school room wisdom. There is doubtless great 
advantage in joining with others in this work. By all means form 
clubs. Remember, however, that organization can easily become an 
excuse for real work. Remember, too, that a Gideon’s army of people 
who are in earnest is only encumbered by a swarm of people who are 
not. 
The purpose of these studies is not to secure scientific results. Trust- 
worthy scientific results are as hard to get as they are precious. The 
purpose here is to help teachers, mothers, and children in the high 
interests they have in common. Nothing is here proposed which any 
one of good judgment may not hopefully undertake. No inaccessible 
apparatus is required. Nevertheless, all observations and records 
should be made with the highest possible fidelity. This is a condition 
of any good to yourself. Then you should come, if possible, into com- 
munication with a psychologist. Possibly your results may afford data 
of scientifie value. After all, a fact is a fact whether or not it is dis- 
covered by a doctor. Finally, do not undertake too much. Begin only 
what you can thoroughly carry out.

  THE PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIVAL. 451 
I. HYGIENIC, 
Assuming that you are not a physician or a specialist in any line 
affecting health, there are still some important things that you can do 
for the health of your pupils. In general, you can by careful attention, 
aided by such plans as those following, discover the existence of many 
forms of sensory, motor, and central defect. 
Vision.—The vision of about 30,000 school children has been tested. 
It is claimed on the basis of these tests that defect of vision increases 
from grade to grade and with the increase of school requirements. It 
is practically impossible for an untrained observer to determine what is 
the matter with defective eyes, but it is possible for the fact of serious 
defect to be known. Get Snellen’s or other test cards (they can be had 
doubtless from any firm dealing in optical supplies). The distance at 
which type of any size should be read is shown on the card. The E’s 
in different positions may be used with persons who can not read. The 
radiating lines are used to detect astigmatism. Test each eye sepa- 
rately, holding a card before the eye which is not being tested. If you 
make no formal eye tests, note at any rate which, if any, of the pupils 
exhibit defective vision. Write a sentence on the board large enough 
to be read from the rear of the room. See which of the children can 
not do this. Note also whether any of the children seem to suffer pain 
from ordinary light. 
(1 am indebted to Dr. F.C. Heath, of Indianapolis, and to Mr. G. B. 
Harris, M. O., of Bloomington, Ind., for valuable suggestions on the 
testing of eyes by untrained persons.) 
Hearing.—The hearing of about 20,000 school children has been 
tested. One investigator reports 2 per cent of defectives. Eleven 
others report 13 to 30 per cent of defectives. A watch or the whis- 
pered voice have usually been used. If you use the voice, place the 
pupil at a given distance, let the ear which is not being tested be kept 
closed by an assistant. Dictate sentences, or, perhaps better, numbers, 
and bid the pupil write. You have only then to take note of those 
pupils who demand a marked increase of loudness. If you use a watch, 
let. the pupil be blindfolded and one ear closed as above. Note the 
distance at which the ticking can be heard when the watch is brought 
toward the pupil. The absolute distance will of course vary with the 
loudness of your watch. The relative distance will reveal the defectives. 
Dermal sensibility.—Abnormal dermal sensibility may be the effect 
or the cause of central nervous defect. Refined tests are possible only 
with special apparatus and by trained observers. Marked abnormality 
may be detected by rough tests as follows: Bid the pupil close his eyes. 
Touch the back of his hand with a pencil. Bid him touch the same 
spot with a pencil, Note the error. Note the pupils that vary widely 
from the average. Press back of hand with point of bone crochet 
 
-P-A-G-E-500
AbD . EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94, 
needle. Note pupils that appear specially sensitive or callous to pain. 
Question pupils that vary considerably from the average in any of 
these tests for evidence of extreme dermal sensitiveness or callousness. 
Note whether these extremes are associated with differing emotional 
dispositions. If you can do none of these things, note at least the 
children who seem specially liable to colds and help save them from 
that. 
Nose breathing. Breathing through the nose is known to be impor- 
tant for physical and mental vigor, memory, power of attention, ete. 
A simple and obvious test will show which children can not breathe 
freely through the nose. Try the apparent defectives carefully several 
times to eliminate eases of temporary stoppage. 
Motor ability —Three classes of tests are proposed. First, general 
motor tests, to be tried on all pupils. Let all the pupils in your room 
write some character, say the figure 9, as rapidly as possible for ten 
seconds. Try once for practice. Then, after a rest, try with care and 
note results. Take particular note of the fastest third and the slowest 
third of a given age, particularly of the slowest. Mxamine the hand- 
writing of all the pupils, taking note of the best and worst, particularly 
the latter. Are the slow ones in rate of writing the awkward ones in 
writing? Note especially those pupils who are poor by both tests. 
Special inability indicates at least retarded motor development. 
Note, if present: Twitching of eyelids, rhythmical movement of eye- 
balls, dropping of eyelids, twitching of face, grinding of teeth, stut- 
tering, tremors or twitching of hands, hyperextension of fingers, irregu- 
larities of gait, muscular restlessness, marked flightiness of attention. 
Motor tests to be made upon children whom the foregoing tests indicate 
as abnormal.—Have child’s eyes shielded from the light for a few 
moments; when the eyes are exposed to the light, note whether or not 
the pupil contracts. The absence of the iris reflex is an early symptom 
of nervous disease. Move your finger in a circle about the child’s field 
of view, and note if eye movements in any direction are limited. Bid 
pupil put out his tongue. Note limited, twitching, or asymmetrical 
movements. Bid pupil extend arms above the head. Note sagging or 
twitching of either hand; premonitory symptom of chorea. Bid pupil 
close the eyes and touch his nose or stand on one foot. Inability to 
do these is symptom of motor incoordination. Can the pupil perform 
common tasks, as balance on his heels, skate, ride a bicycle, throw a 
ball straight, catch a ball, thread a needle, and the like? Have him 
stand quite still for one or two minutes and note twitching movement. 
In young children these will appear normally. In general, note whether 
the pupil plays much and skillfully at games requiring motor ability. 
Central defect.—Defect in the central nervous system may give rise 
to such sensory and motor defects as these indicated above, or to mental 
defects of various sorts. Read the articles by Royce on “Mentally 
defective children in schools,” Educational Review, October, Novem-
-P-A-G-E-501
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIVAL 453 
ber, and December, 1893. Note in particular any signs of overfatigue. 
In addition to sensory and motor defects as given above, note (Galton) 
flightiness of attention, weakening of memory, slowness and difficulty 
in reasoning about common-sense things, insistent ideas, indecision, etc. 
When you have found defect in pupils, what can you do? (a) You 
will at least not blame the defectives for their inability, as you may now 
in ignorance be doing. (b) You will without doubt give special consid- 
eration to these children, such as common sense and common humanity 
may dictate. For example: In seating you will have consideration for 
those who are defective in vision, hearing, in liability to suffer from 
cold, or in liability to take cold. In the requirement of all school tasks 
you will make allowance for the defectives. You will specially beware 
of requiring long-continued stillness, long-continued stress of atten- 
tion, or long-continued or precise use of the hand, eye, or vocal organs 
from young or nervous children, or, as Dr. Meyer suggests, from chil- 
dren just recovering from sickness. You will remember that, while 
* fatigue is the normal accompaniment of mental or physical work, mental 
work exhausts one more rapidly than does physical work ; that children 
become exhausted more readily than do adults; that the bad air of the 
schoolroom accelerates fatigue; that continuous overfatigue leads to 
chronic fatigue, and so to a long list of physical and mental ills; and 
you will consider whether anything which you have power to change 
is helping any child into chronic fatigue. Notice specially the nervous 
children, those entering the period of adolescence, and those competing 
for grades or prizes. Query: If grades and prizes stimulate only a few, 
and if these few are overworked and overexcited by the device——? 
Do you have pupils who should probably retire from school for awhile? 
(c) You will call the attention of parents to the fact of defect, and 
so in many cases secure for the child competent medical treatment. 
(d) Lastly, such observations by teachers may be instrumental in 
inducing school boards to institute expert physical examination of 
school children, and to provide compensatory instruction for defectives. 
Il. THE STUDY OF CHILDREN’S MINDS. 
Most of the methods proposed for the systematic study of children’s 
minds require that a very large number of children should be tested 
precisely in some way, and that the results should be treated by 
statistical methods. Such studies are extremely important, but as a 
rule teachers have neither time nor training to undertake them profit- 
ably. At any rate, such studies will not be proposed here, but only a 
very few lines of inquiry which may lead teachers to a better acquaint- 
ance with their own pupils. Unless teachers seek such acquaintance 
what are all the maxims from the psychology of apperception but use- 
less pedantries? 
(a) What do the children in my school know? What is their present 
stock of ideas? Read Hall’s Contents of Children’s Minds on Enter- 
ing School. 
 
-P-A-G-E-502
  454 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
The children make mistakes. Why? Because the task is not rightly 
presented to their senses? Because of sensory or motor defect? Or 
because of erroneous apperception? In any case, the source of the 
error should, if possible, be known, in order that it may be removed; 
especially so if a certain kind of errors, as often the case, is recurrent; 
for recurrent errors mean the establishment of vicious mental habits. 
Suppose, then, you take note of pupils specially addicted to blundering 
and keep a journal of their mistakes made in oral or written work. 
A keen study of this record in connection with your knowledge of the 
ehild will very likely enable you to discern the source of difficulty. 
You may find oceasion to make a discreet and kindly use of the record 
to open the pupil’s mind to a sense of his need of improvement. At 
the least, earnest following of this plan will cause you to grow in psy- 
chological insight. Finally, if you wish, send your record with an 
aecount of the outcome to some psychologist. 
(b) What are the children of my grade most interested in? What 
are they not at all interested in? What do they assimilate, what reject, 
of my teaching? What do they remember and what forget? I bring 
them material in the several classes—reading, geography, ete. I 
require such and such tasks to be performed. What of this gets into 
the child and stays there? No questions can be more important. Can 
I get toward an answer to them? OanI do this with what time I have 
at my disposal? (See literature below for plans hitherto used.) 
I have this plan to propose: Sound the children thoroughly as to 
what they remember of last year’s work. Thatis good Hegelian and 
Herbartian pedagogy, and I hope also good common sense. First find 
out as thoroughly as possible just what work was given to your pupils 
last year in reading, geography, etc. Then have a series of language 
lessons, followed later by conversation on that work. The list of ques- 
tions must be made with precise reference to the work which the chil- 
dren had, so I can only give examples: 
How many ‘‘pieces” can you remember from the Third Reader, which you had 
last winter? Write the names of all you can remember. 
What “‘ pieces” did you like best? Why? 
You had a story about a boy stopping the water in the dike. Write all you can 
remember of the stery. 
You had a selection on heroism. Write all you can remember about it. 
Tam sure that such questions could lead to the best sort of language 
work, as well as to a review of the things formerly learned, so that “no 
time would be lost.” But if you read over the papers and then talk 
them over with the pupils with the purpose of finding out what sort of 
thing they are interested in, seize upon, assimilate, and remember, how 
can this fail to be of the greatest immediate value to you in the direc- 
tion of this year’s work? 
Iwish that some teachers would try the following modification of 
this plan: Get hold of the examination questions given to your pupils 
last year. Without warning, examine them again on the same ques-
-P-A-G-E-503
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIVAL. 455 
  tions. If possible compare the results with last year’s papers. Besides” 
the immediate value of such studies as this last, they might prove of 
wider value. These things that no child remembers for a year—what 
about teaching them for this year? If they must be known, how must 
we change our method to make them stay known? If they only give 
discipline, is it possible that something which the child seizes upon 
with more hunger will give even more discipline? But one must be 
cautious in making conclusions, still more cautions in making changes. 
(c) Who are the leaders in my school? Who have most to do in 
determining the sentiment of the school as to school work, morals, 
industry, obedience, truthfulness, kindness, ete.? What is the tone of 
the school as to these things?) Imust know. What gives these leaders 
their influence? Is it physical force, speed, skill, intellectual superi- 
ority, friendliness, imperiousness—what? And the followers—let me 
note the way in which they imitate—in dress, games, carriage, speech, 
in attitude. 
To get inside this matter is more important than anything else for 
the suceess of the school, its immediate superficial suecess and its deep 
and lasting success. In studying thus the interplay of leader and fol- 
lower you are moreover studying embryonic human society. You can — 
not go far without getting insight into the laws and forces that hold in 
history and politics. 
(d) Dr. Bergstrém suggests the following: What appeal do you rely 
upon most to influence your pupils—fear, love for yourself, utility, 
politeness, duty, or what? What sort of appeal is the best for the 
pupil? For the purpose of finding out what influences will be most 
effective with each pupil, he suggests that teachers seek to become 
acquainted with the home life of the children, and especially with the 
tone and ideals which prevail there. 
Tn all the foregoing work, remember that children are very suggesti- 
ble. You may easily and unconsciously induce sayings and doings 
such as you are looking for. Again, you may read your own theories 
or expectations into what they do. Try always to get at the sponta- 
neous activities of the children and write them down “without putting 
in any of your own.” 
“But there is no time to do such things as are suggested in this 
circular. Teachers are overworked already. Teachers can not do 
everything.” Even so. Teachers can not do everything. They are 
overworked already. The programme must be carried out. The exam- 
inations must be held. The grades must be made out. The “ground 
must be covered.” There is no time for culture teaching. There is no 
time to get acquainted with the children.

EXTRACTS FROM CHILD STUDY—SYSTEMATIC AND UNSYSTEMATIC. 
By Wirti1am L. Bryan, Ph. D. 
In this article Professor Bryan says: 
I have come especially to urge the more general recognition of two kinds of 
masters who study human nature—one of them by systematic research and one by 
personal acquaintance and insight. I wish to show, if I can, by an illustration, 
that nothing else can take the place of either of these, and that neither of these can 
take the place of the other. 
My illustration is the problem of adolescence. How shall we find out what we 
need to know in order to help the youth most in this critical period of their lives? 
What is it that we know of this period from common observation? We know that 
it is a time of great change, physical and mental. We know that it isa time of 
evitical importance for the establishment of health and habits and other such 
generalities. 
Now come a large body of scientific men, representing many special departments 
of science, and say that they will help fill out our knowledge. They must do this 
in their own way. They must take their own time. They can not be hurried. 
They can not promise every whipstitch a new discovery.. They can not promise 
that each bit of their work will by itself illustrate some general educational law or 
supply some schoolroom recipe. What is it they will do that takes so long? 
(1) They will measure hundreds of thousands of children in every way in which 
children show measurable change as they grow; the dimensions of the body asa 
whole and by parts; the weight of the body as a whole and by parts (e. g., Donald- 
son’s measurement of brain weights at different ages); the motor ability in every 
aspect, as the strength, endurance, speed, and precision of various muscles under 
various conditions; the sensory discriminative ability for all the senses; the tenacity 
and span of memory; the precision, speed, and endurance of the mind in yarious 
measurable tasks; the apperceptive capital and the spontaneous interests; the 
character and amount of sickness and the death rate, and still other determinations 
already made and yet to be made. 
(2) When any one of these determinations is made on a sufficiently large number 
of children, the results are treated by mathematical methods which show not only 
the average measure of children for a certain age, but also the individual distribu- 
tion. For example, Professor Bowditch’s tables show that 5 per cent of the children 
of a certain age are below a certain height, 10 per cent below a certain height, 15 
per cent below a certain height, etc. ‘A comparison of the results for successive 
ages shows the so-called curve of growth; that is, the absolute amount and the rate 
of growth from year to year. From this curve we can see the periods of accelerated 
and retarded growth. In like manner each set of measurements mentioned is treated 
by the methods found appropriate to each. And in like manner, accordingly, we 
find for each measurable function the curve of its growth, the time of life when it 
grows fast, the time when it grows slowly, and the time when it reaches its full 
development. 
(3) As soon as a few studies like this are made, there begins a comparative study 
of the several functions that have been measured. What are the exact relations 
between these several phases of human development? Which of these functions 
fluctuate up and down together, and which, if any, in contrary directions? 
(4) Finally, each and every part of this work must be reviewed in the light of 
the facts contributed by general biology, physiology, neurology, psychiatry, and 
related sciences. (The Child-Study Monthly, May, 1893.)

  THE PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIVAL. ABT 
INITIAL MEASURES IN THE ORGANIZATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF 
THE IOWA SOCIETY FOR CHILD STUDY. 
[‘The society was organized at Dos Moines, December 27, 1894. ‘The following officers were then 
clected: President, Supt. H. E. Kratz, Sioux City; secretary, Supt. 0. C. Scott, Oskaloosa; treas- 
urer, Supt. C. P. Rogers, Marshalltown. ] 
THE INAUGURATION. 
During the year 1894 a few of the school men of the State were in 
correspondence on the subject of child study, and intimated that they 
were pursuing lines of study and investigation in their respective 
schools. A suggestion of one to have a meeting for conference during 
the session of the State Teachers’ Association produced the following 
circular letter, which was sent to the school men and women of the 
State—necessarily, however, to a limited number: 
PRELIMINARY MEETING FOR CHILD STUDY. 
The undersigned, believing that well-organized, systematic child study will lead 
to a better understanding of child nature, more intelligent teaching, and place edu- 
cation on a more scientific basis, desire that a preliminary meeting be held at Des 
Moines, Wednesday, December 26, at 9 2. m., in some convenient room in the Hotel 
Savery, for the purpose of forming an organization and laying plans for the prose- 
eution of such study. The following topics are suggested as a basis of discussion 
for the preliminary meeting: 
Value of child study in general. 
Brief reports of investigations made. 
Most helpful lines of investigation. 
Plans of work and organization of club. 
It is deemed wise to limit the number of participants in this preliminary meeting. 
You are cordially invited to be present. Please promptly acknowledge the receipt 
of this invitation, and state definitely whether or not you will be present. Send 
reply to 
‘ H. E. Krarz, Sioux City. 
Signed: O. C. Scott, city superintendent, Oskaloosa; G. T. W. Patrick, professor 
State University, Iowa City; C. E. Shelton, city superintendent, Burlington; G. I. 
Miller, city superintendent, Boone; F. B. Cooper, city superintendent, Des Moines; 
Henry Sabin, State superintendent of public instruction; H. E. Kratz, city superin- 
tendent, Sioux City. 
The meetings were held as called in the letter. 
The entire forenoon of December 26 was occupied in interesting lines 
of study, and in expressions of opinion on organization and plans of 
work. A committee then appointed to report at a meeting the evening 
of the following day did work which was approved and resulted in 
organization and the election of officers. 
ORGANIZATION AND CONSTITUTION. 
REPORT OF COMMITTER     
ON ORGANIZATION FOR CHILD STUDY AS ADOPTED, 
GENTLEMEN: Your committee on organization and plans for the carrying forward 
the work of child study respectfully submit the following report: 
Believing that an organization for child study will greatly advance our educational 
work and help to place it on a scientific basis, your committee recommends:
-P-A-G-E-506
    A58 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
1. That a society for such study be formed, to be called the Iowa society for child 
study. ‘ 
2. That the officers shall be a president, secretary, and treasurer, who shall per- 
form the usual duties of such officers, and who shall constitute an executive com- 
mittee to appoint leaders to carry on the work of each line of investigation agreed 
upon, and to have general management of the work of the society. 
3. That all persons who are interested. in child study and contribute 50 cents annu- 
ally shall be considered members, All other persons who will aid in carrying on the 
investigations of the society shall be constituted associate members. Both members 
and associate members shall be entitled to receive the reports of the society. 
In addition we respectfully recommend that a circular be issued promptly by the 
executive committco, setting forth the general course and purpose of child study, 
and suggesting the leading lines of investigation which may be made. 
- 4, That for the present chief attention be given to the three following lines of 
investigation: 
(1) Visualization, or eye mindedness and ear mindedness. 
(2) Tests of sight and hearing. 
(3) Determination of age, weight, and height of respective grades. 
We also suggest the advisability of affiliation with the National Association for 
Child Study. 
  The executive committee was instructed to take steps to have this 
society recognized in the programme of the State Teachers’ Association 
as a round table or department. 
On the lines of investigation, the first topic, “Hye mindedness and 
ear mindedness,” was assigned to Mr. O, M. Harvey, of Burlington, as 
leader; the second topie, “Tests of sight and hearing,” to Supt. O. P. 
Bostwick, of Clinton, leader; and the third topic, “ Precosity,” or “De- 
termination of age, weight, and height of respective grades,” to Prof. 
C. C. Stover, Oskaloosa. 
    [Extracts from report (1894) of Dr. E. M. Hartwell, director of physical training, Boston public schools.] 
INTERRELATION OF MENTAL, MORAL, AND PHYSICAL TRAINING. 
  Moral, mental, and physical training, each and all, aim at develop- 
ing the faculty or power of action—of acting in accordance with a 
rule of right and wrong, of acting intelligently, so that action and the 
ends of action shall be adapted to each other; of acting easily or with 
the greatest economy of force—i. e., so that energy shall not be wasted 
in purposeless, irrelevant, roundabout, or self-defeating movements. 
This suggests closer relations and interrelations between physical, 
mental, and moral training than are usually recognized by teachers, or 
the trainers and governors of teachers. Since physical training aims 
at perfecting the body as an instrument and at rendering it the willing, 
prompt, and efficient servant of an intelligent mind and a sensitive and 
enlightened soul, it can not be gainsaid that physical training lies 
at the foundation of mental and moral training, or that it enters and 
must enter as a more or less prominent and necessary factor into the 
greater number of our educational procedures. The full suecess or 
failure of physical training, therefore, does not relate simply to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-507

size or strength of the red meat we call muscles, but is measured in 
part by our achievements in the domain of mind and the domain of 
conduct. In other words, we judge of the mental and moral worth of 
a man by the purpose, number, consecutiveness, and skillfulness of his 
ordinary and extraordinary acts, which acts, when viewed objectively and 
concretely, are reducible to the contractions of muscular fibers. * * * 
THE HYGIENIC AND EDUCATIONAL ENDS OF EXERCISE. 
The ends of exercise may be characterized, in a general way, as, first, 
the promotion of health, and, second, the formation of proper habits of 
action. The one is a hygienic end, while the other is a distinctively 
educational end. It matters not whether we consider a single muscle, 
which admits of only a single limited motion, or a group of muscles, or 
a complicated system of muscular organs, like the organs of speech, or 
the communal structure we call the body, or a class of school children, 
or a football team, or a regiment of soldiers, the ends of exercise are 
practically identical in each case, and can only be attained through a 
combination of hygienic and educational measures. 
The main field of education is the nervous system, and the principles 
of all forms of education into which physical training enters as a factor 
are based upon the power of the nervous system to receive impressions 
and to register them or their effects; in other words, upon its ability to 
memorize the part it has played in acquired movements and on occa- 
sion to revive and repeat such movements. The student of nervous 
disorders notes carefully the peculiarities of his patient’s movements 
in order to determine the seat of his injury or weakness and the nature 
and extent of his disease. It is equally necessary that the practical 
teacher should apprehend the significance of the spontaneous and 
acquired muscular movements of his pupils, be those movements coarse 
or fine, since those movements constitute an index of the action of the 
brain which it is the teacher’s business to develop and train and also 
serve to measure the success and test the character of the teacher’s 
efforts at instruction. This is true not only of instruction in football, 
military drill, gymnastics, sloyd, shoemaking, and sewing, but of 
instruction in drawing, singing, and the three R’s as well. Genuine 
suceess in any of the departments of instruction mentioned above is 
conditioned on the intelligence and skill of the instructor in selecting 
and teaching such forms of neuro-muscular action as are adapted to the 
sex, age, and capacity of his pupils. 
The motor element mm education is so large and of such vital impor- 
tance that we hazard little in predicting that the systematic study of 
movements is destined to play a much more prominent part than has 
been accorded it hitherto in the professional training of all classes of 
teachers. “It can scarcely be too often reiterated,” says Mercier, an 
English alienist, in his Nervous System and the Mind, “that the study 
of movements is the only means by which we can gain any insight 
whatever into the working of the nervous system.” * * *

  460 . EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
THE EVOLUTION OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 
In the evolution of the race and of the individual the more general 
functions and organs are formed and developed earlier than the special 
functions and their organs; e. g., the circulatory and alimentary organs 
develop earlier than the vocal organs and the hands and feet. The 
same law obtains likewise in the growth and development of the nerv- 
ous system, both as to its massive and its minute parts. The nervous 
mechanisms concerned in central movements are at once older and 
more lowly placed than the mechanisms concerned in peripheral move- 
ments. To those parts of the nervous system in man which are 
formed earliest and are practically completed and fully organized at 
birth the late Dr. Ross, a leading English neurologist, gave the name 
“fundamental,” while he designated as “accessory ” those parts which 
are rudimentary at birth and comparatively late in their growth and 
development. Broadly speaking, central movements are represented 
by low-level, fundamental centers, and peripheral movements by high- 
level, accessory centers. If, as has been stated, the nervous system is 
the field of education, education to be natural, safe, and effectual 
should defer the training of the accessory parts of the nervous system 
until the development of its fundamental portions has been secured by 
appropriate forms of general training. 
HOW PHYSICAL TRAINING STRENGTHENS THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 
As is well known, city children as a class present more cases of nerv- 
ous instability than do country children as a class. I therefore ven- 
ture to quote at length Dr. Ross’s views as to the part which physical 
training should play in the education of children with tendencies to 
nervous instability: 
The children of parents who manifest a predisposition to severe nervous disease, 
as hysteria and epilepsy, are frequently not merely quick in their perceptive facul- 
ties, but are also often possessed of great intellectual powers, and much of their 
future happiness depends upon judicious mental training in youth. The children of 
such families ought not to be subjected to any severe mental strain during the 
period of bodily development, or be allowed to enter into competition with other 
children in the mental gymnastics which are so fashionable in our public schools. 
On the other hand, regular, graduated, and systematic exercise in the form of walk- 
ing, riding, gymnastics, and calisthenics does a great deal of good by strengthening 
both the muscular and nervous systems. Everything which tends to develop the 
muscles of the lower extremities and trunk, and indeed all muscles engaged in 
executing the movements common to both man and the lower animals, tends also to 
develop the fundamental part of the nervous system, and a good, sound development 
of the fundamental is the first prerequisite to a well-balanced development of the 
accessory portion. 
The order of the development of the nervous system in the race has been from the 
fundamental to the accessory portions; and no one can reverse this process with 
impunity in that further development of the individual which constitutes education 
in its widest sense. Yet until a few years ago the natural order of development

  THE PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIVAL. 461 
was reversed in the education of youth, and especially in female education, so far 
as this could be accomplished by human contrivance and ingenuity. The natural 
order of development was indeed observed so far as to allow the child to acquire 
the power of walking prior to that of other accomplishments; but the care of the 
infant had not yet been transferred to the professional trainer. No sooner, however, 
had what is technically called education begun than the professional trainer began 
ise the small muscles of vocalization and articulation so as to acquire 
the art of reading, the small muscles of the hand so as to acquire the art of writing, 
and in the case of young ladies the still more complicated movements necessary in 
running over the keyboard of a piano; while little attention was paid to the devel- to ex    
opment of the larger muscles of the trunk and lower extremities, upon the full ~ 
development of which the future comfort of the individual depends. 
In the education of youth in the present day the laws of development and physi- 
ology are not so openly violated and defied as they were a few years ago; but much 
remains to be done in this respect, and especially in the education of children of 
families who manifest a neuropathic tendency. In the children of such families the 
greatest possible care should be taken to develop carefully the fundamental actions, 
inasmuch as a sound development of these involves a stable construction of the 
fundamental part of the nervous system, a process which makes the latter to offer 
2 greater specific resistance to the paroxysmal discharges from the later-evolved 
centers of the accessory portions which underlie hysteria, epilepsy, and even many 
of the psychoses. The process of educating the accessory system, and especially 
the higher centers of that system, should be regular and systematic; habits of men- 
tal scrutiny and self-examination, which, unfortunately, too many religious teachers 
deem necessary for the welfare of the soul, ought to be discouraged. In one word, 
education should be made as concrete and objective as possible. 
  THE LAWS OF DEVELOPMENT AND THEIR BEARING ON EDUCATION. 
If this be true—and who shall gainsay it—is it not evident that edu- 
cational measures of every kind should be selected and coordinated so 
as to conform to the order and rate of growth and development of the 
fundamental and accessory neuromuscular mechanisms of the child 
and the adolescent? Is it too much to ask that educationists should 
recognize, ponder upon, and be guided by, the laws of development 
which determine the health and power of the brain centers, and the 
health and efficiency of the servants and ministers of those centers, 
hamely, the skeletal muscles? It is true, doubtless, that the laws of 
development are recognized in a way in the conventional division of 
schools into elementary, secondary, and superior; but it is no less true 
that the bodily and mental characteristics which differentiate children 
from youth, and both from adults, are deserving of more careful study 
and much fuller recognition than they have received hitherto from 
teachers as a class or from those charged with the appointment and 
control of teachers. 
‘HE SCOPE OF PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGY. 
[For the information of teachers who are constantly making inquiries 
into the limits of the several branches of experimental psychology, the 
following extracts are given from an article by Prof. C. Lloyd Morgan, 
of University College, Bristol, England. In this article Professor Lloyd 
gives a very clear outline of the province of psycho-physics and inci-

dentally shows the dearth of equipment for this work in English 
colleges.— Hd. : 
Under the title of psycho-physiology may be comprised these inves- 
tigations in psychology which have explicit or tacit reference to the 
concomitant physiological processes and which are characterized by 
the application of the experiment method. The boundaries of the sub- 
ject are somewhat ill-defined, since it shades off into physiology on the 
one hand and into introspective psychology on the other. I shall 
endeavor in this article to indicate the scope of such experimental 
investigations. 
A chick, not many hours old, will peck with fair but not complete 
accuracy at any small object which catches its eye. Here we have 
a reflex and responsive action. A stimulus is received in a sense 
organ; an impulse is carried centripetally along ingoing or afferent 
nerve fibers; certain nerve centers are thrown into activity, and an 
outgoing impulse is carried by efferent nerve fibers to muscles which 
are thus thrown into coordinated activity. It is probable that on the 
first occurrence of such an action it is purely automatic and is per- 
formed in virtue of the possession by the chick of an inherited 
organic mechanism, It is accompanied by, but not guided by, con- 
sciousness. Such guidance, however, soon becomes evident. Throw 
to a chick two or three days old half a dozen caterpillars, some of 
them common “loopers,” others yellow and black “cinnabars.” In 
the absence of previous experience they will be equally seized. But 
the loopers will be swallowed, while the cinnabars will be dropped. 
Repeat the experiment next day. The loopers will be gobbled up at 
once. The cinnabars will remain almost, if not quite, untouched. An 
association has been formed between the sight and taste in the two 
cases. Consciousness is no longer merely an accompaniment of the 
action. It controls, enforcing the action in one case, inhibiting or re- 
straining it in another. It is probable that in the higher parts of the 
brain there are special centers, the physiological functioning of which 
is associated with this conscious control. Such activities of the chick, 
first those which are merely responsive and automatic, secondly those 
which are under conscious control, exemplify a wide range of activities 
both in animals and man. 
Let us note the scope of the experimental work that they suggest. 
First, there is the nature and range of stimulation of the nerve endings 
in the sense organ. Secondly, there is the nature and rate of trans- 
mission of the impulses along the nerve fibers afferent and efferent. 
Thirdly, there are the nature and localization of the activities of the 
automatic centers, and the time occupied by their peculiar functioning. 
Fourthly, there is the physiological and psychological investigation of 
the nature and mode of origin of the consciousness which accompanies 
the movements of parts of the body during response. Fifthly, there are 
the conditions, psychological and physiological, of association. And
-P-A-G-E-511
    
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIVAL. 463 
sixthly, there is the mode of application of the control and the locali- 
zation of specialized control centers, together with the estimation of 
the time element in control. 
All these have been made the subject of careful and systematic 
inquiry by the method of experiment. In all cases such experimental 
investigation has led, if not to brilliant positive results, at all events 
to salutary acknowledgment of ignorance. Difficulties of interpreta- 
tion abound. Nowhere are these difficulties greater than in the inves- 
tigation of the physiology and psychology of color vision. Take a 
dozen individuals and get them successively to indicate by means of 
the cross fibers of the spectroscope how far they can see along the 
spectrum, first in the direction of the extreme red, then in the direction 
of the extreme violet. You will find marked differences. Perhaps one 
will show a quite unusual amount cf variation, and you will probably 
find by other tests that he iscolor-blind. Is this variation in the retina 
or in the visual center of the brain? It is well known that the psycho- 
physiology of vision is still a matter under discussion. One of the dif- 
ficulties seems to arise from the fact that what is physiologically 
complex is psychologically simple. Purple gives a simple psycholog- 
ical sensation; but it is due toa combination of physiological impulses, 
the coalescence or synthesis of which is, so to speak, below the thresh- 
old of consciousness. One cannot, or I can not, psychologically analyze 
purple into its constituents, as one can analyze a musical chord. There 
is still a wide field for research in the psychophysiology of sensation. 
An important line of investigation which has now been followed up 
for many years deals, not with differences of kind or of quality in sen- 
sation, but with variations in intensity. Given a stimulus which 
excites sensation; now diminish it on the one hand until it ceases to 
excite sensation, and increase it on the other hand until it reaches-a 
maximum of sensation. Then formulate the law which shall express 
the relation which increase of stimulation bears to the increase of sen- 
sation. The results of Weber’s researches went to show that we must 
look not to the absolute but to the relative increments of stimulus; 
and Fechner, extending and generalizing Weber's results, formulated 
the law of the relations thus: When the stimuli increase in geomet- 
vical progression, the sensations increase in arithmetical progression, 
or the sensation is proportional to the logarithm of its stimulus. 
Concerning this law and its philosophical raison d@’etre there has been 
much animated discussion, into which I do not propose here to enter. 
Suffice it to say that if we represent by a curve the rise of sensation 
from the threshold where it first dawns to its maximum, the law seems 
to hold good only for the mid-region. Various methods of experimen- 
tation are employed. Weber and Fechner employed chiefly the method 
of tabulating the just discernible differences in sensation—of increas- 
ing, that is to say, the intensity of the stimulus, and noting when this 
increment is just perceptible. Others, using larger intervals, have 
   
-P-A-G-E-512
464 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
employed the method of estimating equal increments. Others, again, 
have constantly doubled the stimulus and noted the change in sensa- 
tion. In all cases it must be remembered that what we are really 
dealing with is the perception of the relations between certain given 
sensations. This is a fact too often lost sight of. We have to infer 
from these relations the intensity curve in sensation. 
* * * * * * * 
Researches on the rate of transmission of impulses along the affer- 
ent and efferent nerves may be regarded as mainly physiological. 
Suffice it to say that the rate is about 120 feet per second for ingoing 
impulses, and about 110 feet per second for outgoing impulses. Trans- 
mission in the spinal cord appears to be less rapid. The results of 
experimental investigations on the localization of function in the brain 
appear to justify the hypothesis that the automatic centers—or the 
centers concerned in merely organic response—are quite distinct from 
the control centers, which are probably restricted to the cerebral cortex. 
It is a good working hypothesis that the centers which minister to 
control are the seat of those molecular disturbances which are concomi- 
tant with consciousness. Consciousness apart from control would bea 
mere epiphenomenon of no practical use to the organism. It is scarcely 
necessary for me to do more than remind the reader of the conspicuous 
success which has crowned the efforts of those who have patiently and 
systematically applied the experimental method to the localization of 
the centers of motor control. The motor regions of the hemispheres have 
now been mapped out with considerable exactitude. * * * Inall 
this field of research, as in the transmission of impulses, we are exper- 
imenting more on the physiological than on the psychological side of 
psycho-physiology. 
‘When we come to association, very little that is exact and assured is 
known of the physiological aspect. It is said that association tracts— 
that is, groups of fibers connecting together the several centers in the 
cerebral cortex—are almost, if not quite, absent at birth, and are estab- 
lished during the development of experience, which may well enough 
be so; but what may be the physiological conditions of their develop- 
ment we can at present only guess. On the psychological side much 
has been written on association, and in recent times Mr. Francis Gal- 
ton, followed by Trautscholdt and others, has carried out experiments 
with the object of estimating the time that elapses between the recep 
tion of a simple impression and the occurrence of a simple idea sug- 
gested thereby. Such time would seem to be about three-quarters of 
a second. 
Much attention has been paid to what is termed “reaction time”; 
that is, the time which elapses between a given simple stimulation and 
the resulting responsive motion. This was found by Lange to vary 
according as the person who is being tested directs his attention to the 
expected sense-impression or the anticipated motor response. In the 
   
-P-A-G-E-513
  THE PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIVAL. 465 
case of a simple response to a visual stimulus, the reaction time in the 
former case is rather more than one-fourth of a second, but in the latter 
case only about one-sixth of a second. Practice tends to shorten the 
time, while fatigue lengthens it. A premonitory signal just before the 
stimulation markedly shortens it. Other experiments have been con- 
ducted with a view to ascertaining the time taken in simple cases of 
discrimination. This, too, varies very much with practice, and it is 
questionable whether the shorter time-values measure an act of dis- 
crimination properly so called. This part of the subject is full of diffi- 
culties in the interpretation of the results obtained. 
* * * * * * * 
Enough has now been said to indicate the kind of work on experi- 
mental lines which is being done in psychophysiology. In England, 
while valuable researches have been prosecuted in cerebral localiza- 
tion, comparatively little has been done on the lines which are followed 
up in the German and American psychological laboratories, though 
Mr. Francis Galton’s valuable psychometric observations have been 
based on somewhat similar methods. * * * Is it too much to hope 
_that the time is not far distant when there shall be established in Eng- 
land chairs of zoological and experimental psychology, the occupants 
of which shall have the direction of adequately equipped laboratories, 
wherein systematic observations, on the lines I have above indicated, 
may be conducted? (Nature, March 20, 1894, pp. 504, 505.)

  CHAPTER XI. 
REPORT OF THE COMMITTER OF FIFTEEN. 
INTRODUCTORY STA 
  At the Saratoga meeting in 1892 the National Educational Association appointed 
a committee of ten persons to consider and report upon the subjects of study and 
the methods of instruction in secondary*schools, including public high schools, 
private academies, and schools preparing students for college. President Eliot, of 
Harvard, was appointed chairman. This committee of ten had authority to select 
the members of special conferences and to arrange meetings for the discussion of 
the principal subjects taught in schools preparatory to college. Accordingly, nine 
such conferences were appointed, each consisting of ten members, representing the 
colleges on the one hand and the secondary schools on the other. The subjects rep- 
resented were Latin, Greek, English, other modern languages, mathematics, natural 
philosophy (including physics, astronomy, and chemistry), natural history (and 
biology, including botany, zoology, and physiology), history (including also civil 
government and political economy), and geography (including physical geography, 
geology, and meteorology). 
The report was completed and published in the spring of 1894. Thirty thousand 
copies were distributed by the Bureau of Education, and since then edition after 
edition has been printed and sold by the National Educational Association through 
an agent. 
The influence of the report of the committee of ten has been to impel secondary 
schools toward the choice of well-balanced courses of study containing subjects 
which belong essentially to secondary education, like algebra, Latin, or physics, 
and at the same time either to discontinue elementary branches or to apply to the 
study of these a superior method, by which their principles are traced into higher 
branches and explained. 
The success of the report of the committee of ten has been such as to arouse eager 
interest in a similar inquiry into the work of the elementary schools. Already, in 
February, 1893, a committee has been appointed by the department of superintend- 
ence in the National Educational Association. It was made to consist of fifteen 
members instead of ten, and has been known as the committee of fifteen. This 
committee, with Mr. W. H. Maxwell, superintendent of schools, Brooklyn, N. Y., as 
chairman, was organized by him into three subcommittees: 
(1) On the training of teachers: H. 8. Tarbell, Edward Brooks, F. M. Balliet, 
N. C. Dougherty, and O. H. Cooper, the superintendents of public schools in the 
cities of Providence, R. I., Philadelphia, Pa., Springfield, Mass., Peoria, Ill., and 
Galveston, Tex., respectively. 
(2) On the correlation of studies in elementary education: W.T. Harris, J.M. 
Greenwood, C. B. Gilbert, L. H. Jones, and W. H. Maxwell; Messrs. Greenwood, 
Gilbert, and Jones being city superintendents in Kansas City, St. Paul, and Cleve- 
land, respectively. 
  469
-P-A-G-E-518
  470 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
(3) On the organization of the city school systems: A.S. Draper, E. P. Seaver, A. 
G. Lane, A. B. Poland, and W. B. Powell, Mr. Draper being president of the Univer- 
sity of Illinois and the other members the city superintendents of Boston, Chicago, 
and Washington, D. C., and the State superintendent of New Jersey, respectively. 
The report of this committee of fifteen was submitted to the department of 
superintendence at its meeting in February, 1895, in Cleveland. 
In order to facilitate the study of the report of the committee of fifteen it is of 
value to have at hand the questions submitted by each of the three subcommittees: 
(a) On training of teachers; (b) on correlation of studies; (¢) on organization of 
city school systems. The questions are here appended in the order named. 
A.—TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
1. What should be the lowest age at which a person should be permitted to under- 
take a course of professional work ? 
2, What should be the requirements for scholarship to enter on such a course? 
(a) English grammar, historical grammar, rhetoric, literature. 
(b) Mathematics—arithmetic, algebra, geometry. 
(c) Botany and zoology. 
(d) Drawing. 
(e) Music. 
(f) History. 
(g) Geography 
(h) Physics. 
(i) Chemistry. 
(j) Foreign languages—French, German, Latin, Greek, 
(k) Physiology and hygiene. 
(1) Mineralogy. 
8. Should scholarships be determined by an examination, or should a high school 
diploma be accepted as evidence? If the latter, should a four years’ course be 
required? 
4. What should be the duration of the training school course? 
5. What proportion of this time should be devoted to studying principles and 
methods of education? What proportion to the practice of teaching? 
6. To what extent should psychology be studied, and in what way? 
7. Along what lines should the observation of children be pursued? 
8. What measurements of children should be made, and what apparatus should 
be required for the purpose? 
9. In what way should principles of education be derived from psychology and 
allied sciences? 
10. How far and in what way should the history of education be studied? In 
what way may the history of education be made of practical use to teachers? 
11. In what way should the training in teaching the various subjects of the 
common school curriculum be pursued? 
(a) By writing outlines of lessons? 
(b) By giving lessons to fellow pupil teachers? 
(c) By the study of books or periodicals devoted to methods of teaching? 
(d) By lectures? 
12. In a model school, should there be a model teacher placed over each class? Or 
should there be a model teacher placed over every two classes? Or should the pupil 
teachers be held responsible for the teaching of all classes, under the direction of a 
critic teacher? 
13. What is the most fruitful plan of observing the work of model teachers? 
14, What is the most fruitful plan of criticising the practice work of pupil teachers? 
15. Should the criticism be made by the teachers of methodology, or by critic 
teachers appointed specially for the purpose, or by the model teachers? 
 
-P-A-G-E-519
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. 471 
16. Should the imparting of knowledge other than psychology, principles, meth- 
ods, and history of education form any part of the work of a normal or training 
school? 
17. How should a pupil teacher’s efficiency be tested in a training school? 
18. On what grounds should the diploma of a training school be issued? 
B.—CoRRELATION OF STUDIES. 
  1. Should the elementary course be eight years, and the secondary course four 
years, as at present? Or should the elementary course be six years and the second- 
ary course six years? 
2. Has each of the grammar school studies—language (including reading, spell- 
ing, grammar, composition), mathematics (arithmetic, algebra, plane geometry), 
geography, history, natural science (botany, zoology, mineralogy), penmanship,

I.—REPORT OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
This report treats of the training of elementary and secondary teach- 
ers, considering first that training which should precede teaching 
in elementary schools. By elementary schools are meant the primary 
and grammar departments of graded schools and ungraded or rural 
schools. 
Teachers are “born, not made,” has been so fully the world’s thought 
until the present century that a study of subjects without any study 
of principles or methods of teaching has been deemed quite sufficient. 
Modern educational thought and modern practice, in all sections where 
excellent schools are found, confirm the belief that there is a profound 
philosophy on which educational methods are based, and that careful 
study of this philosophy and its application under expert guidance are 
essential to making fit the man born to teach. 
CONDITIONS FOR PROFESSIONAL TRAINING—AGE AND ATTAINMENTS. 
It is a widely prevalent doctrine, to which the customs of our best 
schools conform, that teachers of elementary schools should have a 
secondary or high school education, and that teachers of high schools 
should have a collegiate education. Your committee believe that these
-P-A-G-E-521
  REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. 473 
are the minimum acquirements that can generally be accepted; that 
the scholarship, culture, and power gained by four years of study in 
advance of the pupils are not too much to be rightfully demanded, and 
that, as a rule, no one ought to become a teacher who has not the age 
and attainments presupposed in the possession of a high school diploma. 
There are differences in high schools, it is true, and a high school 
diploma is not a fixed standard of attainment; but in these United 
States it is one of the most definite and uniform standards that we 
possess, and varies less than college degrees vary or than elementary 
schools and local standards of culture vary. 
It is of course implied in the foregoing remarks that the high school 
from which the candidate comes is known to be a reputable school, and 
that its diploma is proof of the completion of a good four years’ course 
in a creditable manner. If these conditions do not exist, careful 
examination is the only recourse. 
If this condition, high school graduation or proof by examination of 
equivalent scholarship, be accepted, the questions of the age and attain- 
ment to be reached before entering upon professional study and train- 
ing are already settled. Butif amore definite statement be desired, 
then it may be said that the candidate for admission to a normal or 
training school should be 18 years of age, and should have studied 
English, mathematics, and science to the extent usually pursued in 
high schools; should be able to write readily, correctly, and method- 
ically upon topics within the teacher’s necessary range of thought and 
conversation, and should have studied for two or more years at least 
one language besides English. Skill in music and drawing is desir- 
able, varticularly ability to sketch readily and effectively. 
TRAINING SCHOOLS. 
The training of teachers may be done in normal schools, normal 
classes in academies and high schools, and in city training schools. To 
all these the general term “training schools” will be applied. Those 
instructed in these schools will be called pupils while engaged in pro- 
fessional study, and pupil teachers or teachers in training while in 
practice teaching preparatery to graduation. Teachers whose work is . 
to be observed by pupil teachers will be called model teachers; teach- 
ers in charge of pupil teachers during their practice work will be called 
critic teachers. In some institutions model teachers and critic teach- 
ers are the same persons. The studies usually pursued in academies 
and high schools will be termed academic, and those post-academie 
studies to be pursued before or during practice teaching as a prepara- 
tion therefor will be termed professional. 
ACADEMIC STUDIES. 
Whether academic studies have any legitimate place in a normal or 
training school is a question much debated. It can not be supposed 
that your committee can settle in a paragraph a question upon which
-P-A-G-E-522
  AT4 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
many essays have been written, many speeches delivered, and over 
which much controversy has been waged. 
If training schools are to be distinguished from other secondary 
schools, they must do a work not done in other schools. So far as they 
teach common branches of study they are doing what other schools are 
doing, and have small excuse for existence; but it may be granted that 
methods can practically be taught only as to subjects; that the study 
done in professional schools may so treat of the subjects of study, not 
as objects to be acquired, but as objects to be presented, that their 
treatment shall be wholly professional. 
One who is to teach a subject needs to know it as a whole made up of 
related and subordinate parts, and hence must study it by a method 
that will give this knowledge. It is not necessary to press the argu- 
ment that many pupils enter normal and training schools with such 
slight preparation as to require instruction in academic subjects. The 
college with a preparatory department is, as a rule, an institution of 
distinctly lower grade than one without such a department. Academic 
work in normal schools that is of the nature of preparation for profes- 
sional work lowers the standard and perhaps the usefulness of such a 
school; but academic work done as a means of illustrating or enforcing 
professional truth has its place in a professional school as in effect a 
part of the professional work. Professional study differs widely from 
academic study. In the one, a science is studied in its relation to the 
studying mind; in the other, in reference to its principles and applica- 
tions. The aim of one kind of study is power to apply; of the other, 
power to present. The tendency of the one is to bring the learner into 
sympathy with the natural world, of the other with the child world. 
How much broader becomes the teacher who takes both the academic 
and the professional view! He who learns that he may know and he 
who learns that he may teach are standing in quite different mental 
attitudes. One works for knowledge of subject-matter; the other that 
his knowledge may have due organization, that he may bring to con- 
sciousness the apperceiving ideas by means of which matter and method 
may be suitably conjoined. 
How to study is knowledge indispensable to knowing how to teach. 
The method of teaching can best be illustrated by teaching. The 
attitude of a pupil in a training school must be that of a learner whose 
mental stores are expanding, who faces the great world of knowledge 
with the purpose to survey a portion of it. If we insist upon a suffi- 
cient preparation for admission, the question of what studies to pursue 
and especially the controversy between professional and academic work 
will be mainly settled.
-P-A-G-E-523
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN, AT5 
PROFESSIONAL WORK. 
Professional training comprises two parts: («) The science of teach- 
ing, and ()) the art of teaching. 
In the science of teaching are included: (1) Psychology as a basis for 
principles and methods; (2) methodology as a guide to instruction; 
(3) school economy, which adjusts the conditions of work; and (4) history 
of education, which gives breadth of view. 
The art of teaching is best gained: (1) By observation of good teach- 
ing; (2) by practice teaching under criticism. 
RELATIVE TIME. 
The existence and importance of each of these elements in the train- 
ing of teachers are generally acknowledged. Their order and propor- 
tionate treatment give rise to differences of opinion. Some would omit 
the practice work entirely, launching the young teacher upon independ- 
ent work directly from her pupilage in theory. Others, and much the 
greater number, advise some preparation in the form of guided experi- 
ence before the training be considered complete. These vary greatly 
in their estimate of the proportionate time to be given to practice 
during training, The answers to the question, ““What proportion?” 
which your committee has received, range from one-sixteenth to two- 
thirds as the proportion of time to be given to practice. The greater 
number, however, advocate a division of time about equal between 
theory and practice. 
The normal schools incline to the smallest proportion for practice 
teaching, the city training schools to the largest. It should be borne 
in mind, however, that city training schools are a close continuation, 
usually, of high schools, and that the high school courses give a more 
uniform and probably a more adequate preparation than the students 
entering normal schools have usually had. Their facilities for practice 
teaching are much greater than normal schools can secure, and for 
this reason also practice is made relatively more important. As to 
the relative merits of city training schools and normal schools, your 
committee does not desire to express an opinion; the conditions of 
education demand the existence of both, and both are necessities of 
educational advancement. It is important to add, however, that in 
the judgment of your committee not less than half of the time spent 
under training by the apprentice teacher should be given to observa- 
tion and practice, and that this practice in its conditions should be 
as similar as possible to the work she will later be required to do 
independently. 
SCIENCE OF TEACHING—PSYCHOLOGY. 
The laws of apperception teach that one is ready to apprehend new 
truth most readily when he has already established a considerable and 
well-arranged body of ideas thereon. 
 
-P-A-G-E-524
  476 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
Suggestion, observation, and reflection are each most fruitful when 
a foundation of antecedent knowledge has been provided. Hence your 
committee recommends that early in their course of study teachers in 
training assume as true the well-known facts of psychology and the 
essential principles of education, and make their latter study and 
practice in the light of these principles. These principles thus become 
the norm of educational thought, and their truth is continually demon- 
strated by subsequent experience. From this time theory and practice 
should proceed together in mutual aid and support. 
Most fundamental and important of the professional studies which 
ought to be pursued by one intending to teach is psychology. This 
study should be pursued at two periods of the training school course, 
the beginning and the end, and its principles should be appealed to 
daily when not formally studied. The method of study should be both 
deductive and inductive. The terminology should be early learned 
from a suitable text-book, and significance given to the terms by intro- 
spection, observation, and analysis. Power of introspection should be 
gained, guidance in observation should be given, and confirmation of 
psychological principles should be sought on every hand. The habit 
of thinking analytically and psychologically should be formed by 
every teacher. At the close of the course a more profound and more 
completely inductive study of physiological psychology should be 
made. In this way a tendency to investigate should be encouraged or 
created. 
STUDY OF CHILDREN. 
Modern educational thought emphasizes the opinion that the child, 
not the subject of study, is the guide to the teacher’s efforts. To know 
the child is of paramount importance. How to know the child must 
be an important item of instruction to the teacher in training. The 
child must be studied as to his physical, mental, and moral condition. 
Is he in good health? Are his senses of sight and hearing normal, or 
in what degree abnormal? What is his temperament? Which of his 
faculties seem weak or dormant? Is he eye-minded or ear-minded? 
What are his powers of attention? What are his likes and dislikes? 
How far is his moral nature developed, and what are its tendencies? 
By what tests can the degree of difference between bright and dull 
children be estimated ? 
To study effectively and observingly these and similar questions 
respecting children is a high art. No common-sense power of diseern- 
ing human nature is sufficient, though common sense and sympathy 
go along way in such study. Weighing, measuring, or elaborate inves- 
tigation requiring apparatus and laboratory methods are for experts, 
not teachers in training. Above all, it must ever be remembered that 
the child is to be studied as a personality and not as an object to be 
weighed or analyzed.
-P-A-G-E-525
  REPORT. OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. AUT 
METHODOLOGY. 
_ Apart of the work under this head must be a study of the mental 
and moral effects of different methods of teaching and examination, 
the relative value of individual and class instruction at different periods 
of school life, and in the study of different branches. The art of ques- 
tioning is to be studied in its foundation principles and by the illustra- 
tion of the best examples. Some review of the branches which are to 
be taught may be made, making the teacher’s knowledge of them 
ready and distinct as to the relations of the several parts of the sub- 
ject to one another and of the whole to kindred subjects. These and 
many such subjects should be discussed in the class in pedagogy, inves- 
tigation should be begun, and the lines on which it can be followed 
should be distinctly laid down, : 
The laws of psychology, or the capabilities and methods of mind 
activity, are themselves the fundamental laws of teaching, which is the 
act of exciting normal and profitable mind action. Beyond these fun- 
damental laws, the principles of education are to be derived inductively. 
These inductions when brought to test will be found to be rational 
inferences from psychological laws and thus founded upon and explained 
by them. 
SCHOOL ECONOMY. 
School economy, though a factor of great importance in the teacher’s 
training, can be best studied by the teacher of some maturity and 
experience, and is of more value in the equipment of secondary than 
ot elementary teachers. Only its outlines and fundamental principles 
should be studied in the ordinary training school. 
HISTORY OF EDUCATION. 
Breadth of mind consists in the power to view facts and opinions 
from the standpoints of others. It is this truth which makes the study 
of history in a full, appreciative way so influential in giving mental 
breadth. This general advantage the history of education has in still 
larger degree, because our interest in the views and experiences of 
those engaged like us in training the young enables us to enter more 
fully into their thoughts and purposes than we could into those of the 
warrior or ruler. From the efforts of the man we imagine his sur- 
roundings, which we contrast with our own. To the abstract element 
of theoretical truth is added the warm human interest we feel in the hero, 
the generous partisan of truth. The history of education is particu- 
larly full of examples of noble purpose, advanced thought, and moral 
heroism. It is inspiring to fill our minds with these human ideals. 
We read in the success of the unpractical Pestalozzi the award made 
to self-sacrifice, sympathy, and enthusiasm expended in giving applica- 
tion to a vital truth.
-P-A-G-E-526
  478 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
But with enthusiasm for ideals history gives us caution, warns us 
against the moving of the pendulum, and gives us points of departure 
- from which to measure progress. It gives us courage to attack diffi- 
eult problems. It shows which the abiding problems are—those that 
ean be solved only by waiting, and not tossed aside by a supreme 
effort. It shows us the progress of the race, the changing ideals of the 
perfect man, and the means by which men have sought to realize these 
ideals. We can from its study better answer the question, What is 
education, what may it accomplish, and how may its ideals be realized? 
It gives the evolution of the present and explains anomalies in our 
work. And yet the history of education is not a subject to be treated 
extensively in a training school. All but the outlines may better be 
reserved for later professional reading. 
TRAINING IN TEACHING. 
Training to teach requires (1) schools for observation and (2) schools 
for practice. 
Of necessity, these schools must be separate in purpose and in 
organization. A practice school can not bea model school. The pupil 
teachers should have the opportunity to observe the best models of the 
teaching art; and the manner, methods, and devices of the model 
teacher should be noted, discussed, and referred to the foundation 
principles on which they rest. Allowable modifications of this observed 
work may be suggested by the pupil teacher and approved by the 
teacher in charge. 
There should be selected certain of the best teachers in regular 
school work whom the pupil teachers may be sent to observe. The 
pupil teachers should take no part in the school work nor cause any 
change therein. They should, however, be told in advance by the 
teacher what purpose she seeks to accomplish. This excites expecta- 
tion and brings into consciousness the apperceiving ideas by which the 
suggestions of the exercise, as they develop, may be seized and assimi- 
lated. 
At first these visits should be made in company with their teacher 
of methods, and the work of a single class in one subject should be first 
observed. After such visits the teacher of methods in the given sub- 
ject should discuss with the pupil teachers the work observed. The 
pupil teachers should first describe the work they have seen and specify 
the excellencies noted, and tell why these things are commendable and 
upon what laws of teaching they are based. Next the pupil teachers 
should question the teacher of methods as to the cause, purpose, or 
influence of things noted, and matters of doubtful propriety—if there 
be such—should be considered. Then the teacher in turn should ques- 
tion her pupil teachers as to matters that seem to have escaped their 
notice, as to the motive of the model teacher, as to the reason for the 
order of treatment, or form of question, wherein lay the merit of her
-P-A-G-E-527
  REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. 479 
method, the secret of her power. When pupil teachers have made 
such observations several times, with several teachers and in several 
subjects, the broader investigation may be made as to the organization 
of one of the model rooms, its daily programme of recitations and of 
study, the methods of discipline, the relations between pupils and 
teacher, the “school spirit,” the school movements, and class progress. 
This work should be done before teaching groups or classes of pupils is 
attempted, and should form an occasional exercise during the period of 
practice teaching as a matter of relief and inspiration. If an artist 
requires the suggestive help of a good example that stirs his own orig- 
inality, why should not a teacher? 
THE PRACTICE SCHOOL. 
During the course in methodology certain steps closely preparatory 
to practice teaching may be taken. (1) The pupil teacher may analyze 
the topic to be taught, noting essentials and incidentals, seeking the 
connections of the subject with the mental possessions of the pupils to 
be considered and the sequences from these points of contact to the 
knowledge to be gained under instruction. (2) Next, plans of lessons 
may be prepared and series of questions for teaching the given subject. 
(3) Giving lessons to fellow pupil teachers leads to familiarity with the 
mechanism of class work, such as calling, directing, and dismissing 
classes, gives the beginner ease and self-confidence, leads to careful 
preparation of lessons, gives skill in asking questions and in the use of 
apparatus. 
The practice teaching should be in another school, preferably in a 
different building, and should commence with group teaching in a reci- 
tation room apart from the schoolroom. Actual teaching of small 
groups of children gives opportunity for the study of the child mind in 
its efforts at reception and assimilation of new ideas and shows the 
modifications in lesson plans that must be made to adapt the subject- 
matter to the child’s tastes and activities. But the independent charge 
for a considerable time of a schoolroom with a fall quota of pupils, the 
pupil teacher and the children being much of the time the sole occupants 
of the reom—in short, the realization of ordinary school conditions, 
with the opportunity to go for advice to a friendly critic—is the most 
valuable practice; and no practice short of this can be considered of 
great value except as preparation for this chief form of preparatory 
practice. All this work should have its due proportion only, or evil 
mayresult. For example, lesson plans tend to formalism, toself-conceit, 
to work in few and narrow lines, to study of subjects rather than of 
pupils; lessons to fellow pupils make one self-conscious, hinder the 
growth of enthusiasm in work, and are entirely barren if carried beyond 
a very few exercises; teaching groups of children for considerable time 
unfits the teacher for the double burden of discipline and instruction, 
to bear both of which simultaneously and easily is the teacher’s great- 
est difficulty and most essential power.
-P-A-G-E-528
  480 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
A critic teacher should be appointed to the oversight of two such 
pupil teachers, each in charge of a schoolroom. The critic may also 
supervise one or more teachers practicing for brief periods daily with 
groups of children. 
The pupil teachers are now to emphasize practice rather than theory, 
to work under the direction of one who regards the interests of the 
children quite as much as those of the teacher in training. The critic 
must admit the principles of education and general methods taught by 
the teacher of methodology, but she may have her own devices and 
even special methods that need not be those of the teacher of method- 
ology. No harm will come to the teachers in training if they learn that 
principles must be assented to by all, but that methods may bear the 
stamp of the personality of the teacher; that all things must be con- 
sidered from the point of view of their effect upon the pupils; the 
critic maintaining the claims of the children, the teacher of methods 
conforming to the laws of mind and the science of the subjects taught. 
The critics must teach for their pupil teachers and show in action the 
justness of their suggestions. In this sense they are model teachers as 
well as critics. 
The critic should at the close of school meet her pupil teachers for a 
report of their experiences through the day—what they have attempted, 
how they have tried to do it, why they did so, and what success they 
gained. Advice as to overcoming difficulties, encouragement under 
trial, caution if need be, help for the work of to-morrow, occupy the 
hour. Above all, the critic should be a true friend, a womanly and 
cultivated woman, and an inspiring companion, whose presence is help- 
ful to work and improving to personality. 
LENGTH OF TRAINING SCHOOL COURSE. 
There are three elements which determine the time to be spent in a 
training school—the time given to academic studies, the time given to 
professional studies, and the time given to practice. The sum of these 
periods will be the time required for the training course. Taking these 
in the inverse order, let us consider how much time is required for 
practice work with pupils. The time given to lesson outlines and 
practice with fellow pupil teachers may be considered a part of the 
professional study rather than of practice teaching. The period of 
practice with pupils must not be too short, whether we consider the 
interests of the pupils or of the teachers in training. An effort is 
usually made to counteract the effect upon the children of a succession 
of crude efforts of teachers beginning practice by strengthening the 
teaching and supervision through the employment of a considerable 
number of model and supervisory teachers and by dividing the pupils 
into small groups so that much individual work can be done. These 
arrangements, while useful for their purpose, destroy to a considerable 
degree the usual conditions under which school work is to be done and 
tend to render the teachers in training formal and imitative.
-P-A-G-E-529
  REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. 481 
The practice room should be, as far as may be, the ordinary school, 
with the difficulties and responsibilities that will be met later. The 
responsibility for order, discipline, progress, records, reports, commu- 
nication with parents and school authorities, must fall fully upon the 
young teacher, who has a friendly assistant to whom she can go for 
advice in the person of a wise and experienced critic, not constantly at 
hand, but constantly within reach. 
Between the critic and the teacher in training there should exist the 
most cordial and familiar relations. These relations are based on the 
one hand upon an appreciation of wisdom and kindness, on the other 
upon an appreciation of sincerity and effort. The growth of such rela- 
tions, and the fruitage which follows their growth, require time. A 
half year is not too long to be allotted forthem. During this half-year 
experience, self-confidence and growth in power have been gained; but 
the pupil teacher is still not ready to be set aside to work out her own 
destiny. At this point she is just ready for marked advance, which 
should be helped and guided. To remain longer with her critic friend 
may cause imitation rather than independence, may lead to contentment 
and cessation of growth. She should now be transferred to the care of 
a second critic of a different personality, but of equal merit. The new 
critic is bound by her duty and her ambition to see that the first half 
year’s advancement is maintained in the second. The pupil teacher 
finds that excellence is not all upon one model. The value of individu- 
ality impresses her. She gains a view of solid principles wrapped in 
diverse characteristics. Her own individuality rises to new impor- - 
tance, and the elements of a growth not at once to be checked start up 
within her. For the care of the second critic a second half year must 
be allowed, which extends the practice work with pupils through an 
entire school year. For the theoretical work a year is by general 
experience proven sufficient. The ideal training course is, then, one of 
two years’ length. 
Provision for the extended practice which is here recommended can be 
made only by city training schools and by normal schools having con- 
nection with the schools of a city. To set apart a building of several 
rooms as a school of practice will answer the purpose only when there 
are very few teachers in training. In order to give each pupil teacher 
a year of practice the number of practice rooms must equal the num- 
ber of teachers to be graduated annually from the training school, be 
the number 10, or 50, or 500. In any considerable city a school for prac- 
tice will not suffice; many schools for practice must be secured. This 
ean be done by selecting one excellent teacher in each of a sufficient 
number of school buildings and making her a critic teacher, giving her 
charge of two schoolrooms, in each of which is placed a pupil teacher 
for training. 
This insures that the teaching shall be done as nearly as may be 
under ordinary conditions, brings the pupil teachers at once into the

482 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
general body of teachers, makes the corps of critics a leaven of zeal 
and good teaching scattered among the schools. This body of critics 
will uplift the schools. More capable in the beginning than the aver- 
age teacher, led to professional study, ambitious for the best things, 
they make greater progress than they otherwise would do, and are 
sufficient in themselves to inspire the general body of teachers. For 
the sake of the pupil teachers, and the children, too, this plan is best. 
Its economy also willreadily be apparent. This plan has been tried for 
several years in the schools of Providence, with results fully equal to 
those herein claimed. 
TESTS OF SUCCESS. 
The tests of success in practice teaching are in the main those to 
be applied to all teaching. Do her pupils grow more honest, indus- 
trious, polite? Do they admire their teacher? Does she secure obedi- 
ence and industry only while demanding it, or has she influence that 
reaches beyond her presence? Do her pupils think well and talk well? 
As to the teacher herself: Has she sympathy and tact, self-reliance 
and originality, breadth and intensity? Is she systematic, direct, and 
business like. Is she courteous, neat in person and in work? Has she 
discernment of character and a just standard of requirement and 
attainment? 
These are some of the questions one must answer before he pronounces 
any teacher a success or a failure. 
“Admission to a training school assumes that the pupil has good 
health, good scholarship, good sense, good ability, and devotion to the 
work of teaching. If all these continue to be exhibited in satisfactory 
degree and the pupil goes through the prescribed course of study and 
practice, the diploma of the school should naturally mark the comple- 
tion of thiswork. If it appears on acquaintance that a serious mistake 
has been made in estimating any of these elements, then, so soon as the 
inistake is fairly apparent and is probably a permanent condition, the 
pupil should be requested to withdraw from the work. This is not a 
case where the wheat and tares should grow together until the harvest 
at graduation day or the examination preceding it. With such a foun- 
dation continually maintained, it is the duty of the school to conquer 
success for each pupil. 
Teaching does not require genius. Indeed genius, in the sense of 
erratic ability, is out of place in the teacher’s chair. Most good teach- 
ers at this close of the nineteenth century are made, not born; made 
from good material well fashioned. There is, however, a possibility 
that some idiosynerasy of character, not readily discovered until the test 
is made, may rise between the prospective teacher and her pupils, 
making her influence over them small or harmful. Such a defect, if it 
exist, will appear during the practice teaching, and the critic will dis- 
cover it. This defect, on its first discovery, should be plainly pointed

  REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN, 483 
out to the teacher in training and her efforts should be joined with 
those of the critic in its removal. 
If this effort be a failure and the defect be one likely to harm the 
pupils hereafter to be taught, then the teacher in training should be 
informed and requested to withdraw from the school. There should be 
no test at the close of the school course to determine fitness for gradu- 
ation. Graduation should find the teacher serious in view of her 
responsibilities, hopeful because she has learned how success is to be 
attained, inspired with the belief that growth in herself and in her 
pupils is the great demand and the great reward. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS FOR SECONDARY SCHOOLS, 
Perhaps one-sixth of the great body of public school teachers in the 
United States are engaged in secondary work and in supervision. These 
are the leading teachers, They give educational tone to communities, 
as well as inspiration to the body of teachers. 
It is of great importance that they be imbued with the professional 
spirit springing from sound professional culture. The very difficult 
and responsible positions that they fill demand ripe scholarship, more 
than ordinary ability, and an intimate knowledge of the period of ado- 
lescence, which Rousseau so aptly styles the second birth. 
The elementary schools provide for the education of the masses. Our 
secondary schools educate our social and business leaders. The careers 
of our college graduates who mainly fill the important places in pro- 
fessional and political life are determined largely by the years of sec- 
ondary training. The college or university gives expansion and finish, 
the secondary school gives character and direction. 
It should not be forgotten that the superintendents of public schools 
are largely taken from the ranks of secondary teachers, and that the 
scholarship, qualities, and training required for the one class are nearly 
equivalent to that demanded for the other. 
Our high schools, too, are the source of supply for teachers in elemen- 
tary schools. Hence the pedagogic influences exerted in the high school 
should lead to excellence in elementary teaching. 
The superintendent who with long foresight looks to the improvement 
of his schools will labor earnestly to improve and especiélly to profes- 
sionalize the teaching in his high school. The management which 
makes the high school an independent portion of the school system, 
merely attached and. loftily superior, which limits the supervision and 
influence of the superintendent to the primary and grammar grades, is 
shortsighted and destructive. 
There ought also to be a place and a plan for the training of teachers 
for normal sehools. The great body of normal and training schools in 
the United States are secondary schools. Those who are to teach in 
these schools need broad scholarship, thorough understanding of edu- 
cational problems, and trained experience. To put into these schools
-P-A-G-E-532
  484 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-94. 
teachers whose scholarship is that of the secondary school and whose 
training is that of the elementary is to narrow and depress rather 
than broaden and elevate. 
If college graduates are put directly into teaching, without special 
study and training, they will teach as they have been taught. The 
methods of college professors are not in all cases the best, and, if they 
were, high school pupils are not to be taught nor disciplined as college 
students are. High school teaching and discipline can be that neither 
of the grammar school nor of the college, but is sui generis. To recog- 
nize this truth and the special differences is vital to success. This 
recognition comes only from much experience, at great loss, and par- 
tial failure, or by happy intuition not usually to be expected, or by 
definite instruction and directed practice. Success in teaching depends 
upon conformity to principles, and these principles are not a part of 
the mental equipment of every educated person. 
These considerations and others are the occasion of a growing con- 
viction, widespread in this land, that secondary teachers should be 
trained for their work even more carefully than elementary teachers 
are trained. This conviction is manifested in the efforts to secure 
normal schools adapted to training teachers for secondary schools, 
notably in Massachusetts and New York, and in the numerous profes- 
sorships of pedagogy established in rapidly increasing numbers in our 
colleges and universities. 
The training of teachers for secondary schools is in several essential 
respects the same as that for teachers of elementary schools. Both 
demand scholarship, theory, and practice. The degree of scholarship 
required for secondary teachers is by common consent fixed at a ‘col- 
legiate education. No one, with rare exceptions, should be employed 
to teach in a high school who has not this fundamental preparation. 
It is not necessary to enter in detail into the work of theoretical 
instraction for secondary teachers. The able men at the head of insti- 
tutions and departments designed for such work neither need nor 
desire advice upon this matter. And yet for the purposes of this 
report it may be allowable to point out a plan for the organization of a 
secondary training school. 
Letit be supposed that two essentials have been found in one locality: 
(1) A college or university having a department of pedagogy and a 
department of post-graduate work; (2) a high school, academy, or pre- 
paratory school whose managers are willing to employ and pay a num- 
ber of graduate students to teach under direction for a portion of each 
day. These two conditions being met, we will suppose that pedagogy 
is offered as an elective to the college seniors. 
Two years of instruction in the science and art of teaching are to be 
provided—one, mostly theory, with some practice, elective during the 
senior year; the other, mostly practice, with some theory, elective for 
one year as post-graduate work. 
During the senior year is to be studied:

  REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. 485 
THE SCIENCE OF TEACHING. 
The elements of this science are: 
I. Psychology in its physiological, apperceptive, and experimental 
features. The period of adolescence here assumes the prominence that 
childhood has in the psychological study preparatory to teaching in 
lower schools. This is the period of beginnings, the beginning of a 
more ambitious and generous life, a life having the future wrapped up 
in it; a transition period of mental storm and stress, in which egoism 
gives way to altruism, romance has charm, and the social, moral, and 
religious feelings bud and bloom. To guide youth at this formative 
stage, in which an active fermentation occurs, that may give wine or 
vinegar, according to conditions, requires a deep and sympathetic 
nature and that knowledge of the changing life which supplies guid- 
ance wise and adequate. 
Il. Methodology: A discussion of the principles of education and of 
the methods of teaching the studies of the secondary schools. 
ILI. School economy should be studied in a much wider and more 
thorough way than is required for elementary teachers. The school 
systems of Germany, France, England, and the leading systems of the 
United States should also be studied. 
IV. History of education, the tracing of modern doctrine back to its 
sources; those streams of influence now flowing and those that have 
disappeared in the sands of the centuries. 
V. The philosophy of education as a division of an all-involving 
philosophy of life and thought in which unity is found. 
THE ART OF TEACHING. 
This includes observation and practice. The observation should 
include the work of different grades and of different localities, with 
minute and searching comparison and reports upon special topies. 
How does excellent primary work differ from excellent grammar grade 
work? How do the standards of excellence differ between grammar 
grades and high school grades? Between high school and college work? 
What are the arguments for and against coeducation in secondary 
schools as determined by experience? What are the upper and lower 
limits of secondary education as determined by the nature of the pupil’s 
effort? 
In the college class in pedagogy much more than in the elementary 
normal school can the class itself be made to afford a means of practice 
to its members. Quizzes may be conducted by students upon the 
chapters of the books read or the lectures of the professors. These 
exercises may have for their object review, or improved statement, or 
enlarged inference and application, and they afford an ample oppor- 
tunity to cultivate the art of questioning, skill in which is the teacher’s 
most essential accomplishment. 
   
-P-A-G-E-534
486 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
The head of the department of pedagogy will of course present the 
essential methods of teaching, and the heads of other departments may 
lecture on methods pertaining to their subject of study; or secondary 
- teachers of known success may still better present the methods now 
approved in the several departments of secondary work 
POST-GRADUATE YEAR. 
To those graduates who have elected pedagogy in their senior year 
may be offered the opportunity of further study in this department, 
with such other post-graduate work as taste and opportunity permit. 
From those selecting advanced work in pedagogy the board in charge 
of the affiliated secondary school should elect as many teachers for its 
school as are needed, employing them for two-thirds time at one-half 
the usual pay for teachers without.experience. Under the professor of 
pedagogy of the college, the principal, and the heads of departments 
of the school these student teachers should do their work, receiving 
advice, criticism, and illustration as occasion requires. The time for 
which they are employed would provide for two hours of class work 
and about one hour of clerical work or study while in charge of a 
schoolroom. These student teachers should be given abundant oppor- 
tunity for the charge of pupils while reciting or studying, at recess and 
dismissals, and should have all the responsibilities of members of the 
faculty of this school. Their work should be inspected as frequently 
as may be by the heads of the departments in‘which they teach, by 
the principal of the school, and by the professor of pedagogy. These 
appointments would be virtually fellowships with an opportunity for 
most profitable experience. 
In the afternoon of each day these students should attend to college 
work and especially to instruction from the professor in pedagogy, who 
could meet them occasionally with the heads of the departments under 
whose direction they are working. 
On Saturdays a seminary of two hours’ duration might be held, con- 
ducted by the professor of pedagogy and attended by ‘the student 
teachers and the more ambitious teachers of experience in the vicinity. 
These seminaries would doubtless be of great profit to both classes of 
participants and the greater to each because of the other. [Such a 
training school for secondary teachers in connection with Brown Uni- 
versity and the Providence high school is contemplated for the coming 
year.] 
It will not be needful to specify further the advantages to the student 
teachers. The arrangement likewise affords advantage to the affiliated 
school, especially in the breadth of view this work would afford to the 
heads of departments, the intense desire it would beget in them for 
professional skill, the number of perplexing problems which it would 
force them to attempt the solution of.

The visits of the professor of pedagogy and the constant comparison 
he would make between actual and ideal conditions would lead him to 
seek the improvement not only of the students in practice but of the 
school as a whole. 
When several earnest and capable people unite in a mutual effort to 
improve themselves and their work all the essential conditions of prog- 
ress are present.

CHAPTER XII. 
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN (ContinvuEp). 
IL—REPoRT OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE CORRELATION OF 
STUDIES IN ELEMENTARY EDUCATION. 
The undersigned committee agrees upon the following report, each 
member reserving for himself the expression of his individual diver- 
gence from the opinion of the majority by a statement appended to his 
signature, enumerating the points to which exception is taken and the 
grounds for them. 
I, CORRELATION OF STUDIES. 
Your committee understands by correlation of studies: 
1. LOGICAL ORDER OF TOPICS AND BRANCHES. 
First, the arrangement of topics in proper sequence in the course of 
study in such a manner that each branch develops in an order suited 
to the natural and easy progress of the child and so that each step is 
taken at the proper time to help his advance to the next step in the 
same branch, or to the next steps in other related branches of the 
course of study. 
2, SYMMETRICAL WHOLE OF STUDIES IN THE WORLD OF HUMAN LEARNING. 
Second, the adjustment of the branches of-study in such a manner 
that the whole course at any given time represents all the great divi- 
sions of human learning, as far as is possible at the stage of maturity 
at which the pupil has arrived, and that each allied group of studies is 
represented by some one of its branches best adapted for the epoch in 
question; it being implied that there is an equivalence of studies to a 
greater or less degree within each group, and that each branch of 
human learning should be represented by some equivalent study, so 
that, while no great division is left unrepresented, no group shall have 
superfluous representatives and thereby debar other groups from a 
proper representation. 
489

490 EDUCATION BEPORT, 1893-94. 
3. PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMMETRY—THE WITOLE MIND. 
Third, the selection and arrangement of the branches and topics 
within each branch considered psychologically with a view to afford 
the best exercise of the faculties of the mind and to secure the unfold- 
ing of those faculties in their natural order, so that no one faculty is so 
overcultivated or so neglected as to produce abnormal or one-sided 
mental development. 
4, CORRELATION: OF PUPIL’S COURSE OF STUDY WITH THE WORLD IN WHICH HE 
LIVES—HIS SPIRITUAL AND NATURAL ENVIRONMENT.     
Fourth and chiefly, your committee understands by correlation of 
studies the selection and arrangement in orderly sequence of such 
objects of study as shall give the child an insight into the world that 
he lives in and a command over its resources such as is obtained by a 
helpful cooperation with one’s fellows. In a word, the chief considera- 
tion to which all others are to be subordinated, in the opinion of your 
committee, is this requirement of the civilization into which the child 
is born, as determining not only what he shall study in school, but what 
habits and customs he shall be taught in the family before the school 
age arrives, as well as that he shall acquire a skilled acquaintance 
with some one of a definite series of trades, professions, or vocations 
in the years that follow school; and, furthermore, that this question of 
the relation of the pupil to his civilization determines what political 
duties he shall assume and what religious faith or spiritual aspirations 
shall be adopted for the conduct of his life. 
To make more clear their reasons for the preference here expressed 
for the objective and practical basis of selection of topics for the course 
of study, rather than the subjective basis so long favored by educa- 
tional writers, your committee would describe the psychological basis, 
already mentioned, as being merely formal in its character, relating 
only to the exercise of the so-called mental faculties. 
It would furnish a training of spiritual powers analogous to the gym- 
nastic training of the muscles of the body. Gymnastics may develop 
strength and agility without leading to any skill in trades or useful 
employment. So an abstract psychological training may develop the 
will, the intellect, the imagination, or the memory, but without leading 
to an exercise of acquired power in the interests of civilization. The 
game of chess would furnish a good course of study for the discipline 
of the powers of attention and calculation of abstract combinations, 
but it would give its possessor little or no knowledge of man or nature. 
The psychological ideal which has prevailed to a large extent in educa- 
tion has in the old phrenology and in the recent studies in physiolog- 
ical psychology sometimes given place to a biological ideal. Instead 
of the view of mind as made up of faculties like will, intellect, imagina- 
tion, and emotion, conceived to be all necessary to the soulif developed
-P-A-G-E-539
  REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. AQ1 
in harmony with one another, the concept of nerves or brain tracts is 
used as the ultimate regulative principle to determine the selection and 
arrangement of studies. Each part of the brain is supposed to have 
its claim on the attention of the educator, and that study is thought to 
be the most valuable which employs normally the larger number of 
_ brain tracts. This view reaches an extreme in the direction of formal 
as opposed to objective or practical grounds for selecting a course of 
study. While the old psychology with its mental faculties concen- 
trated its attention on the mental processes and neglected the world of 
existing objects and relations upon which those processes were directed, 
physiological psychology tends to confine its attention to the physical 
part of the process, the organic changes in the brain cells and their 
functions. 
Your committee is of the opinion that psychology of both kinds, 
physiological and introspective, can hold only a subordinate place in 
the settlement of questions relating to the correlation of studies. The 
branches to be studied and the extent to which they are studied will 
be determined mainly by the demands of one’s civilization. These will 
prescribe what is most useful to make the individual acquainted with 
physical nature and with human nature so as to fit him as an indi- 
vidual to perform his duties in the several institutions—family, civil 
society, the state, and the church. But next after this, psychology 
will furnish important considerations that will largely determine the 
methods of instruction, the order of taking up the several topics so as 
to adapt the school work to the growth of the pupil’s capacity, and the 
amount of work so as not to overtax his powers by too much or arrest 
the development of strength by too little. A vast number of subordi- 
nate details belonging to the pathology of education, such as the 
hygienic features of school architecture and furniture, programmes, the 
length of study hours and of class exercises, recreation, and bedily 
reactions against mental effort, will be finally settled by scientific 
experiment in the department of physiological psychology. 
Inasmuch as your committee is limited to the consideration of the 
correlation of studies in the elementary school, it has considered the 
question of the course of study in general only in so far as this has 
been found necessary in discussing the grounds for the selection of 
studies for the period of school education occupying the eight years 
from 6 to 14 years, or the school period between the kindergarten on 
the one hand and the secondary school on the other. It has not been 
possible to avoid some inquiry into the true distinction between second- 
ary and elementary studies, since one of the most important questions 
forced upon the attention of your committee is that of the abridgment 
of the elementary course of study from eight or more years to seven or 
even six years, and the corresponding increase of the time devoted to 
studies usually assigned to the high school and supposed to belong to 
the secondary course of study for some intrinsic reason.

  492 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
Il, THE COURSE OF STUDY—EDUCATIONAL VALUES. 
Your committee would report that it has discussed in detail the sev- 
eral branches of study that have found a place in the curriculum of 
the elementary school, with a view to discover their educational value 
for developing and training the faculties of the mind, and more espe- 
cially for correlating the pupil with his spiritual and natural environ- 
ment in the world in which he lives. 
A. LANGUAGE STUDIES. 
There is first to be noted the prominent place of language study that 
takes the form of reading, penmanship, and grammar in the first eight 
years’ work of the school. It is claimed for the partiality shown to 
these studies that it is justified by the fact that language is the instru- 
ment that makes possible human social organization. It enables each 
person to communicate his individual experience to his fellows and 
thus permits each to profit by the experience of all. The written and 
printed forms of speech preserve human knowledge and make progress 
in civilization possible. The conclusion is reached that learning to 
read and write should be the leading study of the pupilin his first four 
years of school. Reading and writing are not so much ends in them- 
selves as means for the acquirement of all other human learning. This 
consideration alone would be sufficient to justify their actual place in 
the work of the elementary school. But these branches require of the 
learner a difficult process of analysis. The pupil must identify the 
separate words in the sentence he uses, and in the next place must 
recognize the separate sounds in each word. Itrequires a considerable 
effort for the child or the savage to analyze his sentence into its con- 
stituent words, and a still greater effort to discriminate its elementary 
sounds. Reading, writing, and spelling in their most elementary form 
therefore constitute a severe training in mental analysis for the child 
of 6 to 10 years of age. We are told that it is far more disciplinary to 
the mind than any species of observation of differences among material 
things, because of the fact that the word has a twofold character— 
addressed to external sense as spoken sound to the ear, or as written 
and printed words to the eye—but containing a meaning or sense 
addressed to the understanding and only to be seized by introspection. 
The pupil must call up the corresponding idea by thought, memory, 
and imagination, or else the word will cease to be a word and remain 
only a sound or character. 
On the other hand, observation of things and movements does not 
necessarily involve this twofold act of analysis, introspective and 
objective, but only the latter—the objective analysis. It is granted 
that we all have frequent occasion to condemn poor methods of instruc- 
tion as teaching words rather than things. But we admit that we mean 
empty sounds or characters rather than true words. Our suggestions 
 
-P-A-G-E-541
  REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. 493 
for the correct method of teaching amount in this case simply to laying 
stress on the meaning of the word, and to setting the teaching process 
on the road of analysis of content rather than form. In the case of 
words used to store up external observation the teacher is told to repeat 
and make alive again the act of observation by which the word obtained 
its original meaning. In the case of a word expressing a relation 
between facts or events, the pupil is to be taken step by step through 
the process of reflection by which the idea was built up. Since the 
word, spoken and written, is the sole instrument by which reason can 
fix, preserve, and communicate both the data of sense and the relations 
discovered between them by reflection, no new method in education has 
been able to supplant in the school the branches, reading and penman- 
ship. But the real improvements in method have led teachers to lay 
greater and greater stress on the internal factor of the word, on its 
meaning, and have in manifold ways shown how to repeat the original 
experiences that gave the meaning to concrete words, and the original 
comparisons and logical deductions by which the ideas of relations and 
causal processes arose in the mind and required abstract words to pre- 
serve and communicate them. 
It has been claimed that it would be better to have first a basis of 
knowledge of things, and secondarily and subsequently a knowledge of 
words. But it has been replied to this that the progress of the child 
in learning to talk indicates his ascent out of mere impressions into the 
possession of true knowledge. For he names objects only after he has 
made some syuthesis of his impressions and has formed general ideas. 
He recognizes the same object under different circumstances of time 
and place, and also recognizes other objects belonging to the same class 
by and with names. Hence the use of the word indicates a higher 
degree of self-activity—the stage of mere impressions without words or 
signs being a comparatively passive state of mind. What we mean by 
things first and words afterwards is therefore not the apprehension 
of objects by passive impressions so much as the active investigation 
and experimenting which come after words are used and the higher 
forms of analysis are called into being by that invention of reason 
known as language, which, as before said, is a synthesis of thing and 
thought, of outward sign and inward signification. 
Rational investigation can not precede the invention of language any 
more than blacksmithing can precede the invention of hammers, anvils, 
and pincers. For language is the necessary tool of thought used in 
the conduct of the analysis and synthesis of investigation. 
Your committee would sum up these considerations by saying that 
language rightfully forms the center of instruction in the elementary 
school, but that progress in methods of teaching is to be made, as 
hitherto, chiefly by laying more stress on the internal side of the word, 
its meaning; using better graded steps to build up the chain of experi- 
ence or the train of thought that the word expresses.
-P-A-G-E-542
  494 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
The first three years’ work of the child is occupied mainly with the 
mastery of the printed and written forms of the words of his colloquial 
vocabulary; words that he is already familiar enough with as sounds 
addressed to the ear. He has to become familiar with the new forms 
addressed to the eye, and it would be an unwise method to require him 
to learn many new words at the same time that he is learning to recog- 
nize his old words in their new shape. But as soon as he has acquired 
some facility in reading what is printed in the colloquial style, he may 
go on to selections from standard authors. The literary selections 
should be graded, and are graded in almost all series of readers used 
in our elementary schools, in such a way as to bring those containing 
the fewest words outside of the colloquial vocabulary into the lower 
books of the series, and increasing the difficulties step by step as the 
pupil grows in maturity. The selections are literary works of art pos- 
sessing the required organic unity and a proper reflection of this unity in 
the details, as good works of art must do. But they portray situations 
of the soul, or scenes of life, or elaborated reflections, of which the child 
. can obtain some grasp through his capacity to feel and think, although 
in scope and compass they far surpass his range. They are adapted 
therefore to lead him out of and beyond himself, as spiritual guides. 
Literary style employs, besides words common to the colloquial 
vocabulary, words used in a semitechnical sense expressive of fine 
shades of thought and emotion. The literary work of art furnishes a 
happy expression for some situation of the soul or some train of reflec- 
tion hitherto unutterable in an adequate manner. If the pupil learns 
this literary production, he finds himself powerfully helped to under- 
stand both himself and his fellow-men. The most practical knowledge 
of all, it will be admitted, is a knowledge of human nature—a knowl- 
edge that enables one to combine with his fellow-men and to share 
with them the physical and spiritual wealth of the race. Of this high 
character, as humanizing or civilizing, are the favorite works of litera- 
ture found in the school readers, about one hundred and fifty English 
and American writers being drawn upon for the material. Such are 
Shakespeare’s speeches of Brutus and Mark Antony, Hamlet’s and 
Macbeth’s soliloquies; Milton’s L’Allegro and Il Penseroso; Gray’s 
Elegy; Tennyson’s Charge of the Light Brigade and Ode on the Death 
of the Duke of Wellington; Byron’s Waterloo; Irving’s Rip Van 
Winkle; Webster’s Reply to Hayne, the Trial of Knapp, and Bunker 
Hill oration; Scott’s Lochinvar, Marmion, and Roderick Dhu; Bryant’s 
Thanatopsis; Longfellow’s Psalm of Life, Paul Revere and The Bridge; 
O’Hara’s Bivouac of the Dead; Campbell’s Hohenlinden; Collins’s How 
Sleep the Braye; Wolfe’s Burial of Sir John Moore, and other fine 
prose and poetry from Addison, Emerson, Franklin, the Bible, Haw- 
thorne, Walter Scott, Goldsmith, Wordsworth, Swift, Milton, Cooper, 
Whittier, Lowell, and the rest. The reading and study of fine selec- 
tions in prose and verse furnish the chief sesthetic training of the ele-

mentary school. But this should be reenforced by some study of 
photographic or other reproductions of the world’s great masterpieces 
of architecture, sculpture, and painting. The frequent sight of these 
reproductions is good; the attempt to copy or sketch them with the 
pencil is better; best of all is an esthetic lesson on their composition, 
attempting to describe in words the idea of the whole that gives the 
work its organic unity, and the devices adopted by the artist to reflect 
this idea in the details and reenforce its strength. The wsthetic taste 
of teacher and pupil can be cultivated by such exercises, and once set 
on the road of development this taste may improve through life. 
A third phase of language study in the elementary school is formal 
grammar. The works of literary art in the readers, reenforced as they 
ought to be by supplementary reading at home of the whole works 
from which the selections for the school readers are made, will educate 
the child in the use of a higher and better English style. Technical 
grammar never can do this. Only familiarity with fine English works 
will insure one a good and correct style. But grammar is the science 
of language, and as the first of the seven liberal arts it has long held 
sway in school as the disciplinary study par excellence. A survey of 
its educational value, subjective and objective, usually produces the 
conviction that it is to retain the first place in the future. Its chief 
objective advantage is that it shows the structure of language and 
the logical forms of subject, predicate, and modifier, thus revealing the 
essential nature of thought itself, the most important of all objects, 
because it is self-object. On the subjective or psychological side 
grammar demonstrates its title to the first place by its use as a disci- 
pline in subtle analysis, in logical division and classification, in the 
art of questioning, and in the mental accomplishment of making exact 
definitions. Nor is this an empty, formal discipline, for its subject- 
matter, language, is a product of the reason of a people not as indi- 
viduals, but as a social whole, and the vocabulary holds in its store of 
words the generalized experience of that people, including sensuous 
observation and reflection, feeling and emotion, instinct and volition. 
No formal labor on a great objective field is ever lost wholly, since 
at the very least it has the merit of familiarizing the pupil with the 
contents of some one extensive province that borders on his life, and 
with which he must come into correlation; butit is easy for any special 
formal discipline, when continued too long, to paralyze or arrest growth 
at that stage. The overcultivation of the verbal memory tends to 
arrest the growth of critical attention and reflection. Memory of 
accessory details, too, so much prized in the school, is also cultivated 
often at the expense of an insight into the organizing principle of the 
whole and the causal nexus that binds the parts. So, too, the study of 
quantity, if carried to excess, may warp the mind into a habit of neg- 
lecting quality in its observation and reflection. As there is no sub- 
sumption in the quantitative judgment, but only dead equality or
-P-A-G-E-544
  496 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
inequality (A is equal to or greater or less than B), there is a tendency 
to atrophy in the faculty of concrete syllogistic reasoning on the part 
of the person devoted exclusively to mathematics. For the normal 
syllogism uses judgments wherein the subject is subsumed under the 
predicate (This is a rose—the individual rose is subsumed under the © 
class rose; Socrates is a man, ete.) Such reasoning concerns individ- 
uals in two aspects, first as concrete wholes and secondly as members 
of higher totalities or classes—species and genera. Thus, too, grammar, 
rich as it is in its contents, is only a formal discipline as respects the 
scientific, historic, or literary contents of language, and is indifferent 
to them. A training for four or five years in parsing and grammatical 
analysis practiced on literary works of art (Milton, Shakespeare, Tenny- 
son, Scott) is a training of the pupil into habits of indifference toward 
and neglect of the genius displayed in the literary work of art, and 
into habits of impertinent and trifling attention to elements employed 
as material or texture, and a corresponding neglect of the structural 
form, which alone is the work of the artist. A parallel to this would 
be the mason’s habit of noticing only the brick and mortar or the 
stone and cement in his inspection of the architecture, say of Sir 
Christopher Wren. A child overtrained to analyze and classify shades 
of color—examples of this one finds occasionally in a primary school 
whose specialty is “objective teaching”—might in later life visit an art 
gallery and make an inventory of colors without getting evena glimpse 
of a painting as a work of art. Such overstudy and misuse of grammar 
as one finds in the elementary school, it is feared, exists to some extent 
in secondary schools, and even in colleges, in the work of mastering 
the classic authors. 
Your committee is unanimous in the conviction that formal grammar 
should not be allowed to usurp the place of a study of the literary 
work of art in accordance with literary method. The child can be 
gradually trained to see the technical “motives” of a poem or prose 
work of art and to enjoy the esthetic inventions of the artist. The 
analysis of a work of art should discover the idea that gives it organic 
unity, the collision and the complication resulting, the solution and 
dénouement. Of course these things must be reached in the elemen- 
tary school without even a mention of their technical terms. The 
subject of the piece is brought out; its reflection in the conditions of 
the time and place to heighten interest by showing its importance; its 
second and stronger reflection in the several details of its conflict and 
struggle; its reflection in the dénouement, wherein its struggle ends in 
victory or defeat and the ethical or rational interests are vindicated; 
and the results move outward, returning to the environment again in 
ever-widening circles. Something resembling this is to be found in 
every work of art, and there are salient features which can be briefly 
but profitably made subject of comment in familiar language with even 
the youngest pupils. There is an ethical and an esthetical content to   
 
-P-A-G-E-545
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN, ~ 49T 
each work of art. It is profitable to point out both of these in the 
interest of the child’s growing insight into human nature. The ethical 
should, however, be kept in subordination to the «sthetical, but for the 
sake of the supreme interests of the ethical itself. Otherwise the 
study of a work of art degenerates into a goody-goody performance 
and its effects on the child are to cause a reaction against the moral. 
The child protects his inner individuality against effacement through 
external authority by taking an attitude of rebellion against stories 
with an appended moral. Herein the superiority of the wsthetical in 
literary art is to be seen. For the ethical motive is concealed by the 
poet and the hero is painted with all his brittle individualism and self- 
seeking. His passions and his selfishness, gilded by fine traits of 
bravery and noble manners, interest the youth, interest us all. The 
established social and moral order seems to the ambitious hero to be 
an obstacle to the unfolding of the charms of individuality. The deed 
of violence gets done and the Nemesis is aroused. Now his deed 
comes back on the individual doer and our sympathy turns against 
him and we rejoice in his fall. Thus the «sthetical unity contains 
within it the ethical unity. The lesson of the great poet or novelist is 
taken to heart, whereas the ethical announcement by itself might have 
failed, especially with the most self-active and aspiring of the pupils. 
Aristotle pointed out in his Poetics this advantage of the esthetic 
unity, which Plato in his Republic seems to have missed. Tragedy 
purges us of our passions, to use Aristotle’s expression, because we 
identify our own wrong inclinations with those of the hero, and by 
sympathy we suffer with him and see our intended deed returned upon 
us with tragic effect, and are thereby cured. 
Your committee has dwelt upon the esthetic side of literature in this 
explicit manner because they believe that the general tendency in ele- 
mentary schools is to neglect the literary art for the literary formalities. 
which concern the mechanical material rather than the spiritual form. 
Those formal studies should not be discontinued, but subordinated to. 
the higher study of literature. 
Your committee reserves the subject of language lessons, composition 
writing, and what relates to the child’s expression of ideas in writing 
for consideration under part 3 of this report, treating of programme. 
B. ARITHMETIC. 
Side by side with language study is the study of mathematics in the 
schools, claiming the second place in importance of all studies. It has 
been pointed out that mathematics concerns the laws of time and 
space—their structural form, so to speak—and hence that it formulates 
the logical conditions of all matter both in rest and in motion. Be this 
asit may, the high position of mathematics as the science of all quantity 
is universally acknowledged. The elementary branch of mathematics 
is arithmetic, and this is studied in the primary and grammar schools 
from six to eight years, or even longer. The relation of arithmetic to 
ED 94 32  
-P-A-G-E-546
    498 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
the whole field of mathematics has been stated (by Comte, Howison, 
and others) to be that of the final step in a-process of calculation in 
which results are stated numerically. There are branches that develop 
or derive quantitative functions—say geometry for spatial forms and 
mechanics for movement and rest and the forces producing them. 
Other branches transform these quantitative functions into such forms 
as may be calculated in actual numbers, namely, algebra in its com- 
mon or lower form, and in its higher form as the differential and inte- 
gral calculus and the ealeulus of variations. Arithmetic evaluates or 
finds the numerical value for the functions thus deduced and trans- 
formed. The educational value of arithmetic is thus indicated both as 
concerns its psychological side and its objective practical uses in cor- 
relating man with the world of nature. In this latter respect as fur- 
nishing the key to the outer world in so far as the objects of the latter 
are a matter of direct enumeration—capable of being counted—it is 
the first great step in the conquest of nature. It is the first tool of 
thought that man invents in the work of emancipating himself from 
thraldom to external forces. For by the command of number he learns 
to divide and conquer. He can proportion one force to another and 
concentrate against an obstacle precisely what is needed to overcome 
it. Number also makes possible all the other sciences of nature which 
depend on exact measurement and exact record of phenomena as to the 
following items: Order of succession, date, duration, locality, environ- 
ment, extent of sphere of influence, number of manifestations, number 
of cases of intermittence. All these can be defined accurately only by 
means of number. The educational value of a branch of study that 
furnishes the indispensable first step toward all science of nature is 
obvious. But psychologically its importance further appears in this, 
that it begins with an important step in analysis, namely, the detach- 
ment of the idea of quantity from the concrete whole, which includes 
quality as well as quantity. To count, one drops the qualitative and 
considers only the quantitative aspect. So long as the individual dif- 
ferences (which are qualitative in so far as they distinguish one object 
from another) are considered, the objects can not be counted together. 
When counted the distinctions are dropped out of sight as indifferent. 
As counting is the fundamental operation of arithmetic, and all other 
arithmetical operations are simply devices for speed by using remem- 
bered countings instead of going through the detailed work again each 
time, the hint is furnished the teacher for the first lessons in arithmetic. 
This hint has been generally followed out and the child set to work at 
first upon the counting of objects so much alike that the qualitative 
difference is not suggested to him. He constructs gradually his tables 
of addition, subtraction, and multiplication, and fixes them in his 
memory. Then he takes his next higher step, namely, the apprehension 
of the fraction. This is an expressed ratio of two numbers, and there. 
fore a much more complex thought than he has met with in dealing
-P-A-G-E-547
  REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. 499 
with the simple numbers. In thinking five-sixths, he first thinks five 
and then six, and holding these two in mind thinks the result of the 
first modified by the second. Here are three steps instead of one, and 
the result isnot a simple number but an inference resting on an unper- 
formed operation. This psychological analysis shows the reason for the 
embarrassment of the child on his entrance upon the study of fractions 
and the other operations that imply ratio. The teacher finds all his 
resources in the way of method drawn upon to invent steps and half 
steps, to aid the pupil to make continuous progress here. All these 
devices of method consist in steps by which the pupil descends to the 
simple number and returns to the complex. He turns one of the terms 
into a qualitative unit and thus is enabled to use the other as a simple 
number. The pupil takes the denominator, for example, and makes 
clear his conception of one-sixth as his qualitative unit, then five-sixths 
is as clear to him as five oxen. But he has to repeat this return from 
_ ratio to simple numbers in each of the elementary operations—addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, and division, and in the reduction of frae- 
tions—and finds the road long and tedious at best. In the case of 
decimal fractions the psychological process is more complex still; for 
the pupil has given him one of the terms, the numerator, from which 
he must mentally deduce the denominator from the position of the deci- 
mal point. This doubles the work of reading and recognizing the frac- 
tional number. But it makes addition and subtraction of fractions 
‘nearly as easy as that of simple numbers and assists also in multiplica- 
tion of fractions. But division of decimals is a much more complex 
operation than that of common fractions. 
The want of a psychological analysis of these processes has led 
many good teachers to attempt decimal fractions with their pupils 
before taking up common fractions. In the end they have been forced 
to make introductory steps to aid the pupil, and in these steps to 
introduce the theory of the common fraction. They have by this 
refuted their own theory. 
Besides («) simple numbers and the four operations with them, (b) 
fractions common and decimal, there is (c) a third step in number, 
namely, the theory of powers and roots. It is a further step in ratio, 
namely, the relation of a simple number to itself as power and root. 
The mass of material which fills the arithmetic used in the elementary 
school consists of two kinds of examples: First, those wherein there is 
a direct application of simple numbers, fractions, and powers; and sec- 
ondly, the class of examples involving operations in reaching numer- 
ical solutions through indirect data and consequently involving more 
or less transformation of functions. Of this character is most of the 
so-called higher arithmetic and such problems in the text-book used in 
the elementary schools as have, not inappropriately, been called (by 
Gen. Francis A. Walker in his criticism on common school arithmetic) 
numerical “conundrums.” Their difficulty is not found in the strictly
-P-A-G-E-548
  500 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
arithmetical part of the process of the solution (the third phase above 
described), but rather in the transformation of the quantitative func- 
tion given into the function that can readily be calculated numerically. 
The transformation of functions belongs strictly to algebra. Teachers 
who love arithmetic, and who have themselves success in working out 
the so-called numerical conundrums, defend with much earnestness the 
current practice which uses so much time for arithmetic. They see in 
it a valuable training for ingenuity and logical analysis, and believe 
that the industry which discovers arithmetical ways of transforming 
the functions given in such problems into plain numerical operations 
of adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing is well bestowed. On 
the other hand the critics of this practice contend that there should be 
no merely formal drill in school for its own sake, and there should be, 
always, a substantial content to be gained. They contend that the 
work of the pupil in transforming quantitative functions by arithmet- 
ical methods is wasted, because the pupil needs a more adequate expres- 
sion than number for this purpose; that this has been discovered in alge- 
bra, which enables him to perform with ease such quantitative transfor- 
mations as puzzle the pupil in arithmetic. They hold, therefore, that 
arithmetic pure and simple should be abridged, and elementary algebra 
introduced after the numerical operations in powers, fractions, and 
+ simple numbers have been mastered, together with their applications 
to the tables of weights and measures and to percentage and interest. 
In the seventh year of the elementary course there would be taught 
equations of the first degree and the solution of arithmetical problems 
that fall under proportion or the so-called “rule of three,” together 
with other problems containing complicated conditions—those in part- 
nership for example. In the eight year quadratic equations could be 
learned, and other problems of higher arithmetic solved in a more sat- 
isfactory manner than by numerical methods. It is contended that 
this earlier introduction of algebra, with a sparing use of letters for 
known quantities, would secure far more mathematical progress than is 
obtained at present on the part of all pupils, and that it would enable 
many pupils to go on into secondary and higher education who are now 
kept back on the plea of lack of preparation in arithmetic, the real 
difficulty in many eases being a lack of ability to solve algebraic prob- 
lems by an inferior method. 
Your committee would report that the practice of teaching two les- 
sons daily in arithmetic, one styled “mental” or “intellectual” and the 
other “written” arithmetic (because its exercises are written out with 
pencil or pen), is still continued in many schools. By this device the 
pupil is made to give twice as much time to arithmetic as to any other 
branch. It is contended by the opponents of this practice, with some 
show of reason, that two lessons a day in the study of quantity have a 
tendency to give the mind a bent or set in the direction of thinking 
quantitatively, with a corresponding neglect of the power to observe
-P-A-G-E-549
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. 501 
and to reflect upon qualitative and casual aspects, for mathematics 
does not take account of causes, but only of equality and difference in 
magnitude. It is further objected that the attempt to secure what is 
called thoroughness in the branches taught in the elementary schools 
is often carried too far; in fact, to such an extent as to produce arrested 
development (a sort of mental paralysis) in the mechanical and formal 
stages of growth. The mind in that case loses its appetite for higher 
methods and wider generalizations. The law of apperception, we are 
told, proves that temporary methods of solving problems should not be 
so thoroughly mastered as to be used involuntarily or as a matter of 
unconscious habit, for the reason that a higher and a more adequate 
method of solution will then be found more difficult to acquire. The 
more thoroughly a method is learned, the more it becomes part of the 
mind, and the greater the repugnance of the mind toward a new method. 
For this reason parents and teachers discourage young children from 
tlre practice of counting on the fingers, believing that it will cause much 
trouble later to root out this vicious habit and replace it by purely 
mental processes. Teachers should be zareful, especially with pre- 
cocious children, not to continue too long in the use of a process that 
is becoming mechanical; for itis already growing into a second nature, 
and becoming a part of the unconscious apperceptive process by which 
the mind reacts against the environment, recognizes its presence, and 
explains it to itself. The child that has been overtrained in arithmetic 
reacts apperceptively against his environment chiefly by noticing its 
numerical relations—he counts and adds; his other apperceptive reac- 
tions being feeble, he neglects qualities and causal relations. Another 
child who has been drilled in recognizing colors apperceives the shades 
of color to the neglect of all else. <A third child, excessively trained in 
form studies by the constant use of geometric solids and much practice 
in looking for the fundamental geometric forms lying at the basis of the 
multifarious objects that exist in the world, will as a matter of course 
apperceive geometric forms, ignoring the other phases of objects. 
It is certainly an advance on immediate sense perception to be able 
to separate or analyze the concrete, whole impression, and consider the 
quantity apart by itself. But if arrested mental growth takes place 
here the result is deplorable. That such arrest may be caused by too 
exclusive training in recognizing numerical relations is beyond a doubt. 
Your committee believe that, with the right methods, and a wise use 
of time in preparing the arithmetic lesson in and out of school, five’ 
years are sufficient for the study of mere arithmetic—the five years 
beginning with the second school year and ending with the close of the 
sixth year; and that the seventh and eighth years should be given to 
the algebraic method of dealing with those problems that involve dif- 
ficulties in the transformation of quantitative indirect functions into 
numerical or direct quantitative data.
-P-A-G-E-550
502 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
Your committee, however, does not wish to be understood as recom- 
mending the transfer of algebra as it is understood and taught in most 
secondary schools, to the seventh year or even to-the eighth year of the 
elementary school. The algebra course in the secondary school, as 
taught to pupils in their fifteenth year of age, very properly begins with 
severe exercises with a view to discipline the pupil in analyzing complex 
literate expressions at sight and to make him able to recognize at once 
the factors that are contamed in such combinations of quantities. ‘The 
proposed seyenth-grade algebra must use letters for the unknown quan- 
tities and retain the numerical form of the known quantities, using let- 
ters for these very rarely, except to exhibit the general form of solution 
or what, if stated in words, becomes a so-called “rule” in arithmetic. 
This species of algebra has the character of an introduction or transi- 
tional step to algebra proper. The latter should be taught thoroughly 
in the secondary school. Formerly it was a common practice to teach 
elementary algebra of this sort in the preparatory schools and reserve 
for the college a study of algebra proper. But in this case there was 
often a neglect of sufficient practice in factoring literate quantities, 
and as a consequence the pupil suffered embarrassment in his more 
advanced mathematics; for example, in analytical geometry, the differ- 
ential calculus, and mechanics. The proposition of your committee is 
intended to remedy the two evils already named: First, to aid the pupils 
in the elementary school to solve by a higher method the more difficult 
problems that now find place in advanced arithmetic; and secondly, to 
prepare the pupil for a thorough course in pure algebra in the secondary 
school. 
Your committee is of the opinion that the so-called mental arithmetie 
should be made to alternate with written arithmetic for two years and 
that there should not be two daily lessons in this subject. 
C. GEOGRAPHY, 
The leading branch of the seven liberal arts was grammar, being the 
first of the trivium (grammar, rhetoric, and logic). Arithmetic, how- 
ever, led the second division, the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, 
music, and astronomy). We have glanced at the reasons for the place 
of grammar as leading the humane studies as well as for the place of 
arithmetic as leading the nature studies. Following arithmetic as the 
second study in importance among the branches that correlate man to 
nature is geography. It is interesting to note that the old quadrivium 
of the Middle Ages included geography, under the title of geometry, 
as the branch following arithmetic in the enumeration, the subject- 
matter of their so-called “geometry” being chiefly an abridgment of 
Pliny’s geography, to which were added a few definitions of geometric 
forms, something like the primary course in geometric solids in our 
elementary schools. So long as there has been elementary education 
there has been something of geography included. The Greek educa- 
tion laid stress on teaching the second book of Homer containing the
-P-A-G-E-551
  REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. 503 
Catalogue of the Ships and a brief mention of the geography and his- 
tory of all the Greek tribes that took part in the Trojan war. His- 
tory remains unseparated from geography and geometry in the Middle 
Ages. Geography has preserved this comprehensiveness of meaning 
as a branch of the study in the elementary schools down to the present 
day. After arithmetic, which treats of the abstract or general condi- 
tions of material existence, comes geography with a practical study of 
man’s material habitat and its relations to him. It is not a simple 
science by itself, like botany or geology or astronomy, but a collection 
of sciences levied upon to describe the earth as the dwelling place of 
man and to explain something of its more prominent features. About 
one-fourth of the material relates strictly to the geography, about one- 
half to the inhabitants, their manners, customs, institutions, industries, 
productions, and the remaining one-fourth to items drawn from the 
sciences of mineralogy, meteorology, botany, zoology, and astronomy. 
This predominance of the human feature in a study ostensibly relating 
to physical nature, your committee considers necessary and entirely 
justifiable. The child commences with what is nearest to his interests, 
and proceeds gradually toward what is remote and to be studied for its 
own sake. It is therefore a mistake to suppose that the first phase of 
geography presented to the child should be the process of continent 
formation. He must begin with the natural differences of climate and 
lands and waters and obstacles that separate peoples, and study the 
methods by which man strives to equalize or overcome these differ- 
ences by industry and commerce, to unite all places and all people, and 
make it possible for each to share in the productions of all. The 
industrial and commercial idea is therefore the first central idea in the 
study of geography in the elementary schools. It leads directly to the 
natural elements of difference in climate, soil, and productions, and 
also to those in race, religion, political status, and occupations of the 
inhabitants, with a view to explain the grounds and reasons for this 
counter process of civilization which struggles to overcome the differ- 
ences. Next comes the deeper inquiry into the process of continent 
formation, the physical struggle between the process of upheaving or 
upbuilding of continents and that of their obliteration by air and 
water; the explanation of the mountains, valleys, and plains, the 
islands, voleanie action, the winds, the rain distribution. But the 
study of cities, their location, the purposes they serve as collecting, 
manufacturing, and distributing centers, leads most directly to the 
immediate purpose of geography in the elementary school. From this 
beginning, and holding to it as a permanent interest, the inquiry into 
causes and eonditions proceeds concentrically to the sources of the 
raw materials, the methods of their production, and the climatic, geo- 
logic, and other reasons that explain their location and their growth. 
In recent years, especially through the scientific study of physical 
geography, the processes that go to the formation of climate, soil, and  
-P-A-G-E-552
  504 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
general configuration of land masses have been accurately determined, 
and the methods of teaching so simplified that it is possible to lead out 
from the centrat idea mentioned to the physical explanations of the 
elements of geographical difference quite early in the course of study. 
Setting out from the idea of the use made of the earth by civilization, 
the pupil in the fifth and sixth years of his schooling (at the age of 11 
or 12) may extend his inquiries quite profitably as far as the physical 
explanations of land shapes and climates. In the seventh and eighth 
year of school much more may be done in this direction. But it is 
believed that the distinctively human interest connected with geogra- 
phy in the first years of its study should not yield to the purely scien- 
tific one of physical processes until the pupil has taken up the study 
of history. 
The educational value of geography, as it is and has been in ele- 
mentary schools, is obviously very great. It makes possible some- 
thing like accuracy in the picturing of distant places and events and 
removes a large tract of mere superstition from the mind. In the 
days of newspaper reading one’s stock of geo graphical information is 
in’ constant requisition. A war on the opposite side of the globe is 
followed with more interest in this year than a war near our own bord- 
ers before the era of the telegraph. The general knowledge of the 
locations and boundaries of nations, of their status in civilization 
and their natural advantages for contributing to the world market, 
is of great use to the citizen in forming correct ideas from his daily 
reading. 
The educational value of geography is even more apparent if we 
admit the claims of those who argue that the present epoch is the 
beginning of an era in which public opinion is organized into a ruling 
force by the agency of periodicals and books. Certainly neither the 
newspaper nor the book can influence an illiterate people; they can do 
little to form opinions where the readers have no knowledge of geog- 
raphy. 
As to the psychological value of geography little need be said. It 
exercises in manifold ways the memory of forms and the imagination; 
it brings into exercise the thinking power in tracing back toward unity 
the various series of causes. What educative value there is in geol- 
ogy, meteorology, zoology, ethnology, economics, history, and polities 
is to be found in the more profound study of geography, and, to a pro- 
portionate extent, in the study of its merest elements. 
Your committee is of the opinion that there has been a vast improve- 
ment in the methods of instruction in this branch in recent years, due 
in large measure to the geographical societies of this and other coun- 
tries. At first there prevailed what might be named sailor geography. 
The pupil was compelled to memorize all the capes and headlands, 
bays and harbors, mouths of rivers, islands, sounds, and straits around 
the world. He enlivened this to some extent by brief mention of the
-P-A-G-E-553
  REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. 505 
curiosities and oddities in the way of cataracts, water gaps, caves, 
strange animals, public buildings, picturesque costumes, national exag- 
gerations, and such matters as would furnish good themes for sailors’ 
yarns. Little or nothing was taught to give unity to the isolated 
details furnished in endless number. It was an improvement on this 
when the metbod of memorizing capital cities and political boundaries 
succeeded. With this came the era of map drawing. The study of 
watersheds and commercial routes, of industrial productions and cen- 
ters of manufacture and commerce, has been adopted-in the better 
class of schools. Instruction in geography is growing better by the 
constant introduction of new devices to make plain and intelligible 
the determining influence of physical causes in producing the elements 
of difference and the counter process of industry and commerce by 
which each difference is rendered of use to the whole world and each 
locality made a participator in the productions of all. 
D, HISTORY. 
The next study, ranked in order of value, for the elementary school 
is history. But, as will be seen, the value of history, both practically 
and psychologically, is less in the beginning and greater at the end 
than geography. For it relates to the institutions of men, and espe- 
cially to the political state and its evolution. While biography nar- 
rates the career of the individual, civil history records the careers of 
nations. The nation has been compared to the individual by persons 
interested in the educational value of history. Man has two selves, 
they say, the individual self and the collective self of the organized 
state or nation. The study of history is, then, the study of this 
larger, corporate, social, and civil self. The importance of this idea is 
thus brought out more clearly in its educational significance. For to 
learn this civil self is to learn the substantial condition which makes 
possible the existence of civilized man in all his other social combina- 
tions—the family, the church, and the manifold associated activities of 
civil society. For the state protects these combinations from destruc- 
tion by violence. It defines the limits of individual and associated 
effort, within which each endeavor reenforces the endeavors of all, 
and it uses the strength of the whole nation to prevent such actions 
as pass beyond these safe limits and tend to collision with the normal 
action of the other individuals and social units. Hobbes called the 
state a leviathan, to emphasize its stupendous individuality and organ- 
ized self-activity. Without this, he said, man lives in a state of “con- 
stant war, fear, poverty, filth, ignorance, and wretchedness; within the 
state dwell peace, security, riches, science, and happiness.” The state 
is the collective man who “makes possible the rational development of 
the individual man, like a mortal God, subduing his caprice and pas- 
sion and compelling obedience to law, developing the ideas of justice, 
virtue, and religion, creating property and ownership, nurture and

education.” The education of the child into a knowledge of this 
higher self begins early within the nurture of the family. The child 
sees a policeman or some town officer, some public building, a court- 
house or a jail; he sees or hears of an act of violence, a case of rob- 
bery or murder followed by arrest of the guilty. The omnipresent 
higher self, which has been invisible hitherto, now becomes visible to 
him in its symbols and still more in its acts. 
History in school, it is contended, should be the special branch for 
education in the duties of citizenship. There is ground for this claim. 
History gives a sense of belonging to a higher social unity which pos- 
sesses the right of absolute control over person and property in the 
interest of the safety of the whole. This, of course, is the basis of 
citizenship; the individual must feel this or see this solidarity of the 
state and recognize its supreme authority. But history shows the col- 
lisions of nations, and the victory of one political ideal accompanied 
by the defeat of another. History reveals an evolution of forms of 
government that are better and better adapted to permit individual 
freedom, and the participation of all citizens in the administration of 
the government itself. 
People who make their own government have a special interest in 
the spectacle of political evolution as exhibited in history. But it 
must be admitted that this evolution has not been well presented by 
popular historians. Take, for instance, the familiar example of old-time 
pedagogy, wherein the Roman republic was conceived as a freer gov- 
ernment than the Roman empire that followed it by persons apparently 
misled by the ideas of representative self-government associated with 
the word republic. It was the beginning of a new epoch when this 
illusion was dispelled, and the college student became aware of the true 
Roman meaning of republic, namely, the supremacy of an oligarchy on 
the Tiber that ruled distant provinces in Spain, Gaul, Asia Minor, Ger- 
many, and Africa for its selfish ends and with an ever-increasing arro- 
gance. The people at home in Rome, not having a share in the cam- 
paigns on the border land, did not appreciate the qualities of the great 
leaders who, like Cxsar, subdued the nations by forbearance, magna- 
nimity, trust, and the recognition of a sphere of freedom secured to 
the conquered by the Roman civil laws, which were rigidly enforced by 
the conquerer, as much as by the violence of arms. The change from 
republic to empire meant the final subordination of this tyrannical 
Roman oligarchy, and the recognition of the rights of the provinces to 
Roman freedom. This illustration shows how easily a poor teaching of 
history may pervert its good influence or purpose into a bad one. For 
the Roman monarchy under the empire secured a degree of freedom 
never before attained under the republic, in spite of the election of 
such tyrants as Nero and Caligula to the imperial purple. The civil 
service went on as usual administering the affairs of distant countries, 
educating them in Roman jurisprudence, and cultivating a love for

accumulating private property. Those countries had before lived 
communistically after the style of the tribe or at best of the village 
community. Roman private property in land gave an impulse to the 
development of free individuality such as had always been impossible 
under the social stage of development known as the village community. 
To teach history properly is to dispel this shallow illusion which 
flatters individualism and to open the eyes of the pupil to the true 
nature of freedom, namely, the freedom through obedience to just laws 
enforced by a strong government. 
Your committee has made this apparent digression for the sake of a 
more explicit statement of its conviction of the importance of teach- 
ing history in a different spirit from that of abstract freedom, which 
sometimes means anarchy, although they admit the possibility of an 
opposite extreme, the danger of too little stress on the progressive ele- 
ment in the growth of nations and its manifestation in new and better 
political devices for representing all citizens without weakening the 
central power. 
That the history of one’s own nation is to be taught in the elemen- 
tary school seems fixed by common consent. United States history 
includes first a sketch of the epoch of discoveries and next of the 
epoch of colonization. This fortunately suits the pedagogic require- 
ments. Jor the child loves to approach the stern realities of a firmly 
established civilization through its stages of growth by means of indi- 
vidual enterprise. Here is the use of biography as intreduction to 
history. It treats of exceptional individuals whose lives bring them 
in one way or another into national or even world historical relations, 
They throw light on the nature and necessity of governments, and are 
in turn illuminated by the light thrown back on them by the institu- 
tions which they promote or hinder. The era of semiprivate adven- 
ture with which American history begins is admirably adapted for 
study by the pupil in the elementary stage of his education. So, too, 
is the next epoch, that of colonization. The pioneer is a degree nearer 
to civilization than is the explorer and discoverer. In the colonial 
history the pupil interests himself in the enterprise of aspiring indi- 
vidualities, in their conquest over obstacles of climate and soil; their 
conflicts with the aboriginal population; their choice of land for settle- 
ment; the growth of their cities; above all, their several attempts and 
final success in forming a constitution securing local self-government. 
An epoch of growing interrelation of the colonies succeeds, a tendency 
to union on @ large scale, due to the effect of European wars which 
involved England, France, and other countries, and affected the rela- 
tions of their colonies in America. This epoch, too, abounds in heroic 
personalities, like Wolfe, Montcalm, and Washington, and perilous 
adventures, especially in the Indian warfare. 
The fourth epoch is the Revolution, by which the Colonies through 
joint effort secured their independence and afterwards their union in a

508 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
nation. The subject grows rapidly more complex and tasks severely 
the powers of the pupils in the eighth year of the elementary school. 
The formation of the Constitution, and a brief study of the salient 
‘features of the Constitution itself, conclude the study of the portion of 
the history of the United States that is sufficiently remote to be treated 
after the manner of an educational classic. Everything up to this 
point stands out in strong individual outlines and is admirably fitted 
for that elementary course of study. Beyond this point the war of 
1812 and the war of the rebellion, together with the political events 
that led to it, are matters of memory with the present generation of 
parents and grandparents, and are consequently not so well fitted for 
intensive study in school as the already classic period of our history. 
But these later and latest epochs may be and will be read at home not 
ouly in the text-book on history used in the schools, but also in the 
numerous sketches that appear in newspapers, magazines, and in more 
pretentious shapes. In the intensive study which should be under- 
taken of the classic period of our history the pupil may be taught the 
method appropriate to historical investigation, the many points of view 
from which each event cught to be considered. He should learn to 
discriminate between the theatrical show of events and the solid influ- 
ences that move underneath as ethical causes. Although he is too 
immature for far-reaching reflections, he must be helped to see the 
causal processes of history. Armed with this discipline in historic 
methods, the pupil will do all of his miscellaneous reading and thinking 
in this province with more adequate intellectual reaction than was 
possible before the intensive study carried on in school. 
The study of the outlines of the Constitution for ten or fifteen weeks 
in the final year of the elementary school has been found of great 
educational value. Properly taught, it fixes the idea of the essential 
threefoldness of the constitution of a free government and the necessary 
independence of each constituent power, whether legislative, judicial, 
or executive. This and some idea of the manner and mode of filling 
the official places in these three departments, and of the character of 
the duties with which each department is charged, lay foundations for 
an intelligent citizenship. 
Besides this intensive study of the history of the United States in 
the seventh and eighth years, your committee would recommend oral 
lessons on the salient points of general history, taking a full hour of 
sixty minutes weekly—and preferably all at one time—for the sake of 
the more systematic treatment of the subject of the lesson and the 
deeper impression made on the mind of the pupil. 
E. OTHER BRANCHES. 
Your committee has reviewed the staple branches of the elementary 
course of study in the light of their educational scope and significance. 
 
-P-A-G-E-557
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. 509 
Grammar, literature, arithmetic, geography, and history are the five 
branches upon which the disciplinary work of the elementary school is 
concentrated. Inasmuch as reading is the first of the scholastic arts, 
it is interesting to note that the whole elementary course may be 
described as an extension of the process of learning the art of reading. 
First comes the mastering of the colloquial vocabulary in printed and 
script forms. Next come five incursions into the special vocabularies 
required (a) in literature to express the fine shades of emotion and the 
more subtle distinctions of thought, (b) the technique of arithmetic, 
(c) of geography, (d) of grammar, (e) and of history. 
In the serious work of mastering these several technical vocabularies 
the pupil is assigned daily tasks that he must prepare by independent 
study. The class exercise or recitation is taken up with examining and 
criticising the pupil’s oral statements of what he has learned, especial 
eare being taken to secure the pupil’s explanation of it in his own 
words. This requires paraphrases and definitions of the new words 
and phrases used in technical and literary senses, with a view to insure 
the addition to the mind of the new ideas corresponding to the new 
words. The misunderstandings are corrected and the pupil set on the 
way to use more critical alertness in the preparation of his succeeding 
lessons. The pupil learns as much by the recitations of his fellow- 
pupils as he learns from the teacher, but not the same things. He sees 
in the imperfect statements of his classmates that they apprehended 
the lesson with different presuppositions, and consequently have seen 
some phases of the subject that escaped his observation, while they in 
turn have missed points which he had noticed quite readily. These 
different points of view become more or less his.own, and he may be 
said to grow by adding to his own mind the minds of others. 
It is clear that there are other branches of instruction that may lay 
claim to a place in the course of study of the elementary school; for 
example, the various branches of natural science, vocal music, manual 
training, physical culture, drawing, etc. 
Here the question of another method of instruction is suggested. 
There are lessons that require previous preparation by the pupil him- 
self; there are also lessons that may be taken up without such prepara- 
tion and conducted by the teacher, who leads the exercise and furnishes 
a large part of the information to be learned, enlisting the aid of mem- 
bers of the class for the purpose of bringing home the new material to 
their actual experience. Besides these, there are mechanical exercises 
for purposes of training, such as drawing, penmanship, and calisthenies. 
In the first place, there is industrial and aesthetic drawing, which 
should have a place in all elementary school work. By it is secured 
the training of the hand and eye. Then, too, drawing helps in all the 
other branches that require illustration. Moreover, if used in the 
study of the great works of art in the way hereinbefore mentioned, it 
helps to cultivate the taste and prepares the future workman for a 
 
-P-A-G-E-558

510 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
more useful and lucrative career, inasmuch as superior taste commands 
higher wages in the finishing of all goods. 
Natural science claims a place in the elementary school not so much 
as a disciplinary study side by side with grammar, arithmetic, and 
history, as a training in habits of observation and in the use of the 
technique by which such sciences are expounded. With a knowledge of 
the techical terms and some training in the methods of original inves- 
tigation employed in the sciences, the pupil broadens his views of the 
world and greatly increases his capacity to acquire new knowledge; 
for the pupil who is unacquainted with the technique of science has 
to pass without mental profit the numerous scientific allusions and 
items of information which more and more abound in all our literature, 
whether of an ephemeral or a permanent character. In an age whose 
proudest boast is the progress of science in all domains, there should 
be in the elementary school, from the first, a course in the elements of 
sciences. And this is quite possible, for each science possesses some 
phases that lie very near to the child’s life. These familiar topics 
furnish the doors through which the child enters the various special 
departments. Science, it is claimed, is nothing if not systematic. 
Indeed, science itself may be defined as the interpretation of each fact 
through all other facts of a kindred nature. Admitting that this is so, 
itis no less true that pedagogic method begins with the fragmentary 
knowledge possessed by the pupil and proceeds to organize it and 
build it out systematically in all directions. Hence any science may 
be taken up best on the side nearest the experience of the pupil and 
the investigation continued until the other parts are reached. Thus the 
pedagogical order is not always the logical or scientific order. In this 
respect it agrees with the order of discovery, which is usually some- 
thing quite different from the logical order, for that is the last thing 
discovered. The natural sciences have two general divisions, one 
relating to inorganic matter, as physics and chemistry, and one relating 
to organic, as botany and zoology. ‘There should be a spiral course in 
natural science, commencing each branch with the most interesting 
phases to the child. A first course should be given in botany, zoology, 
and physics, so as to treat of the structure and uses of familar plants 
and animals, and the explanation of physical phenomena as seen in 
the child’s playthings, domesties machines, ete. A second course cov- 
ering the same subjects, but laying more stress on classification and 
functions, will build on to the knowledge already acquired from the 
former lessons and from his recently acquired experience. A third 
course of weekly lessons, conducted by the teacher as before in a con- 
versational style, with experiments and with a comparison of the facts 
of observation already in the possession of the children, will go far to 
helping them to an acquisition of the results of natural science. Those 
of the children specially gifted for observation in some one or more 
departments of nature will be stimulated and encouraged to make tke 
most of their gifts.  
-P-A-G-E-559
  REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. 1 5Pt 
In the opinion of your committee, there should be set apart a full 
hour each week for drawing and the same amount for oral lessons in 
natural science. 
The oral lessons in history have already been mentioned. The spiral 
course, found useful in natural science because of the rapid change in 
capacity of comprehension by the pupil from his sixth to his fourteenth 
year, will also be best for the history course, which will begin with 
biographical adventures of interest to the child and possessing an 
important historical bearing. These will proceed from the native land ~ 
first to England, the parent country, and then to the classic civiliza- 
tions (Greece and Rome being, so to speak, the grandparent countries 
of the American Colonies). These successive courses of oral lessons 
adapted respectively to the child’s capacity will do much to make the 
child well informed on this topic. Oral lessons should never be mere 
lectures, but more like Socratic dialogues, building up a systematic 
knowledge partly from what is already known, partly by new investi- 
gations, and partly by comparison of authorities. 
The best argument in favor of weekly oral lessons in natural science 
and general history is the actual experiences of teachers who have for 
sometime used the plan. It has been found that the lessons in botany, 
zoology, and physies give the pupil much aid in learning his geog- 
raphy and other lessons relating to nature, while the history lessons 
assist very much his comprehension of literature and add interest to 
geography. 
it is understood by your committee that the lessons in physiology 
and hygiene (with special reference to the effects of stimulants and 
nareoties) required by State laws should be ineluded in this oral course 
in natural seience. Manual training, so far as the theory and use of 
the tools for working in wood and iron are concerned, has just claims 
on the elementary school for a reason similar to that which admits 
natural science. From science have proceeded useful inventions for the 
aid of all manner of manufactures and transportation. The child of 
to-day lives in a world where machinery is constantly at his hand. A 
course of training in wood and iron work, together with experimental 
knowledge of physics or natural philosophy, makes it easy for him to 
learn the management of such machines. Sewing and cookery have 
not the same but stronger claims for a place in school. One-half day 
in each week for one-half a year each in the seventh and eighth grades 
will suffice for manual training, the sewing and cookery being studied 
by the girls and the wood and iron work by the boys. It should be 
mentioned, however, that the advocates of manual training in iron and 
wood work recommend these branches for secondary schools, because of 
the greater maturity of bedy and the less likelihcod to acquire wrong 
habits of manipulation in the third period of four years of school. 
Vocal music has long since obtained a well-established place in all 
elementery schools. The labors of two generations of special teachers 
   
-P-A-G-E-560
512 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
have reduced the steps of instruction to such simplicity that whole 
classes may make as regular progress in reading music as in reading 
literature. 
In regard to physical culture your committee is agreed that there 
should be some form of special daily exercises amounting in the aggre- 
gate to one hour each week, the same to include the main features of 
calisthenics and German, Swedish, or American systems of physical 
training, but not to be regarded as a substitute for the old-fashioned 
recess established to permit the free exercise of the pupils in the 
open air. Systematic physical training has for its object rather the will 
training than recreation, and this must not be forgotten. To go from 
a hard lesson to a series of calisthenic exercises is to go from one kind 
of will training to another. Exhaustion of the will should be followed 
by the caprice and wild freedom of the recess. But systematic phys- 
ical exercise has its sufficient reason in its aid to a graceful use of 
the limbs, its development of muscles that are left unused or rudimen- 
tary unless called forth by special training, and for the help it gives to 
the teacher in the way of schoo) discipline. 
. Your committee would mention in this connection instruction in 
morals and manners, which ought to be given in a brief series of les- 
sons each year with a view to build up in the mind a theory of the con- 
ventionalities of polite and pure minded society. If these lessons are 
made too long or too numerous they are apt to become offensive to 
the child’s mind. It is of course understood by your committee that 
the substantial moral training of the school is performed by the disci- 
pline rather than by the instruction in ethical theory. The child is 
trained to be regular and punctual, and to restrain his desire to talk 
and whisper—in these things gaining self-control day by day. The 
essence of moral behavior is self-control. The school teaches good 
behavior. The intercourse of a pupil with his fellows without evil 
words or violent actions is insisted on and secured. The higher moral 
qualities of truth telling and sincerity are taught in every class exercise 
that lays stress on accuracy of statement. 
Your committee has already discussed the importance of teaching 
something of algebraic processes in the seventh and eighth grades, with 
the view to obtaining better methods of solving problems in advanced 
arithmetic. A majority of your committee are of the opinion that 
formal English grammar should be discontinued in the eighth year 
and the study of some foreign language, preferably that of Latin, sub- 
stituted. The educational effect on an English-speaking pupil of 
taking up a language which, like Latin, uses inflections instead of prep- 
ositions, and which further differs from English by the order in which 
its words are arranged in the sentence, is quite marked, and a year of 
Latin places a pupil by a wide interval out of the range of the pupil 
who has continued English grammar without taking up Latin. But 
the effect of the year’s study of Latin increases the youth’s power of
-P-A-G-E-561
  REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. 513 
apperception in very many directions by reason of the fact that so 
much of the English vocabulary used in technical vocabularies, like 
those of geography, grammar, history, and literature, is from a Latin 
source, and besides there are so many traces in the form and substance 
of human learning of the hundreds of years when Latin was the only 
tongue in which observation and reflection could be expressed. 
Your committee refers to the programme given later in this report 
for the details of coordinating these several branches already recom- 
mended, 
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY STUDIES. 
In recommending the introduction of algebraic processes in the sev- 
enth and eighth years, as well as in the recommendation just now made 
to introduce Latin in the eighth year of the elementary course, your 
committee has come face to face with the question of the intrinsic dif- 
ference between elementary and secondary studies. 
Custom has placed algebra, geometry, the history of English litera- 
ture, and Latin in the rank of secondary studies; also general history, 
physical geography, and the elements of physics and chemistry. Ina 
secondary course of four years trigonometry may be added to the 
mathematics; some of the sciences whose elements are used in physical 
geography may be taken up separately in special treatises, as geology, 
botany, and physiology. There may be also a study of whole works of 
English authors, as Shakespeare, Milton, and Scott. Greek is also 
begun in the second or third year of the secondary course. This is the 
custom in most public high schools; but in private secondary schools 
Latin is begun earlier, and so, too, Greek, algebra, and geometry. Some- 
times geometry is taken up before algebra, as is the custom in German 
schools. These arrangements are based partly on tradition, partly on 
the requirements of higher institutions for admission, and partly on 
the ground that the intrinsic difficulties in these studies have fixed 
their places in the course of study. Of those who claim that there is 
an intrinsic reason for the selection and order of these studies some 
base their conclusions on experience in conducting pupils through them, 
others on psychological grounds. The latter contend, for example, that 
algebra deals with general forms of calculation, while arithmetic deals 
with the particular instances of calculation. Whatever deals with the 
particular instance is relatively elementary; whatever deals with the 
general form .is relatively secondary. In the expression a+ b=c ~ 
algebra indicates the form of all addition. This arithmetic can not do, 
except in the form of a verbal rule describing the steps of the opera- 
tion; its examples are all special instances falling under the general 
form givenin algebra. If, therefore, arithmetic is an elementary branch, 
algebra is relatively to it a secondary branch. So, too, geometry, 
though not directly based on arithmetic, has to presuppose an acquaint 
ance with it when it reduces spatial functions into numerical forms, as, 
ED 94——33
-P-A-G-E-562
514 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94, % 
for example, in the measurement of surfaces and solids and in ascer- 
taining the ratio of the circumference to the radius and of the hypote- 
nuse to the two other sides of the right-angled triangle. Geometry, 
moreover, deals with necessary relations. Its demonstrations reach 
universal and necessary conclusions, holding good not merely in such 
material shapes as we have met with in actual experience, but with all 
examples possible, past, present, or future. Such knowledge tran- 
scending experience is intrinsically secondary as compared with the 
first acquaintance with geometric shapes in concrete examples. 
In the case of geometry it is claimed by some that what is called 
“inventional geometry” may be properly introduced into the elemen- 
tary grades. By this some mean the practice with blocks in the shape 
of geometric solids and the construction of different figures from the 
same; others mean the rediscovery by the pupil for himself of the nec- 
essary relations demonstrated by Euclid. The former—exercises of 
construction with blocks—-are well enough in the kindergarten, where 
they assist in learning number, as well as in the analysis of material 
forms. But its educational value is small for pupils advanced into the 
use of books. The original discovery of Euclid’s demonstrations, on 
the other hand, belongs more properly to higher education than to ele- 
mentary. In the geometrical text-books recently introduced into sec- 
ondary schools there is so much of original demonstration required 
that the teacher is greatly embarrassed on account of the differences 
in native capacity for mathematics that develop among the pupils of 
the same class in solving the problems of invention. A few gifted 
pupils delight in the inventions, and develop rapidly in power, while 
the majority of the class use too much time over them, and thus rob 
the other branches of the course of study, or else fall into the bad prac- 
tice of getting help from others in the preparation of their lessons. A 
few in every class fall hopelessly behind and are discouraged. The 
result is an attempt on the part of the teacher to correct the evil by 
requiring a more thorough training in the mathematical studies pre- 
ceding, and the consequent delay of secondary pupils in the lower 
grades of the course in order to bring up their “inventional geometry.” 
Many, discouraged, fail to go on; many more fail to reach higher studies 
because unable to get over the barrier unnecessarily placed before 
them by teachers who desire that no pupils except natural geometri- 
cians shall enter into higher studies. 
Physical geography in its scientific form is very properly made a 
part of the secondary course of study. The pupil in his ninth year of 
work can profitably acquire the scientific technique of geology, botany, 
zoology, meteorology, and ethnology, and in the following years take 
up those sciences separately and push them further, using the method 
of actual investigation. The subject-matter of physical geography is 
of very high interest to the pupil who has studied geography in the 
elementary grades after an approved method. It takes up the proxi-

  REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. 515 
mate grounds and causes for the elements of difference on the earth’s 
surface, already become familiar to him through his elementary studies, 
and pushes them back into deeper, simpler, and more satisfactory prin- 
ciples. This study performs the work also of correlating the sciences 
that relate to organic nature by showing their respective uses to man. 
From the glimpses which the pupil gets of mineralogy, geology, botany, 
zoology, ethnology, and meteorology in their necessary connection as 
geographic conditions he sees the scope and grand significance of those 
separate inquiries. A thirst is aroused in him to pursue his researches 
into their domains. He sees, too, the borderlands in which new dis- 
coveries may be made by the enterprising explorer. 
Physies, including what was called until recently “‘ natural philoso- 
phy,” after Newton’s Principia (Philosophie Naturalis Principia Mathe- 
matica), implies more knowledge of mathematics for its thorough 
discussion than the secondary pupil is likely to possess. In fact, the 
study of this branch in college thirty years ago was crippled by the 
same cause. It should follow the completion of analytical geometry. 
Notwithstanding this, a very profitable study of this subject may be 
made in the second year of the high school or preparatory school, 
although the formulas can then be understood in so far as they imply 
elementary algebra only. The pupil does not get the most exact 
notions of the quantitative laws that rule matter in its states of motion 
and equilibrium, but he does see the action of forces as qualitative 
elements of phenomena and understand quite well the mechanical 
inventions by which men subdue them for his use and safety. Even in 
the elementary grades the pupil can seize very many of these qualita- 
tive aspects and learn the explanation of the mechanical phenomena 
of nature, and other applications of the same principles in invention, 
as, for example, gravitation in falling bodies; its measurement by the 
scales; the part it plays in the pump, the barometer, the pendulum; 
cohesion in mud, clay, glue, paste, mortar, cement, etc.; capillary 
attraction in lamp wicks, sponges, sugar, the sap in plants; the appli- 
cations of lifting by the lever, pulley, inclined plane, wedge, and screw; 
heat in the sun, combustion, friction, steam, thermometer, conduction, 
clothing, cooking, etc.; the phenomena of light, electricity, magnetism, 
and the explanation of such mechanical devices as spectacles, tele- 
scopes, microscopes, prisms, photographic cameras, electric tension in 
bodies, lightning, mariner’s compass, horseshoe magnet, the telegraph, 
the dynamo. This partially qualitative study of forces and mechanical 
inventions has the educational effect of enlightening the pupil and 
emancipating him from the network of superstition that surrounds 
him in the child world, partly of necessity and partly by reason of the 
illiterate adults that he sometimes meets with in the persons of nurses, 
servants, and tradespeople, whose occupations have more attraction 
for him than those of cultured people. The fairy world is a world of 
magic, of immediate interyentions of supernatural spiritual beings,
-P-A-G-E-564
  516 . - EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
and while this is proper enough for the child up to the time of the 
school, and in a lessening degree for some time after, it is only negative 
and harmful in adult manhood and womanhood. It produces arrested 
development of powers of observation and reflection in reference to 
phenomena and stops the growth of the soul at the infantine stage of 
development. Neither is this infantine stage of wonder and magic 
more religious than the stage of disillusion through the study of mathe- 
matics and physics. It is the arrest of religious development also at 
the stage of fetichism. The highest religion, that of pure Christianity, 
sees in the world infinite mediations, all for the purpose of developing 
independent individuality; the perfection of human souls not only in 
one kind of piety, namely, that of the heart, but in the piety of the 
intellect that beholds truth, the piety of the will that does good deeds 
wisely, the piety of the senses that sees the beautiful and realizes it in 
works of art. This is the Christian idea of divine Providence as con- 
trasted with the heathen idea of that Providence, and the study of 
natural philosophy is an essential educational requisite in its attain- 
ment, although a negative means. Of course there is danger of 
replacing the spiritual idea of the divine by the dynamical or mechan- 
ical idea and thus arresting the mind at the stage of pantheism instead 
of fetichism. But this danger can be avoided by further education 
through secondary into higher education, whose entire spirit and 
method are comparative and philosophical in the best sense of the 
term. For higher education seems to have as its province the correla- 
tion of the several branches of human learning in the unity of the 
spiritual view furnished by religion to otir civilization. By it one 
learns to see each branch, each science or art or discipline, in the light 
of all the others. This higher or comparative view is essential to any 
completeness of education, for it alone prevents the one-sidedness of 
hobbies, or ‘“ fads,” as they are called in the slang of theday. It pre- 
vents also the bad effects that flow from the influence of what are 
termed ‘self-educated men,” who for the most part carry up with them 
elementary methods of study, or at best secondary methods, which 
accentuate the facts and relations of natural and spiritual phenomena, 
but.do not deal with their higher correlations. The comparative 
method can not, in fact, be well introduced until the student is some- 
what advanced and has already completed his elementary course of 
study, dealing with the immediate aspects of the world, and his second- 
ary course, dealing with the separate formal and dynamical aspects 
that lie next in order behind the facts of first observation. Higher 
education in a measure unifies these separate formal and dynamic 
aspects, corrects their one-sidedness, and prevents the danger of what 
is so often noted in the self-educated men who unduly exaggerate some 
one of the subordinate aspects of the world and make it a sort of first 
principle.

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. ys 
Here your committee finds in its way the question of the use of the 
full scientific method in the teaching of science in the elementary school. 
The true method has been called the method of investigation, but that 
method as used by the child is only a sad caricature of the method used 
by the mature scientific man, who has long since passed through the 
fragmentary observation and reflection that prevail in the périod of 
childhood, as well as the tendencies to exaggeration of the importance 
of one or another branch of knowledge at the expense of the higher 
unity that correlates all; an exaggeration that manifests itself in the 
possession and use of a hobby. The ideal scientific man has freed him- 
self from obstacles of this kind, whether psychological or objective. 
What astronomical observers call the subjective coefficient must be 
ascertained and eliminated from the record that shows beginnings, end- 
ings, and rates. There is a possibility of perfect specialization in a 
scientific observer only after the elementary and secondary attitudes 
of mind have been outgrown. An attempt to force the child into the 
full scientific method by specialization would cause an arrest of his 
development in the other branches of human learning outside of his 
specialty. He could not properly inventory the data of his own special 
sphere unless he knew how to recognize the defining limits or bounda- 
ries that separate his province from its neighbors. The early days of 
science abounded in examples of confusion of provinces in the invento- 
ries of their data, It is difficult, even now, to decide where physics and 
chemistry leave off and biology begins. 
Your committee does not attempt to state the exact proportion in 
which the child, at his various degrees of advancement, may be able 
to dispense with the guiding influence of teacher and text-book in his 
investigations, but they protest strongly against the illusion under 
which certain zealous advocates of the early introduction of scientific 
method seem to labor. They ignore in their zeal the deduction that 
is to be made for the guiding hand of the teacher, who silently fur- 
nishes to the child the experience that he lacks and quietly directs his 
special attention to this or to that phase and prevents him from hasty 
or false generalization, as well as from undue exaggeration of single 
facts or principles. Here the teacher adds the needed scientific out- 
look which the child lacks, but which the mature scientist possesses 
for himself. 
It is contended by some that the scientific frame of mind is adapted 
only to science, but not to art, literature, and religion, which have 
something essential that science does not reach; not because of the 
incompleteness of the sciences themselves, but because of the attitude 
of the mind assumed in the observation of nature. In analytic inves- 
tigation there is isolation of parts one from another, with a view to 
find the sources of the influences which produce the phenomena shown 
in the object. The mind brings everything to the test of this idea. 
Every phenomenon that exists comes from beyond itself, and analysis 
will be able to trace the source.  
-P-A-G-E-566
518 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
Now, this frame of mind, which insists on a foreign origin of all that 
goes to constitute an object, debars itself in’ advance from the province 
of religion, art, and literature, as well as of philosophy. For self- 
determination personal activity is the first principle assumed by 
religion, and it is tacitly assumed by art and literature, classic and 
Christian. The very definition of philosophy implies this, for it is the 
attempt to explain the world by the assumption of a first principle, 
- and to show that all classes of objects imply that principle as ultimate 
presupposition. According to this view it is important not to attempt 
to hasten the use of a strictly scientific method on the part of the 
child. In his first years he is acquiring the results of civilization 
rather as an outfit of habits, usages, and traditions than as a scientific 
discovery. He can not be expected to stand over against the culture 
of his time and challenge one and all of its conventionalities to justify 
themselves before his reason. His reason is too weak. He is rather 
in the imitation stage of mind than in that of criticism. He will not 
reach the comparative or critical method until the era of higher 
education. 
However this may be, it is clear that the educational value of science 
and its method is a very important question, and that on it depends 
the settlement of the question where specialization may begin. To 
commence the use of the real scientific method would imply a radical 
change also in methods from the beginning. This may be realized by 
considering the hold which even the kindergarten retains upon sym- 
bolism and upon art and literature. But in the opinion of a majority 
of your committee natural science itself should be approached, in the 
earliest years of the elementary school, rather in the form of results, 
with glimpses into the methods by which these results were reached. 
In the last two years (the seventh and eighth) there may be some 
strictness of scientific form and an exhibition of the method of dis- 
covery. ‘The pupil, too, may to some extent put this method in practice 
himself. In the secondary school there should be some laboratory 
work. But the pupil can not be expected to acquire for himself fully 
the scientific method of dealing with nature until the second part of 
higher education—its post-graduate work. Nevertheless this good 
should be kept in view from the. first year of the elementary school 
and there should be a gradual and continual approach to it. 
In the study of general history appears another branch of the sec- 
ondary course. History of the native land is assumed to be an ele- 
mentary study. History of the world is certainly a step further away 
from the experience of the child. It is held by some teachers to be in 
accordance with proper method to begin with the foreign relations of 
one’s native land and to work outward to the world history. The 
European relations involved in the discovery and colonization of 
America furnish the only explanation to a multitude of questions that 
the pupil has started in the elementary school. He should move out- 
 
-P-A-G-E-567
  
  REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. 519 
ward from what he has already learned, by the study of a new concen- 
trie circle of grounds and reasons, according to this view. This, 
however, is not the usual course taken. On beginning secondary his- 
tory the pupil is set back face to face with the period of tradition, just 
when historic traces first make their appearance. He is by this 
arrangement broken off from the part of history that he has become 
acquainted with and made to grapple with that period which has no 
relation to his previous investigations. It is to be said, however, that 
general history lays stress on the religious thread of connection, though 
less now than formerly. The world history is a conception of the 
great Christian thinker, St. Augustine, who held that the world and 
its history is a sort of antiphonic hymn in which God reads his coun- 
sels and the earth and man read the responses. He induced Orosius, 
his pupil, to sketch a general history in the spirit of his view. It was 
natural that the Old Testament histories, and especially the chapters’ 
of Genesis, should furnish the most striking part of its contents. This 
general history was connected with religion and brought closer to the 
experience of the individual than the history of his own people. To 
commence history with the Garden of Eden, the Fall of Man, and the 
Noachian Deluge was to begin with what was most familiar to all 
minds, and most instructive, because it concerned most nearly the con- 
duct of life. Thus, religion furnished the apperceptive material by 
which the early portions of history were recognized, classified, and 
made a part of experience. 
Now that studies in archeology, especially those in the Nile and 
Euphrates valleys, are changing the chronologies and the records of 
early times and adding new records of the past, bringing to light 
national movements and collisions of peoples, together with data by 
which to determine the status of their industrial civilization, their 
religious ideas, and the form of their literature and art, the concentric 
arrangement of all this material around the history of the chosen peo- 
ple as a nucleus is no longer possible. The question has arisen, there- 
fore, whether general history should not be rearranged for the second- 
ary school and made to connect with American history for apperceptive 
material rather than with Old Testament history. To this it has been 
replied with force that the idea of a world history, as St. Augustine 
conceived it, is the noblest educative ideal ever connected with the 
subject of history. Future versions of general history will not desert 
this standpoint, we are told, even if they take as their basis that of 
ethnology and anthropology, for these, too, will exhibit a plan in 
human history—an educative principle that leads nations toward free- 
dom and science, because the Creator of nature has made it, in its 
fundamental constitution, an evolution or progressive development of 
individuality. Thus the idea of divine Providence is retained, though 
made more comprehensive by bringing the whole content of natural 
laws within his will as his method of work.
-P-A-G-E-568
  520 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
These considerations, we are reminded by the partisans of humanity 
studies, point back to the educative value of history as corrective of 
the one-sidedness of the method of science. Science seeks explanation 
in the mechanical conditions of and impulses received from the envi- 
ronment, while history keeps its gaze fixed on human purposes and 
studies the genesis of national actions through the previous stages of 
feelings, convictions, and conscious ideas. In history the pupil has for 
his object self-activity, reaction against environment, instead of mech- 
anism, or activity through another. 
The history of English literature is another study of the secondary 
school. It is very properly placed beyond the elementary school, for as 
taught it consists largely of the biographies of men of letters. The 
pupils who have not yet learned any great work of literature should 
not be pestered with literary biography, for at that stage the greatness 
of the men of letters can not be seen. Plutarch makes great biogra- 
phies because he shows heroic struggles and great deeds. The heroism 
of artists and poets consists in sacrificing all for the sake of their 
creations. The majority of them come off sadly at the hands of the 
biographer for the reason that the very sides of their lives are described 
which they had slighted and neglected for the sake of the Muses. The 
prophets of Israel did not live in city palaces, but in caves; they did 
not wear fine raiment nor feed sumptuously nor conform to the codes 
of polite society. They were not courtiers when they approached the: 
King. They neglected all the other institutions—family, productive 
industry, and state—for the sake of one, the church, and even that not 
the established ceremonial of the people, but a higher and more direct 
communing with Jehovah. So with artists and men of letters it is 
more or less the case that the institutional side of their lives is neg- 
lected or unsymmetrical, or if this is not the case it will be found 
prosaic and uneventful, throwing no light on their matchless productions. 
For these reasons should not the present use of literary biography as 
it exists in secondary schools and is gradually making its way into 
elementary schools be discouraged and the time now given to it devoted 
to the study of literary works of art? It will be admitted that the 
exposure of the foibles of artists has an immoral tendency on youth; 
for example, one affects to be a poet and justifies laxity and self- 
indulgence through the example of Byron. Those who support this 
view hold that we should not dignify the immoral and defective side of 
life by making it a branch of study in school. 
CORRELATION BY SYNTHESIS OF STUDIES. 
Your committee would mention another sense in which the expres- 
sion correlation of studies is sometimes used. It is held by advocates 
of an artificial center of the course of study. They use, for example, 
De Foe’s Robinson Crusoe for a reading exercise and connect with it 
the lessons in geography and arithmetic. It has been pointed out by
-P-A-G-E-569
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. 521 
critics of this method that there is always danger of covering up the 
literary features of the reading matter under accessories of mathematics 
and natural science. If the material for other branches is to be sought 
for in connection with the literary exercise it will distract the atten- 
tion from the poetic unity. On the other hand, arithmetic and geogra- 
phy can not be unfolded freely and comprehensively if they are to wait 
on the opportunities afforded in a poem or novel for their development. 
A correlation of this kind, instead of being a deeper correlation, such 
as is found in all parts of human learning by the studies of the college 
and university, is rather a shallow and uninteresting kind of correlation 
that reminds one of the system of mnemonics, or artificial memory, 
which neglects the association of facts and events with their causes 
and the history of their evolution, and looks for unessential quips, puns, 
or accidental suggestions with a view to strengthening the memory. 
The effect of this is to weaken the power of systematic thinking, which 
deals with essential relations, and substitute for it a chaotic memory 
that ties together things through false and seeming relations, not of the 
things and events, but of the words that denote them. 
The correlation of geography and arithmetic and history in and 
through the unity of a work of fiction is at best an artificial correla- 
tion, which will stand in the way of the true objective correlation. It 
is a temporary scaffolding made for school purposes. Instruction 
should avoid such temporary structures as much as possible, and when 
used they should be only used for the day and not for the year, 
because of the danger of building up an apperceptive center in the 
child’s mind that will not harmonize with the true apperceptive center 
required by the civilization. The story of Robinson Crusoe has intense 
interest to the child as a lesson in sociology, showing him the helpless- 
ness of isolated man and the reenforcement that comes to him through 
society. It shows the importance of the division of labor. All chil- 
dren should read this book in the later years of the elementary course, 
and a few profitable discussions may be had in school regarding its 
significance. But De Foe painted in it only the side of adventure that 
he found in his countrymen in his epoch, England after the defeat of 
the Armada having taken up a career of conquest on the seas, ending 
by colonization and a world commerce. The liking for adventure con- 
tinues to this day among all Anglo-Saxon peoples, and beyond other 
nationalities there is in English-speaking populations a delight in 
building up civilization from the very foundation. This is only, how- 
ever, one phase of the Anglo-Saxon mind. Consequently the history 
of Crusoe is not a proper center for a year’s study in school. It omits 
cities, governments, the world commerce, the international process, the 
church, the newspaper, and the book from view, and they are not even 
reflected in it. 
Your committee would call attention in this connection to the impor- 
tance of the pedagogical principle of analysis and isolation as preced- 
 
-P-A-G-E-570
  522 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
ing synthesis and correlation. There should be rigid isolation of the 
elements of each branch for the purpose of getting a clear conception 
of what is individual and peculiar in a special province of learning. 
Otherwise one will not gain from each its special contribution to the 
whole. That there is some danger from the kind of correlation that 
essays to teach all branches in each will be apparent from this point 
of view. 
Il. THE SCHOOL PROGRAMME. 
In order to find a place in the elementary school for the several 
branches recommended in this report, it will be necessary to use eco- 
nomically the time allotted for the school term, which is about two 
hundred days, exclusive of vacations and holidays. Five days per 
week and five hours of actual school work or a little less per day, after 
excluding recesses for recreation, give about twenty-five hours per 
week. There should be, as far as possible, alternation of study hours 
and recitations (the word recitation being used in the United States 
for class exercise or lesson conducted by the teacher and requiring the 
critical attention of the entire class). Those studies requiring the 
clearest thought should be taken up, as a usual thing, in the morning 
session, Say arithmetic the second half hour of the morning and gram- 
mmar the half hour next succeeding the morning recess for recreation in 
the open air. By some who are anxious to prevent study at home, or 
at least to control its amount, it is thought advisable to place the 
arithmetic lesson after the grammar lesson, so that the study learned 
at home will be grammar instead of arithmetic. It is found by experi- 
ence that if mathematical problems are taken home for solution two 
bad habits arise, namely: In one case the pupil gets assistance from 
his parents or others, and thereby loses to some extent his own power 
of overcoming difficulties by brave and persistent attacks unaided by 
others; the other evil is a habit of consuming long hours in the prepa- 
ration of a lesson that should be prepared in thirty minutes, if all the 
powers of mind are fresh and at command. An average child may 
spend three hours in the preparation of an arithmetic lesson. Indeed, 
in repeated efforts to solve one of the so-ealled “ conundrums,” a whole 
family may spend the entire evening. One of the unpleasant results 
of the next day is that the teacher who conducts the lesson never 
knows the exact capacity and rate of progress of his pupils; in the 
recitation he probes the knowledge and preparation of the pupil, plus 
an unknown amount of preparatory work borrowed from parents and 
others. He even increases the length of the lessons, and requires 
more work at home, when the amount already exceeds the unaided 
capacity of the pupil. 
The lessons should be arranged so as to bring in such exercises as 
furnish relief from intellectual tension between others that make large 
demands on the thinking powers. Such exercises as singing and ealis-
-P-A-G-E-571
    
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. 523 
thenics, writing and drawing, also reading, are of the nature of a relief 
from those recitations that tax the memory, critical alertness, and intro- 
spection, like arithmetic, grammar, and history. 
Your committee has not been able to agree on the question whatlicn 
pupils who leave school early should have a course of study different 
from the course of those who are to continue on into secondary and 
higher work. It is contended, on the one hand, that those who leave 
early should have a more practical course, and that they should dis- 
pense with those studies that seem to be in the nature of preparatory 
work for secondary,and higher education. Such studies as algebra 
and Latin, for example, should not be taken up unless the pupil expects 
to pursue the same for a sufficient time to complete the secondary 
course. It is replied, on the other hand, that it is best to have one 
course for all, because any school education is at best but an initiation 
for the pupil into the art of learning, and that wherever he leaves off 
in his school course he should continue, by the aid of the public 
library and home study, in the work of mastering science and litera- 
ture. Itis further contended that a brief course in higher studies, 
like Latin and algebra, instead of being useless, is of more value than 
any elementary studies that might replace them. The first ten lessons 
in algebra give the pupil the fundamental idea of the general expres- 
sion of arithmetical solutions by means of letters and other symbols. 
Six months’ study of it gives him the power to use the method in stat- 
ing the manifold conditions of a problem in partnership, or in ascer- 
taining a value that depends on several transformations of the data 
given. It is claimed, indeed, that the first few lessons in any branch 
are relatively of more educational value than an equal number of subse- 
quent lessons, because the fundamental ideas and principles of the new 
study are placed at the beginning. In Latin, for instance, the pupil 
learns in his first week’s study the to him strange phenomenon of a 
language that performs by inflections what his own language performs 
by the use of prepositions and auxiliaries. He is still more surprised 
to find that the order of words in a sentence is altogether different in 
Roman usage from that to which he is accustomed. He further begins 
to recognize in the Latin words many roots or stems which are 
employed to denote immediate sensuous objects, while they have been 
adopted into his English tongue to signify fine shades of distinction in 
thought or feeling. By these three things his powers of observation 
in matters of language are armed, as it were, with new faculties. 
Nothing that he has hitherto learned in grammar is so radical and 
far-reaching as what he learns in his first week’s study of Latin. The 
Latin arrangement of words in a sentence indicates a different order 
of mental arrangement in the process of apprehension and expression 
of thought. This arrangement is rendered possible by declensions. 
This amounts to attaching prepositions to the ends of the words, which 
they thus convert into adjectival or adverbial modifiers; whereas the  
-P-A-G-E-572
524 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
separate prepositions of the English must indicate by their position in 
the sentence their grammatical relation. These observations, and the 
new insight into the etymology of English words having a Latin deri- 
vation, are of the nature of mental seeds which will grow and bear 
fruit throughout life in the better command of one’s native tongue. 
All this will come from a very brief time devoted to Latin in school. 
AMOUNT OF TIME FOR EACH BRANCH. 
Your committee recommends that an hour of sixty minutes each 
week be assigned in the programme for each of the following subjects 
throughout the eight years: Physical culture, vocal music, oral lessons 
in natural science (hygiene to be included among the topics under this 
head), oral lessons in biography and general history, and that the 
same amount of time each week shall be devoted to drawing from the 
second year to the eighth, inclusive; to manual training during the sev- 
enth and eighth years so as to include sewing and cookery for the girls 
and work in wood and iron for the boys. 
Your committee recommends that reading be given at least one les- 
son each day for the entire eight years, it being understood, however, 
that there shall be two or more lessons each day in reading in the first 
and second years, in which the recitation is necessarily very short, 
because of the inability of the pupil to give continued close attention, 
and because he has little power of applying himself to the work of pre- 
paring lessons by himself. In the first three years the reading should 
be limited to pieces in the colloquial style, but selections from the 
classics of the language in prose and in poetry shall be read to the 
pupil from time to time, and discussions made of such features of the 
selections read as may interest the pupil. After the third year your 
committee believes that the reading lesson should be given to selections 
from classic authors of English, and that the work of the recitation 
should be divided between (a) the elocution, (b) the grammatical pecu- 
liarities of the language, including spelling, definitions, syntactical 
construction, punctuation, and figures of prosody, and (c) the literary 
contents, including the main and accessory ideas, the emotions painted, 
the deeds described, the devices of style to produce a strong impres- 
sion on the reader. Your committee wishes to lay emphasis on the 
importance of the last item—that of literary study—which should con- 
sume more and more of the time of the recitation from grade to grade 
in the period from the fourth to the eighth year. In the fourth year 
and previously the first item—that of elocution, to secure distinct enun- 
ciation aud correct pronunciation—should be most prominent. In the 
fifth and sixth years the second item—that of spelling, defining, and 
punctuation—should predominate slightly over the other two items. 
In the years from the fifth to the eighth there should be some reading 
of entire stories, such as Gulliver’s Travels, Robinson Crusoe, Rip Van 
Winkle, The Lady of the Lake, Hiawatha, and similar stories adapted
-P-A-G-E-573
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. 525 
in style and subject-matter tc the capacity of the pupils. An hour 
should be devoted each week to conversations on the salient points of 
the story, its literary and ethical bearings. 
Your committee agrees in the opinion that in teaching language care 
should be taken that the pupil practices much in writing exercises and 
original compositions. At first the pupil will use only his colloquial 
vocabulary, but as he gains command of the technical vocabularies of 
geography, arithmetic, and history, and learns the higher literary vocab- 
ulary of his language, he will extend his use of words accordingly. 
Daily from the first year the child will prepare some lesson or portion 
of a lesson in writing. Your committee has included. under the head 
of. oral grammar (from the first to the middle of the fifth year) one 
phase of this written work devoted to the study of the literary form 
and the technicalities of composition in such exercises as letter writ- 
ing, written reviews of the several branches studied, reports of the 
oral lessons in natural science and history, paraphrases of the poems 
and prose literature of the readers, and finally compositions or written 
essays on suitable themes assigned by the teacher, but selected from 
the fields of knowledge studied in school. Care should be taken to 
criticise all paraphases of poetry in respect to the good or bad taste 
shown in the choice of words; parodies should never be permitted. 
It is thought by your committee that the old style of composition 
writing was too formal. It was kept too far away from the other work 
of the pupil. Instead of giving a written account of what he had 
learned in arithmetic, geography, grammar, history, and natural sci- 
ence, the pupil attempted artificial descriptions and reflections on such 
subjects as “Spring,” “Happiness,” “Perseverance,” “Friendship,” or 
something else outside of the line of his school studies. 
Your committee has already expressed its opinion that a good Eng- 
lish style is not to be acquired by the study of grammar so much as by 
familiarity with great masterpieces of literature. We especially recom- 
mend that pupils who have taken up the fourth and fifth readers, con- 
taining the selections from great authors, should often be required to 
make written paraphrases of prose or poetic models of style, using 
their own vocabulary to express the thoughts so far as possible, and 
borrowing the recherché words and phrases of the author where their 
own resources fail them. In this way the pupil learns to see what the 
great author has done to enrich the language and to furnish adequate 
means of expression for. what could not be presented in words before, 
or at least not in so happy a manner. 
Your committee believes that every recitation is, in one aspect of it, 
an attempt to express the thoughts and information of the lesson in the 
pupil’s own words, and thus an initial exercise in composition, The 
regular weekly written review of the important topics in the several 
branches studied is a more elaborate exercise in composition, the pupil 
endeavoring to collect what he knows and to state it systematically and
-P-A-G-E-574
  526 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
‘in proper language. The punctuation, spelling, syntax, penmanship, 
choice of words, and style should not, it is true, be made a matter of 
criticism in connection with the other lessons, but only in the language 
lesson proper. But the pupil will learn language, all the same, by the 
written and oral recitations. The oral grammar lessons, from the first 
year to the middle of the fifth year, should deal chiefly with the use of 
language, gradually introducing the grammatical technique as it is 
needed to describe accurately the correct forms and the usages violated. 
Your committee believes that there is some danger of wasting the 
time of the pupil in these oral and written language lessons in the first 
four years by confining the work of the pupil to the expression of 
ordinary commonplace ideas not related to the subjects of his other 
lessons, especially when the expression is confined to the colloquial 
vocabulary. Such training has been severely and justly condemned as 
teaching what is called prating or gabbling, rather than a noble use 
of English speech. It is clear that the pupil should have a dignified 
and worthy subject of composition, and what is so good for his purpose 
as the themes he has tried to master in his regular lessons? The 
reading lessons will give matter for literary style, the geography for 
scientific style, and the arithmetic for a business Bisuvies for all styles 
should be learned. 
Your committee recommends that selected lists of words difficult to 
spell be made from the reading lessons and mastered by frequent writ- 
ing and oral spelling during the fourth, fifth, and sixth years. 
Your committee recommends that the use of a text-book in grammar 
begin with the second half of the fifth year, and continue until the 
beginning of the study of Latin in the eighth grade, and that 1 daily 
lesson of twenty-five or thirty minutes be devoted to it. 
For Latin we recommend 1 daily lesson of thirty minutes for the 
eighth year. For arithmetic we recommend number work from the 
first year to the eighth, 1 lesson each day, but the use of the text-book 
in number should not, in our opinion, begin until the first quarter of 
the third year. We recommend that the applications of elementary 
algebra to arithmetic, as hereinbefore explained, be substituted for’ 
pure arithmetic in the seventh and eighth years, a daily lesson being 
given. 
Your committee recommends that penmanship as a separate branch 
be taught in the first six years at least 3 lessons per week. : 
Geography, in the opinion of your committee, should begin with oral 
lessons in the second year, and with a text-book in the third quarter of 
the third year, and be continued to the close of the sixth year with 1 
lesson each day, and in the seventh and eighth years with 3 lessons . 
per week. 
History of the United States, with the use of a text-book, your com- 
mittee recommends for the seventh and the first half of the eighth 
year, 1 lesson each day; the Constitution of the United States for the 
third quarter of the eighth year.

Reading: Eight years, with daily lessons. 
Pennmanship: Six years, 10 lessons per week for first two years, 5 for third and 
fourth, and 3 for fifth and sixth, 
Spelling lists: Fourth, fifth, and sixth years, 4 lessons per week. 
Grammar: Oral, with composition or dictation, first. year to middle of fifth year, 
text-book from middle of fifth year to close of seventh year, 5 lessons per 
week. (Composition writing should be included under this head. But the 
written examinations on the several branches should be counted under the 
head of composition work.) 
Latin or French or German: Eighth year, 5 lessons per week. 
Arithmetic: Oral first and second years, text-book third to sixth years, 5 lessons 
per week. 
Algebra: Seventh and eighth years, 5 lessons per week. 
Geography: Oral lessons second year to middle of third year, text-book from 
middle of third year, 5 lessons weekly to seventh year, and 3 lessons to close 
of eighth. 
Natural science and hygiene: Sixty minutes per week, eight years. 
History of United States: Five hours per week seventh year and first half of 
eighth year. 
Constitution of United States: Third quarter in the eighth year. 
General history and biography: Oral lessons, sixty minutes a week, eight years. 
Physical culture: Sixty minutes a week, eight years. 
Vocal music: Sixty minutes a week, eight years. 
Drawing: Sixty minutes a week, eight years. 
Manual training, sewing, and cooking: One-half day each week in seventh and 
eighth years, 
Your committee recommends recitations of fifteen minutes in length 
in the first and second years, of twenty minutes in length in the third 
and fourth years, of twenty-five minutes in the fifth and sixth years, 
and of thirty minutes in the seventh and eighth. 
The results of this programme show for the first and second years 
20 lessons a week of fifteen minutes each, besides 7 other exercises, 
occupying an average of twelve minutes apiece each day; the total 
amount of time occupied in the continuous attention of the recitation 
or class exercises being twelve hours, or an average of two hours and 
twenty-four minutes per day. 
For the third year 20 lessons a week of twenty minutes each, and 5 
general exercises taking up five hours a week, or an average of one 
hour per day, giving an average time per day of two hours and twenty 
minutes for class recitations or exercises. 
In the fourth the recitations increase to 24 (by reason of 4 extra 
lessons in spelling) and the time occupied in recitations and exercises 
to thirteen hours and an average per day of two hours and thirty-six 
minutes,

week. The total is nineteen hours per week, or three and three- 
quarters per day. ; 
The foregoing tabular exhibit shows all of these particulars. 
IV. METHODS AND ORGANIZATION. 
Your committee is agreed that the time devoted to the elementary 
school work should not be reduced from eight years, but they have 
recommended, as hereinbefore stated, that in the seventh and eighth 
years a modified form of algebra be introduced in place of advanced 
arithmetic, and that in the eighth year English grammar yield place 
to Latin. This makes, in their opinion, a proper transition to the 
studies of the secondary school and is calculated to assist the pupil 
materially in his preparation for that work. Hitherto the change 
from the work of the elementary school has been too abrupt, the pupil 
beginning three formal studies at once, namely, algebra, physical 
geography, and Latin. ‘ 
Your committee has found it necessary to discuss the question of 
methods of teaching in numerous instances while considering the ques- 
tion of educational values and programmes, because the value and time 
of beginning of the several branches depend so largely on the method 
of teaching. 
The following recommendations, however, remain for this part of their 
report: 
They would recommend that the specialization of teachers’ work 
should not be attempted before the seventh or eighth year of the ele- 
mentary school, and in not more than one or two studies then. In the 
secondary school it is expected that a teacher will teach one, or at most 
two, branches. In the elementary school, for at least six years, it is 
better, on the whole, to have each teacher instruct his pupils in all the 
branches that they study, for the reason that only in this way can he 
hold an even pressure on the requirements of work, correlating it in 
such a manner that no one study absorbs undue attention. In this 
way the pupils prepare all their lessons under the direct supervision of 
the same teacher, and by their recitations show what defects of meth- 
ods of study there have been in the preparation. 
The ethical training is much more successful under this plan, because 
the personal influence of a teacher is much greater when he or she 
knows minutely the entire scope of the school work. In the case of 
the special teacher the responsibility is divided and the opportunities 
of special acquaintance with character and habits diminished. 
With one teacher, who supervises the study and hears all the recita- 
tions, there is a much better opportunity to cultivate the two kinds of 
attention. The teacher divides his pupils into two classes and hears one 
recite while the other class prepares for the next lesson. The pupils 
reciting are required to pay strict attention to the one of their number 
who is explaining the point assigned him by the teacher; they are to 
ED 94———34
-P-A-G-E-578
530 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
be on the alert to notice any mistakes of statement or omissions of 
important data; they are at the same time to pay close attention to the 
remarks of the teacher. This is one kind of attention which may be 
ealled associated critical attention. The pupils engaged in the prep- 
aration of the next lesson are busy, each one by himself, studying the 
book and mastering its facts and ideas, and comparing them one with 
another, and making the effort to become oblivious of their fellow- 
pupils, the recitation going on, and the teacher. This is another kind 
of attention, which is not associated, but an individual effort to master 
for one’s self without aid a prescribed task and to resist all distracting 
influences. ‘These two disciplines in attention are the best formal 
training that the school affords. 
Your committee has already mentioned a species of faulty correlation 
wherein the attempt is made to study all branches in each, misapplying 
Jacotot’s maxim, “ All is in all” (tout est dans tout). 
A frequent error of this kind is the practice of making every recita- 
tion a language lesson, and interrupting the arithmetic, geography, 
history, literature, or whatever it may be, by calling the pupil’s atten- 
tion abruptly to something in his forms of expression, his pronunciation, 
or to some faulty use of English; thus turning the entire system of 
school work into a series of grammar exercises and weakening the 
power of continuous thought on the objective contents of the several 
branches by creating a pernicious habit of self-consciousness in the 
matter of verbal expression. While your committee would not venture 
to say that there should not be some degree of attention to the verbal 
expression in all lessons, it is of the opinion that it should be limited 
to criticism of the recitation for its want of technical accuracy. The 
technical words in each branch should be discussed: until the pupil is 
familiar with their full force. The faulty English should be criticised as 
showing confusion of thought or memory, and should be corrected in 
this sense. But solecisms of speech should be silently noted by the 
teacher for discussion in the regular language lesson. 
The question of promotion of pupils has oceupied from time to time 
very much attention. Your committee believes that in many systems 
of elementary schools there is injury done by too much formality in 
ascertaining whether the pupils of a given class have completed the 
work up to a given arbitrarily fixed point, and are ready to take up the 
next apportionment of the work. Im the early days of city school 
systems, when the office of superintendent was first created, it was 
thought necessary to divide up the graded course of study into years 
of work, and to hold stated annual examinations to ascertain how many 
pupils could be promoted to the next grade or year’s work. All that 
failed at this examination were set back at the beginning of the year’s 
work to spend another year in reviewing it. This was to meet the con- 
venience of the superintendent, who, it was said, could not hold exam- 
inations to suit the wants of individuals or particular classes. From
-P-A-G-E-579
  
- REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. 531 
this arrangement there naturally resulted a great deal of what is called 
“marking time.” Pupils who had nearly completed the work of the 
year were placed with pupils who had been till now a year’s interval 
below them. Discouragement and demoralization at the thought of 
taking up again a course of lessons learned once before caused many 
pupils to leave school permanently. 
This evil has been remedied in nearly one-half of the cities by pro- 
moting pupils whenever they have completed the work of a grade. The 
constant tendency of classification to become imperfect by reason of 
the difference in rates of advancement of the several pupils, owing to 
disparity in ages, degree of maturity, temperament, and health, makes 
frequent reclassification necessary. This is easily accomplished by 
promoting the few pupils who distance the majority of their classmates 
into the next class above, separated as it is, or ought to be, by an interval 
of less than half a year. The bright pupils thus promoted have to 
struggle to make up the ground covered in the interval between the two 
classes, but they are nearly always able to accomplish this, and gener- 
ally will in two years’ time need another promotion from class to class. 
The procrustean character of the old city systems has been removed 
by this device. 
There remain for mention some other evils besides bad systems of 
promotion due to defects of organization. The school buildings are 
often with superstitious care kept apart exclusively for particular 
gradesof pupils. The central building erected for high school purposes, 
though only half filled, is not made to relieve the neighboring grammar 
school, crowded to such a degree that it can not receive the classes which 
ought to be promoted from the primary schools. It has happened in 
such cases that this superstition prevailed so far that the pupils in the 
primary school building were kept at work on studies already finished 
because they could not be transferred to the grammar school. 
In all good school systems the pupils take up new work when they 
have completed the old, and the bright pupils are transferred to higher 
classes when they have so far distanced their fellows that the amount 
of work fixed for the average ability of the class does not give them 
enough to do. 
In conclusion, your committee would state, by way of explanation, 
that it has been led into many digressions in illustrating the details of 
its recommendations in this report through its desire to make clear 
the grounds on which it has based its conclusions, and through the 
hope that such details will call out a still more thoroughgoing discus- 
sion of the educational values of branches proposed for elementary, 
schools, and of the methods by which those branches may be success- 
fully taught. 
With a view to increase the interest in this subject your committee 
recommends the publication of selected passages from the papers sent
-P-A-G-E-580
532 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
in by invited auxiliary committees and by volunteers, many of these 
containing valuable suggestions not mentioned in this report. 
WILLIAM T. HARRIS, Chairman, 
United States Commissioner of Education, 
Washington, District of Columbia. 
I dissent from the majority report of the committee in regard to the 
following points: 
ARITHMETIC. 
(1) As to fractions.—In teaching arithmetic there does not exist any 
greater difficulty in getting small children to grasp the nature of the 
fraction as such than in getting them to grasp the idea of the simpler 
whole numbers. It is true that the fractions 4, 4, 4, etc., as symbols, 
are a little more complex than are the single digits; but as to the real 
meaning, when once the fractional idea has been properly developed 
by the teacher and the significance of the idea apprehended by the 
pupil, it is as easily understood as any other simple truth. Children 
get the idea of half, third, or quarter of many things long before they 
enter school, and they will as readily learn to add, subtract, multiply, 
and divide fractions as they will whole numbers. In using fractions 
they will draw diagrams and pictures representing the processes of 
work as quickly and easily as they illustrate similar work with integers. 
It is of course assumed that the teacher knows how to teach arithmetic 
to children, or, rather, how to teach the children how to teach them- 
selves. There is really no valid argument why children in the second, 
third, and fourth years in school should not master the fundamental 
operations in fractions. Not only this, they will put the more common 
fractions into the technique of percentage, and do this as well in the 
second and third grades as at any other time in their future progress. 
There is only one new idea involved in this operation, and that consists 
in giving an additional term—per cent—to the fractional symbol. 
‘When one number is a part of another it may be regarded as a frac- 
tional part, or as such a per cent of it. A great deal of percentage is 
thus learned by the pupils early in the course. Children are not hurt 
by learning. Standing still and lost motion kill. 
Every recitation should reach the full swing of the learner’s mind, 
including all his acquisitions on any given topic. But if the teaching of 
fractions be deferred, as it usually is in most schools, the time may be 
materially shortened by teaching addition and subtraction of fractions 
together. This is simple enough if different fractions having common 
denominators are used at first, such as $+ 3=?, and$—$=? Then 
the next step, after sufficient drill on this case, is to take two fractions 
(simple) of different units of value, as4+4—=?,and$—4=? Multi- 
plication and division may be treated similarly. 
In decimals the pupil is really confronted by a simpler form, of 
fractions than the varied forms of common fractions.  
-P-A-G-E-581
  REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. 533 
Devices and illustrations of a material kind are necessary to build up 
in the pupil’s mind at the beginning a clear concept of a tenth, ete., 
and then to show that one-tenth written as a decimal is only a short- 
_ hand way of writing 4 as a common fraction, and soon. He sees very 
soon that the decimal is only a shorthand common fraction, and this 
notion he must hold to. This is the vital point in decimals. The idea 
that they can be changed into common fractions and the reverse at 
will establishes the fact in the pupil’s mind that they are common 
fractions and not uncommon ones. Fixing the decimal point will in a 
short time take care of itself. 
In teaching arithmetic the steps are: (1) Developing the subject till 
each pupil gets a clear conception of it; (2) necessary drill to fix the 
process; (3) connecting the subject with all that has preceded it; (4) its 
applications; (5) the pupil’s ability to sum up clearly and concisely what 
he has learned. 
(2) As to abridgment.—Under this head I hold that a course in arith- 
metic, including simple numbers, fractions, tables of weights and meas- 
ures, percentage and interest, and numerical operations in powers, does 
not fit a pupil to begin the study of algebra. That while he may carry 
the book under his arm to the schoolroom, he is too poorly equipped to 
make headway on this subject, and instead of finishing up algebra in 
a reasonable length of time he is kept too long at it, with a strong prob- 
ability of his becoming disgusted with it. 
There are subjects, however, in the common school arithmetic that) 
may. be dropped out with great advantage, to wit, all but the simplest 
exercises in compound interest, foreign exchange, all foreign moneys 
(except reference tables of values), annuities, alligation, progression; 
and the entire subjects of percentage and interest should be condensed 
into about twenty pages. 
Cancellation, factoring, proportion, evolution, and involution should 
be retained. Cancellation and factoring should be strongly emphasized, 
owing to their immense value in shortening work in arithmetic, algebra, 
and in more advanced subjects. Some drill in the metric system should 
not be omitted. 
(8) As to mental arithmetic.—Till the end of the fourth year the pupil 
does not need a text-book of mental arithmetic. So far his work in 
arithmetic should be about equally divided between written and mental. 
At the beginning of the fifth year, in addition to his written arithmetic, 
he should begin a mental arithmetic and continue it three years, reciting 
at least four mental arithmetic lessons each week. The length of the 
recitation should be twenty minutes, <A pupil well drilled in mental 
arithmetic at the end of the seventh year, if the school age begins at 6," 
is far better prepared to study algebra than the one who has not had 
such a drill. There are a few problems in arithmetic that can be solved 
more easily by algebra than by the ordinary processes of arithmetic, 
but there are many numerical problems in equations of the first degree
-P-A-G-E-582
  534 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94, 
that can be more easily handled, by mental arithmetic than by algebra. 
To attack arithmetical problems by algebra is very much like using a 
tremendous lever to lift a feather. Those who have found a great 
stumbling-block in arithmetical “conundrums,” have, if the inside facts 
were known, been looking in the wrong direction. A deficiency of 
“number-brain-cells” will afford an adequate explanation. 
(4) Rearrangement of subjects—There should be a rearranging of the 
topics in arithmetic so that one subject naturally leads up to the next. 
As an illustration, it is easily seen that whole numbers and fractions can 
be treated together, and that with United States money when the dime is 
reached is the proper time to begin decimals, and that when ‘a square” 
in surface measure first comes up the next step is the square of a num- 
ber as well as its square root, and that solid measure logically lands 
the learner among cubes and cube roots. When he learns that 1,728 
cubic inches make 1 cubic foot he is prepared to find the edge of the 
eube. What is meant here is pointing the way to the next above. All 
depends upon the teacher’s ability to lead the pupil to see conditions 
and relations. My contention is that truth, so far as one is capable of 
taking hold of it when it is properly presented, is always a simple affair. 
(5) As to algebra.—If algebra be commenced at the middle of the 
seventh year let the pupil go at it in earnest and keep at it till he has 
mastered it. Here the best opportunities will be afforded him to con- 
nect his algebraic knowledge to his arithmetical knowledge. He builds 
the one on top of the other. The skillful teacher always insists that 
the learner shall establish and maintain this relationship between the 
two subjects. To switch around the other way appears to me to be the 
same as to omit certain exercises in the common algebra because they 
are more briefly and elegantly treated in the calculus. It is admitted 
that a higher branch of mathematics often throws much light on the 
lower branches, but these side lights should be employed for the pur- 
pose of leading the learner onward to broader generalizations. Unless 
one sees the lower clearly, the higher is obscure. Build solidly the 
foundation on arithmetic—written and mental—and the higher branches 
will be more easily mastered and time saved. 
HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES, 
In teaching this branch in the public schools there dces not appear, 
so far as I can see, any substantial reason why the pupils should not 
study and recite the history of the rebellion in the same manner that 
they do the Revolutionary war. The pupils discuss the late war and 
the causes that led to it with an impartiality of feeling that speaks 
more for their good sense and clear judgment than any other way 
by which their knowledge can be tested. They may not get hold of 
all the causes involved in that conflict, but they get enough to under- 
stand the motives which caused the armies to fight so heroically and 
why the people, both North and South, staked everything on the issue.
-P-A-G-E-583
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. 535 
Just as the men who faced each other for four years and met so often 
in a death grapple will sit down now and quietly talk over their trials, 
sufferings, and conflicts, so do their children talk over these same stir- 
ring scenes. They, too, so far as my experience extends, are singularly 
free from bitterness and prejudice. It is certainly a period of history 
that they should study. 
THE SPELLING BOOK. 
In addition to the “spelling lists” I would supplement with a good 
spelling book. So far no “word list,” however well selected, has sup- 
plied the place of a spelling book. ATI those schools that threw out 
the spelling book and undertook to teach spelling incidentally or by 
word lists failed, and for the same reason that grammar, arithmetic, 
geography, and other branches can not be taught incidentally as the 
pupil or the class reads Robinson Crusoe or any other similar work. 
It is an independent study and as such should be pursued. 
JAMES M. GREENWOOD, 
Superintendent of Schools, Kansas Oity, Mo. 
While affixing my signature to the report of this committee as 
expressing substantial agreement with most of its leading proposi- 
tions, I beg leave also to indicate my dissent from certain of its recom- 
mendations and to suggest certain additions which, in my judgment, 
the report requires. 
(1) There are other forms of true correlation which should be included 
with the four mentioned in the first part of the report and which should 
be as clearly and fully treated as are these four. 
The first is that form of correlation which is popularly understood 
by the name, and which is also called by some writers, concentration, 
coordination, unification, and alludes in general to a division of studies 
into content and form—by content meaning that upon which it is fitting 
that the mind of the child should dwell and by form the means or 
modes of expression by which thoughts are communicated. Or it may 
be thus expressed: the true content of education is (1) philosophy, 
or the knowledge of man as to his motives and hidden springs of action, 
indicated in history and literature, and (2) science, the knowledge 
of nature and its manifestations and laws. Its form is art, which is 
the deliberate, purposeful, and effective expression to others of that 
which has been produced within man by contact with other men and 
with nature, and is commonly referred to as divided into various arts, 
such as reading, writing, drawing, making, and modeling. The relation 
of content and form is that of principle and subordinate, the latter 
receiving its chief value from the former. In a true education they 
are so presented to the mind of the child that he instinctively and 
unconsciously grasps this relation, and is thereby lifted into a higher 
plane of thinking and living thanif the various arts are taught, as 
they too commonly are, without reference to a noble content. This 
 
-P-A-G-E-584
536 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
relation of form to content is vaguely referred to in the report, but 
nowhere definitely treated. It seems to me that it is a true form of 
correlation, and as such deserves special and definite treatment. 
Moreover, it is at present much in the minds of the teachers of this 
country, often in forms that are misleading and harmful. The fact that 
it adds the important element of interest to the dry details of common 
school life makes it especially attractive to progressive and earnest 
teachers, and this committee should recognize its importance and make 
such an utterance upon it as will guide the average teacher to a clear 
comprehension of its meaning and to a wise use of it in the school- 
room. 
Second. There is a still higher form of correlation which is definitely 
referred to later in the report as that ‘‘of the several branches of human 
learning in the unity of the spiritual view furnished by religion to our 
civilization.” This in the report is assigned absolutely to the province 
of higher education. While I do not wish to dissent wholly from this 
view, since it is doubtless true that this higher unity can not be com- 
prehensively stated for the use of a child, yet a wise teacher can so 
present subjects to even a young child that a sense of the unity of all 
knowledge will to a certain degree be unconsciously developed in his 
mind. In regard to certain of the great divisions of human knowledge 
this relation is so evident that they can not be properly presented at 
all unless the relation be made clear. Such studies are history and 
geography. 
(2) The recommendations upon the subject of language should be 
broadened to cover the production of good English by the child him- 
self with the suggestion of suitable topics and proper methods. This 
report confines itself to the absorptive side of education and ignores 
that development of power over nature, man, and self which comes 
from free exercise of faculties and free expression of thought. The 
study of language as something for the child to use himself, the great 
means by which he is to assert his place in civilization and exert his 
influence for: good, is nowhere referred to except in the vaguest way. 
This statement in regard to language applies almost equally well to 
drawing, and here is made evident the importance of the form of cor- 
relation to which I have just referred. The proper material for the 
training of the child in expression is that which is furnished by the 
study of man and nature. His mind being filled with high themes, he 
asserts his individuality, expresses himself in regard to them, and 
thereby gains at once both a closer and clearer comprehension of what 
he has studied and also the power by which he may become a factor 
in his generation. 
(3) I would wish to omit the word “weekly” where it occurs in the 
discussion of the subjects of general history and science, unless it be 
understood to mean that an amount of time in the school year equiva- 
lent to sixty minutes weekly be given to each of these subjects. It is 
 
-P-A-G-E-585
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. 5at 
often better to condense these subjects into certain portions of the year, 
giving more time to them each week and using them as the basis, to a 
certain degree, of language work. I believe that, especially with young 
children, clearer concepts are produced by such connected study pur- 
sued for fewer weeks than by lessons seven days apart. 
(4) In my judgment manual training should not be limited to the 
seventh and eighth grades, but should begin in the kindergarten with 
the simple study of form from objects and the reproduction in paper of 
the objects presented, and should extend, in a series of carefully graded 
lessons, through all the grades, leaving, however, the heavier tools, 
such as the plane, for the seventh and eighth grades. By these means 
an interest is kept up in the various human industries, sympathy for 
all labor is created, and a certain degree of skill is developed; more- 
over, the interest of the pupils in their school is greatly enhanced. 
Manual training has often proved the magnet by which boys at the 
restless age have been kept in school instead of leaving for some gain- 
ful occupation. 
(5) I desire to suggest that geometry may be so taught as to be a 
better mathematical study than algebra to succeed or accompany arith- 
metic in the seventh and eighth grades. I do not refer particularly to 
inventional geometry, to which the committee accords a slighting atten- 
tion, but to constructive geometry and the simplest propositions in 
demonstrative geometry, thus involving the comprehension of the ele- 
mentary geometric forms and their more obvious relations. This study 
may be made of especial interest in connection with manual training 
and drawing, while it presents fewer difficulties to the immature mind 
than the abstractions of algebra, since it connects more directiy with 
the concrete, by which its presentation may often be aided. 
(6) While agreeing fully with the majority of the committee that the 
full scientific method should not be applied to the study of elementary 
science by young children, yet I am compelled to favor more of experi- 
mentation and observation by the child, and less of telling by the 
teacher than the report would seem to favor. 
(7) I would go further than the majority of the committee, and insist 
that except in rare cases there should be no specialization of the teach- 
ing force below the high school, and that even in the first years of the 
high school, so far as possible, specialization should be subordinated to 
a general care of the child’s welfare and oversight of his methods of 
study, which are impossible when a corps of teachers give instruction, 
each in one subject, and see the student only during the hour of reci- 
tation. 
(8) While in the main I agree with the bald statements under the 
head “ Correlation by synthesis of studies,” since reference is made to 
only a very artificial mode of synthesis not at all in vogue in this coun- 
try, I must dissent emphatically from this portion of the report as by 
inference condemning a most important department of correlation, to  
-P-A-G-E-586
  538 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
which I have referred earlier. The doctrine of concentration is not 
necessarily artificial; rather it refers to the higher unity, of which this 
committee has spoken in glowing terms as belonging to the province of 
higher education. It also includes the division of the school curricu- 
lum into content and form, which this committee inferentially adopts in 
its treatment of language. I do not believe, any more than do the 
majority of the committee, that the entire course of study can De liter- 
ally and exactly centered about a single subject, nor do I believe in any 
artificial correlation; but there.is a natural relation of all knowledges, 
which this committee admits in various places, and which is the basis 
of a proper synthesis of studies, according to the psychological principle 
of apperception. 
(9) If by the term “oral,” as applied to lessons in biography and in 
natural science, the committee means, as the word would imply, that 
the instruction is to be given in the form of lectures by the teacher, I 
can not in full agree with the committee’s conclusions. As I have 
already stated, in natural science the work should be largely that of 
observation, and in history and biography, while in the very lowest 
grades the teachers should tell the children stories, as soon as it is pos- 
sible the desired information should be obtained by the student through 
reading. To this end the reading lesson in school should be properly 
correlated with his other studies, and he should be advised as to his 
home reading. The information thus obtained should be the subject of 
conversation in the class, and should furnish the material for much of 
the written language work of the children. 
(10) I must dissent emphatically and entirely from that portion of the 
report which recommends that a text-book in grammar be introduced 
into the fifth year of the child’s school life. Itis a questionin my mind 
whether it would not be better if the text-book were not introduced into 
the grades below the high school at all. Certainly it should not appear 
before the seventh year. Such knowledge of grammar as will familiar- 
ize the child with the structure of the sentence, the basis of all lan- 
guage, and as will enable him to use correctly forms of speech which 
the necessities of expression require, should be given orally by the 
teacher in connection with the child’s written work, when needed; but 
against the introduction of a text-book upon grammar, the most 
abstruse of all the subjects of the school curriculum, when the pupil is 
not more than 10 years old, I must protest. Instead of that the child 
should devote much time, some every day, to writing upon proper 
themes in the best English he can command, furnishing occasion to the 
teacher to correct such errors as he may make, and acquiring by use 
acquaintance with the correct forms of grammar. If, as will doubtless 
be the case in most cities, local conditions render the introduction of 
Latin into the eighth grade inadvisable, this study of grammar may be 
made in that grade somewhat more intensive.

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. 559 
(11) If by a text-book in geography is meant that which is commonly 
understood by the term, and not simply geographical reading matter, 
in my judgment it should not be introduced earlier than the fifth year. 
These suggestions and expressions of dissent, if approved by the 
committee, would necessitate some change inthe programme submit- 
ted, the most important of which would be the making room for the 
production of English in the grades. This could be provided in the 
first and second grades by taking some of the time devoted to penman- 
ship and doing the work partly in connection with the reading classes. 
In the third and fourth grades it should take some of the time devoted 
to penmanship, and should be studied also in connection with geogra- 
phy and reading, and in the fifth and sixth grades it should take all of 
the time given to grammar. 
I regret to be compelled to express dissent upon so many points, but 
as most of them appear to me vital and as the differences appear to be 
not merely superficial but fundamental, affecting and affected by one’s 
entire educational creed, I can not do otherwise. To most of the report 
I most gladly give my assent and approval. 
CHARLES B. GILBERT, 
Superintendent of Schools, St. Paul, Minn. 
I agree most heartily with the main features of the foregoing report 
of the subcommittee on correlation of studies. It is so admirable in its 
analysis of subjects and in its statement of comparative education 
values, and so suggestive in its practical applications to teaching, that 
I regret to find myself appearing in any way to dissent from its con- 
clusions. Indeed my principal objection is not against anything con- 
tained in the report (unless it be against a possible inference which 
might be drawn at one point), but it refers rather to what seems to me 
to be an omission. 
In addition to all the forms of correlation recommended in the report, 
it seems to me possible to make a correlation of subjects in a pro- 
gramme in such way that the selection of subject-matter may be, to 
some extent, from all fields of knowledge. These selections should be 
such as are related to one another so as to be mutually helpful in acqui- 
sition. They should be the main features of knowledge in the different 
departments. 
These different departments, from which the chosen subjects should 
be taken, must be fundamental ones, and must be sufficiently numerous 
to represent universal culture. The report itself indicates conclusively 
what these are. 
Reference is made in the report to various attempts that have been 
made to correlate subjects of study. 
A very just criticism is made upon that attempt at correlation by 
the use of the story of Robinson Crusoe as a center of correlation. It 
is distinctly pointed out in the report that the experiences of Robinson  
-P-A-G-E-588
  540 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
Crusoe are lacking in many of the elements of universal culture, and in 
many elements of education needed to adjust the individual properly 
to the civilization of our time and country. It is equaliy evident that 
the attempt to make this story the center of correlation leads directly 
to trivial exercises in other subjects in order to make them “correlate” 
with Robinson Crusoe. It is also shown in the report that it naturally 
leads to fragmentary knowledge of many subjects very much interior 
to that clear, logically connected knowledge of a subject which may be 
had by pursuing it without reférence to correlating it with all others. 
It is at this point that, in my judgment, a wrong inference is per- 
mitted by the report. 
It does not, as it seems to me, follow that because correlation based 
on Robinson Crusoe is a failure all correlations having the same gen- 
eral purpose will necessarily prove failures. For my own part, I do not 
believe that correlation needs any “center,” outside the child and its 
natural activities. If, however, it seems wiser to give special promi- 
nence to any given field of acquisition, it should, in my judgment, be 
accorded to language and its closely related subjects—reading, spell- 
ing, writing, composing, study of literature, etc. Indeed language, as 
a mode of expression, is organically related to thinking, in all fields 
of knowledge, as form is related to content. A “system” or “pro- 
gramme” of correlation on this basis would seek for fundamental 
ideas in all the leading branches, and make them themes of thought 
and occasions of language exercises. The selections would omit all 
trivialities in all subjects, and would not attempt to correlate for 
the mere sake of correlation; but would seek to correlate wherever 
by such correlation kindred themes may be made to illuminate one 
another. To illustrate, concrete problems in arithmetic would be 
sought that would clearly develop and illustrate mathematical ideas 
and their application; but in a secondary way these problems would 
be sought for in the various departments of concrete knowledge— 
geography, history, physics, chemistry, astronomy, meteorology, polit- 
ical, industrial, or domestic economy. But none of these themes would 
be so relied upon for problems as to compel one to choose unreasonable 
or trivial relations on which to base them. The problems themselves 
should represent true and important facts and relations of the other sub- 
jects as surely and rigidly as they should involve correct mathematical 
principles; and all such exercises should be rightly related to the child’s 
education in language. 
In like manner, when a child is engaged in nature study of any kind, 
some valuable problems in mathematics may be found rightly related, 
both to the subject directly in hand and the child’s natural progress in 
arithmetic. Also many of the lessons in nature study are directly 
related to some of the finest literature ever produced, in which analo- 
gies of nature are made the means of expression for the finest and 
most delicate of the human experiences. When the child has mastered
-P-A-G-E-589
  REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. 541 
the physical facts on which the literary inspiration is based is the true 
time to give him the advantage of the study of such literature. These 
ideas are not only rightly related to one another, but to the mind itself. 
It is, so to speak, the nascent moment when the mind can easily and 
fully master what might else remain an impenetrable mystery, and all 
because subjects and occasion have come into happy conjunction. 
This is not the place in which to attempt any elaboration of such a 
system of correlation. But I feel that its absence from the report may 
make many persons feel that the latter is so far incomplete. 
L. H. JONES, 
Superintendent of Schools, Cleveland, Ohio. 
With the main lines of thought in this report I find myself in agree- 
ment. With many of its details, however, Iam not in accord. Iregret 
to have to express my dissent from its conclusions in the following 
particulars: 
(1) The report makes too little of the uses of grammar as supplying 
canons of criticism which enable the pupil to correct his own English, 
and as furnishing a key (grammatical analysis) that gives him the 
power to see the meaning of obscure or involved sentences. 
(2) For the study of literature complete works are to be preferred to 
the selections found in school readers. 
(3) That species of language exercise known as paraphrasing I 
regard as harmful. 
(4) The study of number should not be omitted from the first year in 
school. Practice in the primary operations of arithmetic should not 
be omitted from the seventh and eighth years. The quadratic equation 
should be reserved for the high school. 
(5) The foreign language introduced into the elementary school 
course should be a modern language—French or German. Latin should 
be reserved for those who have time and opportunity to master its 
literature. 
(6) In the general programme of studies the school day is cut up 
into too many short periods. The tendency of such a programme as 
that in the text would be to destroy repose of mind and render reflec- 
tion almost an impossibility. 
(7) I desire to expréss my agreement with the opinions stated in see- 
tions 2, 3, 6, and 9 of Mr. Gilbert’s dissenting opinion, and in the main 
with what Mr. Jones says on the correlation of studies.

CHAPTER XIII 
. REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN—Continvep. 
Iil.—ReEPoRT OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE ORGANIZATION OF 
Ciry ScHOOL SYSTEMS. 
It is understood that the committee is to treat of city school systems 
which are so large that persons chosen by the people to manage them, 
and serving without pay, can not be expected to transact all the busi- 
ness of the system in person, nor to have personal knowledge of all 
business transactions; and which are also so large that one person 
employed to supervise the instruction can not be assumed to personally 
manage or direct all of the details thereof; but must, in each case, act 
under plans of organization and administration established by law, and 
through assistants and representatives. 
The end for which a school system exists is the instruction of the 
children, the word instruction being used with the meaning it attains in 
the mind of a well-educated person, if not in the mind of an educational 
expert. 
To secure this end, no plan of organization alone will suffice. Noth- 
ing can take the place of a sincere desire for good schools, of a fair 
knowledge of what good schools are and of what will make them, of a 
public spirit and a moral sense on the part of the people, which are 
spontaneous or which can be appealed to with confidence. Fortunately 
the interest which the people have in their own children is so large, and 
the anxiety of the community for public order and security is so great, 
that public sentiment may ordinarily be relied upon, or may be aroused 
to action, to choose proper representatives and take proper measures 
for the administration of the schools. If, in any case, this is not so, 
there is little hope of efficient schools. Wherever it is so, it alone will 
not suffice; but proper organization may become the instrument of 
public sentiment and develop schools that will be equal to the needs of 
all and become the safeguards of citizenship. 
Efficient schools can be secured only by providing suitable buildings 
and appliances and by keeping them in proper order, on the one hand, 
and, on the other hand, by employing, organizing, aiding, and directing 
teachers so that the instruction shall have life and power to accomplish 
the great end for which schools are maintained. 
513  
-P-A-G-E-592
  
  544 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94, 
The circumstances of the case naturally and quickly separate the 
duties of administration into two great departments, one which man- 
ages the business affairs, and the other which supervises the instruec- 
tion. The business affairs of the school system may be transacted by 
any citizens of common honesty, correct purposes, and of good business 
experience and sagacity. The instruction will be ineffective and 
abnormally expensive unless put upon a scientific educational basis 
and supervised by competent educational experts. 
There will be a waste of money and effort, and a lack of results, 
unless the authorities of these two departments are sympathetic with 
each other; that is, unless, on the one hand, the business management 
is sound, is appreciative of good teaching, looks upon it as a scientific 
and professional employment, and is alert to sustain it; and unless, on 
the other hand, the instructors are competent and self-respecting, know 
what good business management is, are glad to uphold it, and are able 
to respect those who are charged with responsibility for it. 
To secure efficiency in these departments, there must be adequate 
authority and quick public accountability. The problem is not merely 
to secure some good schoolhouses, but good schoolhouses wherever 
needed, and to avoid the use of all houses which are not suitable; it is 
not to get some good teaching, but to prevent all bad teaching and to 
advance all fhe teaching to the highest possible point of special train- 
ing, of professional spirit, and of life-giving power. All of the busi- 
ness matters must be intrusted to competent business hands and 
managed upon sound business principles, and all of the instruction 
must be put upon a professional basis. To insure this, there must be 
deliberation and wisdom in determining policy, and then the power to 
do what is determined upon must be present and capable of exercise, 
and the responsibility for the proper exercise of the power must, in 
each case, be individual and immediate. 
It is imperative that we discriminate between the legislative and 
the executive action in organizing and administering the schools. The 
influences which enter into legislative action looking to the general 
organization and work of the schools must necessarily and fundamen- 
tally flow directly from the people and be widely spread. The greater 
the number of people, in proportion to the entire population, who can 
be led to take a positive interest and an active part in securing good 
schools the better will the schools be, provided the people can secure 
the complete execution of their purposes and plans. But experience 
has clearly shown that many causes intervene to prevent the complete 
execution of such plans; that all the natural enemies of sound admin- 
istration scent plenty of plunder and are especially active here; that 
good school administration requires much strength of character, much 
business experience, much technical knowledge, and can be measurably 
satisfactory only when the responsibility is adequate and the penalties 
for maladministration are severe. Decentralization in making the plan
-P-A-G-E-593
  REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. 545 
and determining what shall be done, and centralization in executing 
the plan and in doing what is to be done, are perhaps equally important. 
It should be remembered that the character of the school work of a 
city is not merely a matter of local interest, and that the maintenance 
of the schools does not rest merely or mainly upon local authority. 
The people of the municipality, acting, and ordinarily glad to act, but 
in any event being required to act, under and pursuant to the law 
which has been ordained by the sovereign authority of the State, estab. 
lish and maintain schools. They must have the taxing power which 
the State alone possesses in order to enable them to proceed at all. 
They must regard the directions which the State sees fit to give as to 
the essential character of the schools, when it exercises in their behalf 
or when it delegates to them the power of taxation. 
The plan should be flexible for good, while inflexible for evil. After 
meeting essential requirements, the people of the municipality may and 
should be empowered to proceed as much further as they will in elab- 
orating a system of schools. The higher the plane of average intelli- 
gence, and the more generally and the more directly the people act in 
deciding what shall be done, and the greater the facility and complete- 
ness with which the intelligence of the city is able to secure the proper 
execution of its plans by officers appointed for that purpose, the more 
elaborate and the more efficient will be the schools. 
It is idle to suggest that centering executive functions is unwisely 
taking power away from the people. The people can not execute plans 
themselves. The authority to do so must necessarily be delegated. 
The question simply is, Shall it be given to a number of persons, and if 
so, to how many? Or to only one? This question is to be decided by 
experience, and it is of course true that experience has not been uni- 
form. But it is doubtless true that the general experience of the com- 
munities of the country has shown that where purely executive functions 
are conferred upon a number of persons jointly, they yield to antag- 
onistic influences and shift the responsibility from one to another; and 
that centering the responsibility for the proper discharge of executive 
duties upon a single person, who gets the credit of good work and 
must bear the disgrace or penalty of bad work, and who can quickly 
be held accountable for misdeeds and inefficiency, has secured the full- 
est execution of public plans and largest results. To call this ‘central- 
ization,” with the meaning which commonly attaches to the word, is 
inaccurate. Instead of removing the power from the people, it is keep- 
ing the power closer to the people and making it possible for the citizen, 
in his individual capacity, and for organized bodies of citizens, to 
secure the execution of plans according to the purpose and intent with 
which those plans were made. Indeed it is safe to say that experience 
has shown that it is the only way in which to prevent the frequent 
thwarting of the popular will and the defiance of individuals whose 
interests are ignored or whose rights are invaded. 
ED 94——35
-P-A-G-E-594
  546 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
So much, it seems to us, is strongly supported both by reason and by 
experience, and is clearly manifest. 
But all the people of a city whose population is numbered by hun- 
dreds of thousands or millions can not meet in a legislative assemblage 
to formulate plans for school government any more than they can all 
meet to make plans for municipal government. They can not ever 
gather in mass meetings, and, if they could, mass meetings can not 
deliberate. Even their legislative action must flow not from a primary, 
but from a representative assembly. 
What shall such a representative legislative bedy be called? How 
shall it be chosen? Of how many members shall it be composed? And 
what shall be its powers? These and other similar questions. are all- 
important and must be determined by the lawmaking power of the State. 
The sentiments of the city, as expressed through the local organizations 
and particularly through the newspapers, must of course have much 
weight with the legislature if there is anything like unanimity er any 
very strong preponderance of opinion in the city; for the plan for which 
a community expresses a preference will surely be likely to operate 
most effectually in that community. But the local sentiment is not 
conclusive. When divided it is no guide at all. The legislature is to 
take all the eireumstances into consideration, take the world’s expe- 
rience for its guide, and, acting under its responsibilities, it must exer- 
cise its high powers in ways that will build up a system of schools in 
the city likely to artieulate with the State edueational system and 
become the effective instrument of developing the intelligence and 
training the character of the children of the city up to the ideals of 
the State. : 
The name of the legislative branch of the school government is not 
material, and the one to whieh the people are accustomed may well 
eontinue to be employed. There is no name more appropriate than the 
“board of education.” 
The manner of selecting the members of this legislative body may 
turn somewhat upon the circumstances of the city. We are strongly 
of the opinion that im view of the well-known difficulty about securing 
the attendance of the most. interested and intelligent electors. at. school 
elections, as well as because of the apparent impossibility of freeing 
school elections from political or municipal issues, the better manner 
of seleetion is by appointment. 
If the members of the board are appointed, the mayor of the city is 
likely to be the official to whom the power of appointment may most 
safely be intrusted. The mayor is not suggested because his office 
should sustain any relations to the school system, but in spite of the 
fact that it does not and should not. The school system should be 
absolutely emancipated from partisan politics and eompletely disasso- 
ciated from municipal business. But we think the appointments should 
be made by some one person rather than by a board. The mayor is
-P-A-G-E-595
  REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. 547 
representative of the whole city and all its interests. While not chosen 
with any reference to the interests of the schools, he may be assumed 
to have information as to the fitness of citizens for particular responsi- 
bilities and to be desirous of promoting the educational interests of the 
people. If he is given the power of appointment, he should be partic- 
ularly enjoined by law to consider only the fitness of individuals and 
to pay no regard to party affiliations, unless it be particularly to see to 
it that no one particular party has an overwhelming preponderance in 
the board. The mayor very commonly feels constrained under the 
pressure of party expediency to make so many questionable appoint- 
ments that he is only too glad, and particularly so when enjoined by 
the law, to make very acceptable appointments of members of school 
boards in order that he may gratify the better sentiment of the city. 
Weare confident that the problem of getting a representative Loard of 
education is not so difficult as many think, if the board is not permitted 
to make patronage of work and of salaried positions at the disposal of 
the public school system. Under such circumstances, and more and 
more so as we have approached such circumstances, appointment in 
the way we suggest has produced the best school boards in the larger 
cities of the country. 
Attempts to eliminate partisanship from school administration by 
arraying an equal number of partisans against each other in school 
boards do not at least aim at an ideal. At times such boards have 
worked well and at others have led to mischievous consequences. The 
true course is to insist that all who have any share in the management 
of the schools shall divest themselves of partisanship, whether political 
or religious, in such management, and give themselves wholly to the 
high interests intrusted to them. If it be said that this can not be 
realized, it may be answered, without admitting it, that even if that 
were so it would be no reason why the friends of the schools should 
not assert the sound principle and secure its enforcement as far as pos- 
sible. We must certainly give no countenance to makeshifts, which 
experience has shown to be misleading and expensive. The right must 
prevail in the end, and the earlier and more strongly it is contended for 
the sooner it will prevail. 
The members of school boards should be representative of the whole 
population and of all their common educational interests, and should 
not be chosen to represent any ward or subdivision of the territory, or 
any party or element in the political, religious, or social life thereof. 
Where this principle is not enforced the members will feel bound to 
gain what advantage they can for the subdistrict or special interests 
they represent; bitter contests will ensue, and the common interests 
will suffer. 
The number of the members of a board of education should be small. 
Tn cities of less than 500,000 inhabitants it should not be more than 
nine, and preferably not more than five. In the very largest cities it 
may well be extended to fifteen.
-P-A-G-E-596
  548 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
The term for which members are appointed should be a long one, say, 
five years. 
We think it an excellent plan to provide for two branches and sets 
of powers in the board of education; the one to have the veto power, 
or at least to act as a check upon the acts of the other. This may be 
accomplished by creating the office of school director and charging the 
incumbent with executive. duties on the business side of the adminis- 
tration, and by giving him the veto over the acts of the other branch 
of the board, which may be called the school council. Beyond the care 
and conservatism, which are insured by two sets of powers acting 
against each other, this plan has the advantage of giving the chief 
executive officer of the system just as high and good a title as that of 
members of the board; it is likely to secure a more representative man, 
and gives him larger prerogatives in the discharge of his executive 
duties and better standing among the people, particularly among the 
employees and teachers associated with the public school system. 
If this plan is adopted the school director should be required to give 
his entire time to the duties of his position and be properly compensated 
therefor. He should be the custodian of all property and should appoint 
all assistants, janitors, and workmen authorized by the board for the 
care of this property. He should give bond with sufficient sureties 
and penalties for the faithful and proper discharge of all his duties. He 
should be authorized by law to expend funds, within a fixed limit, for 
repairs, appliances, and help, without the action of the board. ATI con- 
tracts should be made by him and should run in his name, and he 
should be charged with the responsibility of seeing that they are faith- 
fully and completely executed, All contracts involving more than a 
limited and fixed sum of money should be let upon bids to be adver- 
tised for and opened in public. He should have a seat in the board of 
education, should not vote, but should have the power to veto, either 
absolutely or conditionally, any of the acts of the board through a 
written communication. This officer and the school council should 
together constitute the board of education. 
The board of education should be vested only with legislative fune- 
tions and should be required to act wholly through formal and recorded 
resolutions. It should determine and direct the general policy of the 
school system. Within reasonable limits, as to amount, it should be 
given power, in its discretion, to levy whatever moneys may be needed. 
for school purposes. It should control the expenditure of all moneys 
beyond a fixed and limited amount, which may safely and advanta- 
geously be left to the discretion of the chief executive business officer. 
It should authorize, by general resolutions, the appointment of neces- 
sary officers and employees in the business department, and of the super- 
intendent, assistants, and teachers in the department of instruction, 
but it should be allowed to make no appointment other than its own 
clerk. With this necessary exception, single officers should be charged 
with responsibility for all appointments. 
 
-P-A-G-E-597
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. 549 
This plan, not in all particulars, but in the essential ones, has been 
on trial in the city of Cleveland, Ohio, for nearly three years, and has 
worked with very general acceptability. If this plan is adopted, the 
chief executive officer of the system is already provided for and his 
duties have already been indicated. Otherwise it will be necessary for 
the board to appoint such an officer. In that event the law should 
declare him independent, confer upon him adequate authority for the 
performance of executive duties, and charge him with responsibility. 
But we know of no statutory language capable of making an officer 
appointed by a board, and dependent upon the same board for supplies, 
independent in fact of the personal wishes of the members of that board. 
And right here is where the troubles rush in to discredit and damage 
the school system. 
We now come to the subject of paramount importance in making a 
plan for the school government in a great city, namely, the character 
of the teaching force and the quality of the instruction. A city school 
system may be able to withstand some abuses on the business side of 
its administration and continue to perform its function with measurable 
success, but wrongs against the instruction must, in a little time, prove 
fatal. The strongest language is none too strong here. The safety of 
the Republicthe security of American citizenship, are at stake. Goy- 
ernment by the people has no more dangerous pitfall in its road than 
this, that in the mighty cities of the land the comfortable and intelligent 
masses, who are discriminating more and more closely about the edu- 
cation of their children, shall become dissatisfied with the social status 
of the teachers and the quality of the teaching in the common schools. 
In that event they will educate their children at their own expense, 
and the public schools will become only good enough for those who can 
afford no better. The only way to avert this is by maintaining the 
instruction upon a purely scientific and professional footing. This is 
entirely practicable, but it involves much care and expense in training 
teachers, the absolute elimination of favoritism from appointments, the 
security of the right to advancement, after appointment, on the basis 
of merit, and a general leadership which is kindly, helpful, and stimu- 
lating to individuals, which can secure harmonious cooperation from all 
the members and which lends energy and inspiration to the whole body. 
This can not be secured if there is any lack of authority, and experi- 
ence amply proves that it will not be secured if there is any division of 
responsibility. The whole matter of instruction must be placed in the 
  hands of a superintendent of instruction, with independent powers and . : 
adequate authority, who is charged with full responsibility. 
The danger of inconsiderate or improper action by one vested with 
such powers is of course possible, but it is remote. Regardless of the 
legal powers with which he may be individually vested, he is in fact 
and in law a part of a large system. He must act through others and 
in the presence of multitudes. There is a great publicity about all he
-P-A-G-E-598
  550 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
does. When a single officer carries such responsibility he is at the 
focus of alleyes. There are the strongest incentives to right action. 
Without discovery, at least by many persons, he can not act wrong- 
fully. If heis required to act under and pursuant to a plan, the details 
of which have been announced, and of which we shall speak in a 
moment, a wrongful act will be known to the world and he must bear 
the responsibility of it, and the danger of maladministration is almost 
eliminated. 
Moreover, we must consider the alternative. It is not in doubt. All 
who have had any contact with the subject are familiar with it. It is 
administration by boards or committees, the members of which are not 
competent to manage professional matters and develop an expert 
teaching force. Yet they assume, and in most cases honestly, the 
knowledge of the most experienced. They override and degrade a 
superintendent, when they have the power to do so, until he becomes 
their mere factotum. For the sake of harmony and the continuance of 
his position he concedes, surrenders, and acquiesces in their acts, while 
the continually increasing teaching force becomes weaker and weaker 
and the work poorer and poorer. If he refuses to do this, they precipi- 
tate an open rupture and turn him out of his position. Then they 
eloud the issues and shift the responsibility from one to another. 
There are exceptions, of course, but they do not change the rule. 
Tt will be unprofitable to mince words about this all-important mat- 
ter. If the course of study for the public schools of a great city is to 
be determined by laymen, it will not be suited to the needs of a com- 
munity. If teachers are to be appointed by boards or committees, the 
members of which are particularly sensitive to the desires of people 
who have votes or influence, looseness of action is inevitable and 
unworthy considerations will frequently prevail. If the action of a 
board or committee be conditioned upon the recommendation of a super- 
intendent, the plan will not suffice. No one person is stronger than 
the system of which he is a part. Such a plan results in contests 
between the board and the superintendent, and such a contest is obvi- 
ously. an unequal one. There is little doubt of the outcome. In recom- 
mending for the appointment of teachers, the personal wishes of 
members of the board, in particular cases, will have to be acquiesced 
in. Ifa teacher, no matter how unfit, can not be dropped from the 
list without the approval of a board or committee after they have heard 
from her friends and sympathizers, she will remain indefinitely in the 
. Service. This means a low tone in the teaching force and desolation 
in the work of the schools. If the superintendent accepts the situa- 
tion, he becomes less and less capable of developing a professional 
teaching service. If he refuses to accept it, he is very likely to meet 
humiliation; dismissal is inevitable unless he is strong enough to make 
himself secure by doing the right thing and going directly to the peo- 
ple and winning their approval. 
 
-P-A-G-E-599
  REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. BBA 
The superintendent of instruction should be charged with no duty 
save the supervision of the instruction, but should be charged with the 
responsibility of making that professional and scientific, and should be 
given the position and authority to accomplish that end. 
If the board of education is constituted upon the old- plan he must 
be chosen by the board. If it is constituted upon the Cleveland plan 
he may be appointed by the school director, with the approval of two- 
thirds or three-fourths of the council. The latter plan seems preferable, 
for it centralizes the main responsibility of this important appointment 
in a single individual. In either case the law and the sentiment of the 
city should direct that the appointee shall be a person liberally edu- 
cated, professionally trained, one who knows what good teaching is, but 
is also experienced in administration, in touch with public affairs, and 
in sympathy with popular feeling. 
The term of the superintendent of instruction should be from five 
to ten years, and until a successor is appointed. In our judgment it 
should be determinate, so that there may be a time of public examina- 
tion, but it should be sufficiently long to enable one to lay foundations 
and show results without being carried under by the prejudices which 
always follow the first operation of efficient or drastic plans. The sal- 
ary should be fixed by law, and not subject to change in the middle of 
a term or except by law. 
For reasons already suggested, the superintendent, once appointed, 
should have power to appoint from an eligible list, all assistants and 
teachers authorized by the board, and unlimited authority to assign 
them to their respective positions and reassign them or remove them 
from the force at his discretion. 
To secure a position upon the eligible list from which appointments 
may be made, a candidate, if without experience, should be required 
to complete the full four years’ course of the city high schools, or its 
equivalent, and in addition thereto pass the examination of the board 
of examiners and complete at least a year’s course of professional 
training in a city normal training school under the direction of the 
superintendent. If the candidate has had, say, three years of success- 
ful experience as a teacher, he should be eligible to appointment by 
passing an examination held by a general examining board. This 
board may be appointed by the board of education, but should exam- 
ine none but graduates of the high school and training school unless 
specially requested so to do by the superintendent of instruction. The 
number admitted to the training schools should be limited, and the 
examinations should be gauged to the prospective needs of the ele- 
mentary schools for new teachers. The supply of new teachers may 
well be largely, but should not be wholly, drawn from this local source. 
The force will gain fresh vitality by some appointments of good and 
experienced teachers from outside.
-P-A-G-E-600
  552 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
The work of putting a large teaching force upon a professional basis, 
of making the teaching scientific and capable of arousing minds to 
action, is so difficult that a layman can scarcely appreciate it. It has 
hardly been commenced; it has been made possible only when the ayve- 
nues of approach to the service have been closed against the unquali- 
fied and unworthy. After that, the supervision must be close and 
general as well as sympathetic and decisive. The superintendent must 
have expert assistants enough to learn the characteristics and measure 
the work of every member of the force. They must help and encour- 
age, advise and direct, according to the circumstances of each case. 
The work must be reduced to a system and the workers brought into 
harmonious relations. Each room must show neatness and life, and 
the whole force must show ardor and enthusiasm. By directing the 
reading, by encouraging an interchange of visits, by organizing clubs 
for self-improvement, by frequent class, grade, and general meetings, 
the professional spirit must be aroused and the work energized. Those 
who show teaching power, versatility, amiability, reliability, steadi- 
ness, and growth must be rewarded with the highest positions; those 
who lack fiber, who have no energy, who are incapable of enthusiasm, 
who will not work agreeably with their associates, must go upon the 
retired list. Directness and openness must be encouraged. Attempts 
to invoke social, political, religious, or other outside influences to secure 
preferment must operate to close the door to advancement. In general 
and particular, bad teaching must be prevented. In every room a firm 
and kindly management must prevail and good teaching must be appar- 
ent. All must work along common lines which will insure general and 
essential ends. Until a teacher can do this, and can be relied upon to 
do it, she must be helped and directed; when it is manifest she can 
not or will not do it, she must be dismissed; when she shows she can 
do it and wants to do it, she must be left to exercise her own judg- 
ment and originality and do it in her own way. In the schoolroom the 
teacher must be secure against interference. In all the affairs of the 
school her judgment must be trusted to the utmost limit of safety. 
Then judgment will strengthen and self-respect and public respect will 
grow. The qualities which develop in the teacher will develop in the 
school. To develop these qualities with any degree of uniformity in a 
large teaching force requires steady and uniform treatment through 
a long course of years under superintendence which is professional, 
strong, just, and courageous; which has ample assistance and author- 
ity; which is worthy of public confidence and knows how to marshal 
facts, present arguments, and appeal to the intelligence and integrity 
of the community with success. 
It is the business of the plan of organization to secure such super- 
intendence. It can not be secured through an ordinary board of edu- 
cation operating on the old plan. It is well known what the influences 
are that are everywhere prevalent and must inevitably prevent it. It
-P-A-G-E-601

may be secured in the law, and it must be secured there or it will not 
be secured at all. 
In conciuding this portion of the report, the committee indicates 
briefly the principles which must necessarily be observed in framing a 
plan of organization and government in a large city school system. 
First. The affairs of the school should not be mixed up with partisan 
contests or municipal business. 
Second. There should be a sharp distinction between legislative 
functions and executive duties. 
Third. Legislative functions should be clearly fixed by statute and 
be exercised by a comparatively small board, each member of which is 
representative of the whole city. This board, within statutory limita- 
tions, should determine the policy of the system, levy taxes, and con- 
trol the expenditures. It should make no appointments. Every act 
should be by a recorded resolution. It seems preferable that this 
board be created by appointment rather than election, and that it be 
constituted of two branches acting against each other. 
Fourth. Administration should be separated into two great inde- 
pendent departments, one of which manages the business interests and 
the other of which supervises the instruction. Hach of these should be 
wholly directed by a single official who is vested with ample authority 
and charged with full responsibility for sound administration. 
Fifth. The chief executive officer on the business side should be 
charged with the care of all property and with the duty of keeping it 
in suitable condition; he should provide all necessary furnishings and 
appliances; he should make all agreements and see that they are prop- - 
erly performed; he should appoint all assistants, janitors, and work- 
men; in a word, he should do all that the law contemplates and all 
that the board authorizes concerning the business affairs of the school 
system, and when anything goes wrong he should answer for it. He 
may be appointed by the board, but we think it preferable that he be 
chosen in the same way the members of the board are chosen, and 
be given a veto upon the acts of the board. 
Sixth. The chief executive officer of the department of instruction 
should be given a long term and may be appointed by the board. If 
the board is constituted of two branches, he should be nominated by 
the business executive and confirmed by the legislative branch. Once 
appointed, he should be independent. He should appoint all authorized 
assistants and teachers from an eligible list to be constituted as pro- 
vided by law. He should assign to duties and discontinue services for 
cause, at his discretion. He should determine all matters relating to 
instruction. He should be charged with the responsibility of develop- 
ing a professional and enthusiastic teaching force and of making all 
the teaching scientific and forceful. He must perfect the organization 
of his department and make and carry out plans to accomplish this. 
If he can not do this in a reasonable time he should be superseded by 
one who can.

554 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
The government of a vast city school system comes to have an auton- 
omy which is largely its own and almost independent of direction or 
restraint. The volume of business which this government transacts 
is represented only by millions of dollars; it calls not only for the 
highest sagacity and the ripest experience, but also for much special 
information relating to school property and school affairs. Even more 
important than this is the fact that this government controls and deter- 
mines the educational policy of the city and carries on the instruction 
of tens or hundreds of thousands of children. This instruction is of 
little value, and perhaps vicious, unless it is professional and scientific. 
This government is representative. All citizens are compelled to 
support it, and all have large interests which it is bound to promote. 
Every parent has rights which it is the duty of this school government 
to protect and enforce. When government exacts our support of public 
education, when it comes into our homes and takes our children into 
its custody and instructs them according to its will, we acquire a right 
which is as exalted as any right of property, or of person, or of con- 
science, can be; and that is the right to knew that the environment is 
healthful, that the management is kindly and ennobling, and that the 
instruction is rational and scientific. It is needless to say to what 
extent these interests are impeded or blocked, or how commonly these 
rights of citizenship and of parentage are denied or defied, or how 
helpless the individual is who seeks their enforcement under the system 
of school government which has heretofore obtained in some of the 
great cities of the country. This is not surprising. It is only the 
logical result of the rapid growth of cities, of a marvelous advance 
in knowledge of what is needed in the schools, of the antagonism of 
selfish interests by which all public administration, and particularly 
school administration, is encompassed, and of the lack of plan and 
system, the confusion of powers, the absence of individual responsi- 
bility, in the government of a system of schools. By the census of 
1890 there are seven cities in the United States, each with a population 
greater than any one of sixteen States. The aggregate population of 
twelve cities exceeds the aggregate population of twenty States. Gov- 
ernment for education certainly requires as strong and responsible an 
organization as government for any other purpose. These great centers 
of population, with their vast and complex educational problems, have 
passed the stage when government by the time-honored commission 
will suffice. No popular government ever determined the policy and 
administered the affairs of such large bodies of people successfully, 
ever transacted such a vast volume of business satisfactorily, ever pro- 
moted high and beneficent ends, ever afforded protection to the rights 
of each individual of the great multitude, unless in its plan of organi- 
zation there was an organic separation of executive, legislative, and 
judicial functions and powers. All the circumstances of the case, and 
the uniform experience of the world, forbid our expecting any substan-
-P-A-G-E-603
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. 555 
tial solution of the problem we are considering until it is well settled 
in the sentiments of the people that the school systems of the greatest 
cities are only a part of the school systems of the States of which these 
cities form a part, and are subject to the legislative authority thereof; 
until there is a plan of school government in each city which differen- 
tiates executive acts from legislative functions; which emancipates the 
legislative branch of that government from the influence of pelf seekers; 
which fixes upon individuals the responsibility for executive acts, either 
performed or omitted; which gives to the intelligence of the community 
the power to influence legislation and exact perfect and complete exe- 
eution; which affords to every citizen whose interests are ignored or 
whose rights are invaded a place for complaint and redress, and which 
puts the business interests upon a business footing, the teaching upon 
an expert basis, and gives to the instruction that protection and 
encouragement which is vital to the development of all professional 
and scientific work. 
We have undertaken to indieate the general principles which we 
think should be observed in setting up the framework of government 
of a large city school system. While we have no thought that any 
precise form of organization which could be suggested would, in all 
details, be imperative, we are confident that the form or plan of organ- 
ization is of supreme consequence, and that any which disregards the 
principles we have pointed out will work to disadvantage or lead to 
disaster. :

I find myself in general accord with the doctrines of the report. 
There is only one feature of it from which I feel obliged to dissent, and 
that is an important though not necessarily a vital one. I refer to the 
office of school director. I see no need of such an officer elected by 
the people, and I do see the danger of his becoming a part of the polit- 
ical organization for the dispensation of patronage. 
All power and authority in school affairs should reside ultimately in 
the board of education, consisting of not more than eight persons, 
appointed by the mayor of the city, to hold office four years, two mem- 
bers retiring annually and eligible -for reappointment once and no 
more. This board should appoint as its chief officer a superintendent 
of instruction, whose tenure should be during good behavior and 
efficiency, and whose powers and duties should be to a large extent 
defined by statute law, and’ not wholly or chiefly by the regulations of 
the board of education. The superintendent of instruction should have 
 
-P-A-G-E-604
  556 i EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94, 
a seat and voice but not a vote in the board of education. The board 
of education should also appoint a business agent, and define his 
powers and duties in relation to all matters of buildings, repairs, and 
supplies, substantially as set forth in the report in relation to the 
school director. 
All teachers should be appointed and annually reappointed or rec- 
ommended by the superintendent of instruction until after a sufficient 
probation they are appointed on a tenure during good behavior and 
efficiency. 
All matters relating to courses of study, text-books, and examina- 
tions should be left to the superintendent and his assistants, consti- 
tuting a body of professional experts who should be regarded as alone 
competent to deal with such matters, and should be held accountable 
therefor to the board of education only in a general way, and not in 
particular details.

I concur in the recommendations of the subcommittee on the organ- 
ization of city school systems, as summarized in the concluding portion 
of the report, omitting in item third the words: “(And that it be con- 
stituted of two branches, acting against each other.” Omit fifth: “But 
we think it preferable that he be chosen in the same way that members 
otf the board are chosen and be given veto power upon the acts of the 
board.” I recommend that the veto power be given to the president 
of the board.

VERBATIM REPORTS OF RECITATIONS IN ARITHMETIC 
AND LANGUAGE IN THE SCHOOLS OF KANSAS CITY, 
MISSOURI. 
J. M. GrEENWoop, Superintendent. 
INTRODUCTION. 
The foregoing report of the committee of fifteen, which is printed in full, contains 
expressions of dissent by some of the members of the subcommittees. Among them 
is the dissenting vote of Supt. James M. Greenwood of Kansas City, Mo., a member 
of the subcommittee on correlation of studies. He claims that in teaching arithme- 
tic, fractions may be taught with almost the same facility as whole numbers. In 
order to permit professional teachers to judge understandingly of the methods Mr. 
Greenwood advocates in teaching arithmetic, and to prove his assertion correct, he 
had stenographic reports taken of lessons given by teachers under his direction in 
the Kansas City schools. These reports are here appended as a very valuable sup- 
plement to the report of the committee of fifteen on correlation of studies, with the 
hope that they may induce other teachers and supervisors to direct their attention 
to the problem of simplifying methods of teaching and thus save time for other 
branches, notably for the earlier introduction of algebra. 
Superintendent Greenwood adds a number of lessons on language and grammar, 
taken down in shorthand also, These lessons are well adapted to illustrate the 
method in vogue in good schools in this country; hence will aid teachers in estab- 
lishing a model of intellectual training through the study to the English language. 
The correctness of the accounts here offered is vouched for by. the teachers and the 
principals of the respective schools in which the lessons were given. The age of the 
pupils is also explicitly stated in each case. Mr. Greenwood wishes acknowledg- 
ment to be made to principal J. C. Hisey of the Scarritt school, Kansas City, as the 
chief author of the details of the scheme of number work here illustrated.—Editor.

ADAMS SCHOOL—MISS CARR, TEACHER. 
[April 9, 1895—Class B, grade second.] 
Assistant Superintendent. Miss Carr, when I was at your school the other day I saw a great inter- 
est in the lesson in which you were developing the idea of the number 23 with your lower class. Will 
you take the same class to-day and develop another number for us, that we may get a record of all of 
the steps of the lesson? 
Miss Carr. I will do so at once. (The class is called.) 
Q. What number are we to study to-day, children?—Class. Twenty-six. 
Miss Carr. We will begin, then, by grouping the numbers below 26, and including it, according to 
their endings. (In answer to the teacher's question as to the endings of the numbers below 26 the fol- 
lowing groups are obtained :)

Q. Then we will cross the fifth one out, Aro there any others?—Arthur, The fourth is like the second. 
Q. Then we will cross the fourth one out. Are any others alike? 
Forrest. ‘The ninth and seventh are alike. 
(Teacher crosses ninth out.) 
Ernst. The tenth and sixth are alike. 
Teacher. We will cross the tenth out also. 
Teacher. Subtraction is learned at the same time in a similar manner from the same groupings. Thus, the first group is read: Twenty-six less one equals twenty-five; twenty-six less eleven equals 
fifteen; twenty-six less twenty-one equals five; Twenty-six less twenty-five equals one; twenty-six 
less fifteen equals eleven; twenty-six less five equals twenty-one. All the groupings are read in the 
same way, and the drill follows. By calling attention to the endings of numbers, I find this classifica- 
tion of combinations an aid toward rapid addition and subtraction. I supplement this work by con- 
crete problems involving these processes and numbers, as: There are sixteen children in one class and 
ten in another; how many in both classes? There were twenty-six children in the schoolroom; 
sixteen were studying, and the rest were reciting; how many were reciting? 
(Teacher erases the groups.) 
Teacher. The children are then given the drill; first, by grouping the numbers according to the end- 
ings; after which the combinations are given at random, thus: I will put a number on the board, and 
you give me the other number that with it will make twenty-six. 
Q. 4.—Mabel. Twenty-two. 
Q. 10.—Bessie. Sixteen. 
Q. 21.—Minnie. Five. 
Q. 8.—Dora. Eighteen. 
Q. 12.—Anna. Fourteen. 
Teacher. I proceed in this manner until all the numbers less than twenty-six are in a column on 
the board. The drill is then strengthened by requiring each of several children to read the whole 
coluwn as a paragraph, Division and multiplication are developed as follows: 
Q. What number are we studying?—Allie. The number twenty-six. 
Q. What is the first number below twenty-six?—Tony. Twenty-five is the first number below 
twenty-six. 
Q. We all know about twenty-five, don't we?—Class. Yes’m. 
Q. Twenty-five and what make twenty-six?—Class. One. 
Q. Then, there are how many twenty-fives in twenty-six?—George. One and one twenty-fifth 
twenty-fives in twenty-six. 
Q. What are the factors of this twenty-five?—Oscar. Five times five. 
Q. What would be a good number to take next, then?—Dora. Tho number five. 
Q. Count twenty-six by fives.—Dora. Five, ton, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, one. There are five 
and one-fifth fives in twenty-six. 
(For the form of this lesson, see Table No.3.) 
Q. Twenty-four and what make twenty-six? 
Q. Now, how many twenty-fours in twenty-s 
fours in twenty-six. 
Q. Think of the factors of twenty-four, and tell me a good number to take next.—Ernst. Twelve. 
Q. Count twenty-six by twelves.—Ernst. Twelve, twenty-four, and two make twenty-six. 
Q. How many twelves in twenty-six?Anna. There are two and one-sixth twelves in twenty-six. 
Q. How do you know?—Anna. I see two whole twelves, and a two, which is one-sixth of another 
twelve. 
Q. What is another factor of twenty-four?—Mabel. Six. 
Q. Count twenty-six by sixes.—Olive. Six, twelve, eighteen, twenty-four, and two make twenty-six. 
There are four and one-third sixes in twenty-six. 
Q. Name some other factors of twenty-four.—John. Eight times three. 
Q. Count twenty-six by threes.—George. Three, six, nine, twelve, fifteen, eighteen, twenty-one, 
twenty-four, and two make twenty-six. There are eight and two-thirds threes in twenty-six. 
Q. Name another factor of twenty-four.John. Three times eight. 
Q. Count. twenty-six by eights.—John. Eight, sixteen, twenty-four, and two make twenty-six. 
There are three and one-fourth eights in twenty-six. 
Q. What other number can we get from twenty-four?—Tony. Four. 
Q. Count twenty-six by fours.—Tony. Four, eight, twelve, sixteen, twenty, twenty-four, and two 
make twenty-six. 
Q. How many fours in twenty-six?—Dave. There are six and one-half fours in twenty-six. 
Q. What is one-fourth of twenty-six?—Edna. Six and one-half is one-fourth of twenty-six. 
Q. What, then, are three-fourths of twenty-six ?—Edna. Three-fourths of twenty-six are nineteen 
and one-half. 
Q. What else can we get out of twenty-four?—Class. Two. 
Q. How many twos in each one of these fours?—Class. Two twos. 
    
Forrest. Twenty-four and two make twenty-six.

  REPORTS OF RECITATIONS IN ARITHMETIC. 577 
Q. Class may count twenty-six by twos.—Class. Two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen, 
eighteen, twenty, twenty-two, twenty-four, twenty-six. 
Q. How many twos in twenty —Bessie. There are thirteen twos in twenty-six. 
Q. If there are thirteen twos in twenty-six, how many thirteens in twenty-six?—Maud. There are 
two thirteens in twenty-six. 
Q. Two is what part of twenty-six.—Ernst. Two is one-thirteenth of twenty-six. 
Q. Twenty-three and what make twenty-six?—Dave. Twenty-three and threo make twenty-six 
Q. How many twenty-throcs in twenty-six?—Blanche. There are one and threo twenty-thirdst 
      twenty-threes in twenty-six. 
Q. Has twenty-tiree any factors?—Class. No’m. 
Q. Twenty-two and what make twent: 1—Eva. Twenty-two and four make twenty-six. 
Q. How many twenty-twos in twenty-six?—Olive. In twenty-six there are one and two-elevenths 
twenty-twos. 
Q. Prove that that is so.—Ida. I see a whole twenty-two and a four. Two is one-eleventh of 
twenty-two, so four would be two-clevenths of another twenty-two. 
Q. What number shall we take next?—Blanche. Eleven. 
Q. Count twenty-six by eleven.—Andrew. Eleven, twenty-two, and four make twenty-six. 
Q. How many elevens in twenty-six?—Walter. There are two and four-elevenths elevens in 
twenty-six. 
Teacher. Placing upon the board these answers as they are given, we proceed in this manner until 
we have measured twenty-six by all the numbers under it, thus forming Table No.3, ‘This worl: is also 
followed by the drill, the table being erased from the board, and the numbers in irregular order being 
placed ina column on the board, from which each of several children read the division paragraph. 
Addition and division are not only read from this table in the manner indicated and fractions 
reduced, but multiplication may also be developed, reading thus: One time twenty-five and one make 
twenty-six, or twenty-five times one and one twenty-fifth make twenty-six. Five times five and one 
make twenty-six, or five times five and a fifth make twenty-six, and so on. 
This table is also supplemented by the concrete work, as: If I spend twenty-six cents for tops, at 
five cents each, how many could I buy? Divide two and one-sixth dozen cookies among thirteen 
children, how many would each child get? Each share would be what part of the cookies? If James 
gaye his share to John, how many would John have? What part of all the cookies would John 
have? At two cents each, how much would thirteen marbles cost? Twenty-six quarts of milk would 
make how many gallons, ete.? With this work for a foundation, the text-book problems can be readily 
solved.

sixteenths of a pound are threo ounces; one ounce is one-sixteenth of a pound; eight ounces are 
eight-sixteenths of a pound; three ounces are three-sixteenths of a pound; eight-sixteenths of a pound 
and three-sixteenths of a pound are eleyen-sixteenths of a pound. Therefore one-half and three- 
sixteenths are eleven-sixteenths. 
Q. Three-sixteenths taken from one-half leaves what?—George C. One-half of a pound is éight ounces; 
teenths of a pound are three ounces; one ounce is one-sixtcenth of a pound; eight ounces are 
eight-sixteenths of a pound; three ounces are three-sixteenths of a pound; three-sixteenths of a 
pound taken from eight-sixteenths of a pound are five.sixteenths of a pound. ‘Therefore three- 
sixteenths taken from one-half leave five-sixteenths. 
Q. How many three-sixteenths in one-half?—Cleo. One-half of a pound is eight ounces; three- 
sixteenths of a pound are three ounces; one ounce is one-sixteenth of a pound; eight ounces are 
eight-sixteenths of a pound; three ounces are three-sixteenths of a pound; in eight-sixteenths of a

fourth of a foot is three inches; one inch is one-twelfth of a foot; eight inches are eight-twelfths of a 
foot; three inches are three-twelfths of a foot; eight-twelfths of a foot and three-twelfths of a foot are 
eleven-twelfths of afoot. Therefore two-thirds and one-fourth are eleven-twelfths. 
Q. One-fourth taken from two-thirds is what?—Bert. Two-thirds of a foot are eight inches; one- 
fourth of a foot is three inches; one inch is one-twelfth of a foot; eight inches are eight-twelfths of a 
foot; three inches are three-twelfths of a foot; three-twelfths of a foot taken from eight-twelfths of a 
foot leave five-twelfths of a foot. Therefore one-fourth taken from two-thirds leave five-twelfths. 
Q. How many one-fourths in two-thirds?— Ruth. Two-thirds of a foot are eight inches; one-fourth 
of a foot is three inches; one inch is one-twelfth of a foot; eight inches are eight-twelfths of a foot; 
three inches are three-twelfths of a foot; in eight-twelfths of a foot there are two and two-thirds three- 
twelfths of afoot. Therefore there are two and two-thirds one-fourths in two-thirds. 
Q. One-third of one-fourth is what?—Lida. One-fourth cf a foot is three inches; one inch is one- 
twelfth of a foot; three inches are three-twelfths of a foot; one-third of three-twelfths of a foot is one- 
twelfth of a foot. Therefore one-third of one-fourth is one-twelfth. .

There are two one-tenths in one-fifth. There are four one-tenths in two-fifths. There are six one- 
tenths in three-fifths. There are one and two-thirds three-tenths in one-half. There are eight one- 
tenths in four-fifths. 
Q. If one yard of cloth cost 16 cents, how many yards can be bought for 64 cents ?—Howard. Four 
yards. If one yard of cloth cost 16 cents, for 64 cents you can buy as many yards of cloth as 16 cents 
are contained times in 64 cents, which are four times. Therefore you can buy 4 yards of cloth for 64 
cents, at 16 cents a yard. 
Q. If 7 pounds of sugar cost 63 cents, what will one pound cost?—Katherine. 9 cents. If 7 pounds 
of sugar cost 63 cents, one pound will cost one-seventh of 63 cents, which is nine cents. Therefore 
one pound of sugar will cost 9 cents. : 
Q. If one yard of muslin cost 12 cents, what will 9 yards cost?—Ruth. $1.08. If one yard cost 12 
cents, 9 yards will cost 9 times 12 cents, which are one hundred eight cents, or one dollar and eight 
cents. Therefore 9 yards of muslin will cost $1.08. 
Q. If one dozen eggs are worth 25 cents, what are five dozen worth?— Willie. $1.25. If one dozen 
eggs cost 25 cents, 5 dozen will cost 5 times 25 cents, which are $1.25. Therefore five dozen eggs will 
cost $1.25. 
By Assistant Superintendent. What will three quarts of milk cost at 20 cents a gallon?—Robert. 15 
cents. If one gallon of milk cost 20 cents, one quart will cost one-fourth of 20 cents, which is 5 cents.

20 cents, three quarts will cost 15 cent: S 
By Assistant Superintendent. What will 16 eggs cost at 15 cents a dozen?—Willie B. 20 cents. If 
one dozen eggs cost 15 cents, four eggs will cost one-third of 15 cents, which is 5 cents. Sixteen eggs 
are four eggs more than one dozen. Fifteen cents and 5 cents are 20 cents. ‘Therefore sixteen eggs 
will cost 20 cents, at 15 cents a dozen. 
By Assistant Superintendent. What will 11 feet of rope cost, at 9 cents a yard?—Harold. If one yard 
of rope cost 9 cents, one foot will cost one-third of 9 cents, which is 3 cents. Eleven feet will cost 
eleven times 3 cents, which are 33 cents. Therefore, if one yard of rope cost 9 cents, eleven feet will 
cost 33 cents. 
By Assistant Superintendent. Who can give another explanation?— Willie B. In eleven feet there 
are three and two-thirds yards. If one yard cost 9 cents, 33 yards will cost three and two-thirds times 
9 cents, which are 33 cents. Therefore eleven feet of rope will cost 33 cents if one yard cost 9 cents. 
‘Assistant Superintendent. Miss Smith, will you show us what your pupils can do in ordinary

Q. A corporation declared a dividend of § of its proceeds. The rest was added to the sinking fund. 
What per cent was added to the sinking fund? 
Ernst. 16§ per cent. 
Florence. § equals the whole. If the dividend was §, the rest would be}. of a quantity equals 
163 per cent of it. 
Q. A owning 4 of a mill, sold 624 per cent of his share to B, whoowned the rest. What part of the 
mill did each then own? 
Lela. A owned 30 per cont and B 70 per cent. 
Rosa. A owned ¢ of the mill, and sold 624 per cent, which equals § of a quantity. If A owned 4, 
then he sold five-eighths of four-fifths, which is one-half. He had left the difference between four- 
fifths and one-half, which is ;%, or 30 per cent. Then A owned 30 per'cent and B 70 per cent. 
Q. What per cent of the square of eight is the square of four? 
Clare. 25 per cent. 
Herman. The square of 8 is 64. The square of 4 is 16. 16 is 25 per cent of 64. 
Ernst. ‘Che square of 8 is 64. The square of 4is 16. Sixteen sixty-fourths equal one-fourth. One- 
fourth of a quantity equals 25 per cent of it. 
Q. What is the relation of a certain quantity to 116g per cent of it? 
Alice. ‘The relation is as 6 to 7. 
Florence. 100 per cent equals six-sixths. 1163 per cent equals } more than §, which is 3. ‘Therelation 
of 100 per cent to 1163 per cent is as 6 to 7. 
Q. Find a certain number of which 663 per cent exceeds 40 per cent by 200. 
Harry. 750. 
Walter. 663 per cent of a quantity minus 40 per cent of the same quantity equals 263 per cent of 
the quantity. 263 per cent of a quantity equals y of it. If 200 is 4 of the quantity, yy, is 4 of 200, 
which is 50. 4% would be 15 times 50, which are 750. 
Louisa. 66% per cent of a quantity equals 3 of it. 40 per cent of the’ quantity equals 2 of it. % 
minus 3 equal y. If 200 is ys, yy would be 4 of 200, which is 50. }3 would bo 15 times 50, which 
is 750,

20 acres, or one-eighth, or 124 per cent. 
Q. A quantity of flour is worth $84. What is 116} per cent of the quantity worth? 
Alice, $98. 
Agnes. 100 per cent of a quantity equals § of it. 1163 per cent equals 4 more than §. $84 equals 
§. One-sixth would be one-sixth of $84, which is $14. If $14 is one-sixth, one-sixth more would be 
$84 plus $14, which is $98. 
Florence. 1163 per cent equals { of a quantity. If § cost $84, } would cost 4 of $84, which is $14, and 
would cost 7 times $14, which is $98. 
Q. A man paid $42 for an overcoat, which was 124 per cent less than the price asked by the retailer. 
‘What was the asking price? 
Jennie. $48. 
James. 124 per cont of a quantity equals } of it. If $42 is J of the asking price, § would be } of $42, 
which is $6. §, or the whole asking price, would be 8 times $6, which are $48. 
Jacob. The man must have § at first. 124 per cent of a quantity equals 4 of it. He sold it for } less 
than he asked for it; he must have sold it for J of the asking price. If $42 is { of the asking price, § 
of the asking price would be } of $42, which is $6, and § would be 8 times $6, which are $48. 
Q. What is the relation of 5 per cent of a quantity to 66% per cent of a quantity?—Harry. 5 per cent

    WHITTIER SCHOOL—MISS VAN-METER, TEACHER. 
[April 1, 1895—Beginning Class A, grade sixth.] 
‘Assistant Superintendent. Miss Van Meter, what have your pupils done in the measuring of 
surfaces? 
Miss Van Meter. They are beginning to find the area of rectangles and triangles. 
Assistant Superintendent. Have they studied the relation of the rectangle to the triangle? 
Miss Van Meter. They have not. 
Assistant Superintendent. I wish that you would give us a lesson this morning to show how they 
connect the idea of the rectanglo with the idea of the triangle. 
Q- What have I in my hand [shows a square inch piece of paper, which is used as a unit 
throughout the lesson]?—George. A rectangle. 
Q. Just by looking at it, what would you call it in nt to size?—Chester. A square inch. 
Q. What name would be given to this figure [holding up a larger piece of paper]?—Lula. That is 
arectangle. 
Q. How may I ascertain the number of square inches in this rectangle?—John. Multiply the length 
by the breadth. 
Q. Before I can multiply the length by the breadth, what must I find?—John. How long and how 
wide it is? 
Q. I have measured this rectangle, and have found it to be 9 inches long and 6 inches wide. Who 
can tell mo how many square inches ean be eut from this piece of paper [holding up the paper 
rectangle and the square inch unit] ?—Josie. Fifty-four square inches. 
Q. In other words, the area of this rectangle is how much?—Josie. Fifty-four square inches. 
Q. What have I in my hand now [holding up a square piece of paper]?—Perey. A square. 
Q. What else may it bo called ?—Mamie. A rectangle. 
Q. If I fold the paper containing 54 square inches into two equal parts, what is the number of 
square inches in each part?—Fannie. Twenty-seven square inches.

Q. What do you call this figure?—Arthur. A triangle. 
  3 9in. 
Q. And still what is the relation of this figure to the rectangle?—Edith. It is one-half of it. 
Q. What, then, is the area of the triangle?—Josie. Twenty-seven square inches. 
Q. If the rectangle is 9 inches long and 6 inches wide, by folding it that way I still have the length 
9 inches and the width 6 inches; but you tell me the area is 27 square inches. Now, from that fact, 
how may thearea of a triangle be found ?—Lottie. Multiply the length by the breadth and divide by two. 
Q. Instead of calling the names length and breadth of the rectangle, the 9 inches may be called the 
_ base of the triangle, and tho breadth of the rectangle, 6 inches, now becomes the altitude of the tri- 
angle. Now, using other terms, how may we find the area of the triangle?—Roy. Multiply the base 
by one-half of the altitude. 
Q. If the base is 9 inches and the altitude 6 inches, what is the area?—Roy. ‘The area is 27 square 
inches. 9 times three square inches are twenty-seven square inches.    
  Practical problems by the same class, given by Assistant Superintendent: 
Q. What will 7 bushels 3 pecks 4 quarts of cherries cost, at $4.25 bushel?—Chester. First reduce 
the 7 bushels 3 pecks 4 quarts to quarts, which are 252 quarts. Since there are 32 quarts in one bushel, 
in 252 quarts there would be as many bushels as 32 is contained times in 252, which are Tj times, or Tf 
bushels. 7% bushels would cost 7f times $4.25, which are $33.46. 
Q. How many square rods in 3 of an acre?—Mamie, 1063 square rods. ‘There are 160 square rods in 
one acre. In two-thirds of an acre there are two-thirds of 160 square rods. 
Q. Two persons observed an eclipse of the moon, one seeing it at 9 p.m. and the other at 11.30 p.m. 
What was the difference in their longitude? (Pupils were ready with an answer in less than one-half 
minute.)—Herman. 37° 30’. 
Q. If 15 equal bars of silver weigh 24 pounds 8 ounces 16 pennyweights, what is the weight of each 
Dar? (Several had answers in one minute.)—A. 1 pound 7 ounces 15 penny weights 173 grains. 
Q. What part of a rod are 8 fect, 4 inches? (‘Three-fourths of the pupils had an answer in one 
minute.)—A. 39. 
Q. Reduce 0.096 of a bushel to a decimal of a pint. (One-half of the class had an answer in one min- 
ute.)—A. 6.144.

  592 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
Teacher. Yes, there would be just one strip cut off the required Jength. What would occur on the 
second, third, fourth strips, and so on?—Clara. There would be a certain number of inches cut-off or 
turned under. 
Q. What would you call that quantity cut off on account of matching of figures?—Delbert. Waste 
or loss. 
Q. I will say that there are eight inches loss in matching the figures; what will you do with the 
eight inches ?—Harrell. We will reduce them to parts of a foot. 
Q. What would that equal?—Harrell. Two-thirds of a foot. 
Q. Who would have to stand this loss of 3 foot?—Phil. The buyer. 
Q. How long is each strip?—Mattie. 30 feet long. 
Q. How many feet would you have to buy for the second, third, fourth strips, and so on?—Delbert. 
303 feet. 
Q. How many yards would that equal? 
Theo. Ten yards. 
Mattie. Ten and two-ninths yards. 
Q. How many strips ten and two-ninths yards long would you require?—Roy. Seven strips. 
Q. Why did you say seven strips?—Roy. The first strip was only ten yards long, the remaining 
seven strips would be 103 yards long. 
Q. How long are those seven strips ?-—Clara¥ Ten and two-ninths yards long. 
Q. How many strips of that length do you require?—Walter. Seven strips, each 103 yards long. 
Q. What does that equal?—Class. 71§ yards. 
Q. What is the length of the first strip?—Willie. Ten yards. 
Q. Making a total of how many yards?—Mattie. 815 yards.

Q. Suppose the carpet is three-fourths of a yard wide; how many strips are required for a room %2 
yards wide?—Earl. 8§ strips; no, 9 strips. 
Q. Why did you not say 8 strips instead of 9 strips?—Earl. Because you can not buy § of astrip. 
You must buy one whole strip, which makes 9 strips. 
Q. How many yards in length is the room?—Clifford. Ten yards. 
Q. Supposing there is a loss of nine inches in matching figures, on how many of the nine strips 
would there be a waste of nine inches ?—Harrel. On eight strips. 
Q. How much would that nine inches loss on each of eight strips equal in yards?—Mattie. One- 
fourth of a yard on each strip.

REPORTS. OF RECITATIONS IN ARITHMETIC. 593 
Q. A drover bought cattle at $65 a head, and sold them for $81.50 head. What is the gain per 
cent?—(Frank repeats question.) 
Q. What is the first step that we take?—Olga. Find the gain in dollars. 
Q. What is the next step? 
Fred. Divide the gain by the cost, and that will give the rate. 
(21 pupils out of 41 had an answer in one-half minute.) 
(Frank. 30 per cent.) 
Alfred. If a drover bought cattle at $65 a head, and sold them for $84.50 a head, he gained the dif- 
ference between $84.50 and $65, which is $19.50. 
Q. What do you say next?—Ethel. The gain is as many per cent as $65 is contained times in $19.50, 
which is 30 hundredths times or 30 per cent. 
Q. In the subject of percentage the $84.50 would be called what?—Una. Amount. 
Q. To what would the $65 be equivalent in percentage?—Maggie. Base. 
Q. What would you be required to find in percentage ?—Karl. The rate per cent. 
Q. What do you always do to find the rate per cent of gain or loss? 
Julia. Divide the gain or loss by the cost, and the amount expressed in hundredths is the gain or 
loss per cent. 
Jessie. Divide the gain or loss in dollars by the cost. 
Q. A man sold a watch for $180, and lost 163 per cent. What was the cost? Gave the first step in 
working the problem ?—Alfred M. 100 per cent minus 163 per cent is 834 per cent. 
Q. Why do you take 163 per cent from 100 per cent? 
Julia. Because $180 is only 834 per cent of the cost. 
(Four pupils only did not have an answer in § of a minute.) 
Una. $216, 
Q. Give a full analysis of the problem.—Florence. The cost of the watch is 100 per cent of itself, 
and he lost 163 per cent. The difference is 834 per cent, or $180. 
Q. How do you find the cost when you have that? 
Florence. $180 is 83} per cent of the cost of the watch, or § of the cost; one-sixth of the cost of the — 
watch equals one-fifth of $180, which is $36, and six sixths, or the cost of the watch, are six times $36, 
which are $216. 
Myrtle. 100 per-cent, the cost of the watch, less 163 per cent equals 834 per cent, or $180. 1 per cent 
would equal one eighty-three and one-third of $180, or $2.16; 100 per cent would equal 100 times $2.16, 
or $216. 
Q. A house and lot were sold for $7,762.50, at a gain of 15 per cent. What was the cost? What is 
the first step in working this problem?—Ethel. 100 per cent of the cost of the house and lot plus 15 
per cent gain is 115 per cent of the cost, or $7,762.50. 
Q. What is the next step? 
Ernst Z. The cost would be as many times $1 as 115 per cent is contained times in $7,762.50. 
(Seven pupils did not have an answer at the expiration of 45 seconds.) 
Nana. $6.750. 
Q. Explain it—Maggie K. The cost of the house and lot is 100 per cent, and if he gained 100 per 
cent— 
Teacher. I do not agree with you.—Leslie. 100 per cent, or the cost, plus 15 per cent, the gain, is 
115 per cent of the cost, or $7,762.50; and the cost would be as many times $1 as 115 per cent is con- 
_ tained times in $7,762.50, or 6,750 times, or $6,750. 
Teacher. Correct his mistake.—Hugh. The cost would be as many times $1 as 1.15 is contained 
times in $7,762.50, or 6,750 times, or $6,750. 
Q. In percentage what would you call that $6,750?—Ernest B. The base. ° 
Q. What would you call that $7,762.50?--Maggie S. The amount. 
Q. A man sold two horses for $150 each; on one he gained 25 per cent, and on the other he lost 25 per 
cent. Did he gain or lose by the transaction, and how much? What do we first do in this problem ?— 
Daisy. Find the cost of the first horse. 
Q. What next?—Julia. Find the cost of the second horse. 
Q. And then what?—Ethel. Find the gain or loss on each. 
Q. What else could you do rather than that?-—Fred. Add the costs and selling prices, and subtract. 
(One-half of the pupils had the problem solved in one minute; all had finished in 14 minutes.) 
Q. What was the question? 
May. Did he gain or lose by the transaction, and how much? 
Alfred. He lost $20. 
Hugh. He gained $20. 
Jessie. He neither gained nor lost. 
Frank G. He gained $38.50. 
Q. Explain.—Florence. The cost was four-fourths. If he gained 25 per cent on one, or 4, $150 was 
the sum of ¢ and 4, or §. If § of the cost equal $150, one-fourth of the cost was one fifth of $150, or 
$30, and four-fourths, or the cost, was four times $30, or $120, which is the cost of the horse on which 
he gained 25 per cent. If on the other horse he lost 25 per cent, or one-fourth of the cost, then the

-P-A-G-E-642
  594 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
difference between four-fourths of the cost and one-fourth of the cost is three-fourths of the cost, or 
$150. If $150 is three-fourths of the cost, one-fourth of the cost is one-third of $150, which is $50. 
» Four-fourths, or the cost, would be four times $50, which are $200. If the second horse cost him $200, 
and the other horse cost him $120, the entire cost is the sum of $120 and $200, which is $320. The 
entire selling prices of the two horses is the sum of $150 and $159, which is $300. He would lose the 
difference between $320 and $300, which is $20. 
} (Nine pupils had wrong answers.) 
Q. An agent furnished a schoolhouse for $45, and received $5.40 commission. What was the rate of. 
commission? Whatis the first step in the problem?—Una. Find the rate. 
Q. In percentage what would the $45 be called?—Una. It would be the base. 
Q. What would the $5.40 be?—Saul. It would be the percentage. 
Q. What would be required to find? 
Class. The rate. 
(Every pupil had an answer in one minute; two pupils had wrong answers.) 
Willie. $1.80. 
Q. What pupil will tell me why Willie can not bo right? 
Ernst Z. Because the answer is to be the rate per cent, and he gave hi: 
Fred. 12 per cent. 
Alfred. 10 per cent. 
Teacher. 12 per centis correct. 
Q. An agent received 5 percent for buying wool, and his commission was $208.50; how much wool 
did he buy? What do we want to find in this problem?—Ethel. How much wool he bought. 
Q. What would that be in percentage?—Ethel. Base. 
Q. What would be the rate in this problem?—Frank G. The 5 per cent. 
Q. What would you call the $208.50?—Mary. Percentage. 
Q. How do we always find the base when we have the rate and percentage given? 
Olga. Divide the percentage by the rate to find the base. 
Ernst Z. He bought $4,170 worth of wool. If he received 5 per cent commission for buying wool, 
and received $208.50, he would buy as many dollars’ worth of wool as 5 cents are contained times: in 
$208.50, which are 4,170 times or $4,170. 
Q. A Boston merchant sent his broker in Cincinnati $3,529.20 to be invested in bacon, after deduct- 
ing his commission of 2, percent. How much bacon did he buy? What do we first want to find ?— 
Alfred. We want to find how much money he invested in bacon. 
Q. Whatis the first step?—Tom. Add 100 per cent and 2 per cent. 
Q. Why? 
‘Tom. Because every dollar's worth of bacon the broker bought would cost the merchant $1.02—one 
dollar and the 2 cents commission, which makes $1.02. 
Ernst. For every dollar's. worth of bacon the broker buys he received two cents for commission, 
and altogether, the one dollar for the bacon and his commission would be $1.02, and the entire bill 
would be the sum of what he received for bacon and his commission, or $3,529.20.

answer.) 
Q. What parts of speech have special forms in regard to case?—Stella. Pronouns. 
Q. You mean by this that only pronouns have special forms for cases. What shall I ask you to do 
if I speak about giving the cases of nouns?—Anna. Give the declension. 
Q. You may decline any noun you wish.—Kitty. Singular: Nominative, man; possessive, man’s; 
objective, man. Plural: Nominative, men; possessive, men’s; objective, men. 
Q. Do we find three different forms for the three cas . We find only two forms. 
Q. Where do we find these two different forms?—Ray. The nominative and objective are 
the possessive is different. 
Q. Nouns being alike in the nominative and objective, and different in tlic possessive, let us see 
how it is with pronouns. Declino I.--Eva. Singular: Nominative, I; possessive, my or mine; obje

Q. Lo what modification of pronouns?—George. Case. 
Q. What is the caution in to-day's lesson?—Ada. The pronouns, J, we. thou, ye, he, she, they, and 
who are nominative forms, and must not be used in the objective. Me, us, thee, him, her, them, and 
whom are objective forms, and must not be used in the nominative. 
Q. What do the sentences given you illustrate?—Wallace. They illustrate errors in uso of case.’ , 
These sentences in our lesson are not correct. 
(Pupils repeat the incorrect sentences, then correct them, and state the reasons.) 
Anna. It is not me you are in love with. Correct: Itis not Cyou are in love with. Tis the attribute 
complement, and should be in the nominative case. 
Tom. He was neither better bred nor wiser than you or me. Correct: He was noitlier better bred 
nor wiser than you or I, The nominative F should be used instead of the objective me, because it is 
the subject of the verb understood. 
Q. Why did you not change the case of the word you? 
nominative or objective. 
Q. Where do we make our errors in the use of case?—Wallace. In using the nominative for the 
objective, and the objective for the nominative. 
Q. In which case do we not make this kind of mistake?—Wallace. In the possessive. 
Q. What error do we generally make in the use of the possess 
Stella. An error in spelling. 
Anna. Who will go? Me. Correct: Who will go? I. The nominative I should be uscd instead of 
the objective me, because it is the subject of the verb will go, understood. 
Daisy. Him being a stranger, they easily misled him. Correct: He being a stranger, they easily 
misled him. ‘The objective Him should not be used for the nominative he, because it is used independ- 
ently with the participle. 
Q: Now, you may think of what you have done, and recall the instances in which we need to use the 
nominative case. 
Jessie. We need to uso the nominate case when the word is used 
complement, and when it is used independently, 
Ray. And when it is used as explanatory modifier. 
Q. This, so far, has not been shown. Give an illustration of a pronoun used as explanatory modi- 
fier, selecting from the list of sentences in this lesson.—Carrie. It was Joseph, he whom Pharaoh pro- 
moted. 
Q. In what case is the word /ie?—Maggie. In the nominative case. 
Q. Why is ié in the nominative case?—Osmar. Because the word it explains is in tle nominative 
case. 
Q. Are all explanatory modifiers in the nominative 
is always in the same case as the word it explains 
Q. In what other instance do we need the nominative case besides those mentioned ?—(No answer.) 
Assignment of lesson. Now, in preparation for to-morrow’s lesson, you may select from this list of 
sentences all those in which the error of using the objective for the nominative has been made, and 
correct all such errors, being very careful to think of the reason for such corrections. You will then

  (Sentence is read, pupil corrects and states reason.) 
1, Him and me are good friends. 
Tessie. He and I are good friends. The objective forms him and me should not be used for the 
nominative forms he and I, because they form the compound subject of the sentence. 
2. Lhe two friends were her and me. 
Florence. The two friends were she and I. ‘The objective forms her and me should not be used for 
the nominative forms she and I, because they form the compound attribute complement of the intransi- 
tive verb were. 
3. Who did you see? i Willie. Whom did you see? The nominative form who should not be used for the objective form 
whom. Whom is the object complement of the transitive verb did see. 
4, Who did you ask for?

whom, because it is the principal word in a prepositional phrase.

form his, because when the antecedent is preveded by every, it makes 1t singular, and a pronoun must 
agree with its antecedent in number.

-P-A-G-E-652
604 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
George. I gave tho horse oats, but he would not eat them, ‘The singular pronoun it should not be 
used for the plural them, because its antecedent, ots, is plural, and the pronoun should be plural to 
agree with it. 
7. Time and tide waits for no man. 
Ollie. Time and tide wait for no man. ‘The singular verb waits should not be used for the plural verb 
wait. The verb should agree in number with its compound subject, time and tide. 
8. Each hour and each day bring their portion of duty. 
Sadie. Each hour and each day brings its portion of duty. I changed the plural verb bring to the 
singular verb brings, because the verb should agree with its subject each hour and each day in the 
singular number. 
Q. Why is the subject singular?—Sadie. The subject is singular because it is a compound subject 
preceded by each. . 
Q. Why did you change the pronoun?—Sadie. I changed the pronoun them to the pronoun it because 
the pronoun should agree with its antecedent in the singular number. 
9, Neither Jane nor Mary are at home. 
George. Neither Jane nor Mary is at home. The plural verb are should not be used for the singular 
verb is, because when a compound subject is preceded by neither or nor, the singular verb should be 
used.

used without an auxiliary verb, and the past tense did should not be used with the auxiliary verb.

have, and the past participle gone should not be used without an auxiliary. 
12. He throwed the ball over the fence. 
Nellie. He threw the ball over the fence. There is no such word as throwed, because throw is an 
irregular verb. S 
Q. What are the principal parts of the verb throw?—Jessie. Present, throw; past, threw; past par- 
ticiple, thrown. 
Q. What is an irregular verb?—Willie. An irregular verb is one that does not form its past tense 
and past participle by adding ed to the present. 
13. Did you sleep good? 
George. Did you sleep well?—The adjective good should not be used for the adverb well, because it 
answers the question, How did you sleep? and words that answer the question how are adverbs. 
14. This is the most pleasantest day we have had. 
Cecelia. This is the pleasantest day we have had; or, this is the most pleasant day we have had. 
The adjective pleasant should not be compared twice by the use of most and est. 
Q. How many ways are there of comparing the adjective pleasant ?—Cecelia. Two ways. Positive, 
pleasant; comparative, pleasanter; superlative, pleasantest; or positive pleasant; comparative, more 
pleasant; superlative, most pleasant. 
15. The younger of those three boys is the smarter. 
Willie. The youngest of those three boys is the smartest. The comparative forms younger and 
smarter should not be used for the superlative forms youngest and smartest. The superlative form is 
required, because there are three boys compared. 
@ Who can change that sentence so that the adjectives used would be correct?—Sadie. The 
younger of those two boys is the smarter. 
Q. Why is that correct?—Sadie. Because when there are two boys compared the comparative 
degree should be used.

two of the class were able to give it with the correct wording. Then the children were told to write 
it out on their slates.) :

LESSONS IN REPRODUCTION. 
  Assistant Superintendent. I see here a composition by one of your pupils. Pleaso tell me how the 
pupils got the facts that they have recorded ?—Miss Kube. ‘There were some visitors present last week, 
and Lasked the children if they would write an essay if I brought them a book they had never seen. 
Ibrought in a book containing this story. ‘Two of the books were given to the pupils, while I retained 
one. The children read a paragraph round about; and when one had read a paragraph he gave the 
book to a child directly behind him. ‘This child, in turn, gave the book to the one back of him, until 
the book had gone around the class. After which the books were gathered. Some of the more difli- 
cult words, such as Nanuk, Bruin, Metek, Agoonaek’s father, were put on the board in response to a 
child's inquiry how to spell one or the other. The children had not seen the words before. The 
children were then asked to write an essay. There were no questions asked, excepting some help was 
given on the spelling. 
Assistant Superintendent. Were the slates corrected before the compositions were copied ?—Miss 
Kube. Some of them were looked over, but no important changes or corrections were made. 
Teacher. During this reading lesson the children were asked first to see the country, the people or 
the animals around the place, to understand exactly what is said. Then they were asked, “Do you 
see what one little girl is doing?” or ‘Do you see the house the seal has made for its baby?” When 
we were through we asked the children to write an essay abont what they remembered in the reading 
lesson. We think that this way of doing cultivates the habit of observation and leads the children 
to seo the conditions of the life they read about. ‘This is what produces the particular characteristic 
of this work. The two following essays are the result of the aboye lesson: 
     
  The story of Agoonack. (Bessie Hanes; age, 10 years.) It is-very cold in thenorth where Agoonack 
and her baby brother live, and where also the bear and the seal live. ‘The seal is very useful to the 
Eskimo people. They use its fat for oil for their lamps and its skin for clothes. ‘The seal makes a 
very pretty house for her baby. She makes a hall through the thick ice, which is as thick as a. small 
person is tall. This hall is for her to take food through to her little one. hero is a little door

joining the room to the hall. The walls of the room are of ice. The room is too small for the mother 
seal to live with her baby; but she does not need to live in a house, forshe ean swim about and her 
baby seal can not. 
Agoonack is arrayed in her little hood and jumper, and is goingsvith her father to hunt seal. They 
are walking along, when Agoonack’s father, Motek, tells her to go behind an iccberg for he sees the 
house of the seal. He gives a sudden jump into the house. The little seal gives a piteous cry as 
Metek takes it up. ‘The mother hears her child's cry and swims quickly to the surface. Metck knows 
she will come, and he is ready fer her. Just as she comes to the surface he throws'a spear at her and 
drags her out of the water. ‘This would seem eruel to you, but Agoonack is used to it and she knows 
that they must have something to cat. 
If Agoonack’s father had known where he had left his little girl, Iam sure he would not have left 
her there. Up alittle ways in the iceberg is a little cave where Nanuk, the bear, lives with her two 
little cubs. The mother bear plays awhile and then they go avout and enjoy themselves sliding down 
the hill. And they lived happily ever afterwards. 
              
‘The story of Agoonack. (Harold Crane, age 10 years.) The seals have homes as well as. anybody 
else. Near the shore are the large icebergs, and in these they make;their homes. The mother seal 
carves the doors and rooms out very neatiy. In the picture, the mother seal is swimming through 
the door, and the baby seal is perched on top of the door. I suppose it is too young to swim. 
Agoonack, the little Eskimo girl, goes with her father; Metek. He has along spearin his hand. He 
tells Agoonack to hide behind an iceberg, while he lays and watches for the very seals I have been 
writing about. Very soon the baby seals are spied by Metek, and he rushes forward and the spear 
goes into the poor little seal. Then he waits for the mother seal. He knows she will come after her 
little one. It seems very cruel to kill the gentle animals, but what would Agoonack do without 
them? ‘The seal furnishes the Eskimo with food, clothing, and oil.

Assistant Superintendent. Now, Miss Kube, please let us see your children do gome work 
plan you have outlined. 
Teacher. Pupils, read from “The Seven Little Sisters Prove their Sisterliood,” continuation, pages 
8 toll. 
Tn onr last lesson, we saw Agoonack at the seal house, then at home where they had seal blood soup 
for supper. Now, we aro at her home, and we shall see what they did there. 
Write on your slates what Agoonack found when she came home, who these people were, and what 
tliey did; the presents they gave her, and so on. 
(This was the first time the pupils had ever heard the story. After they had listened to it, they 
reproduced it according to directions on their slates. Some of the most difficult words were put on the 
board.) 
(There were four of the class ready in twenty minutes. ‘The work of two is reproduced verbatim:) 
Edward Thayer: When Agoonack got home she found company. It was a kudlunah, meaning a 
white man. He gave Agoonack a string of beads, and she looked up in his face and said, “Thanks.” 
Metek grunted over a knife, wliieh was the best thing he ever saw to ent with. When Metek asked 
him where his home is, and how he got there, the kudlunah points south and says oomiack, which 
means ship. The kudlunah tells Metek that he will take him to the great oomiack to-morrow. AIL 
day Agoonack has been saying, ‘Koyenna,” meaning thanks. Agoonack is the first to sce him com: 
ing home. She can sce a little black speck on the snow. Metek has presents and treasures when le 
comes home. Metek is called down in the ship to seo the captain. ‘The captain has asked him if he 
will go with him to hunt walruses and seals. But Metek says he can not go and leave his wife and 
children home, because they can not hunt. The captain stops and thinks a minuto, and then tells 
Metek to get them. Metek goes quickly home and gets them, and they all goon the groat oomiack. 
Bessie Smith. When Agoonack gets home from the scal hunt something very strange lappens. A 
white man, or kudlunah, has come to visit them. When Metek asked him where he comes from, and 
when he points south and says oomiack, which means ship, they wonder how he got so far. He takes 
astring of beads from his pocket and gives them to Agoonack. Sho says, “ Koyenna,” which means 
them knives, needles, and thread. ‘That night they stay up late, and even little 
Sipsu, Agoonack’s brother, gets behind his mother and listens to the kudlunah’s stories about the 
oomiack. The next day the kudlunah and Metek goto the oomiack. ‘The kudlunah thinks that maybe 
he had better not trust Metek, but on they go. When Metek gets home he has a great deal to tell 
about the comiack. He tells about something from which fire flashes and a terrible noise follows, 
much better to kill seals with than the spears. Agoonack listens with delight. After the kudlunah 
has been with the Eskimo about three months, he calls Metek into the oomiack down in the cabin. 
He comes up with a smile on his broad face. This is what the captain has been telling him. He 
said, “ Metek, I know you are such a good hunter, and if you will come with me a little farther north, 
T will reward you with guns, pistols, and kniv Metck answers, ‘‘I can not leave my wife and 
children behind. The kudlunah says he can take them along. This is the reason he wears a smile.

CHAPTER XV. 
EDUCATIONAL VALUES. 
[The following article on educational values I reprint from the report of the St. 
Louis schools for the year 1872-73.’ It contains a somewhat fuller discussion of 
some of the points relative to the educative value of the several studies in elemen- 
tary and secondary schools, and in this way may be useful in explaining points that 
are left obscure in the report of the subcommittee on correlation of studies.] 
The educator is called upon especially to scrutinize the character of 
his elementary work. He must see from afar the effects of the trifling 
things with which he makes his beginnings. It is the feeling of this 
duty that has in late years drawn so much attention to Froebel’s theo- 
ries of the kindergarten and to primary education generally. It is all 
essential that the foundation should be sufficient for the superstructure. 
Of late, therefore, much thought has been expended on the question of 
adapting the course of study in the common schools to the actual 
demands upon the citizen in after life. The same zeal which has chal- 
lenged the methods and subjects of the common schools has with still 
more emphasis challenged the higher education in our colleges and uni- 
versities. It has demanded the substitution of more practical studies 
for the traditional disciplinary course. It has asked for more science 
and less Latin or Greek and for a radical extension of the elective sys- 
tem of making up a course of study for each individual. Much has 
been accomplished by this movement toward gaining its points. 
Meanwhile a vigorous reaction has set in, and the old finds its defenders 
and apologists. The discussion widens its scope and extends to many 
other phases not originally called into question, not only the proper 
course of study for the public schools, but their right to exist on appro- 
priations from the public treasury; especially with reference to the 
public high school the discussion is a warm one. Teachers and directors 
of public-school systems have become suddenly aware that there may 
be an “irrepressible conflict” between the system of public and that of 
private instruction. It is somewhat startling to learn that there are 
two systems firmly established in our land confronting each other with 
radically different theories as to a proper course of study. Such hos-

tility could not but develop sooner or later into an open contest. Now 
that the general attention is directed to education as an element of 
national and social strength, we can no longer avoid a discussion of 
these differences and of the theories on which they are based. The 
peaceful victories of industry at Paris, London, and Vienna and the 
colossal victories of Prussian arms at Sadowa and Sedan have aroused 
statesmen and political economists to the study of public education as 
essential to national strength in productive industry and in the field of 
battle as well. What this education should be, how far it should be 
carried, whether cornpulsory or not, whether there should be different 
courses of education, adapted to the supposed destinies of the pupils— 
these and other kindred questions must be discussed in the light of 
fundamental principles, On the one hand it is contended, in the inter- 
est of productive industry, that the public schools, being for the masses 
who ere destined to fill the ranks of common laborers, should give a 
semitechnical education and avoid the purely disciplinary studies. The 
latter should be reserved for private academies and preparatory schools 
founded by private enterprise and open to such of the community as 
can afford to patronize them, The higher education in this country 
conducted in its colleges and universities should, according to this view, 
have no organic relation whatever to the public school system, but only 
to the system of preparatory schools and academies supported by 
private wealth. That the effect of such a state of affairs is to injure 
the cause of education in general, who can doubt, when he reflects that 
such isolation must have the effect of arraying the supporters of public 
schools and those who have received the primary education given in 
them against the supporters of higher education and against the class . 
of citizens who have received it? For it will result that those who 
receive a higher education will have been, during their whole course in 
a system of schools founded on a basis different from the public schools, 
having a different course of study and supported in a radically differ- 
‘ent manner. That the graduates of higher institutions should under 
those circumstances be in sympathy with public school education is 
impossible. The public schoois would necessarily be the schools of a 
easte—of the proletariat—the class whose chief organ is the hand, and 
whose brains are educated solely to serve the hand better. The very 
persons themselves are called “‘ hands” very appropriately. 
In this country, with its boundless possibilities, living as we do 
largely upon our hopes, conscious of a rapid development in the past 
and of great prospects in the future, with a national history whose bio- 
graphical side is the story of “self-made” men, aspiration is the leading 
characteristic of the people, and the poorest immigrant here soon kindles 
with its impulse, and while he endeavors by thrift to accumulate a for- 
tune, he prepares for its perpetuity by educating his children. 
There is nothing more favorable to the character of the foreigner 
newly arrived on our shores than this, that he is everywhere eager to
-P-A-G-E-667
  EDUCATIONAL VALUES. 619 
avail himself of the school privileges, To the self-respect born of 
aspiration, what greater shock can be offered than the establishment 
of caste schools—public schools founded especially for the industrial 
class, to the end that its children being born from “ hands” shall be 
“hands” still, and shall not mingle with the children of the wealtby, 
nor with those of the liberally educated. Such discrimination leads 
the laborer to refuse all school education unless he can afford to pay 
for it in the private school. 
The complete degradation of the public school results. On the one 
hand those who have received higher education have been nurtured in 
an atmosphere of contempt for the free schools of the laboring classes. 
On the other hand the laboring classes themselves despise the symbol 
of their inferiority and the institution designed to make their inferiority 
hereditary. 
But it may be that a higher education demands a primary education 
specially designed as preparation and introduction toit. It is possible 
that an education, to be completed in three or five years, ought to be 
on an entirely different plan from that intended to cover ten or fifteen 
years. If such were found to be the case, our only remedy might be a 
twofold course in the public schools—a so-called “ general course” and 
a “classical course.” Where this were not feasible we might lament 
the fate of the public school, but could not remove its necessary evils. 
It would inevitably become the school of the proletariat, and the flour- 
ishing private school would draw away the children of wealth ‘and 
competence and furnish them a different course of study. 
This question touches most vitally our whole public school system, 
and especially the course of study in the high school. Let us inquire, 
therefore, what are the current standards of education, as set up by 
the public and private schools. 
According to the theory on which college education rests, the pre- 
paratory schools should confine their work almost entirely to the dis: 
ciplinary studies. The mathematics and Latin and-Greek are the main 
requisites for admission. Not only is this the case, but for two years 
after admission there is very little deviation from this course. _Har- 
yard, by raising the standard for admission by at least a year’s work, 
now makes Latin, Greek, and mathematics elective after freshman year, 
and requires physics, rhetoric, history, and elementary French as the 
regular studies of sophomore year. By this it will be seen that if 
public schools are to fit their pupils for the colleges they must adopt 
the same course as the academies and special preparatory schools and 
make thoroughness in collateral or information branches unessential 
for promotion. By the college system these collateral branches shall 
be reached only after the disciplinary course ‘is finished. Even Har: 
vard’s recent and noteworthy changes consist in demanding another 
year’s work in the preparatory school on Latin, Greek, and the mathe- 
matics. A small departure from this looks also in the direction of 
allowing previous work in French and other studies as an equivalent
-P-A-G-E-668
620 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
for required work. The natural sciences are to be included in the pre- 
paratory work at some future time. 
It does not appear that any college has made so great a departure 
as to require for admission just what a public high school would con- 
sider a proper requirement for a diploma, 
‘Phe public schools have generally adopted a course of study resting 
on a different theory from the one on which that of the colleges is 
based. The course of study in the public schools assumes the princi- 
ple that it is best to unite disciplinary studies with collateral studies 
intended to supply information and insight. This union of discipline 
and knowledge must begin in the primary school and continue through 
the high school. 
The amount of actual culture (including under this term both discip- 
line and knowledge) represented by the public high school course is 
almost equal to that attained by the students who have completed sopho- 
more year in most colleges—that is to say, a graduate of a city high 
school is as able to pursue independent investigations into the various 
branches of science and literature, native and foreign, as the college 
student of two years’ standing. What he has been obliged to do 
thoroughly in history, United States and European; in geography, 
descriptive and physical; in English literature and the grammars of 
English, Latin, and French, or German; rhetoricals, writing, spelling, 
and reading; in physics, chemistry, or natural history; in mathemat- 
ies; in mental and moral philosophy—what he has done in these 
studies is an equivalent for the Latin, Greek, and mathematics of 
freshman and sophomore years, together with the preparatory studies 
actually required. ! 
Now, what are the facts as to admission to the colleges? The gradu- 
ate of the high school is placed on the same basis as the specially pre- 
pared student who is really two years his junior in general culture. 
This injustice prevents the high-school graduate from resorting to the 
regular course in our colleges. 
The question is narrowed down to this, Which is the correct system, 
that of the colleges which separates, or that of the public schools 
which unites dicipline and knowledge? If the latter, then the colleges 
. of the land ought to be reconstructed and adapted to the prevailing 
system of education here well established. If the former is right, then 
our public school system ought to. be purged of the collateral work in 
its course of study. Finally, if both are right and necessary, each in 
its own sphere, then it is evident that there is required a system of 
private or public schools which occupy the place that the academy 
system in New England and New York occupies. Into these must be 
sent those pupils who expect to fit for a higher education. This latter 
alternative does not furnish a solution of the difficulty. There still 
remains, as has been stated at length, an irreconcilable conflict between , 
the public school system and the system pursued in these preparatory 
schools. 
 
-P-A-G-E-669
  EDUCATIONAL VALUES. ‘621 
The conflict lies between the systems as now established, and not 
between the systems as they ought to be. It seems to me that the pub- 
lie school system is substantially the correct one, and that the higher 
education of the country should adapt itself to it, This will appear 
evident if I can demonstrate that the best course of study for a short 
school period is a section of the best course of study for a long period, 
and that conversely the long course of study can to best advantage 
take up for its preparatory studies just what the common school should 
teach. In brief, if the course of study is one for culture and for busi- 
ness or the professions, so that, whatever section of it be cut off from 
the beginning furnishes the best course up to that point, whether 
regarded as preparatory to a continuation of the course of study or a 
completed course—then it will be conceded that higher education and 
common school education should both adopt that course, and thus 
become mutually complementary. Then the academies and classical 
schools, private institutions supported as special feeders for the colleges, 
must perforce adopt the same course as the common schools. 
That this is plausible I shall undertake to prove bya brief review of 
the causes that have led to the differences shown to exist, and that it 
is rational I shall endeavor to show by a-survey of the psychological 
principles that should determine the selection of a course of study. 
In all times nations have recognized the necessity of educating their 
directive intelligenee. Those who are to rule are carefully educated for 
this purpose. Public money has never been grudged for the education 
of the governing classes. So soon as the State has found that its 
national strength depended on the education of a special class, that class 
has at once been provided for. The immense sums recently expended 
in the various countries of Europe for industrial education show that 
statesmanship has at last found out that political prosperity depends 
upon the prosperity of the civil community. In our comparatively new 
experiment of a ‘government of the people, by the people, and for the 
people,” to educate the ruling class means to educate all the people. 
But in the earlier days of our history the system of education was 
definitely shaped toward providing a learned few to look after the 
highest interests, the clergy, the physicians, the lawyers. The three 
R’s, reading, writing, and arithmetic, were for all. To these essentials 
the candidates for the profession added Latin, Greek, and higher mathe- 
matics, and then entered professional schools to study their specialties. 
A liberal education included the classics and mathematics, the common 
school education included only the three R’s. But the newspaper and 
magazine, together with rapid transportation, have opened up so great 
possibilities to the one who possesses a common education that he con- 
tinues his theoretic education after school life almost inevitably. The 
former standard of a liberal education is attained by the average of the 
community. The development and rapid growth of the sciences and of 
modern literature have added such immense provinces to the domain
-P-A-G-E-670
  622 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
set apart for a liberal education that it now bears little resemblance to 
its first shape and magnitude. Hence, it happens that while our higher 
education demands only disciplinary studies as preparatory to it, and 
then proceeds to add at least two years more of disciplinary studies, 
the growth of realized intelligence, in the shape of science and litera- 
ture, has introduced changes that have destroyed its symmetry and 
adaptation. In the common school the three R’s have been so expanded 
by the contents they have received from literature and the sciences of 
nature, and of inan, that they furnish much more than is required by 
the colleges, and much more than is used as a foundation for the super- 
structure there built. Moreover, the same causes that have operated 
to expand and fill up the common school course have likewise influenced 
the college course, but not in the same way. Their influence in the 
common school course is felt throughout its entire extent; in the college 
course its presence is recognized by an expansion during the last part 
of it. After discipline is obtained, then the student is prepared to 
apply himself to the rich contents of the modern world. Science, art, 
and history may then be explored. Short excursions are accordingly 
made into those realms, chiefly, however, by means of the oral lectures 
of the professor, who gives fine summaries of what has been accom- 
plished in this or that special province. To such students as have no 
familiar acquaintance with a considerable number of the primitive facts 
and details, the generalizations of the professor are vague and mean- 
ingless. The ideal of the course of study in our higher education finds 
thus its type in the palm tree, which climbs nearly to its full height 
branchless and then expands suddenly into full foliage. If the plan 
which the public schools have unconsciously and undesigningly adopted 
were followed, its type would bea tree that expands into foliage from 
below up to the top. What serious obstacle is there in the way of 
adopting for the college course a curriculum involving a central axis of 
discipline studies and a complement of accessory branches yielding 
information and insight? To the severe disciplines of Latin, Greek, and 
the mathematics, add the sciences—both natural and social-political— 
and literature and civil history. The preparation for college should 
then demand the rudiments of science, literature, and history. This 
change would adapt the college to the public school course. 
I do not ignore here the important consideration—once far more 
important than now—which goes to justify the present college course. 
I allude to the principle that education must involve a period of 
estrangement from the common and familiar. The pupil must be led 
out of his immediateness and separated in spirit from his naturalness, 
in order that he may be able to return from his self-estrangement to 
the world that lies nearest to him and consciously seize and master it. 
Without such self-alienation that which lies nearest to man and deepest 
in his nature does not become objective to him at all, but remains 
merely instinctive and implicit. Therefore there is a deep-lying ground 
for taking the student out of the familiar modern world and requiring
-P-A-G-E-671

him to breathe the atmosphere of the far-off and distant world of 
antiquity for several years of his life. When he again approaches his 
own world he is vividly conscious of it by reason of its obvious differ- 
ences from the classic world, with which he has become familiar. 
Further reasons to strengthen this position will also be found in a con- 
sideration of the specific psychological import of the study of the 
classics, a consideration which it is necessary to undertake as a pre- 
liminary to the thorough investigation of the principles of a course of 
study. I will anticipate here, however, the final grounds of decision 
against the present system by saying that the expansion of the modern 
world of realized intelligence is so great that it leads the student quite 
irresistibly into the self-estrangement spoken of above. Its art and 
literature portray the widest and deepest collisions of the problem of 
life; its science enumerates the whole range of existences, whether 
corporeal, like the mineral, plant, or animal, or incorporeal, like human 
institutions and generalizations. Besides this, the proper mastery over 
any province of knowledge involves three stages, and these must be 
separated in time long enough to allow of complete assimilation. The 
pereeptive, the reflective, and the stage of insight can not be simul- 
taneous. This points to the principle which requires the course of 
study to be exhaustive at each of its epochs—including all the repre- 
sentative provinces in some one of their types at all stages of progress. 
The mind should grow with all its windows open from the beginning. 
What it acquires in its early stages will be rudimentary, but will fur- 
nish a rich native store for future thought when the period of reflec- 
tion sets in stronger and stronger. The roots of the sciences and 
literature and history should go down deep into the earliest years, so 
that the unconscious influence derived thence shall assist in molding 
the taste, will, and intellect during the most plastic period of growth. 
Without this thorough assimilation with the whole intellectual being— 
the unconscious molding of one’s view of the world (Weltvorstellung, 
as the Germans call it)—a growth of years—later scientific and literary 
studies are likely to be barren, lacking a fruitful soil in the disposition 
(Gemiith) and phantasy. Almost everything great in the world of 
reason has.a slow gestation, first gathering force in the disposition and 
then in the phantasy, coming gradually into shape and definiteness 
through a series of monstrous forms before it sees the light of conscious 
reason. 
THE STUDY OF THE CLASSICS. 
No one who considers carefully the psychological results of classic 
study can help feeling some degree of dismay at the treatment such 
study receives at the hands of a majority of our so-called ‘prominent 
educators.” 
The cause of the public schools is indeed greatly injured by unwise 
zeal. Much of the alienation discoverable toward public schools on 
the part of those who conduct higher education is traceable to that
-P-A-G-E-672
  624 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
feeling of distrust engendered by the tirades of naive, unconscious men, 
who find themselves face to face with a question that has two antithetic 
extremes, whose mediation reaches far down into the mysteries, With 
the cant of progress and reform on their tongues and a polemical 
flourish of the epithet “old fogy,” they challenge whatever they can 
not justify on immediate, simple, and therefore shallow grounds. 
Hence they are sure to challenge pretty much all that is deep and 
rational. Nor are they the ones to blame. For there is little adequate 
justification proffered on the part of the installed professors who would 
seem called upon to defend their province of activity by showing its 
rationality. 
This is partly due, again, to the isolation of higher education from 
common school education. Those who have prepared for college have 
conquered their prejudices and yielded to the demands of the higher 
course. Training has obliterated the traces of protest which might 
some time have burst forth. Hence the justification of the college 
curriculum is not undertaken, but left a tenet of blind faith. It is true, 
a few traditional grounds are stated in a somewhat mechanical manner. 
Discipline, culture, accuracy of thought, and expression—these are the 
stock arguments in favor of classical study. 
With a view to a more thorough examination of these points I have 
ventured to discuss them here in their psychological bearings. It is 
essentially a psychological question. What influence on the mind have 
these studies? What peculiar influence arises from the study of Latin 
and Greek that the modern languages do not exert upon the scholar? 
What is the definite meaning of the words “discipline,” “culture,” 
“exactness of thought,” “refining influence,” when applied to the 
results of classical study, or what is the ground on which these lan- 
guages are called “perfect”? 
The Latin and Greek languages are spoken of as being “perfect”? in 
the sense of completeness as regards further growth, or as regards 
‘etymological inflections, or as regards syntactical organism, or, finally, 
as regards capability of expression, whether artistic, scientific, or his- 
torical. This latter designation (“perfect”) does not seem to recom- 
mend itself as a substantial reason for the prominent place Latin and 
Greek hold in education. In the first sense, as complete in respect to 
growth, they would have no advantage over the Anglo-Saxon, the old 
Norse, the Zend, the Sanscrit, or any other dead language. Nor is it 
obvious at first glance why such completeness is an advantage. Why 
should we not rather study a living, organic growth, wherein we can 
trace a process actually going on? Lawsare manifested only in transi- 
tions from one stage to another. Again, if inflections are considered, 
what thoughtful man will assert that inflections are a mark of perfec- 
tion? Is the Sanscrit more perfect than the Latin or Greek because it 
inflects twice as much as the latter? Does not maturity of spiritual 
development do away with inflections? Could the syntax of Greek or
-P-A-G-E-673
EDUCATIONAL VALUES. 625 
Latin do any more wonderful things than the syntax of Milton or 
Shakespeare? ‘Could the language of Cicero express what that of Burke 
could not, or that of Plato and Aristotle express what Hegel and 
Schelling found German inadequate to do? It is doubtful if any of 
these questions could be answered in such a way as to defend Latin 
and Greek on the ground of a superior degree of perfection over all 
other languages. 
But there are better grounds for the support of classical study. As 
subsidiary reason for the study of Latin one may name its importance 
to the English-speaking people on account of the fact that it furnishes 
the root words to that part of our vocabulary which is more especially 
the language of thought and reflection, while the Teutonic or Gothic 
groundwork is the language of the sensuous experience and of common 
life. Hence it happens that even a little study of Latin makes a great 
difference in the grasp of the mind as regards generalization and prin- 
ciples. Without Latin the trope and metaphor underlying the abstract 
terms necessary to express all elevated sentiment or thought in English, 
and more specifically all scientific results—whether moral, legal, spiri- 
tual, or natural—is not perceived nor felt. Such trope or metaphor is 
the basis of abstract terms, and hence the latter have been called “ fossil 
poetry.” To gain command of the resources of a language one must 
revivify this poetic element, must acquire a feeling of the trope and 
metaphor which it contains. 
This argument for the study of Latin by English-speaking people 
holds good in a greater or less degree for the Romanic nations of mod- 
ern times. But it is not so convincing when applied to the Germanie, 
Norse, and Slavonic peoples. It is when we come to look the question 
earnestly in the face, as applied to all European culture, that we begin 
to see its truer and deeper psychological bearing. 
I have already quoted the remark of Schopenhauer that—   
A man who does not understand Latin is like one who walks through a beautiful 
region in a fog; his horizon is very close to him, He sees only the nearest things 
clearly, and a few steps away from him the outlines of everything become indistinct 
or wholly lost. But the horizon of the Latin scholar extends far and wide through 
the centuries of modern history, the middle ages, and antiquity. 
Here we have the essential kernel of the matter hinted at under a 
figure of speech. 
The object of education in the school should be to clear up the mind 
and give substance and discipline to its powers. To attain to clearness 
there is but one way—the student, engrossed in his little world of 
opinions and caprices, must learn the presuppositions of his being and 
activity. The individual looks out from his narrow environs i: the 
now and here and sees that he is what heis mostly through conven- 
tionality. He does this or that because others do it; he acquired the 
habit when a child and has never questioned its rationality. His family 
and immediate circle of acquaintances have given him his habits of 
ED 9440 : 
   
-P-A-G-E-674
626 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
thinking and acting. He leoks further and sees that the community 
in which he lives is governed likewise by use and wont. Tradition is 
the chief factor; accidental modifications of time and place enter as a 
less important factor; another factor in the result is the law of develop- 
ment or evolution, wherein he sees a gradual change ensuing from 
internal growth. Through observation of this latter fact—that of evo- 
lution—he is carried at once beyond his community and beyond all 
contemporary communities. He begins to trace the historic evolution 
of his own civilization out of the past. Out of the formless void of 
his consciousness there begin to arise some intimations of his where- 
about, and whence and whither. 
Even the most materialistic science of our time hastens to caution us 
that we should never seek to know the individual by isolating him from 
his conditions. To know an individual thing scientifically, we must 
study it in its history. It is a part of a process. Its presuppositions 
are needed to make it intelligible. Only in the perspective of its his- 
tory can we see it so as to comprehend it as a whole. 
If aman does not know nor feel his existence, he can not be said to 
live it as an independent existence. The humblest piece of dirt beneath 
our feet pulsates with vibrations that have traveled hither from the 
farthest star. But the clod does not know nor feel its community with 
the universe of matter. That wniverse does not exist for the clod; con- 
sequently the clod does not exist for itself. When we learn to know 
our entire being it exists for us, and therein we come to exist for our- 
selves. It is conscious communion with one’s existence that makes it 
one’s own. The more complete the consciousness the higher and more 
personal the being. The man who does not know his history nor the 
history of his civilization, does not consciously possess himself. His 
existence, as involved in those presuppositions, is not for him, is hence 
unassimilated, and therefore exists as his fate and not as his freedom. 
The first requisite for directive power is knowledge. Directive intelli- 
gence, knowledge itself, may ceaselessly modify the effects of its pre- 
suppositions as it finds them on itself, and. by successive acts of the 
will may determine itself in accordance with its pure ideal. This is 
freedom. 
When the scholar learns his presuppositions and sees the evolution 
afar off of the elements that have come down to him and entered his 
being—elements that form his life and make the conditions which 
surround him and furnish the instrumentalities which he must wield— 
then he begins to know how much his being involves, and in the con- 
sciousness of this he begins to be somebody in real earnest. He begins 
to find himself. The empty consciousness fills with page oe its 
own proper substance; it subsumes its particular being under the gen- 
eral self which it finds to be its truc being; it “stands under” itself; 
rises from a particular special form of being to a generic, universal 
form thereof, which may be called cuiture. 
 
-P-A-G-E-675
EDUCATIONAL ‘VALUES. 627 
Thus for ages the mind of youth has been trained in the schools on 
the two “dead languages,” Latin and Greek. For the evolution of the 
civilization in which we live and move and have our being issued 
through Greece and Rome on its way to us. We kindled the torches 
of our institutions—of the watchfires of our civilization—at their 
sacred flames. The organism of the State, the invention of the forms 
in which man may live in a civil community and enjoy municipal and 
personal rights—these trace their descent in a direct line from Rome 
and were indigenous to the people that spoke Latin. In our civil and 
political forms-we live Roman life to-day. That side or phase of the 
complex organism of modern civilization is Roman. Our scientific and 
esthetic forms come from beyond Rome; they speak the language of 
their Greek home to this very day, just as much as jurisprudence and 
legislation pronounce their edicts in Roman -words. Religion points 
through Greece and Rome to a beyond in Judea for a still deeper 
spiritual presupposition. 
To assimilate this antecedent stage of existence it is not sufficient 
to form an acquaintance with it by reading its history or literature in 
translations. The thorough assunilation of it in consciousness demands 
such an immediate contact with it as one gets by learning the lan- 
guages of those people—the clothing of their inmost spiritual selves. 
We must don the garb in which they thought and spoke in order to 
fully realize in ourselves these embryonic stages of our civilization. 
For we know truly what we have lived through. We must live it in 
our dispositions or feelings, then realize the forms which it takes on in 
the phantasy, i.e., its art forms, and finally seize it in the abstract con- 
ceptions of the understanding and grasp its highest syntheses in the 
principles of the reason. The earlier stages, that of feeling and that of 
phantasy, can be reached best through the natural symbolism of the 
word. Each national spirit reveals itself to itself in its own way by its 
language. Translation loses this peculiar element of feeling, although 
it retains the higher rational element. But in the present instance it 
is essential to retain precisely the immediate, naive, germinal “cell 
growth” of those national spirits whose results we have assimilated. 
From the modern scientific idea of method—even that called Dar- 
winism—we see the absolute necessity of mastering our history in 
order to know ourselves. We must take up into our consciousness our 
presupposition befere we can be in a condition to achieve practical 
freedom. Just as the uncultivated person feels and knows his narrow 
circle of sensations, desires, appetites,and volitions as his personal 
existence, his ‘ego,” so the man of culture recognizes his identity with 
the vast complex of civilization, with the long travail of human history: 
“He omnipresent is, 
All round himself he lies, 
Osiris spread abroad, 
Upstaring in all eyes.” 
   
-P-A-G-E-676
628 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
For he looks at himself through the eyes of mankind and sees him- 
self in mankind. History is the revelation of what is potentially in 
each man., 
We may now inquire what aspect the question of the substitution of 
a modern language—say German or French—for Latin or ot has. 
Is it not clear that a modern language stands to English in the relation 
of coordination and not in any sense in that of a presupposition? As 
immediate facts, German and French stand in need of explanation 
through evolution, just as much as the English does. Their civiliza- 
tions are not embryonic stages of English civilization, but rather repe- 
titions of it. To suggest a study of German or French as a substitute 
for Latin or Greek would be paralleled in the science of zoology by 
suggesting a study of snakes instead of tadpoles in the embryology of 
the frog. 
Greece and Rome stand at the entrance to the modern world or the 
occidental phase in world history. Greece introduces the idea of indi- 
viduality into history in place of the oriental idea of substance. Rome 
deepens the idea of individuality to that of legal person. Both nations 
conquered the Orient. First, Greece, under Alexander, avenged its 
wrongs, long suffered at the hand of Persia, by subduing Asia Minor, 
Syria, Egypt, Persia proper, Bactria, and western India. The Greek 
kingdoms in Asia Minor and Egypt were for centuries the seats of 
science. The Greek kingdoms in Syria and Bactria—no one knows 
how much the East Indians and Chinese owe to them in the way of 
seraps of science and art. 
Then Rome brought under her yoke the western and northern barba- 
rians, rooted out Carthage, and extended her sway to the east over 
Greece and the Greek empires temporarily. The great modern States 
were born in the Roman colonies of the west, and were nurtured under 
her civil code of laws and with such Greek refinement as followed in 
the wake of Roman wealth and might. Finally, Christianity, sheltered 
under the Roman eagle, found its way to all lands that were destined 
to enter modern civilization, and under the threefold nurture of Roman 
laws, Greek science, and Christianity the long education went on toward 
national independence and a humanitarian civilization. 
Discipline, culture, exactness of thought, refining influence are, in a 
special sense, results of classical study, inasmuch as it alone furnishes 
a direct road to the conscious possession of the conventionalities of our 
civilization. Greek gives the presuppositions of the theoretical intelli- 
gence; Latin that of the practical (or will side) of the intelligence. 
Mere disciplined ability to give attention to a subject connectedly is 
not adequate to give culture or exactness of thought. Mathematical 
drill suffices for that sort of discipline, but it is accompanied with the 
mental habit of abstracting from and ignoring quality or the concrete 
relations of the most important of subjects—human life.   
 
-P-A-G-E-677
EDUCATIONAL VALUES. 020 
Why the argument in favor of Latin and Greek in education does not 
apply to oriental presuppositions beyond them may be asked. The 
reply is twofold. The most important of the presuppositions mentioned, 
the theoretical and practical, are indigenous with those two peoples— 
the former with Greece, the latter with Rome. Oriental presupposi- 
tion appears in Greece as the basis of myths and of the religious mys- 
teries. The myths represent the overthrow of the doctrine of substance 
by spiritual might—the Titans by the gods of Olympus—Asiatic fate 
by European free personality. 
The Roman presupposition appears still less’ to be derived from the 
Orient. It isnot in any proper sense to be regarded as a reaction 
against the Orient, although Greece is such a reaction. The presuppo- 
sition of Christianity is, however, found in the Orient, in Judaism, and 
this fact is sufficiently emphasized in that part of our education which 
is left to the church. The spiritual elements embodied in. religion 
are far more subtle than those we have just considered. But their 
discussion does not belong here. 
With this hasty survey of the most important and most hotly con- 
tested question in higher education, let us approach the theme whose 
discussion is to throw light on the true relation of colleges and 
universities to the public schools.    
THE COURSE OF STUDY. 
To discover precisely what the pupil gets from studying a particular 
branch—what he adds to his mental structure in the way of discipline 
and knowledge—is one of the problems of educational psychology. 
Without determining accurately the value of a given study by ascer- 
taining what the pupil is to gain from it in the way of information that 
shall make clear his view of life or in the way of discipline that shall 
increase his strength to grapple with other problems, the educator is 
not in a condition to decide where it belongs in the course of study or 
how much time it demands. Indeed, it may be said that the want of 
such preliminary investigation has injured our educational system and 
is injuring it fully as much as all other causes combined. It is owing 
to the lack of psychological insight that we have so many changes in 
theories and systems, so much advocacy of one-sided extremes. 
Caprice and arbitrariness determine the choice of this or that study. 
The likes and dislikes of the teacher settle the course of the pupil; the 
whim of the parent is allowed to do the same thing. 
We have just seen some of the psychological grounds for the large 
place classical study holds in the curriculum of our higher education. 
When Latin was the language of the learned, its paramount impor- 
tance in education was not questioned. It is at first somewhat sur- 
prising to discover that it is still the language of the learned who speak 
English, for the reason that the vocabulary of science, of refined ecul- 
ture, and of abstract thought or generalization, is nearly all of Latin 
 
-P-A-G-E-678
  630 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
derivation. But more important than this is the subtle spiritual gain 
derived from the increase of mental strength to analyze and combine 
the clements of human interests—still more important, the clearing 
up of the view of human life, the certainty of conviction obtained by 
the contemplation of human nature in its evolution through long inter- 
vals of time. 
Our inquiry will lead us to investigate the twofold division of 
branches in the course of study into disciplinary and information- 
giving ones. We shall find both classes of studies in the elementary 
branches taught in common schools, and likewise in the more advanced 
studies of the high school and college. What psychology teaches us 
in regard to the elementary branches must be seen first. In its light 
we can then discuss the continuation of the same by the high school 
and college. We can also decide the extent to which the desire of dis- 
cipline or information should lead us in selecting the branches to be 
pursued. The “elementary branches ” alluded to are— 
I. Reading and writing—the mastery of letters. 
Il. Arithmetic—the mastery of number. 
III. Geography—the mastery over place. 
TV. Grammar—the mastery over the word. 
VY. History—tho mastery over time. 
In order to show the exhaustiveness with which these studies occupy 
the field, both subjectively and objectively, let us reclassify these studies 
under a new order. 
The theoretic survey of the world (and intellectual education must 
undertake to give this) reaches into two realms—the world of matter 
or nature, the world of humanity or spirit. Theoretically considered, 
nature falls into inorganic or organic, and the sciences corresponding 
to these are physics and natural history. Physics (including chemistry) 
treats of the inorganic phases of nature, all of which may be treated 
mathematically or quantitatively. Natural history treats nature’s 
organic phases: meteorology, geology, botany, zoology, and ethnology. 
Meteorology can not strictly be called organic, neither can geology. 
But the former is a circular movement, a process which moves in cycles. 
Moreover, it conditions all organic life through its cycles, and is there- 
fore studied in connection with the latter in physical geography. Geol- 
ogy may be called the “ Harth organism” (the Germans thus name it), 
and it treats of the organic process of: the globe—using organic as more 
general than the term “living.” Mathematics determines the abstract 
a priori laws of time and space. Time and space are the abstract log- 
ical conditions of nature. Mathematics is the general preliminary 
science of nature, which fixes and defines the conditions of nature in 
the abstract. Mathematics, physics, and (organics or) natural history 
form the theory of nature, the first and second (mathematics and 
physics) treating nature analytically or by elements; the third treating 
nature synthetically, as exhibited in organic forms or cyclical processes.
-P-A-G-E-679
  
EDUCATIONAL VALUES. 631 
The world of humanity or spirit is distinguished from that of nature 
by means of this mark or characteristic: It everywhere is self-deter- 
mined by a conscious purpose, while mere nature obeys laws uncon- 
sciously. Spirit is an end to itself. Nature’s forms are ruled and 
swayed by external ends. By “external” ends I mean purposes, 
designs, or objects which are not consciously formed in thought—not 
self-proposed by the being whose end and aim they express. Man can 
form for himself a purpose. He can think his own final cause, and he 
alone can think out and discover the final cause of a merely natural 
being, an unconscious being. 
The theory of man includes three phases: (1) Theory of man as a 
practical being, a will power, a moral being acting socially and -polit- 
ically, a history maker. (2) Theory of man as a theoretical being, a 
thinking power, a rational being, giving an account to itself of the 
world and itself—in short, a science maker. (3) Theory of man as an 
artist, or as a being that represents or portrays himself, embodies his 
ideal in real forms, makes the visible world into his own image—in short, 
as the producer of art and literature. (A fourth sphere—that of 
religion, the obverse of art, a realm wherein man strives to elevate 
himself above all visible forms to the absolute ideal through devotion 
and worship—will occur to the thoughtful classifier. It is so impor- 
tant that it belongs to an education apart from the rest, a sacred educa- 
tion to be found within the church, and not side by side with other 
branches in secular education.) 
To tabulate our results, we find for the total theoretic survey of the 
world the following:    
  f Mathematics. 
Physics (and chemistry). 
TE. Organic... sciiss teed Natural history.* 
IT. Theoretical or thinking ponte ; Logie, philosophy, philology. Mature <2. 2. ---2- 
( j Man or spirit....- 4 Civil history, social and political 
sciences. 
UV. Aisthetic or art power... Literature and art. IV. Practicalor will power. ; 
The two worlds—the macrocosm and the microcosm—here fall under 
five general divisions, as seen in the above general review. 
Our elementary branches distribute according to this general survey 
as follows: 
I. Nature inorganic—arithmetic. 
II. Nature organic—geography. 
IN. Man—theoretical—grammar. 
IV. Man—practical—history. 
VY. Man—sthetic—reading (literature).

meteorological process, geological structure, the plant and animal.

632 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
That these branches lie at the basis, and open first and directly out 
of the mind upon the world, will be evident upon a little consideration. 
It will also become clear that these are the only branches which le 
directly at the door of the uncultivated mind. 
I. Arithmetic quantifies. By its mastery, man to a eh degree 
obtains theoretical dominion over time and space, and by it he can 
formulate the entire inorganic world. The Pythagoreans valued its 
disciplinary significance in that it is the first elevation above what is 
merely sensuous—an elevation through abstraction from particular 
quality. The mastery over number opens the window of the mind 
upon the world of quantity, giving one power to a certain extent to rec- 
ognize aud fix theoretically all quantity. From this study branch out 
the higher mathematics and physics. 
II. Geography localizes. By its mastery man comes to realize his 
spatial relation to the rest of the world. As civilized man the supply 
of his wants of food, clothing, and shelter is a perpetual geographical 
process realized through the division of labor and commercial exchange. 
By this geographical relation each individual becomes participant in 
the entire production of the globe and in turn contributes to all. In 
geography the child learns this fact of interdependence and community, 
which is, even when known particularly and not generalized by him, of 
the greatest possible importance as a category in his thinking or view 
of the world. It is the second window of the mind. Through it he 
learns the organic world and its relations to the human race and to him- 
self individually. Climate (meteorology), surface (geology), plants 
(botany), animals (zoology), man (ethnology, sociology, political and 
religious forms to some extent) are the topics to which he is intro- 
duced, and these are general categories or “tools of thought” whose 
mastery give him great vantage ground; think of him as not possessed 
of these distinctions in his mind and see what imbecility in dealing 
with the world would result. Shut up the geographical window of the 
soul and what darkness ensues! From this study branch out in higher 
education the special organic sciences indicated in the parentheses 
above used. 
III. Grammar fixes and defines speech. Byits mastery man obtains 
the first mastery over his mind as an instrument. To grammar belong 
reading and writing considered as orthography. And grammar in this 
aspect is the first study in school and the most powerful lever for all 
development of what is human. It is the key to all that is spiritual. 
By the arts of reading and writing or orthography man issues forth 
from the circumscribed life of the senses in which he is confined to his 
own immediate experience and to that of his small circle of acquaint- 
ances. He issues forth into the world revealed through the printed 
page—a world extending as wide as the human race and deep into 
time, as deep as the earliest hieroglyphics will lead him. The library 
opens to him and he can now use all the senses of all mankind, for their 
 
-P-A-G-E-681
  EDUCATIONAL VALUES. 633 
observations have been reported; he can use their thoughts and feel- 
ings, for these also have been reported. His own five senses, used 
unaided, would take him but little way in beholding the spectacle of 
the universe. But by means of this auxiliary of orthography he can 
supplement his finite being by the human race and he thereby comes 
into an infinite heritage. Grammar as etymology and syntax initiates 
the pupil into the general forms of thought itself. Thus there branch 
out logic, psychology, and metaphysics, as well as the various phases 
of philosophy. Has it not been said indeed that the father of logic 
discovered its forms through grammar. Under a thin veil the pupil 
deals with pure thought when he studies syntax. 
IV. History deals with human progress and process. By its mastery 
the child learns to recognize his presuppositions—his existence as con- 
tinued into the past. The precedent conditions are a part and parcel 
of his existence, just as the distant spatial conditions belong to his 
aggregate social conditions, as he learns in geography. As family and 
a nation, his existence is spread out in time; asa social being, it is 
spread out in space. History opens the fourth important window of 
the soul. It looks upon deeds and events, chiefly the former. Man, as 
a will power, unfolds his nature in successive deeds, and thence in 
time, and hence in history, From history branch out the practical or 
will sciences—jurisprudence, politics, and sociology, in the latter 
sharing with descriptive geography the same theme. 
V. Reading, when carried beyond orthography, wherein it is a 
department of grammar, includes the mastery of literature, which is 
the highest realm of esthetics. Poetry, the drama, and prose fiction 
Jead into all art realms. Art portrays, in one shape or another, the 
collisions which the individual encounters in solving the problem of 
life; the collision with the ethical and moral and religious, and the 
collision of the ethical against the moral and religious, as when the 
edict of the state and moral or religious conviction collide; or, finally, 
when the inclination of the individual (love, hate, ete.), collides with 
fate or circumstances. 
These five elementary branches are exhaustive, so far as including 
an initiation into every phase of nature and spirit. No one would leave 
out any of these from the common school curriculum. It remains, 
therefore, for us, in carrying up this education to its higher spheres, to 
retain its exhaustiveness, and not suffer any sphere to drop away 
unrepresented. In the high school course, these five departments are 
continued and reinforced in the following manner: 
(a) Algebra. 
(b) Geometry and trigonometry. 
I. Inorganic nature. { (c) Analytical geometry. 
(d) Natural philosophy.

With so extended a curriculum for the high school, each one of the 
five departments of human culture being filled with what belongs to it 
most directly, it is impossible in its four years’ course to accomplish as 
much in the departments of Latin and Greek as is required of those 
preparatory schools which concentrate their whole energies on the 
classics even to the neglect of higher mathematics. But in the mathe- 
matics greater advance will be made than is required for admission to 
college at present. So in natural sciences the general compends—(1) 
natural philosophy, including an outline of the sciences of inorganic 
nature; (2) physical geography, including an outline of the sciences 
of organic nature and of cyclical nature—these general compends will 
be mastered, and with them the general technics and the general ideas 
of all natural science. Some special sciences, like botany, zoology, or 
physiology, may be studied for the further investigation of methods. 
English hterature, in its history and examples, will be studied to good 
purpose, and the special study of Shakespeare, the greatest of literary 
men, will serve to give the pupil insight into the nature of artistic 
work. History of the United States is studied in the district school. 
The outline of universal history is completed in the high school. .The 
Constitution of the United States is the best discipline for the initia- 
tion of the pupil into the legal style and into the constitutional form 
for political organisms. The triune form, which there has its best 
example, is the type of state organisms, of municipal organisms, and 
to some extent even of corporate organisms. In a country where every 
person, without exception, is necessarily brought into relation with 
various forms of its realization, and is likely to be called upon to assist 
in organizing such, it is highly important that all should be taught 
thoroughly this archetype of our governmental forms. Accordingly, 
in the district schools, he studies its outlines with special reference to 
the coordination of its three separate functions. In the high school he ' 
studies it in its details and practical functions, and with it studies 
also parliamentary law. Some time is given to the outlines of philos- 
ophy, moral and mental, and their history, in the high school.

  EDUCATIONAL VALUES. 635 
What is the course of study for the succeeding four years which the 
college and university occupy? The high school furnishes its pupils 
with less preparation in the classics, and considerably more prepara- 
tion in all other branches. The college course that should adapt itself 
to the publie school system must demand less preparation in the clas- 
sics, but require one modern language; about the same in mathematics 
(i. e., all of algebra, geometry, and trigonometry); more in natural 
science, history, and literature. It would then be able to begin math- 
ematics, in freshman year, with analytical geometry, and require all to 
take the differential and integral calculus in the regular cowrse, leaving 
to the list of elective studies the remaining mathematics. In natural 
science there should be a continuation of the study of inorganic nature 
by special branches, and a more thorough application of mathematics 
to the same; organic nature also should be taught by special branches. 
The ordinary course in Greek and Latin for two years must be strictly 
followed, and, after that, made elective; comparative philology should 
be made a required study for a year. Logic, history of speculative 
philosophy, and the thorough study of the system of one of the greatest 
philosophers, together with a criticism of the latest philosophic move- 
ments of the day should belong to the required course, leaving further 
studies of this class to the elective list. Lectures on the philosophy of 
history, of literature, art, science, etc., should begin early and continue 
throughout the course—not frequently, but at intervals. The practice 
of crowding into the senior year all of this matter does not find the 
students prepared by growth for philosophical generalization, nor ~ 
acquainted with its technique. Advance views can not be communi- 
cated or acquired unless the basis of quiet assimilation has been pre- 
pared. ‘Time is indispensable for the growth of the deep thinker. To 
use two or three years of the college course in learning Latin, Greek, 
and mathematics without attempting any generalization of the results 
does not prepare the pupil to enter into such generalizations, but rather 
confirms in him a doubt as to their possibility. No wonder that so 
many students graduate unable to refute the shallow sophisms with 
which the air is filled by thinkers of the second stage of culture in 
thought, when they ought to have mastered the third stage of thinking 
in college, or at least to have learned that there is such a stage and 
that all the greatest names in philosophy, from Aristotle down, have 
worked in it, and, more than all this, that on the third stage alone are 
found all positive justifications of institutions and all insight into their 
nature. The study of literature, art, social science, polities, law, eth- 
nology, philology, universal history, and psychology should be con- 
ducted through lectures on their philosophy, and accompanied by 
recitation work in special provinces for the sake of illustration of prac- 
tical method in investigation. 
How much should be elective in the college course and what should 
be required of all? Those studies which have a direct bearing on the 
 
-P-A-G-E-684
  636 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
discipline and insight of the scholar should not be placed on the list 
of electives. At least, if it is necessary to establish the institution on 
a basis that permits one to choose any or all of the branches, it is 
very important to include all the branches essential to discipline and 
insight in the list required for a degree. I am in favor of excluding 
elective studies from the high school altogether. The “classical 
course,” so called, is adopted in order to meet the requirements of the 
college in preparatory work. A ‘general course” is made out side by 
side with the “classical” course, and neither course is in harmony with 
the public school system nor with sound psychological principles. 
Those who are to “finish their education” with the high school course 
are the very ones who need a share of classical study. Classical study 
is not merely a preparation for higher study, as Latin might have been 
when it was studied in order to learn how to read the “language of the 
learned,” who wrote all their-books in it. If a pupil were to remain 
only one year in the high school he ought, by all means, to study Latin 
during that time; it will come the nearest of all his studies to endow- 
ing him with a new faculty—with a new power of insight. 
In the district school course each of the branches named is essential 
to the culture of the child, and it does not matter whether his course 
is to be one year or three years or ten years or twenty years. If he 
attends one year he learns to read and write and count—nothing else 
so important as these arts to him, for they open the doors of the spir- 
itual universe to him and the keys can never be taken away from him. 
In three years he perfects himself in reading, writing, the elements of 
arithmetic, and learns the outlines of geography. What other branch 
can be compared with one of these at this period? Botany? Drawing? 
What is botany to the boy who can not read or write or count, or who 
knows not his relation to the earth on which he lives? What is the 
art of drawing compared with the art of writing? The degree of uni- 
versality is the test to apply in settling such questions. But botany 
and drawing need not be wholly banished from even the primary school. 
The branches being divided into disciplinary, insight giving, informa- 
tion giving, and technical-skill giving, the two former are to be regarded 
as essentials, and perhaps four-fifths of the time in school devoted to 
them; the latter deserve their place, and if one-fifth of the time be 
given them they reenforce the other branches. In St. Louis natural 
science is taught in oral lessons one hour a week—the lesson being 
given on Wednesday afternoon. The pupils are not required to pre- 
pare their lessons; they are only to listen attentively and participate 
actively when called upon by the teacher for their experience. They 
are to be interested, and no constraint is to be exercised except to 
secure respectful attention. I have found that the information obtained 
in these lessons makes its appearance especially in the geography les- 
sons. The one lesson of the week that is devoid of constraint and con- 
tains a range of topics and explanations suited to gratify childish curi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-685
  
EDUCATIONAL VALUES. 637 
osity I believe to be very valuable—at least far more valuable than the 
same time devoted to arithmetic or reading. I can not say that two 
hours per week used in this way would be as valuable as one hour, 
while its inroads on the other studies would be felt to their injury. 
Confined to one lesson, it aids the others by reaction, while the infor- 
mation gradually amassed is of immediate value and of still greater 
indirect value in preparing the mind for the exhaustive comprehension 
of nature in the high school or college. It is the active feeling and 
phantasy of the child that does most; his senses and reflection are 
roused by those unconscious movements of his soul. Hence, what he 
can tell directly about the subjects of his lessons may not be very much 
or very coherent, yet his spirit of investigation and the conviction 
that all natural phenomena can be explained is of great consequence 
to his after life. Drawing, again, is the only study tending directly to 
cultivate the hand and eye—a sort of universal skill-developing study. 
A short time each day can be spent on drawing better than not, for it 
is a rest from the discipline studies. 
In the high school and in the college the course of study should still 
be carried on in certain studies with a view to discipline the mind 
severely, and in others to give the first initiatory course, laying the 
foundation for what must grow several years before the teacher can 
venture to unfold the highest significance of it. It must be allowed to 
“soak” for its time. The philosophy of history, art, and literature 
can not be taught at once. Perhaps the first coursé is fortunate if 
it leaves a conscious conviction in the mind of the pupil thatit is pos- 
sible to have a philosophy of such things, the pupil not being able 
to give any rational account as yet of any piece of such philosophy. 
The descriptive phases of the sciences can be learned early. We have 
three cyclical movements in our natural-science course, each traversing 
the same round and covering the whole field, gradually increasing in 
minuteness and scientific precision. The course in the high school 
ought to prove more interesting and fruitful for the previous prepara- 
tion, and it probably will when the present pupils in our lower grades 
reach that school. 
Is not the highest problem of education how to liberate the genius 
of the pupil? If genius can not be created or developed it certainly 
needs liberation. It seems to me that a course of study which plants 
first in the feeling and phantasy and then gradually brings out through 
the reflection and reason the ideas of its contents will come nearest to 
the liberation of genius.

CHAPTER XVI. 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS DURING THE COLONIAL AND REYVO- 
LUTIONARY PERIOD IN THE UNITED STATES. 
By Rev. A. D. Mayo, LL. D. 
INTRODUCTION. 
Tne AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOL. 
The author of this essay does not propose to write a detailed history of the Ameri- ~ 
can common school. This important work has been done, with various degrees of 
success, in a few valuable essays, including the complete and increasing number of 
volumes setting forth the local history of popular education in the several States 
of the Union. But the great storehouse of material for the final history of the 
American common school is still found in the 31 volumes of the American Journal of 
Education, edited by the first United States Commissioner of Education, Hon. 
Henry Barnard, LL.D., from 1855 to 1881; but now first really made accessible to 
the unprofessional reader through a complete analytical index, prepared under the 
direction of Hon. William T. Harris, the fourth United States Commissioner of 
Education. Here, as nowhere else, will be found the most elaborate and reliable 
record of the entire progress of universal education in the United States. Here 
also, prepared by the most competent authorities, are the earliest intelligible accounts 
given to our people of the educational systems of Europe. No other man of the 
illustrious company of American educators has prepared an educational chronicle of 
equal importance. Dr. Barnard was himself a conspicuous worker in the revolution 
of sixty years ago which inaugurated, in our country, the ideas and methods of what 
in popular phrase is known as “the new education.” This venerable man has been 
spared to receive the tribute of the most celebrated educational authorities of all 
civilized countries to the supreme importance of his remarkable compilation and to 
rejoice in the final triumph of the American common school by its establishment in 
every State and Territory of the Republic. Once for all, the author of this treatise 
disclaims any pretension to originality in the investigation or arrangement of the 
innumerable details of this department of the national history. Without special 
reference or acknowledgment, he has drawn from the overabundance of material 
what suits his special purpose in telling the story of the American common school. 
It will be our aim in the present essay, while briefly rehearsing this “great and 
wondrous story,” to set before the 10,000,000 American youth of sufficient age to 
comprehend it, before the teachers of this ‘‘ grand army” of the national reserve, 
and before the school authorities of every degree, and the educational public in 
general, some considerations of absolute importance to the welfare of the Republic. 
(1) We desire to impress upon this portion of our people the fact that the American 
common school, in its present state of development, is the most original and vital 
product of the national life. 
639 
   
-P-A-G-E-688
        
640 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
(2) We would show its fundamental relations to our democratic-republican Gov- 
ernment and order of society; its profound influence thereon from the beginning of 
the colonial life; its formative power in the development of the early history of the 
new Republic; our dependence upon it, through every period, in the slow evolution 
of the country into its present estate for a corresponding enlargement and enlight- 
enment of the most characteristic American society, and the absolute necessity that 
in all its essential ideas and methods of administration, it should be preserved, in 
the full measure of its present expansion, as the essential, conservative, and vitalizing 
agency in our American order of public and private affairs. 
(3) We shall discuss incidentally the extent-to which the methods of the organ- 
ization and administration of popular education in foreign lands can be profitably 
copied in the reformation and perfecting of our own American common-school sys- 
tem. We shall also direct attention to the danger of an unreasonable and provincial 
resistance to the incoming of all improvements in the line of a genuine American 
development, and especially warn against that narrow spirit of localism and mate- 
rialism which leaves a community at the mercy of specious and pretentious theories 
concerning the training of children and youth, essentially hostile to our American 
system of education and the fundamental ideas of the national life. 
The American common school, in its present state of enlargement, extending from 
the kindergarten to the State university and the elaborate arrangement for indus- 
trial training, like everything in American affairs, has been the gradual creation of 
the American people from the earliest period of colonization. The educational ideas 
and organizations of our people have always and everywhere been among the most 
influential factors in the national development, from the early provincial notions of 
colonial society to the enlarged national ideals of the present hour. No vital portion 
of our republican order of society is of crude, hasty, or careless adoption. 
The American common school has always been the most vital and influential ele- 
ment in the life of that portion of the country which first adopted it, and to-day is 
the most powerful agency in the civic, religious, social, industrial, literary, and home 
affairs of the entire Union. Each body of energetic and progressive European colo- 
nists who drifted to our New World brought the educational theories and methods 
of his own country more deeply embedded in its habits of life than any other remi- 
niscence of its old home. The habit of training children and youth in the home, the 
church, and the school underlies even the powerful impulse for personal and political 
freedom. Indeed, this enthusiasm for liberty, when wrought out in practical activ- 
ity, often turns out to be largely an obstinate assertion of absolute personal inde- 
pendence, with a sleepless jealousy of interference from any outward authority. 
But, underneath the most violent protest against even the essential restraints of 
republican Government lie embedded in the consciousness and habits, both of the 
superior and common order of these people, the old familiar system of youthful train- 
ing through the type of schooling to which they have been accustomed at home. 
The Dutch in New Amsterdam, the Puritansin New England, the French and Spanish 
populations of Louisiana, the Quakers, Germans, Scotch, and Irish of Pennsylvania, 
the Catholics and Hebrews of every State, struck out at first on the lines of the 
educational training to which they had been accustomed in the Old World. And, ata 
later period, the most persistent and formidable resistance to the present American 
common-school system has come from the European notions and habits of large bodies 
of recent immigrants of several nationalities. From the beginning the American sys- 
tem of popular education has been in a state of perpetual conflict with the convic- 
tions and habits of each of these numerous classes of people. Until the last fifty 
years the clergy of the different religious bodies were the actual leaders of every 
department of education. According to the convictions of the influential majority 
of the ecclesiastical class, education has been in the past the mental and religious 
training of children and youth into a zealous and faithful discipleship of one religious 
denomination. For this reason the absolute separation of church and state, though 
declared in the Constitution of the nation and of all the States, and everywhere 
 
-P-A-G-E-689
  PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE COLONIAL PERIOD. 641 
enacted into the legal code, has been delayed for a long period and resisted here as 
elsewhere. 
So when the American common-school system of to-day is assailed as ‘“‘ anew depar- 
ture,” even a ‘ perversion ” of the original intent of its friends in colonial days, or 
a radical innovation upon the country district school of half a century ago, it may 
be replied that, like the growth of American Government and society, it has been a 
gradual evolution from the most profound convictions and practical experience of 
the American people. To no exclusive class or colony can we look for the complete 
ideal or the thorough working out of even the essential principles of the common 
school. 
Education, in our American sense, is the training of a whole people for a worthy 
and effective manhood and womanhood as the soul of good citizenship. By its very 
nature it must be the most influential motive power of our civilization. Like all 
formative agencies, it must be of slow growth and often of imperfect and capri- 
cious manifestation. Religious creeds and polities may be modified, forms of goy- 
ernment changed, fashions of society—even the habits of home life—upset, the indus- 
trial methods of Christendom revolutionized, new types of literary and artistic 
culture created, before this profound, slow-moving, conservative central power, the 
education of the coming generations, is essentially transformed. Every attempt 
to lift a people above the average training of the younger third of its population by 
the inspiration of a revolutionary upheaval or the semiinsanity of a popular social, 
industrial, or political revolt, will inevitably find its level on the common ground of 
the organized educational life. 
Nowhere has the American people so plainly and persistently announced its ideal 
of republican society as in the people’s common school. 
For centuries before the colonization of Virginia, New York, and Massachusetts 
many of the elements of the present American system of popular education had been 
incorporated in the European school life of the period. Free schools had been sup- 
ported by private beneficence, churches, corporate cities, industrial guilds, and 
religious orders in almost every nation in Europe. Some of the most valuable ideas 
and methods of mental and moral instruction and discipline were elaborated by the 
Jesuits, who for two centuries were the virtual educators of all classes on two con- 
tinents. Like all valuable new departures in human affairs, the American common 
school at first included much of the spirit and largely adopted the prevailing methods 
of organization, administration, and instruction bequeathed to it from abroad. 
But the one essential element that appeared at first in the New England colonies 
and has steadily grown in every American State and community to be its dominant 
characteristic is the idea that the whole American people claim the absolute right 
to use the accumulated public wealth to educate the entire body of children and 
youth into that type of mental, moral, and practical manhood and womanhood that 
culminates in good American citizenship. 
To-day the plain American citizen in one respect is the most powerful sovereign 
on earth, for by casting his ballot he may elect a President of the United States, 
who for four years is, in more than one respect, the most powerful ruler among the 
nations, and nowhere is the opportunity and right of woman to make the man, who 
outwardly makes the Government, so acknowledged and exercised as in this Repub- 
lic. The training of this American type of “sovereign citizen,” the man who at 
once governs and obeys, is in no essential respects a subordinate matter. Not only 
the best discipline of the mind, but the schooling of the character and the union of 
both in the discipline of the executive faculties, is essential to the every-day life of 
the good citizen. Nothing less than this has been the ideal of the true educational 
class of the American people from the earliest day. 
This lofty ideal—the training of a whole people, by the whole people, for the highest 
earthly position demanding the most complete manhood and womanhood—must be 
assumed in all just criticism of the past and present educational life of our country.

Hero comes in the golden rule, announced in Italy, two generations ago to Wash- 
ington Allston by Samuel Taylor Coleridge: ‘(No man is competent to criticise the 
defects of a book or a. work of art who does not comprehend its merits.” 
The country is now excited and the popular press almost monopolized by tho 
wholesale criticism of experts in education, who seem never to have grasped this 
fundamental idea of the American common school or observed the steadfast, unre- 
lenting way in which the American people, in every State, have wrought toward it 
and stood by it when obtained as tho citadel of the nation’s life. 
So, when we are reminded that the voice of the people in education, as elsewhere, 
may not be the voice of God, the American people reply: We rely on every good 
agency of human society, working in tho atmosphere of freedom, to generate and 
preserve that popular wisdom, virtue, and common sense which is the soul of all pro- 
gressive civilization. Nowhere on earth and at no period of human history havo 
the home, the church, social, industrial, and public life, and private schools of every 
grade, been so free to put forth their uttermost energy; nowhere is a wise, righteous, 
and efficient man or woman at the present hour so powerful for good as in this 
Republic. But at every crisis not only the most valuable but the only possible 
agency for training a new generation for sovereign citizenship in a Republic like 
ours is a common school, organized, governed, administered through representa- 
tives legally chosen by a flexible majority, which is for the time the agent of the 
popular. will and is supported by the whole people. Though for the time this 
system of education shares the defects and can not rise above the high average of its 
ereator and administrator, still it is the best and most helpful arrangement under the 
circumstances. For this is the theory on which the whole structure of American 
society stands, and its displacement as the chief corner stone of the common school- 
house would undermine the foundations of the Republic. 
Nothing is easier than for an expert, influenced by the superficial order and smooth 
working of a system of national education, devised and administered by a despotic 
beurocracy, to declare the American common school in its present condition unscien- 
tific, illogical, a realm of incapacity and disorder, and bring forth a recipe for its 
reconstruction. But this ‘short method” of dealing with the imperfections of a 
people toiling in the midst of the grand experiment of training a generation for 
sovereign citizenship fails completely of its purpose, inasmuch as it does not com- 
prehend the characteristic method of our American republican civilization. 
What to this expert appears the caprice of chance or the sign of decay is like the 
disorder of a great metropolitan city square in which a noble public building is 
being erected with its swarming multitude of workmen, its piles of débris, its litter 
of precious and common materials, its awkward, half-finished portions, giving no fit 
suggestion of the entire plan. These defects and erudities in the people’s common 
school are more evident to its intelligent and responsible friends, who have “ borne 
the burden and heat” of long years of public administration, than to the expert. 
But the best instructed of these practical schoolmen understand what the critic can 
not—the immense difficulty of doing anything well by the slow and tortuous method 
of educating public opinion and directing public administration. 
They have learned to bear and forbear with much that at present is unsatisfactory 
and apparently pernicious; to be content to take in hand what comes first; not to 
expect that a work so great can be carried on with all of its departments abreast; to 
await the right time to achieve the least good result; to watch the happy moments 
and loftiest inspiration of the people for the accomplishment of the noblest ends, 
and often to be gratified with some genuine advance, though minute in comparison 
with the completed design. 
It is one thing to elaborate a scheme of national education in a bureau of “great 
educators,” itself the creature of a sovereign who at best represents a fixed order of 
society, which can only by slow advances avoid the chronic peril of revolution, and 
quite another for the foremost educational public of an American State to educate 
the political “dissolving view” we call a legislature into a reasonable and conscien- 
   
-P-A-G-E-691

tious apprehension of educational affairs. Much more difficult is it to save a good 
educational bill on its passage through such a body from the mischievous amend- 
ments and annexes of its ignorant, pretentious, or narrow-minded friends or from 
the insidious and untiring scheming of the foes of popular education. But all 
American experience demonstrates that this education of legislature, Congress, and 
court is one of the most hopeful factors in the nation’s life. Year by year we behold, 
even in our great corrupt metropolitan cities, in States that for a century held the 
American common school at arm’s length, in the least ambitious and most provin- 
cial rural districts, astonishing revivals of sound and progressive ideas, We see the 
flaring up of an irrepressible ambition to imitate the achievements of a moro 
advanced community. We see the common people, even the freedmen first intro- 
duced to responsible citizenship, revolting against the cherished theories of the cul- 
tured class and exploding, in the wrath of one election day, the shrewdest plots of 
political, ecclesiastical, and social “rings” for the capture of the people’s great 
heritage, the common school. 
That man, or body of men, however exalted or established in their own convic- 
tions, who have only contempt and hatred for the American common school, even at 
its feeblest beginnings, or fancy that the mighty current of popular education can 
be fenced within the levees or diverted into the reservoirs of any system less com- 
prehensive than the present, reckon without their host. Here, as everywhere in 
American affairs, the final verdict of 70,000,000 of people is better than the most 
scientific scheme of any clique in church, university, or partisan civic policy, And 
the one thing the people of the United States will not do, until a permanent majority 
concludes to adopi a different form of government, will be to intrust to any class, 
however well informed or apparently impartial, that absolute authority over popular 
educational affairs so attractive to a growing class of scholarly men in our own and 
every land. 
To these and similar misapprehensions, both of the original intent and character- 
istic methods of administration that have already become a national conviction and 
habit in the conduct of the American common schocl, are we indebted for the per- 
sistent attempts to change essentially its type of character; sometimes by the earnest 
representatives of large and influential bodies of people. The demand that the 
American common-school system shall be changed to a federation of private, religious, 
and corporate institutions, loosely held together by an annual Government inspec- 
tion and subsidy; or that, by some indirect arrangement, the old-time European 
parochial school shall become an annex to our national system of unsectarian moral 
instruction and discipline; the peremptory demand of certain university critics that 
the secondary, even the clementary, department of the common school shall be 
radically modified in order to weed out the superior few and speed their course to 
the doors of a college in no way responsible to the State and only indirectly influ- 
enced by the advance of educational thought and practice; the outery from a con- 
siderable body of the patrons and teachers of private and denominational seminaries 
against the public support of the free high and normal schools and the State univer- 
sity; the almost brutal assault in great industrial centers upon every department of 
the common school that can not at once be brought inside the narrow circle of a 
materialistic so-called ‘‘practical” notion of the training of the average American 
child; the imperious demand that the administration of the common-school system, 
in all save its mere financial and economic details, shall be removed beyond the 
reach of the people whose children are its subjects and remanded to a body of 
scholars whose only known qualification is a loud and often insolent assertion of 
their own supreme capacity—these and other similar projects for the reformation 
and reconstruction of the system of universal education, slowly built up by the 
combined effort of the most eminent educators and foremost people of every order and 
condition, by the thought, observation, and experience of almost three centuries of 
American life, may sometimes be productive of good through the wakening and 
concentration of public attention on some acknowledged or insidious defect in the

644 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
working of our educational system. But no one of these theories can have a vital 
force in our educational training for good American citizenship until the present 
ideal of government and all things involved in the republican order of affairs is 
entirely changed in the deliberate convictions of a working majority of the people 
of the United States. 
It is only a narrow literalism or an obstinate and almost invincible provincialism 
that insists on holding the American common school to the type of the fathers, or 
even to what seemed a finality to the educators of a generation ago. Whatever may 
be the truth in the political theory of ‘‘ strict construction” in the written constitu- 
tions of States or of the nation, none but a confirmed educational pedant can deny 
the right and obligation of the American people to adjust the agencies and institu- 
tions that depend on their own voluntary activity to the expanding movements of 
national growth and the progress of civilization. 
For, despite the assertion of all sorts of educational pundits who, in learned style, 
demonstrate that this or that right to educate the child is reserved to family and 
church and is altogether fenced off from public interference by the very constitution 
of human nature; yet now, as always since the dawn of civilization, every healthy, 
national life asserts the obligation to educate the growing generation for the func- 
tions of citizenship, and surely in our Republic, where there is no government save 
the annual expression of the will of the whole people, through methods created by 
and changeable by the people; where a system of public education by the state is 
only the people combining for the most practical method of doing an essentially 
good thing, it is evidently in the power of the state to expand the system of train- 
ing for citizenship according to the growing demand of the common weal. 
When we are referred to the old-time country district school of the early New Eng- 
land colonies, or the later seminary of the secondary or higher education as the just 
limit of state interference with the private or natural right of the parent to educate, 
we may well remember the changes that, like successive tidal waves of a revolution, 
have submerged the manners, customs, and entire habits of living of the least pro- 
gressive of our American commonwealths within a short generation. 
Perhaps the most notable of these changes is the declining power and influence of 
great men, even in political—much more in the religious—social, and industrial life of 
our American society. Two hundred years ago the virtual government of every 
American colony was, at best, in the hands of a small fraction of its people, and 
even they were dominated with almost imperial mastery by a very few eminent 
men. But the day has already passed when any man in public affairs can become 
the master of his country or swing a people as Bismarck and Gladstone in our time 
have turned about great masses of theircountrymen. More and more is the nation and 
every State and community now ruled by the prodigious force of great combinations 
of people, representing an overwhelming public or private interest; their leaders are 
only the spokesmen of what appears to be the wise and right thing to the more 
intelligent mass below. 
In such a condition of affairs, which is bound to become a confirmed national 
habit, it is little short of pedantic folly to insist on confining public education within 
the narrow lines of the common school, private academy, and denominational college 
of half a century ago. Worthy of all praise in their own day and generation for the 
great and good results they wrought in the development of the national life, they 
are now as incompetent to meet the people’s greater need as the ox or mule team, 
the stagecoach, the one-horse plow, the log cabin, and the entire machinery and 
environment of the old American life would be to deal with the commercial, manu- 
facturing, governmental, industrial, and domestic necessities of to-day. A century 
ago, even in America, it might be all that was possible to train up a small class of 
energetic and able men who, by sheer weight of character and public service, could 
force upon a distracted and half-indifferent people a constitution and form of goy- 
ernment’ that remains still the admiration of the world. But to preserve that 
Government, to rise to and abide on that mount of vision occupied by the fathers;
-P-A-G-E-693
  “PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE COLONIAL PERIOD. 645 
requires now far more than the uttermost wisdom and patriotism of any body of 
statesmen. If our country is to remain the sort of Republic to which our foremost 
peoplo aspire, it will be only when a permanent majority of the people becomes so 
much better, wiser, and more thoroughly trained in executive faculty than now that 
no statesman or party will fancy itself powerful enough to override the “sober 
second thought” of the constituency that has become the controlling force in public 
affairs. And if there is any other agency save a vast and beneficent system of popu- 
Jar education that will furnish that constituency, all the teaching of history is 
vain. If there is one truth established by the experience of mankind, in every age, 
under every form of government, it is that no set of men is able, sacred, or impartial 
enough to be long intrusted with the exclusive direction of a people’s life. What- 
ever may be the inherent defects of popular government, it is the best school yet 
devised by man, under fit conditions and limitations, for securing that enjoyment of 
“life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,” declared in our Declaration of Inde- 
pendence among the ‘natural and inalienable” human rights. And only by the 
successive broadening out of a national scheme that lifts the school above the domi- 
nation of classes, castes, sects, and parties, into range with the best thought, life, and 
practical experience of a whole people, can these conditions and limitations of abso- 
lute personal independence be gradually established, without which even an Amer- 
ican republic falls into the abyss of anarchy. 
So it is not through heresy against any hard and fast divine scheme of training 
the child and informing the youth that the people’s common school of this Republic 
has grown from its old-time modest pretension to a dominating influence in the 
national life. It has only responded to the rapidly growing demands of the Ameri- 
can people for a system of common culture and discipline that shall occupy the 
great common territory outside and exclusive of all private, political, social, indus- 
trial, and sectional preserves and bring the children, though for only a few short 
years, together in an arrangement which, at its best, is the only possible rehearsal 
of the common relations and activities of citizenship in the new American life. 
From these considerations we are prepared to estimate the value of the frequent 
declarations along more than one line of criticism that the American common 
school up to the present time has been, if not an absolute failure, a grievous and 
unnecessary disappointment to the people. The weight of this positive assertion 
depends, of course, on the ideal of the critic and the point of view from which the 
methods of our school organization, administration, instruction, and discipline are 
surveyed. It requires no extended observation to perceive that these critics judge 
the American common school from other ideals than that of the people who have 
established and still, in good faith, support it. 
If the object of a system of popular education in this Republic be the production 
of a generation of zealous and active churchmen of the different religious sects; or of 
a body of youthful scholars, according to the severe tests of modern scholarships; 
or the sending forth of a multitude of boys and girls, from the age of 12 to 15, com- 
petent to practice a trade or push out at once on a career of successful self-support, 
or to produce a graduate to respond to anyone of a score of standards set up by the 
numerous critics of our present educational affairs, the cause of the common school 
would certainly go by default. The American people have never proposed either of 
these results as the ideal of its policy of universal education, although in no respect 
is the American common school indifferent or hostile to any of these precious inter- 
esis. And if the critic assumes the possibility of any such all-embracing and all- 
compelling supervision of school administration by public officials, or despotic 
control of teachers by superintendents, as he finds in Continental Europe, he will 
not only be disappointed and disgusted, but may learn that he has quite mistaken 
the method by which any important public interest can be safely furthered in our 
country. 
But if he will take the pains to study the genius, history, and achievements of the 
American people and its method of doing all good things during the past hundred  
-P-A-G-E-694
  646 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
years, he can not resist the conclusion that least of all has the educational depart- 
ment of the national life been a failure or in any special way a disappointment. 
The ideal of the true educational public, which from the first has been responsible 
for tho development of our common school, has been mental instruction and disci- 
pline, blended with moral and practical training. This, under the conditions of a 
republican order of society, will contribute to the peculiar style of manhood and 
womanhood essential to good American citizenship. It has not been regarded a 
wise educational or political policy to enslave the parent, to enforce the schooling 
of the child, or to do, by public edict, either of several things regarded as indispen- 
sable to the training of the subject of a European continental empire. The ideal has 
been to create and support a generous system of common schools, free to all, with 
somewhat better facilities every year, so attractive that every parent might be per- 
suaded to use it for his children; to protect childhood at every point, and especially 
to secure to it the precious opportunity of elementary education, and keep it out of 
the clutches of the ignorant and vicious parent and brutal employer; to make that 
school a rehearsal of civic life, a place where vulgarity and vice shall be suppressed, 
and all “sorts and conditions” of youth taught to live under the benign protection 
of wise and just law; to awaken the mental faculties, impart essential information, 
discipline the powers of acquisition, and fling open the highways of learning, with 
reasonable incentive to superior ability and to the honorable ambition of all; to 
make every common schoolhouse a practical training school of virtuous manhood 
and womanhood, according to the loftiest standards of morality, by its very environ- 
ment and atmosphere, the arrangement of courses of study, the hourly habits of the 
child and its established discipline; above all, by the influence of the character, 
“walk and conversation” of the teacher, to make him an object lesson of worthy 
manhood; by placing the children during their most impressible age under the 
direct charge of women, that the coming generation may share the most refining 
influences, thus prolonging the ministry of good motherhood to the verge of respon- 
sible youth; to develop the executive and personal faculty by including the indus- 
trial side of the new education, without exposing the child to the labor of learning 
a trade in infancy; in short, to enable the pupil to hecome intelligent without the 
pretense of expert scholarship; industrious and effective without becoming a pro- 
fessional workman; moral and religious without imposing the trammels of sectari- 
anism; well informed in the history of his country and intensely patriotic without 
landing him in the slough of partisan polities—such a man or woman as the country 
needs more than all things else. This is the ideal that from the first, like the Star in 
the East, has gone before the people in their journey toward the Promised Land. 
This is the people’s ideal, in more than one respect original and comprehensive 
beyond that of any nation in the past or present. But in working toward this 
exalted purpose the American people have not deluded themselves with the fancy 
that all this is of immediate or other than gradual achievement. They remember 
that two long centuries of colonial life barely sufficed to hold the 3,000,000 of our 
early population together through the strain of an eight-years’ war of independence 
and the more perilous era of the formation of general government; that even the 
original Constitution of the United States was the result of a compromise that left 
the two great rival ideas concerning the national integrity so obscured that, after 
seventy years of fierce agitation, the whole people flew to arms to solve the problem 
by “the dread arbitrament of war;” and that reconstruction, under an amended 
Constitution, after the destruction of society in sixteen Commonwealths, left on hand 
more than one open question more perilous than the controversies that have wrecked 
successive empires in the Old World. They realize how slow and tortuous and 
often disheartening has been the progress of the people out from the social semibar- 
barism, tho terrible religious bigotry, the obstinate provincialism, and the rock- 
ribbed inclosures of nationality, class, and culture, from which the different bodies 
of immigrants have ascended to the broad uplands of the new national life. 
 
-P-A-G-E-695
PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE COLONIAL PERIOD. 647 
They have not looked for miracles in educational progress and achievement in the 
working of their favorite institution, the common school. All that could reasonably 
be expected the same gradual progress and increasing efficiency as in every other 
department of the national life. As the years have gone by, the people of every 
State, in succession, have shouldered new burdens at the call of their trusted educa- 
tors, justified by their own observation of the importance of the emergency and the 
outcome of educational results. 
And in view of this ideal and this method of development, seen to be the only 
le way to the accomplishment of a work so vast as training the coming gener- 
ation of American youth for American citizenship, who is prepared to say that the 
common school in all its grades has not scored a success corresponding to any depart- 
ment of the national life? What is better to-day and what has come up to its 
present estate with as few mishaps by the way as the common school? Have the 
politicians and statesmen, who sometimes affect to ignore and are always ready to 
offer positive opinions on the education of the people, done better with their record of 
contention? Havethe theologians and ecclesiastics who, with an opportunity of bound- 
Jess freedom and activity, are still at sea on effectual means of bringing the masses in 
range of the gospel, and are still arrayed in hostile, rival sects? Have the leaders 
of the labor movement, who seem to have found no method of bettering their con- 
stituency than a chronic state of warfare between labor and capital? Is it the mag- 
nates of the exchange, who confess that, under the present system, 80 per cent of the 
young men who enter business fail? Is it the leaders of society who, in the commer- 
cial metropolis of the Union, are posing in the absurd attempt to establish an upper 
caste of “400” on the basis of birth and wealth? Or have the science, literature, 
art, or even the higher education in our country, so far excelled the common school 
in satisfying the reasonable expectations of the people that their representatives 
can afford to ignore or denounce the people’s seminary as an evident failure? And, 
pray, what record of great and good things done for the 20,000,000 of young America 
has the expert to show as his warrant to sentence all save a portion of the 350,000 
common school teachers to a limbo of “unscientific” uselessness? Every profes- 
sional, industrial, social, and political group of leaders in the country is to-day under 
a fire of criticism as contemptuous, remorseless, and positive as the educational 
public that is responsible for the common school. ‘There is none of them that 
doeth good; no, not one,” is the verdict when tried by the Olympic type of judgment 
now affected by an infallible class in its estimation of the national schoolhouse. 
Yet, despite these manifold failures in the conduct of every great interest of the 
national life, the nation survives; the world moves; ‘‘old things pass away and all 
things become new;” and, by a method that no man fully understands, though every 
man must recognize, every department of American life is to-day on a broader, 
firmer, more intelligent, and humane basis than a generation ago. 
What does all this signify, if not that, on the whole, the majority of honest and 
active workers in the foremost ranks of every great institution and agency of Ameri- 
can civilization are learning, year by year, better ways of navigating the unknown 
sea of our new republican life? Nothing is at once so cheap, so tempting to half- 
knowledge and the conceit of all-round wisdom, inspired by special training in ono 
corner of expert research, as the reckless habit of judging the movements of a whole 
people by the maneuverings, failures, and absurdities even of their chosen repre- 
sentative men. Yetitis by this type of criticism that the people’s school is now 
assailed, often from quarters so influential and with such assumption of infallibility 
as sometimes to shake the faith of ‘the very elect.” 
But, after all just acknowledgment of the evident defects and iciuouepleeenees of 
the American system of universal education, he must indeed be a careless observer or 
quite gone in prejudice who can not look atti thankfulness and a mighty hope on 
what is going on in the national schoolhouse, day by day, in the sight of all men. 
Is there really anything better done in the United States of America than this com- 
monplace work of the teachers among the little children; correcting vulgar and 
      
     
-P-A-G-E-696
  648 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
vicious habits; waking up drowsy or vagrant minds; reforming evil character; 
inspiring new hope in thousands hopeless before; sending forth increasing multi- 
tudes with a little higher aspiration for nobler living, more exalted position, or with 
amore reliable determination to be somebody and do something in the new Ameri- 
can life? 
It is easy enough for the walking expert to circulate through a hundred city school- 
rooms, dispose of their methods of instruction and discipline as antiquated or 
unscientific, remand their pupils to the limbo of the unwashed and condemn the 
entire system as a stupid pretense of education, sending forth a generation of chil- 
dren incompetent to help themselves. But why, then, do we find these same incompe- 
tent school boys and girls twenty years later swarming in all the avenues of 
American enterprise in the fore-front of every great and good cause, successful in 
business, enlarging and deepening the current of every art, occupation, and pro- 
fession, devising and doing better things than any previous generation under thirty 
years of age this world has yet seen? Under all our pessimistic estimates that the 
country is on the edge of doom, as certain of the doleful doctors affirm, there must 
be some ever-present and effective cause for the prodigious growth in all directions, 
material and spiritual, that has lifted this Republic within the past thirty years in 
line with the greatest nationalities of the earth. That most powerful and perma- 
nent cause is the steady influence of the people’s common school system in all its 
grades; not only through its own increasing efficiency, but through the correspond- 
ing growth of every department of educational life. The secondary, higher indus- 
trialand professional school ; the new journalism; the Chautauqua assembly, summer 
institute and university extension; the improved public speaking; the whole side 
of life included in the vast arrangements for universal education—all these agencies 
and institutions have been greatly dependent upon the American common school 
through its revival of the new elementary education during the past half century. 
So, judging the future by the past, is it not safe to predict that through the years 
to come our beloved country must depend upon the same mighty formative agency, as 
powerful as the common air and sunlight and early and later rain, for the preserva- 
tion, elevation, and growing toward perfection of all that shall make this Republic 
“that happy nation whose God is the Lord?” 
In the first essay we propose to trace briefly the progress of the common school 
idea from its earliest appearance in New England; to trace the essays at popular 
education in all the colonies before the war of independence, and the first awakening 
of the whole people during the revolutionary period in the dedication of vast areas 
of public lands by Congress to the use of the children. The reader who compre- 
hends the*full significance of this period, which practically includes the first two 
centuries of American life, will not fail to discern in the educational ideas and 
achievements of the original thirteen colonies the prophecy and, in more than one 
essential feature, the realization of all that has been noted in the introduction of 
this essay as characteristic of the present American common school. 
THE BEGINNINGS OF THE AMERICAN COMMON SCHOOL IN THE THIRTEEN COLONIES 
BEFORE THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE, 1608-1776. 
NEW ENGLAND, 
The period of one hundred and sixty-eight years from the settlement of Virginia 
till the Declaration of Independence by the thirteen American colonies remains still, 
in some important respects, an unexplored historical realm. There is no special lack 
of material for the ordinary record of acts of Parliament and provincial legislatures, 
the doings of officials in church and state, thé dismal chronicle of wars with the 
pagan and Christian enemies of the new settlements; especially for the tedious 
emphasis in the narratives of personal eccentricities, social extravagancies, and 
religious fanaticisms. But the one thing the thoughtful student of American his-
-P-A-G-E-697
      
PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE COLONIAL PERIOD. 649 
tory longs to know is the trend of thought and sentiment among the influential peo- 
ple of all these colonies which, half conscious to themselves and often quite apart from 
public expression, was the irresistible undertow sweeping all things toward the open 
sea of political independence, union, and republican nationality. Here alone can be 
found a sufficient explanation of the marvelous outbreak which, in 1776, attracted 
the attention of Christendom; of the successful revolt from the most powerful empire 
on the globe and the later establishment of a form of government which the foremost 
living European statesman has styled “‘the most memorable achievement of polit- 
ical wisdom in history.” | 
Unfortunately, it is in this direction that the student of American history, from its 
beginnings in the early years of the seventeenth to the closing decade of the eight- 
eenth century, finds least satisfaction. It does not help the thoughtful inquirer to 
plod through the regulation History of the United States, wherein a group of extem- 
pore demigods strikes into existence the world’s great Republic. Just as little 
comfort is found in the wearisome wandering through the endless tangle of ante- 
revolutionary politics; wars, Indian or French, or the even more impassable wilder- 
ness of the early controversies of the contentious religious sects. We come nearer 
the core of the matter in a work like Prof. Moses Coit Tyler’s admirable history of 
American literature. Still further light glimmers through the crevices in a book 
like the recent treatise of Mr. William B. Weeden, The Early Industrial and Social 
Life of New England. The Johns Hopkins University also gives hopeful outlook in 
a series of suggestive monographs on different phases of the colonial life. But the 
historian of American thought before the revolutionary epoch has not yet appeared, 
and the ambitious attempt at forcing this intense period of mental activity in the 
New World into conformity with a preconceived scientific or philosophic theory of 
civilization gives little satisfaction. 
By the nature of the case, the materials for such an investigation must be meager, 
Of literature, in its general acceptation, there was next to none during the long 
reach of almost two centuries, when the colonial mind ‘“‘went sounding on its dim 
and perilous way,” pondering the mighty issues of the new life inits newhome. The 
physical conditions of existence were all unfavorable to that intimate communion 
between, or even the frequent meeting together, of thoughtful people, out of which 
a dominating public opinion can be generated. The different colonies were really 
separate little nationalities, governed, led in social fashions, directed in their indus- 
tries, and swayed or antagonized in their religious movements from across the sea, 
They were separated even more by the inevitable jealousies of their populations, 
representing in their widely different nationalities, creeds and classes, the rival, often 
hostile interests of their native countries. Democratic and concentrated New Eng- 
land, the cosmopolitan structure of society in the middle colonies, a British rural 
aristocracy intensified by the rising slave-power and provincial local pride along 
the Southern Atlantic Coast, made an almost hopeless condition for any save the 
most formal union forced upon all by the presence of a common danger. Besides, 
in communities so peculiar in their relations to a jealous and domineering home goy- 
ernment, there grew up a habit of suppression of the most vital thought and speech 
by their best informed people until the very eve of revolt in open war. 
Altogether, it remains one of the most difficult, as the most interesting, task yet 
open to the modern American historian to correctly map out the lines of thought, 
trace the half-formed plans, and indicate the prophetic expectations of these 3,000,000 
people, which, like the under-world beneath the pavement of a great city, is at 
once a mystery to all save the expert engineer, although the only explanation of 
what we see above, in the daylight of its crowded life. But through the drifting 
mist of this realm of half knowledge, more evident with every generation from the 
earliest years, appears the remarkable phenomenon of the consolidation of society 
in the New England colonies. While every community beyond the Hudson River 
was distracted by the contentions of the rival elements of its population; unable to 
combine for the accomplishment of anything of special moment; in this bleak, far-  
-P-A-G-E-698
650 ‘EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94, 
away corner of the half dozen little northeastern Puritan settlements, there was 
going on a steady process of combination for all social and civic results, by a people 
more pronounced in their individuality than any that came across the sea. If in 
human history another 20,000 people has ever been thus led apart by Providence and 
for two centuries kept out of elbow-touch with all antagonistic conditions, to accom- 
plish a greater task of hard thinking, meanwhile teiling at the novel experiment of 
welding a race of men, the most original, obstinate, and self-asserting in personal 
opinions, into a state where all great common interests should walk abreast and 
every man become a vital part of a compact whole, its record has been lost. 
Here lies the peculiar ‘‘ faculty” of that wonderful New England civilization, often 
so exaggerated and misrepresented, even by its own historians, as an ideal condition 
of society. No people in history present more sharp and irritating points of repul- 
sion to the critical observer, who fails to apprehend its ‘hiding place of power.” 
That central characteristic to which, under Ged, this Republie owes so much was a 
positive genius for republican citizenship; the ‘“‘saving common sense,” below all 
the extremes of personal conviction, which enabled these little neighborhoods of 
obstinate, contentious, personally despotic, exceptionally able and intelligent folk 
to come together as by instinct and close up into communities in which no man 
would be a subject and no man could be a lord, a priest, or a king, but each, in his 
fit place, must be a ‘member of society” so vital that his casting out would dissolve 
the entire copartnership. A New England town ef the old time was in no sense a 
confederation, but rather a blending of all into a new organism, wherein the indi- 
vidual gifts and powers of every citizen were wrought into the forces of a new 
society. 
It was this perfect union and vitalization of the whole body of citizens in a com- 
mon organism which gave to these towns and the Commonwealths into which they 
developed such a capacity for steady progress out of the narrowness, fanaticism, 
social despotism, aud obstructive individualism with which they were originally. 
burdened. Never before was the profound truth, announced in his inimitably 
characteristic way by Abraham Lincoln, ‘‘ You can cheat some of the people all the 
time, and all the people some of the time, but you can’t cheat all the people all the 
time,” so demonstrated in history as in this original condition of New England 
society through the one hundred and. fifty years before the war of independence. 
The nearest approach to the voice of Ged of which a fallible human organization is 
capable is along this open highway, surveyed by New England in these memorable 
years; the developing, expanding, perpetually ‘‘revised and corrected” verdict of a 
community of superior people, tried and tested in the solemn work of building a 
new civilization, burdened with the sense of a personal and social responsibility to 
Almighty God. : 
And the more we look for the innermost hiding place of this marvelous genius for 
republican civilization, we find it not in the policy of church or state, in the habits 
of society, or the methods of industry, though all these were the outcome of the 
radical conviction silently and persistently at work below. It was the conviction 
that every child born into this world is the child of God, capable of becoming a vital 
and useful member of society; and the corresponding obligation of the community 
to give to it the opportunity of that training at home, in the church, and in the 
school, which would send it forth at early manhood or womanhood a self-directing, 
competent person and a reputable citizen of a self-governed state. 
This conviction was the corner stone of every respectable New England home, and 
explains the domestic life of that people as nothing else can, And out of the New 
England home, not from the church or state, but out of the very heart of the father- 
hood and motherhood and childhood and youth of the home, was born the early New 
England school. It outwardly took on the form of the old English organization of 
education. It was largely under the infivence of the church. But beneath these it 
was the firstborn child out of the deepest heart of Puritan New England. It first 
appeared at home, where the instruction was given by the parents or relatives, often

specially competent to teach in letters as in morals and manners. Gradually, in the 
neighborhood, it grew into the primitive country district school. Step by step it 
expanded into the grammar school and college. Before the first generation had 
passed away the colony of Massachusetts Bay virtually had on the ground, for the 
first time in human history, a system of public education over which neither state nor 
church nor municipality nor corporation nor the despotic personal control of private 
beneficence had full domination; where every responsible citizen was a working 
partner in the community or state that had burdened itself with the heavy responsi- 
bility of educating every child for worthy manhood and womanhood and competent 
citizenship by the combined agencies of private and public wealth. Here was the 
beginning of the American common school, the most precious and permanent gift 
to the Republic from the genius of New England, the stone for two hundred and fifty 
years so persistently ‘‘rejected by the builders” of other commonwealths, but, in 
these later days, now recognized as ‘‘the head of the corner,” the corner stone of tho 
new Republic that “can not be broken,” but “upon whomsoever it shall fall it shall 
grind him to powder.” 
The failure to appreciate this peculiar union of all responsible people in a commu- 
nity to establish, govern, and stand behind private effort for the support of a school 
for all children, through the agency of an essentially democratic State, as the one 
distinctive feature of the American common-school system, accounts for the frequent 
suggestion that the early Dutch settlers of New York brought to the country the 
idea of this great national institution. Through the cloud of controversy that has 
recently gathered around the positive assertion of this proposition, like a summer 
morning fog on the Hudson River and bay of New York, a few incontrovertible facts 
appear, like the headlands of that superb region, overtopping the mist below. 
(1) We observe that the United Netherlands, in the seventeenth century, did 
probably enjoy the distinction of the best-schooled population in Europe. But there 
is no reliable evidence that the system by which this was accomplished had its origin 
in or was dependent upon the initiative of the masses of the people. The schools of 
Holland were of various kinds. Until the Protestant Reformation they were largely 
in the hands of the Catholic priesthood; although, perhaps, of a more energetic and 
popular sort than elsewhere. The Reformation precipitated the memorable conflict 
between the states of Holland and Belgium and the Spanish Empire, which resulted 
in the existence for a period of what is called the Dutch Republic. This was a con- 
federacy of the states of Holland, without a king, but still abiding in an intensely 
aristocratic form of society, in which the feudalism of the open country and the 
turbulent assertion of independence by the people of the cities made a political com- 
bination almost inconceivable in our own time. In these es, through the agency 
of the Reformed Church, grants from the civic authorities, private donations, and 
the action of industrial guilds, supplemented by taxation imposed by the municipal 
governments, there came up, on the whole, the best opportunity for general culture 
yet offered to any European people. But as we leave the ranks of the superior class 
and come down to the masses of the people, we find little evidence of the enlighten- 
ment on which the advocates of the Dutch origin of the common school insist. 
Indeed, there is no positive proof that any but the most meager opportunity for 
elementary schooling was offered to the ordinary boy or girl of the humbler sort. 
Certainly there was nothing like the school system of the New England colonies in 
vogue even in Holland, when, in 1614, the West India Company, for trading with the 
Indians, established its three stations at New York, Rondout, and Albany. 
(2) In this revival of learning there was no monopoly of interest in education by 
Holland, As early as 1567 the Scottish Presbyterian Church began its great work 
of educating the people, in which it persisted with such constancy that by 1696 
there was nothing to boast above it in Europe, and the Scotch people have never 
fallen below Holland in this essential respect. In Germany, Sweden, and Geneva, 
everywhere among the reformed communities of Continental Europe, the revival of 
   
-P-A-G-E-700
652 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
learning and the disposition to carry the torch of knowledge down among the 
masses of the people was apparent. In Great Britain it took on the characteristic 
British method of coming up from the people, rather than descending from the 
national or municipal government. England was becoming well supplied with 
private and corporate grammar schools at the time of the Puritan migration. The 
leading men of this migrating body, itself the flower of middle-class intelligence, 
enterprise, and progressive ideas in ecclesiastical and civil polity, were the graduates 
of these schools and in an unusual degree had been students of the universities. 
(3) Aside from the general influence of Holland upon the progressive class in 
England, which has probably been underrated, it is now asserted in the new litera- 
ture of the subject originating from New York that the origin of the common 
school of the United States was the work of the Dutch settlers of the island of 
Manhattan. But there isno evidence that the early schools of the Massachusetts 
colony were in any special way imitations from the Dutch. In their organization, 
courses of study, and methods of discipline they were copies of the English schools 
in which their authors had been educated at home. The claim that the settlers of 
Plymouth brought the school system of Holland from their twelve years’ residence 
at Leyden is disproved by every source of reliable historical information on the con- 
dition of these people. The little Puritan colony in Leyden was a forlorn band of 
foreigners, separated from the people around it by the barriers of language, a radi- 
eal difference of church polity, a sleepless jealousy concerning the perversion of 
their children by the contagion of continental manners, and the longing for the 
dear English life left behind that always broods over the emigrant from the ‘“sea- 
girt isle.” It was the feeling that the original members of this company were grow- 
ing old and unable longer to endure the strain of self-support; that their children 
were in danger of estrangement by what they regarded the loose examples around 
them; the irrepressible desire to establish a community of their own in ‘“God’s 
country” over the sea, that sent forth at first a detachment and afterwards the 
entire body of these people. 
The somewhat equivocal connection of the one scholar of the body, Robinson, 
with the university of Leyden, evidently favored by his espousal of the illiberal 
side in the theological controversy that agitated it, has been worked for a good 
deal more than its worth in this matter. Moreover, the years of this occupation 
were among the most distracted iu the history of the Netherlands. They were on 
the verge of a renewal of the awful struggle that tore away Belgium and, later, 
forced the Dutch Republic back into the fold of European monarchical states, 
where it still abides. And it is remarkable, if the Pilgrims brought the common 
school from Leyden to Plymouth in the hull of the Mayflower, that they let it ‘lie 
moldering in the grave” for fifty years, as the advocates of this theory assert, but 
actually fifteen years before a school was established in that colony. 
Nothing but a strange misapprehension of the one distinguishing characteristic of 
the American common school, its origin from the peeple and growth, through the 
agency of the State by the support and administration of its creators, could trans- 
form the early parochial schools in the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam to the 
beginnings of the American common-school system. The famousschool of the Dutch 
Reformed Church, established in 1633, was simply a parochial school whose teachers 
were appointed by the ecclesiastical officials; as certainly apart from popular origin, 
direction, and support as the Columbia University of the New York of the pres- 
ent day. Indeed, there had been in the Dutch settlements of the valley of the Hudson 
and Mohawk up to 1664, when the colony passed under the English control, no such 
thing as “popular sovereignty” until a few years previous, when, after a bitter con- 
test, an ineffective popular participation in the management of public affairs was 
wrested from the despotic commercial corporation, the West India Company. The 
entire valley of the Hudson was settled, at first, on a tenure which was a very near 
approach to the expiring feudalism of central Europe. The tenant of the land had
-P-A-G-E-701

no rights under a patroon, who was a virtual “lord of all power and might” in civil 
and ecclesiastical affairs. Even the right of appeal to the company at New York 
was commonly signed away on entering upon this relation. The education of the 
tenantry was absolutely dependent on the lord of the manor and the right was exer- 
cised according to his narrow or liberal views. And there is no proof that anything 
like the early schools of New England were found on these great estates. The little 
villages, even the principal towns, New York, Brooklyn, and Albany, where the best 
educational opportunities were enjoyed, had no such method of developing the edu- 
cational life of a whole people as we find in communities like Boston, Dorchester, 
Roxbury, and all the leading towns of New England. Whatever of public support 
was given to these schools by the government of the company was withdrawn by the 
English authorities, on the ground that they were really parochial schools of the 
Dutch Reformed Church and taught in the Dutch language. The crowning evidence 
of this view is the fact that, though until the close of the eighteenth century the 
population of this entire district was largely of the original Dutch occupancy, there 
seems to have been no protest and no general movement for anything like the present 
common-school facilities. In 1800 there were only parochial and private schools in 
the city of New York, and the Public School Society was formed by eminent citizens 
to bring in the increasing number of children that were left out of school by this 
ineffectual method of instructing the masses. The occupation of this splendid valley 
by the Dutch as a company trading with the Indians, the original medieval tenure of 
the land by the early settlers, the obstinate contentions that rent the colony by the 
growing efforts of the masses of the people for representation in the government, the 
cosmopolitan character of the population, from the first, all made the establishment 
of any system like the present American common school a virtual impossibility. 
So we are compelled to come back to the Massachusetts Colony on the Atlantic 
Coast for the beginning of the great American institution, the American common 
school, And for the full understanding of this fact we must take into consideration 
several indirect influences which, like the environment of climate, air, and the gen- 
eral habit of living, have a powerful influence upon the institutions of any people. 
(1) We notice the intelligence of the early settlers of Plymouth, Massachusetts 
Bay, and of the two colonies, Connecticut and New Haven. The immigration of 
native-born Englishmen of the more progressive middle class; the class represented at 
home by Milton, Newton, and the illustrious men who later brought on the revolution 
of 1688—was confined to the twenty years between 1620 and 1640, and hardly exceeded 
20,000 souls. In the Massachusetts colonies 1 man in every 250 people had been a 
graduate of an English university, and many of the clergy and laity bronght from 
home a good reputation for superior scholarship and honorable service in church and 
college. Some of them returned and became eminent in the history of that turbu- 
lent period. In no body of immigrants up to that date, possibly in no body of peo- 
ple of similar origin and surroundings, were there garnered up larger possibilities for 
the building of a new order of human affairs in which the sovereign people should 
take the old place of priest and king. 
The religious fanaticism, social severity, and personal intensity and eccentricity 
of the Puritan in New England, even then, was largely the armor of defense by 
which alone he could hold himself erect amid the storm and stress of a home perse- 
eution that, for an entire generation, made England almost uninhabitable by the 
dissenter from the established church. The only way in which these people could 
live at all in the enjoyment of their own religious, civic, and social faith was in anew 
country, out of elbow touch with all opposing influences. They did simply what 
any similar people, inspired by common sense and practical policy, must do. They 
planted themselves in a new country, with an ocean between them and the mother 
land, and ‘‘gave notice to quit,” on the one hand, to the state church at home which 
would have brought to the New World the same persecution that drove them across 
the sea, and, on the other, to the intolerant ‘‘come-outer” or disorderly element that 
   
-P-A-G-E-702
  654 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
would demoralize the new community, This policy of defense, this establishment 
of something like spiritual, civic, and social martial law in the face of the enemy, 
was suspended with the coming to the British throne of William and Mary, and, 
from that day, civil and religious liberty was the theory of New England life as 
surely as to-day. 
Even at first the Massachusetts commonwealth of church members was the greatest 
advance toward republican government on the face of the earth. There, for one 
hundred and fifty years, with Europe at arm’s length, in constant conflict with 
France and the pagan savage on its northern border, a vast wilderness between it 
and the central and southern British ‘colonies, this people wrought out the prac- 
tical experiment of a democratic order of society so thoroughly that it is now essen- 
tially the theory and practice of the American republican government and an object 
lesson for all the nations of the earth. 
(2) More than half a century ago Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton, then a student at the 
university, drew up a remarkable paper on the subject of popular education, just 
looming above the horizon of British politics. He insisted thatnosystem of popular 
schooling could be a success in the then state of English society without some pre- 
vious effort to lift up the parents of the children to an appreciation of the need of 
education. The entire history of the public schooling of the lower classes of the 
English people is a commentary on this fact. There is nothing but hope for a coni- 
munity where the leading influences are on the side of universal education; where 
the child and youth live encompassed by an atmosphere of intelligence, thought, and 
aspiration for things beyond the present achievement. Never since the dawn of his- 
tory was there a country that fulfilled these conditions better than the early com- 
munities of New England. Here were all the incentives to the most active interest 
in the uplifting of the young. Here was the very soil out of which might be 
expected such a practical new departure as the original common school of New 
England, from which has grown a system of popular education competent to the 
training ofa free people in such a nationality as ours. 
(8) Another powerful influence favorable to universal education was the intense and 
intelligent industrial spirit of this early New England people. From high to low 
these 20,000 immigrants were a phalanx of workers. The higher class, even ‘‘the 
Brahmin caste,” the clergy, were chiefly landholders and farmers. Governor Win- 
throp “worked for a living;” the students and professors of the early Harvard 
studied and taught, figuratively, ‘‘in their shirt sleeves; ” and for two hundred years 
the women of New England, not inferior in thoughtful and aspiring mental habits to 
any body of their sex in Christendom, had no servant class, but stood up to the ter- 
rible toil of settling a new country with a capricious climate, caring for the home, 
teaching the children, and laying the foundation of a highly intellectual and moral 
order of society. Into the new common school this people put all the energy and prac- 
tical ‘‘vim” that has made New England to-day the richest section of the wealthiest 
nation uponearth. If the family lived away from neighbors the children were taught 
athome. As soon as there were enough for a group aschool was established. It was 
often taught by the minister, the best schoolmaster that could be found, in the 
church or in a private house, and the first school law of the Massachusetts colony 
makes a long stride of progress in demanding “ the employment of amaster” for the 
schools, instead of the mistress of the ancient “‘dame’s school” of the Continent and 
the mother country. 
(4) Before there was any organized government of town or colony, every community 
in Plymouth and Massachusetts had extemporized ‘‘a government of the people.” 
The new school was not handed down from above by civic or ecclesiastical power. 
It was built up, stone by stone, by the people whose children it taught, largely sup- 
ported by private tuition, watched over with sleepless vigilance by the parerts. The 
minister of the New England church was all powerful for influence; but, from the 
first, he was no priest, Originally he could not administer the right of marriage, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-703

the Bible could not be read at the opening of a public assembly. On every side he 
was reminded that he was but the head servant of a people who had already come 
to the outskirts of the civilized world and would tramp on to the uttermost wilder- 
ness to maintain the right of conscience and work out its own ideal of a state. 
(5) The severity and barrenness of social life which, even to this day, provokes the 
satire and awakens the lofty contempt of the critic, like much of the church polity, 
was a violent reaction of those people from the loose living and demoralizing 
fashions of the “Merrie England” from which they had come. It threw back the 
mind, heart, and imagination of a powerful people on itself for a score of gener- 
ations. The result was that in this era of “lean living and high thinking” was 
wrought out a religious, civil, and social polity and an educational habit that not 
only made the people of New England for several generations the most intelligent 
in the land, but the leaders in American literature and art and foremost in the great 
liberal movements of religion, charity, and all that makes for national reputation 
in the upper story of the nation’s life. 
(6) This very exclusiveness in the early generations of New England society was 
favorable to the establishment of the common school. Being all of one way of 
thinking on matters theological, ‘‘the religious question” in popular education did 
not trouble them. All believed that religion and morality wero at the foundation 
and must be wrought into the substance of every successful scheme of universal 
education. They put into their school the system of religion and morals then at 
hand, certainly not “liberal” when judged by the present standards of the American 
people, but effective for the day and generation. But underneath this garment of a 
severe religious and moral theory was the man who wore it; a man who believed 
himself in the most intimate personal communion with and directed by the special 
providence of Almighty God; with no priest or church standing between him and 
his Maker. As his creed enlarged, he claimed the freemen’s right for his children in 
the schoolhouse. : 
So out of this old elementary school was gradually evolved the American system 
of popular education, unsectarian and unecclesiastical, but practically religious and 
moral; the theory of character-training now established in the public-school keep- 
ing of every American State. 
It was among such a people, encompassed with such an industrial, religious, civic, 
and social environment, that these éarly schools of the New England colonies, while 
taking on many of the forms and somewhat of the spirit of their British models, 
sunk a deeper edacational shaft, and, in placing the schooling of the mass of chil- 
dren in charge of the whole responsible people as their dearest interest, laid tho 
foundations of the American common school. <A brief account of these early schools 
and the legislation of the colonies will show that before the first generation had 
passed away every essential feature of the present common-school system of the 
American people had been recognized and, in greater or less degree, been incorporated 
in the practice of all but two of the colonies. 
The little settlement of Boston, on Massachusetts Bay, may certainly claim the 
honor of establishing one of the first of that series of free or ‘‘ grammar schools” 
which gradually spread through the colonies. It was nota free school from the 
absence of tuition fees. Indeed, none of these early schools were free, except to the 
children of the poor, unless now and then a proper charity establishment. This 
school, afterwards expanded, is now known as the public Latin school of the city, 
probably the oldest of its kind now in operation in the Union, although other sem- 
inaries of the private or parochical church type may have the precedence by a few 
years. 
In 1636, only six years after the first settlement of Boston, and when the entire 
population of Massachusetts Bay colony did not exceed 5,000 persons, the general 
court appropriated £400 ($2,000), a sum greater than the colonial taxes levied for all 
other purposes in a single year, to establish the school which in 1638, by the gift of    
   
   
-P-A-G-E-704
656 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
£779 and asmall library of 260 volumes from John Harvard in 1650, became Harvard 
College. It is said that this general court, presided over by Sir Henry Vane, was 
“the first body in which the people, by their representatives, ever gave their own 
money to founda place of education.” Although not a State university in the special 
sense of our time, Harvard was a college built out of the heart of a people, by gifts 
of all sorts, from the timely donation of John Harvard down to the humble present 
of ‘one great and one small trencher salt.” For more than one generation the new 
seat of learning was kept alive by the never-failing interest shown by a multitude 
of bequests, while the faculty served on starvation rations. During the first eighteen 
years all the available receipts of the college did not exceed £1,400. During the 
first century Massachusetts gave £8,000, and all other gifts amounted to £22,000. 
The population of all New England at its foundation was not above 20,000, with fifty 
towns and villages. Twelve of the first graduates returned to Europe and one-half 
_of the 500 during the seventeenth century entered the ministry. During the first one 
hundred years the salaries of the professors were paid out of the colonial treasury. 
Contributions were also received from England. Until the opening years of the 
eighteenth century ‘(Fair Harvard” was a sickly educational infant, fighting for life 
amid many adverse conditions. In the year 1700 a charter from the royal governor, 
Dudley, and the vigorous administration of President Leverett placed it on firmer 
foundations. In process of time the university was gradually detached from its 
connection with the church and state, and is now a private corporation; but in its 
first inception it was a good illustration of the way in which the people of the New 
England colonies went to work to establish a seat of learning—“ putting their hand 
to the plow and looking not back,” but “pressing forward” toward the educational 
kingdom of heaven. 
Meanwhile the good example of Boston had been followed. Other towns were 
making arrangements for the schooling of their children together, and in every good 
family the little ones were taught by the parents and catechised by the parson. 
But now the general court set its hand to the work, in the two acts of 1642 and 1647, 
which are the foundation of the common school in Massachusetts and the beginning 
of the mass of legislation in behalf of the children and youth which is the glory of 
the Republic. In 1647, the date of the second law, we find the outlines of a complete 
system of popular education in Massachusetts—the elementary, the grammar or sec- 
ondary schools, and the college—all the creation of the people, supported by the 
contributions of parents, private beneficence, public taxation, and legislative grants. 
The new colony of Connecticut was only three years behind Massachusetts in 
framing an educational code similar in its essential features. In 1655 the neigh- 
boring colony of New Haven followed in a school law even more exacting, and in 
1657 the united colonies of Connecticut and New Haven adopted the act of the 
former. With slight alterations these statutes remained the “law of the land” for 
the two most influential of the New England colonies till the organization of the 
States of Massachusetts and Connecticut at the close of the Revolutionary war. 
Maine and New Hampshire were a part of Massachusetts—the former till 1820, the 
latter till 1693. In that year New Hampshire followed in the wake of the older 
colony and established similar regulations for popular education. 
Yale College was founded in 1698-99-1700, by the associated Congregational min- 
isters of the colony, as ‘a school of the church.” A sum of £700, originally raised 
for the enterprise, had been turned over to Harvard, where for a time the boys were 
sent from the younger colony. In 1701 a charter was obtained. Twenty years later 
the gift of Elihu Yale, a native of Boston, afterwards a governor of the East India 
Company, of £500 and books gave his name to this celebrated university. Beyond 
the gifts of other friends of education, the colonial grants, all told, up to the Revolu- 
tionary epoch, had not exceeded $25,000, and in a century and a half less than 
$100,000. Yale was rather a child of the church and Harvard a child of the people. 
But it is remarkable that in a period of great theological stringency Harvard Col- 
 
-P-A-G-E-705

lege was never bound by any illiberal or sectarian limitations that would check the 
freest pursuit of truth in theology. During the first twenty years Yale was free 
from similar ecclesiastical control, though in 1722 a theological test was introduced 
for the faculty which held on for one hundred years. 
Brown University, in Rhode Island, and Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, werd 
established in 1764 and 1769. Neither of them could be called an outgrowth of the 
common-school system, although from the first practically identified with and never 
* found in hostility to the New England idea of universal education. Of academic 
and grammar schools there was a steady growth, most of them supported by the 
people, in this as in other respects the precursor of the present free high school now 
established in every State in the Union. By 1665 every town in Massachusetts had 
a common school, and, with due exceptions for the status of the people, there was 
afair supply of the elementary, secondary, and higher education. ‘From the estab- 
lishment of the colony of Massachusetts until the founding of the Dummer Academy, 
in 1780, just one hundred and fifty years, there was not a school of any importance, 
save the Roxbury Latin school, which was not a public school established by the 
town, controlled by the town, and supported wholly or in part by the town, the 
last charge for tuition of which there is any record in any of these public schools 
being in Salem in 1767.” 
As this original school legislation of the two foremost colonies of New England is 
the foundation of the vast body of ‘acts and resolves,” national, State, municipal 
and rural, on which the present common-school system of our country is erected, it 
may not be amiss to quote them for the information of the present generation of stu- 
dents, teachers, school authorities, and the educational public in general. A careful 
perusal of these admirable statutes will dispel the reckless and ignorant assertions 
of more than one of the heated controversialists who rise up in periodical disparage- 
ment of the educational status of New England at the beginning of the great Ameri-_ 
can campaign for universal education. It will be seen that no present theory of the 
educational training of Young America for American citizenship, however broad and 
assured of its own originality, can surpass this primal declaration of the Puritan 
statutes of Massachusetts and Connecticut in their regard for mental, moral, and 
industrial instruction and discipline as the threefold strands of the golden cord that 
would bind fast and forever together the destinies of a new nationality. 
In April, 1635, the people of Boston, not a year after its settlement, in town meet- 
ing assembled, enacted a law establishing a school ‘for the teaching and nour- 
teuring of children,” and invited Master Philemon Purmont to become schoolmaster, 
although Mr. Maude finally accepted the position. Thirty acres of land and a 
garden plat were voted to the new pedagogue; £50 and a house to the master and 
£30 to an usher, who should also teach to read, write, and cipher, were added. 
Indian children went to school free. The expense was to be borne by voluntary 
allowance, yearly contribution, or by rate of such as refused. The order was con- 
firmed by the general court. 
From this time on it became a fashion to establish schools. Indeed, the year 
following the general court of the colony passed the act for the establishment of a 
college. It must be borne in mind that family instruction, probably by the assist- 
ance of the clergy, was already a habit. In 1642 the general court passed the 
following stringent education and labor law, which, with the subsequent enactment 
of 1647, holds within itself the entire substance of the American common-school and 
industrial education, after the compulsory form; and we note especially that these 
are not laws imposed on a community by a government and administered by a 
church in which the people had no decisive authority. The town meeting of Boston, 
the general court of Massachusetts, and the church, whose cooperation was invoked, 
neither of them ten years old, were little more than extempore arrangements of the 
people to execute their sovereign will with effitiency and dispatch.

The law of May, 1642, reads as follows: 
“Forasmuch as the good education of children is of singular behoof and benefit to 
any commonwealth, and whereas many parents and masters are too indulgent and 
negligent of their duty in that kind: It is ordered by this court and the authority 
thereof that the selectmen of every town, in the several precincts and quarters 
where they dwell, shall have a vigilant eye over their brethren and neighbors, to 
see, first, that none of them should suffer so much barbarism in any of their families 
as not to endeavor to teach, by themselves or others, their children and apprentices 
so much learning as may enable them perfectly to read the English tongue, and 
knowledge of the capital laws, upon penalty of 20 shillings for each neglect therein. 
Also that all masters of families do once a week at the least catechise their children 
and servants in the grounds and principles of religion, and if any be unable to do so 
much, that then at the least they procure such children and apprentices to learn 
some short orthodox catechism without book, that they may be able to answer unto 
the questions that shall be propounded to them out of such catechism by their 
parents or masters or any of the selectmen when they shall call them to a trial of 
what they have learned in this kind. And further that all parents and masters do 
breed and bring up their children and apprentices in some honest, lawful calling, 
labor, or employment, either in’ husbandry or some other trade, profitable for them- 
selves and the commonwealth, if they will not or can not train them up in learning 
to fit them for higher employments. And if any of the selectmen after admonition 
by them given to such masters of families shall find them still negligent of their 
duty in the particulars aforementioned, whereby children and servants become rude, 
stubborn, and unruly, the said selectmen with the help of two magistrates, or the 
next county court for that shire, shall take such children or apprentices from them, 
and place them with some masters for years (boys till they come to twenty-one and 
girls eighteen years of age complete), which will more strictly look unto and force 
them to submit unto government, according to the rules of this order, if by fair 
means and former instructions they will not be drawn unto it.”! 
In 1647 the following school code was enacted: 
“Tt being one chief project of that old deluder, Satan, to keep men from the 
knowledge of the scriptures, as in former times, keeping them in an unknown 
tongue, so in these latter times, by persuading from the use of tongues, so that at 
least the true sense and meaning of the original might be clouded and corrupted 
with false glosses of deceivers, and to the end that Jearning may not be buried in 
the grave of our forefathers, in church and commonwealth, the Lord assisting our 
endeavors : 
“Tt is therefore ordered by this court and authority thereof, That every township 
within this jurisdiction, after the Lord hath increased them to the number of fifty 
householders, shall then forthwith appoint one within their town to teach all such 
children as shall resort to him, to write and read, whose wages shall be paid either 
by the parents or masters of such children or by the inhabitants in general, by 
way of supply, as the major part of those who order the prudentials of the town 
shall appoint, provided that those who send their children be not oppressed by 
paying much more than they can have them taught for in other towns. 
“And it is further ordered, That where any town shall increase to the number of 
one hundred families or householders, they shall set up a grammar school, the masters 
thereof being able to instruct youths so far as they may be fitted for the university. 
/This is the law as it appears in the Massachusetts Revisal of 1660. This revisal 
was made in 1658 and the origin of the law in 1642 is indicated by writing that date 
after it in brackets. The same law, but with varying capitalization, punctuation, 
and paragraphs, appears in the collection of 1672. The original law, the form in 
which it was passed by the general court in 1642, will be found in Mass. Col. 
Records, II, 6-9.

PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE COLONIAL PERIOD. 659 
And if any other town neglect the performance hereof above one year, then every 
such town shall pay £5 per annum to the next such school till they shall perform 
this order.” 
A subsequent law orders ‘that in every town the chosen men appointed to manage 
the prudential affairs of the same shall henceforth stand charged with” the execu- 
tion of these stringent laws. With occasional modifications, but in the same spirit, 
the common-school system, including the elementary, secondary, higher, moral and 
religious, and industrial training, became a part of the common life of the colony 
under these original laws. It is significant that in’ these original statutes neither 
the word church nor minister occurs, Unlike the method of the great central colo- 
nies, the education of the young was taken in hand by the people themselves, through 
officials elected in a manner more nearly resembling republican government than 
ever before. 
In Connecticut, in 1650, the original statute of Massachusetts was reenacted, with 
slight changes. 
In 1655 the colony of New Haven passed a similar law. Ten years afterwards, on 
the union of the two colonies, the Connecticut code of 1650 became the law of the 
united colonies. In 1672 each of the four county towns of the colony was required to 
maintain a grammar school, “every family which is able and willing is commanded 
to give yearly but the fourth part of a bushel of corn, or something equivalent 
thereto, for the advancement of learning by the college at Cambridge.” According 
to Dr. Henry Barnard, ‘‘as early as 1701 the system of public instruction in Connec- 
ticut was so far matured as to embrace the following particulars: 
“(1) An obligation on every parent and guardian of children ‘Not to suffer so 
much for barbarism in any of their families as to have a single child or apprentice 
unable to read the Holy Word of God, and the good laws of the colony,’ and also ‘ to 
bring them up to some lawful calling or employment,’ under a penalty for each 
offense. 
(2) A tax of 40 shillings on every £1,000 of the lists of estates was collected in 
every town, with an annual State tax, payable proportionably to those towns only 
which should establish their schools according to law. 
(3) A common school in every town having over seventy families, kept for at 
least six months in a year. 
“(4) A grammar school in each of the four head county towns, to fit youth for 
college. 
“(5) A collegiate school toward which the general court made an annual appro- 
priation of £120. 
“(6) Provision for the religious instruction of the Indians.” 
Well does the learned compiler of the great treasure house of educational informa- 
tion, The American Journal of Education, remark: ‘‘Thesystem, therefore, embraced 
every family and town, all classes of children and youth, and all the then recognized 
grades of schools. There were no select or sectarian schools to classify society at 
the roots, but all children were regarded with equal favor, and all brought under the 
assimilating influence of early associations and similar school privileges.” 
Here was the foundation laid, not only for universal education, but for a practical 
and social equality which has never been surpassed in the history of any other com- 
munity. It is not remarkable that, under this thorough system, the people of Con- 
necticut, at the dawn of American independence, were the most enlightened of all 
the colonies and that, in 1795, a great landed domain in the Territory of Ohio, now 
known as the Connecticut Reserve, because reserved by the State when it ceded its 
claim to a portion of the general national domain in the West, should have been set 
apart as the first permanent American State fund for education, the income to be 
applied to the support of common schools. 
The only exceptions to this unanimity of the New England colonies were, first, 
the partial case of the Plymouth colony, that waited fifteen years before organizing

aschool. Here is a flat disproof of the assertion that the Pilgrims brought from 
Leyden, Holland, the idea of the American common school. In fact, one of the 
chief reasons for leaving their Dutch home of a dozen years was the desire to edu- 
eate their children in English schools, their dislike of what they termed ‘the 
outlandish language” of the Hollanders, and the dread of social and personal juve- 
nile demoralization from the free and easy continental habits of life. The reasons 
for this apparent neglect of education in their new home were the early privations 
and perils of this little band of pioneers, cast in midwinter on the bleak Atlantic 
coast, and the extremely radical and intensely personal type of character of the 
people themselves. The Plymouth colony was a collection of the most extreme 
religious thinkers of northeastern England, while the Puritan immigration to Massa- 
chusetts Bay included a more conservative class, who could have remained longer 
behind and had not yet entirely broken with the civil and ecclesiastical authorities 
at home. | They represented the upper strata of the great progressive middle class 
that now controls the Government of Great Britain, and the fact that they at once 
established a system of education which was mainly the grammar school and college 
of England and Scotland, enlarged on its elementary side to meet the exigencies of 
a new country and a progressive civic polity, is sufficient proof of the essentially 
home origin of their new experiment in education. 
The colony of Rhode Island was another even more extreme community of radical 
Dissenters and Protestants, not only for a larger ecclesiastical freedom than they 
found in Massachusetts, but for a ‘glorious liberty” of personal and political 
activity. 
Thus, while Roger Williams and his associates did bravely stand by the idea of 
personal independence of thought and action, the colony they founded had at first 
little thought for that education of the whole people on which the entire American 
structure of civil and religious liberty is founded, until 1790, at the close of the 
Revolutionary epoch. Even then Rhode Island had but 10,000 people, and was one 
of the last, as the least colony, that gave in its adhesion to the new National Govern-- 
ment. Still education was not wholly neglected meanwhile. Brown University was 
established in 1764, and schools existed in Providence and Newport, while the latter 
town was becoming one of the chief marts of commerce for the new Republic. 
The colony of Vermont did not exist prior to 1724, and, till the Revolution, was 
practically a scattered group of pioneer settlers in a mountain and woodland wil- 
derness, always in peril from the French and Indian aggressions from Canada, and 
distracted by a chronic controversy for civil independence with its neighbors in New 
York. 
The significance of the original educational theory and practice of the early New 
Engiand Colonies is fitly described by Horace Mann, in his vigorous, characteristic 
style: 
“There are three fundamental propositions upon which the common school system 
of Massachusetts rests: 
“*(1) The successive generations of men, taken collectively, poner ne one great 
commonwealth. 
‘((2) The property of this commonwealth is pledged for the education of all its 
youth up to such point as will save them from poverty and vice, aud prepare them 
for the adequate performance of their social and civil duties. 
“«(3) The successive holders of this property are trustees, bound to the faithful 
execution of their trust by the most sacred obligations; and embezzlement and 
pillage from children have not less of criminality, and more of meanness, than the 
same offenses perpetrated against contemporaries.” 
As representative of the moral and religious ideal of the early New England 
school we may fitly reproduce the prayer of Rev. John Eliot, who, for fifty years, 
labored for the conversion and civilization of the Indians in New England, includ- 
ing in his ministry the preparation of schoolbooks in their language, the establish-
-P-A-G-E-709
  
/

ment of schools, and the persistent effort to bring their superior young men into the 
enjoyment of the best opportunities in the colony. He was the untiring friend 
of the early common school of the colonies. The following prayer reads like the 
united petition of the nobler sort of people in the New England colonies in behalf 
of the institution next to home and church nearest their heart—the early colonial 
common school: 
Cotton Mather writes of John Eliot: 
“A grammar school he would always have upon the place, whatever it cost him; 
and he importunedall other places to have the like. I can not forget the ardor with 
which I once heard him pray, in a synod of these churches which met at Boston to 
consider ‘how the miscarriages which were among us might be prevented.’ I say 
with what fervor he uttered an exhortation to this people: ‘Lord, for schools every- 
where among us! O! that our schools may flourish! That every member of this 
assembly may go home and provide a good school to be arranged in the town where 
he lives; that before we die we may see a good school arranged in every plantation 
in the country.’ God so blessed his endeavors that Roxbury has afforded more 
scholars, first for the college and then the publick, than any town of its bigness, or, 
if I mistake not, of twice its bigness, in all New England.” 
A fair analysis of this body of colonial legislation in behalf of universal education 
shows how completely the entire structure of the American common school is builded 
on foundations that must endure, unless the American people ‘fall from grace” and 
return to some of the old-time European systems or launch out on the unknown sea 
of the ultra secular theory, which divides man into “faculties” as separate and well 
defined as the water-tight compartments of a great ocean steamer, holding that the 
state, the only power on earth which claims the supreme right to override the 
inalienable and natural rights of ‘life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” must 
be absolutely divorced from all acknowledgment of Almighty God and all recog- 
nition of the moral law, outside the dim and distant logical approaches of the experi- 
menting of a materialistic philosophy. 
(1) The entire system originated from and was organized, supported, and admin- 
istered by the people, as the people was then understood. This meant the reliable 
and responsible portion of the population, on whom church, State, and society were 
dependent. That neither universal suffrage, nor woman suffrage, nor several other 
“rights and privileges” were at that time factors of civilized society is not to the 
point. The voting and governing people of New England was the broadest base on 
which a civilized government, up to that date, had been reared, and, since its fun- 
damental principle was an absolute denial of the infallible authority of priest and 
king in the realm of the personal conviction of the voter, here was the broad gate- 
way through which the majestic procession of humanity has defiled in its march of 
centuries toward the uplands of the universal emancipation of the race. That 
gate was never shut, and with the springing forth of ‘‘the new light,” prophesied by 
Robinson, this people followed on, and to-day can boast of the most complete organ- 
ization of “liberty and union, one and inseparable, now and forever,” in the wide 
world. - 
These colonies, for a generation after the settlement of Massachusetts and Con- 
necticut, were to England virtually a far-off land, and the new colonial child had 
been weaned and stood well up, with a stiff back and an obstinate pair of legs, 
before the iron hand of parliamentary aggression was felt. There is no evidence 
that the home government was ever sufficiently interested in the new colonial experi- 
ment in education to interfere in any way with its development. Neither is there 
any ground for the assertion. that the New England system of common schools is an 
imitation of any of the old European forms of parochial education dominated by 
the church and administered by the clergy. That the church and the clergy were 
very positive factors in the school life of Massachusetts and Connecticut through all 
those years is not disputed. But the critics who see in this fact only the evidence 
 
-P-A-G-E-710
  662 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94, 
of the ecclesiastical despotism and bigotry of New England forget that, in affairs of 
church, as of state, the people were practically supreme. ‘The Puritans of New Eng- 
land came to anew country as a body of dissenters, either already cast out or in danger 
of expulsion from the Church of England athome. For a generation these churches 
were a group of absolutely independent congregations, steered by the people com- 
posing them, jealous to the last degree of interference from any quarter, holding their 
clergy to the most absolute fidelity as representatives of the congregation. It was 
only a growing conviction of the danger of this isolated independency that drove, 
first the churches of Massachusetts and afterwards of Connecticut, to the loose con- 
federations of the Cambridge and Saybrook platforms, which were the beginnings of 
Congregationalism, the only original contribution of America to the ecclesiastical 
polity of Christendom. The essential principle of this new polity was the persistent 
denial of ecclesiastical authority and the substitution of ‘ advice” and “influence” 
for authority, as the only legitimate functions of church union. The union of church 
and state which, after a sort, held on, in the form of a public tax for the support of 
public worship was not the imposition of a church by a sovereign power on the people 
but, originally, the unanimous consent of a community to be taxed for the common 
good in religious as now in civil and educational affairs. The town was taxed for the 
church and school; both church and school being the creation of the popular will. 
The clergy were not a priesthood, but simply a body of ministers, the hardest 
worked class of public servants; for several generations the guardians of the new 
life, constituting the vast majority of the educated class, settled “during good 
behavior,” mostly landed proprietors, influential men of affairs, politicians, teachers, 
the ‘men of all work” of the new colonial dispensation. Still below church and 
state was, forever abiding, ‘‘the common people,” the original source of power—no 
hard and fast aristocracy, such as ruled with despotic sway even the free cities of 
Europe; no body of titled men, entrenched in heredity and permanent political 
position—abiding on a sacred foundation as flexible and variable as the blue all- 
surrounding sea that beat against their rocky or sandy shores, never for a day out- 
side its everlasting barriers, but ebbing and flowing with the passing hours, now 
lashed to a tempest, now reposing as a sea of glass, now bearing aloft a proud navy 
on its mountain waves, now stranding the proudest monarch of the waters on a sand 
bar of its broadest bay. 
(2) This fact disproves the claim of the Chistrian churches to the introduction of 
sectarian religious education in common schools preferred by the ecclesiasticisms that 
brought their polity across the Atlantic. The religious and moral teaching in that 
early colonial school was doubtless the severe theology and the corresponding social 
and private morality of the day. It was enforced in the schools, as in the home, as 
the common faith and practice of the people. It assumed in full the fundamental 
proposition that the American common school is, below all else, a school of charac- 
ter; that good citizenship can only be the outgrowth of a good moral and religious 
life, and that the system of morals announced in the life and teaching of the Master 
is the ideal of tho new national life, to be interpreted by the best reason, conscience, 
and growing experience of the people. But with the passing years this fundamental 
idea of Puritanism, the right and duty of every man to the guardianship of his own 
soul above and beyond his allegiance to king, emperor, or priest, wrought out its 
legitimate result in the limitation of this function to moral and practical religious 
instruction and discipline in the schools common to all. The present American sys- 
tem of moral instruction and discipline in the people’s schools of every degree is the 
logical outcome of that original practice in the New England schools; and the extreme 
theory of the absolute divorce of the common school from all moral instruction refer- 
ring to a religious sanction, is a recent European idea, a feature of the impracticable 
continental notion of democracy. Here again we have the Anglo-Saxon, practical, 
common-sense idea of moral and religious training, whereon has been founded and 
well founded our republican order of civilization, all continental European theories, 
ecclesiastical or philosophical, to the contrary notwithstanding.

PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE COLONIAL PERIOD. 663 
(3) Here at the outset is laid the broadest foundation for the education of the 
whole people by private and public cooperation in the establishment of the elemen- 
tary, secondary, and higher departments. The country district school with its meager 
fare of “the three R’s”; the grammar school with its narrow curriculum of classics 
and mathematics; the college, at first little more than a nursery for ministers, because 
the ministers were virtually the ‘men of all work” who were expected to attend to 
everything that everybody else had no time for, were equally a part of the new 
schenic of universal education. The theory now forced upon public attention, that 
the State should concern itself only with the elementary schools of children, runs 
sharply against the fact that it was the college that first received the public bounty 
of the colonial general court, and for a hundred years was supported and to a degree 
governed by the provincial legislature. And until a recent date the legislature of 
Massachusetts has been accustomed to give a “send-off” to every one of the dozen 
colleges of the Commonwealth, in the form of a generous contribution of money or 
lands, and, until the final organization of the free high-school system, by correspond- 
ing subsidies a large number of academies were endowed. The New England colo- 
nies never fell into the net spread by a persistent class of the social, civic, and clerical 
opponents of the common school, that the vast public interest in the secondary and 
highcr education is their own special province, or that the preparation of teachers 
and superintendents of the common school should be remanded to the sole charge of 
irresponsible private, sectarian, or corporate associations. From the beginning the 
colonial government flung wide open all doors of culture. 
(4) That, for a time, none of these schools were free, in the modern sense of our gra- 
tuitous instruction, is no disproof of this intent, since it was impossible for a govern- 
ment so limited and under such constant pressure of taxation for a bare existence to 
shoulder the entire support of the education of the masses. The State did its utter- 
most and then left it to the local authorities to do the rest. The result is, to-day, 
that Massachusetts, the State which, on the whole, offers the broadest and’ most 
effective system of instruction in the world to every child, with free schoolbooks, 
with $10,000,000 expended yearly for her 350,000 children, with a free high school 
offered to all of her youth, with 90 per cent of school children under skilled super- 
vision, has scarcely a State tax at all for education—only a moderate school fund 
with an income of $100,000 a year, depending on local town and city appropriations 
for 99 per cent of this vast amount. Every State in the Union is now following on 
this track. Only here,in the waking up to the necessity of a generous local support 
of public education, is seen a hopeful future for the common schools of every portion 
of the country. 
(5) The curriculum of the early New England elementary school was certainly meager 
to the last degree, including little beside reading, spelling, writing, and the small 
“figuring,” essential to the ordinary business of life. But such was the order of 
things even as late as a centufy ago. The children’s day had not yet dawned and 
the old Pagan and Hebrew ideas of the absolute supremacy of the parent over the 
child still brooded like a dark cloud over the path of the colonial life. But the 
article for the assumption of the people’s charge in education that appears in the 
Massachusetts law of 1642 was a public assertion of the right of the State to educate 
the child in default of the parent to do his own duty. While the home could meet 
the exigency for the time it was well. But the Massachusetts general court sent 
forth its mandate to look into the homes of the people and unmask parental greed, 
neglect, and abuse; it even asserted supreme authority to take the child from the 
parent and educate and train it at public expense. This idea isnow wrought out in 
our elaborate system of legislation for the protection of childhood and youth. The 
principle there asserted that the little child might be schooled in knowledge, morals, 
manners, and industrious habits by the whole people for the public good was cer- 
tain to open into the broad and healthful uplands of the present American common 
school.

It was almost two centuries yet before Boston reached the point of adding a pri- 
mary department to its growing system of public instruction. Paganism and 
Mohammedanism were especially religions for the adult side of society, leaving the 
children and youth to the despotic rule of man, tempered only by the all-protecting 
love and wisdom of woman shut up in the narrow life at home. When the Great 
Teacher spoke the comprehensive words, “Suffer little children to come unto me 
and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of Heaven,” he delivered the charter 
of children’s rights and broke the chains in which the ancient world, Pagan, 
Hebrew, and Mohammedan, had bound the household. The order to give a ‘mas- 
ter” to the elementary school was a step out from the traditionary dame school 
of Europe and marked a decided new departure. Fora century the schools of the 
New England colonies were taught by graduates of Harvard and Yale. In some 
respects this was an advantage over the rural common schools of to-day. In the 
early experience of the author of these pages the country district schools in New 
England in winter were taught largely by students and graduates of the different 
colleges and academies. 
And, beyond tho meager common curriculum, there was, even then, a broad 
margin of semiprivate instruction of ambitious pupils by the teachers outside of 
school hours, with the constant cooperation of the entire household at home. The 
exclusion of girls from the elementary schools was in the same line. Up to a gen- 
eration ago, in half the States of the Union, the ideal of female education was by 
the governess or tutor in the household, and only the want of means to do the 
fashionable thing was the excuse for sending the daughters to a private class or 
abroad to the female seminary. But the progress in both these directions in these 
States notes the growth of a broader sentiment in the most enlightened centers of 
education in all lands. It was out of the old New England district common schools 
of the country, to which girls were admitted, that came forth the Emma Wil- 
lards and’ Mary Lyons who built up the first great seminaries to extend to the 
daughters of the people the superior advantages enjoyed by their brothers. To-day 
every Protestant university in the Union is in greater or less degree responding to 
the demand of the young womanhood of the nation for equal rights and oppor- 
tunities in the open field of universal education. 
The course of study in the early grammar school and college of New England was 
substantially the same as in the public schools of the England of that day. The 
present race of elderly British statesmen, including Mr. Gladstone, were educated in 
the great ‘public schools” on a mental diet almost as meager and exclusive as that 
of the early New England college. Indeed, so well up to the prevailing ideal was 
Harvard College that from the first it included a considerable number of students 
from across the ocean and many of the graduates returned to the Old World and he- 
came well known in every private and public station. To-day Harvard University, 
the first college established by the whole people, leads the country in its experiment- 
ing on the field of the elective system of study and the broadest scheme of moral 
training, through its successful arrangements for public worship and a personal 
Christian ministry, to the student. 
(6) One would think there was small need for insisting on industrial education in. 
the early colonial school in a new land, where every man and woman, from the gov- 
ernor and the parson down to the Indian and negro slave, was practically a day 
laborer in the common work of the hard world in which their lot was cast. Yet, in 
all this early legislation, there was inserted, and, in the law of Connecticut, placed 
at the front as a chief impelling cause, the demand that the people should train up 
their children and youth in the habit of industry and the actual practice of a self- 
supporting occupation. : 
Here was one of the mighty moving forces of the civilization of that early time, 
the tremendous industry and relentless economy of the early New England life. The 
records of the Plymouth colony are full of the most ludicrous regulations for the  
-P-A-G-E-713
  PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE COLONIAL PERIOD. 665 
punishment of laziness and the saving of everything that in any way could con- 
tribute to the necessity or comfort of life. Never did a race of people of such ability 
and aspiration, men, women, and children, toil so terribly and with such patting of 
the thinking brain into the working hand as these New England folk for the 
one hundred and fifty years before the Revolution. Then and there were laid the 
broad foundations of the enormous wealth and marvelous inventive and executive 
faculty of the succeeding generations of young men and women educated in the 
industrial system of those States. Neither was the economy of that primitive day 
what certain magnates of the exchange dismiss with the contemptuous epithet 
“stinginess.” The colored people of the South, to-day, handle more money and have 
in reach more of the comforts of life than the fathers and mothers of New England 
for a full generation after the settlement of Plymouth, Boston, Hartford, and New 
Haven. But, already, these people had grasped the secret of a Christian economy 
as distinguished from a pagan stinginess; they had learned to save on the lower in 
order to expend on the upper side of life. It was while these people were living 
within such narrow limitations that their little children died like sheep, and toil 
and privation, like gaunt specters, looked in at every household, that the church, 
the school, the college, everything that made for the upper side of civilization, were 
so nobly supported. Could the story be told in full of the way in which the gener- 
ations of the New England pcople have earned and saved the money by which the 
present mighty structure of religion, education, and charity, ‘‘ with all that adorns 
and embellishes civilized life,” has been raised; how they have earned the gigantic 
capital that still dominates half the continent and trained the faculty that fills the 
Patent Office with miracles of labor-saving invention, the lesson might well be 
learned by other communities. A work like that of Mr. William E, Weeden sets 
forth in startling colors the amazing progress of these colonies in all the arts and 
industries in the face of the obstinate,even malignant, industrial policy of the — 
mother country. It was this policy of suppression of the industrial forces of an 
irrepressible people that finally drove New England into revolt. And in the life of 
rural New England the common school has always gone along with a practical edu- 
cation in work. The rapid rise of village and city life that removes the children 
and youth so largely from the necessity and opportunity of hand labor is one of the 
chief reasons for the present great movement in behalf of manual training and 
gymnastic exercises. 
(7) But we must never forget that behind and before, over and above, and all 
around the primitive system of New England education by the common school, was 
the larger seminary of the rising New England life. It was the providential oppor- 
tunity of this Puritan civilization, for the one hundred and fifty years before the 
Revolution, that the country was occupied, governed, and developed by a race of 
men who believed themselves a ‘‘ peculiar people,” watched over and directed by 
daily and hourly communion with the “light that enlighteneth every man that com- 
eth into the world.” It matters not that the morality of these people did not, in 
private life or character, rise to this exalted ideal of a providential call to establish 
a new kingdom of God in a new world; or that their religious life was pitched on 
the key of a narrow creed, and a severe type of character that too often strayed from 
the broad highway of Christian charity. The conviction was present. It was the 
public ideal, and to a greater or less degree it modified everything in public and 
private life. It made the society of the day a moral and spiritual phalanx, moving 
with irresistible power on the lines of what was foreordained, the beginning of a 
new kingdom of Heaven on earth. By this atmosphere was the humblest New Eng- 
land rural school of two hundred years ago somewhat environed, as by the bracing 
air and brilliant sunshine of a northern clime. The entire exterior of New England 
is a stormy seacoast. The greater area of its interior is a wild realm of mountain 
land. For two centuries it was largely a region of dense forests, rushing streams,

ance of nature. It was amid this pioneer life, destitute of all the helps to easy liy- 
ing of the modern world, off on the border land of civilization—on one side, threat- 
ened or worried perpetually by the most powerful empire on the earth; on the other, 
in constant peril from the savage and the Frenchman; preoccupied with the task of 
keeping the wolf from the door and building up a new order of human affairs—that 
the child and youth were sent to school. About all that any school could give was 
the most simple lessons of reading, writing, and “ figuring,” as a help in working out 
the profound problems of civilization with which he was so soon to be confronted. 
In surroundings like these, children and youth grow preternaturally old; human 
nature “‘lives fast” and good people find each other and learn the divine art of coop- 
eration for greatends. Here, in this unity and intensity of public opinion, concen- 
trated on one overpowering public interest, the growth of a new society, must we 
look for the prodigious outcome of what to our modern educational expert seems an 
almost contemptible agency for the schooling of a people. Horace Mann was born 
under similar conditions and fitted for Brown University in a few months. Henry 
Wilson was taken from a New Hampshire ‘poorhouse” and ‘bound out” toa 
stingy farmer who refused to send him to school, ‘‘read through” a minister’s library 
by the light of pine knots thrown on the kitchen fire, and died Vice-President of 
the United States. Thousands of these brave boys and girls were sprouted in these 
country schools and worked their way up to an education through privations, toils, 
and sacrifices only next to perpetual martyrdom. Here we recognize ‘‘the power 
behind the throne,” in the environment of these beginnings of the American com- 
mon school. And the most hopeful feature of the revival of the new education in 
the new South is that these great States are now swarming with brave boys and 
girls who are going through the same process of working out an education in a 
meager country school, through labors and experiences well known to multitudes 
of the best New England men and women, recalling their own experience in the good 
fight for manhood and womanhood out of which is woven the warp and woof of our 
splendid American life. 
One of these typical seminaries of the earliest period was the celebrated public 
school of Dorchester, Mass. It was founded in 1639, less than ten years after the 
settlement of Boston, for the instruction of boys “in English, Latin, and other lan- 
guages.” At first it was supported from the income of the public lands of Thomp- 
sons Island, granted to the inhabitants by the general court, and the occupants of 
the land were subjected to an annual assessment of £20 for this purpose. The 
seven ‘‘select men” divided at once on the burning question whether ‘‘maydes” 
should be schooled with the boys. The result was that the ‘little maydes” of 
Dorchester were requested to step out, for fifty years, when their granddaughters 
stepped in. In 1641 the interest in the island was conveyed to the town for the 
maintenance of ‘a free school for instructing children and youth in literature and 
good learning ;” but in 1659 the general court made other donations and conveyed 
to the town 1,000 acres of land, in lieu of the loss of title tothe island. John Clapp 
gaye $13,500 in 1655 “ for ministry and school,” and, from that time on, a succession 
of gifts flowed in. In the early period a tuition fee was paid in produce, and the 
cost of fuel, a big matter in a colonial New England winter, was assessed on the 
parents, each scholar representing a load of wood, cut, if ‘‘long.” Later on a fee 
of two and sixpence a family was imposed in place of the-wood. In 1781 an annex 
was voted for a different part of the town. 
The records show that as early as 1645 this was, in all essential respects, a public 
school in the present acceptation of the term. The ‘‘school wardens” were chosen 
for life by the inhabitants, with large powers, but subject to the veto of their con- 
stituency. The master was chosen with the consent of a majority of the people. 
The schoolhouse was kept in repair by an income from rents; but arrears and emer- 
gencies were met by the people. The inhabitants decided the hours of session, 7 to5, 
or 8 to 4, with two hours intermission at noon. On Monday morning the children

were examined, in public, on their recollection of the Sunday service and their 
behavior thereat, and fit approval or discipline administered. There was no distine- 
tion between rich and poor. Especial attention was given to instruction in manners 
and morals, and a service of prayer was held at the close of the day. Corporal pun- 
ishment was carefully guarded, and aggrieved parents could appeal to the wardens 
against the master, One of the first books in the school was the New England 
primer. The hornbook was an arrangement for the use of beginners. It consisted 
of a leaf of coarse paper with the alphabet and the Lord’s Prayer printed upon it, 
fastened on a thin slip of wood and covered with horn to protect it from soiling, 
The children must read the primer before admittance, being taught at home, or in a 
private dame’s school. Spelling the words ofa lesson, writing, and ‘ cyphering,” 
with reading, were the regulation course of study, at first. Of 70 teachers of this 
school before 1790, three-fourths were graduates of Harvard College, Cambridge 
(England), Brown University, and Dartmouth College; 31 of them were ordained 
ministers. 
Out of the training in this people’s seminary came an interesting episode in South- 
ern life. In the year 1700, a colony of Dorchester Congregationalists, under the lead 
of Rey. John Lord, emigrated to a place, now Summerville, near Charleston, 8. C., 
and there settled a new Dorchester, where they and their descendants remained for 
fifty years. One of their first doings was to reproduce a feature of their New Eng- 
land home under a colonial charter, known as the Dorchester Free School. Driven 
from the place by its unwholesome climate, they marched on to the new colony of 
Georgia, where they were assigned, by Oglethorpe, to a tract of country south of 
Savannah, along the seacoast, named St. John’s Parish. They built a Congregational 
church at Midway and a famous academy. When the first Continental Congress 
assembled at Philadelphia, as the colony of Georgia was not prepared to send dele- 
gates, St. John’s Parish commissioned Mr, Lyman Hall to go in their behalf; so that 
the first Continental Congress consisted of the representatives of twelve colonies 
and Lyman Hall, representing the Dorchester folk in Georgia. The patriotism of 
the plucky little parish was appreciated, and Mr. (afterwards Governor) Hall was 
finally joined by additional delegates from the colony. At the close of the war, the 
new State of Georgia, in addition to gifts of estates to Gen. Anthony Wayne and 
Gen. Nathaniel Green, organized a county from this parish and named it Liberty 
County, in honor of the patriotism of the people. For well-nigh one hundred years 
Liberty County, Ga., was ‘‘ known of all men” in Southern parts for the number 
of distinguished clergymen and educators it sent forth. Among them were the 
Gildersleeves, Joneses, Bakers, Mells, and numerous others, many of whom are still 
among the best kuown of the educational men of the Gulf States. The country 
finally became a region of great plantations, and in the march of General Sherman 
was relieved of its large slave population. A recent visit showed the old church, 
now a colored conventicle; and the picturesque dilapidated cemetery, crowded with 
the headstones of well-known people. The negroes, in imitation of their predeces- 
sors, are among the best of their race in the State. We sat at an open window on a 
Sabbath morning in early spring and saw a hundred wagons pass, filled with these 
people, who were as well dressed as the old Dorchester fathers and mothers that 
left Boston one hundred and seventy-five years before, and with all the evidences of 
moderate prosperity. Liberty is one of the “dry” counties, under a local option 
prohibitory liquor law. 
It is unnecessary to enlarge on this head, as every considerable town in these col- 
onies, in due time, had its school, and even the isolated settlements, “away out 
West,” as Springfield, Mass., was first called. Those up among the mountainsof New 
Hampshire, on the coast of Maine, and on the islands of the sea, also had this oppor- 
tunity of acommon school. That there was illiteracy still existing among a people 
so cireumstanced in a border country is not surprising. But, long before the Revo- 
lution, the colony of Connecticut boasted that all its people could read and write. 
 
-P-A-G-E-716

And the life they lived was a “select school” of mental, moral, and industrial train- 
ing, such as many a great metropolis is now trying in vain to devise for the benefit 
of the most hopeless of the ‘neglected classes’—the children of rich, thoughtless, 
or ignorant parents, still kept by the dictates of baleful fashions from the contact 
with actual life, the most tonic discipline of all for the growing girl or boy. 
It was not alone to South Carolina and Georgia that the new colonies of Massa- 
chusetts and Connecticut sent the graduates of these early common schools and 
colleges. Nine years before the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock a band of several 
hundred Puritans from England appeared on the south shore of the James River, in 
what is now Norfolk County, Va., and at once went at their characteristic business 
of building up a country in all essential respects like that of the later comers in 
New England. Fora term of years they went on with success; became known as a 
prosperous settlement; sent two burgesses to the colonial assembly and, afterwards, 
furnished a governor to the colony during the administration of the Protector, 
Cromwell, in England. But darker days fell upon them. Governor Berkeley 
worried them out of their homes under a system of nagging persecution, every way 
as illiberal as the early bigotry of New England. 
In 1619 they accepted an invitation to go to Maryland, then, under the rule of Lord 
Baltimore, a refuge for the persecuted, and settled at Greenberry’s Point, on the Sey- 
ern River, near the present city of Annapolis. For fifty years and more the Puritan 
settlement in Anne Arundel County was. the political and social backbone of the 
colony, and, more than once, became the governing power, finally upsetting the 
feudal tenure of Lord Baltimore, and delivering the people of Maryland over to a 
popular government. They were finally mingled with a large settlement of Quakers 
and absorbed in the growing population of this portion of the State. 
In 1753, 600 citizens of Windham County, Conn., under direction of the Susque- 
hanna Land Company, established themselves in a region in the Valley of Wyoming, 
Pennsylvania, which to-day includes 5 counties and 15 townships, inhabited by more 
than 200,000 people. In spite of perils from the Indians and the terrible Wyoming 
massacre commemorated in Campbell’s exquisite poem, they appropriated 900 acres 
of each township to the support of schools, organized education in nearer approach 
to the present common school system than ever was known at home, and held on 
under this local arrangement until 1834, when the State of Pennsylvania first estab- 
lished a full system of common schools. Among its citizens the most important 
character in placing in the new constitution of the State, in 1790, the clause under 
which Pennsylvania now supports her excellent system of public instruction was 
Timothy Pickering. : 
About this time a notable religious movement occurred in the migration to Vir- 
ginia of a body of people who, under the ominous title ‘‘ New Lights,” inaugurated 
a prodigious revival. Beginning in the region of what is now knownas “The Wil- 
derness,” they woke up a widespread interest, converted several leading men, inter- 
ested Patrick Henry, and forged ahead till they had made a streak of light all the 
way down to the neighborhood of the present Atlanta, Ga. This movement of the 
Virginia Baptists was a powerful factor in the agitation, led by Thomas Jefferson, 
for the separation of church and state in Virginia, and had a powerful influence in 
the subsequent separation of the civil and ecclesiastical powers in the Constitution 
of the United States. 
Dr. Benjamin Franklin, who for a time was a student in the Latin school of Bos- 
ton, became the most prominent leader of educational reform in the colony of Penn- 
sylyania, under the rule of the Penn family which, spite of the broad views of its 
distinguished head, never favored the commonschool. Franklin was one of the chief 
organizers of the University of Pennsylvania, and more than one of the present 
institutions of learning in Philadelphia refers to him asits founder. He interested 
himself warmly in the establishment of schools for the new German immigrants, and, 
although resisted by the German clergy, accomplished great good. Almost every

great city in the Union has a ‘Franklin schoolhouse” among its educational 
buildings. 
One of the most entertaining, certainly one of the most useful, books that could be 
compiled for the instruction and inspiration of American educators would be a bio- 
graphical record of the superior teachers during the one hundred and fifty years of 
the New England colonial life. Two centuries ago, everywhere in Christendom, the 
clergy largely monopolized both the teaching and supervision in school life. But 
only in the New England colonies could it be said that the clerical body was in line ~ 
with the type of education that later developed into the American common school. 
The reason of this was that, in the first new American departure in ecclesiastical 
affairs, there was laid, at an early period in these New England colonies, the founda- 
tions of the Congregational polity, in which the body—‘‘church members” and the 
congregation—constitute an independent religious body which approves its creed, 
appoints its teachers, directs its polity in regard to other churches, and, in all essen- 
tial respects, constitutes the church. 
In New England the church and the common school had the same constituency. 
Neither was the creature of an ecclesiastical or civil body claiming any right above 
the will of the people who were its working membership. The minister, the local 
civil authority, and the schoolmaster were chosen by the same body of voters and, 
in all matters concerning education, acted in complete unison. Thus it was natural 
and often best that to the minister, who at that period was usually the most compe- 
tent man in the community, should be assigned the added work of the teacher, 
especially of the grammar or higher department of the public school. The children 
were prepared for this school in a lower department, often taught by a woman—per- 
haps oftener a private than a public arrangement. It was owing to this fact that, 
for two hundred years, the common schools of New England were in favor with the 
leading clergy and received the great accession of power that comes from the 
approval of the organized religious life of the community. Hundreds of the ablest 
and most devoted clergymen of these colonics, at one time many through their entire 
professional career, were thus engaged in the work of instruction in the people’s 
schools. 
But outside the clerical class there grew up, from the first, a class of professional 
schoolmasters, somewhat of the British type, but modified by the demands and spirit 
of the new colonial life, who served the people in a way that merits far greater rec- 
ognition than even the public of to-day is inclined to give. In the great treasure- 
house of American educational lore, Dr. Barnard’s 30 volumes of the American Journal 
of Education, will be found a large number of these biographical sketches, all pre- 
pared with care and many of them inclosed in a broad margin of information on 
contemporary educational affairs. In the ‘‘good time coming” one of the most use- 
ful circulars of information of the National Bureau of Education may be a volume of 
these admirable sketches, collected from Dr. Barnard’s overflowing treasury. The 
limits of this essay forbid even the mention of this illustrious roll of men and women 
who, by their lifelong devotion, wrought out, year by year, what has become the most 
precious heritage of the people—the American system of common-school education. 
A brief sketch of the life and work of one of the earliest, as one of the most eminent, 
of these men, may, however, be given as a type of the superior New England school- 
master of the old time. 
Ezekiel Cheever, the son of a linen draper of London, was born in that city in 
1614; well educated at St. Paul’s school; came to this country in 1637, at the age of 
28, and became one of the founders of the colony of New Haven. He was at once 
recognized; was one of the 12 men chosen to establish the church and, in that 
capacity, became a deacon of the congregation and an occasional preacher. He 
was elected a deputy from New Haven to the general court in 1646. As the large 
majority of the settlers of New Haven could read and three-fourths of them write, 
itis not remarkable that they called their best scholar to teach in the new school.  
-P-A-G-E-718
670 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
From 1688 to 1650 Mr. Cheever taught the first schools in the new colony. Begin- 
ning with the elementary department, he was soon promoted to the mastership of 
the first free school. This school was largely a private arrangement for the instruc 
tion of select pupils of all classes in the classics and higher branches. It was the 
beginning of the academy, that, later, became so large an element in the education 
of New England; indeed, largely monopolized the secondary education in these 
States. At first, however, there was in the free school an element of public support, 
and this at New Haven was established under the following enactment of the “town 
meeting.” 
“For the better training of youth in this town, that, through God’s blessing, they 
may be fitted for public service hereafter, in church or commonwealth, it is ordered 
that a free school be set up,and the magistrates with the teaching elders are entreated 
to consider what rules and orders are meet to be observed, and what allowance may 
be convenient for the schoolmaster’s care and pains, which shall be paid out of the 
town’s stock.” 
For one hundred and fifty years the colony of Connecticut educated its children 
by this cooperation of private and public effort, with the result that, in 1800, it is 
asserted that “a family which had suffered so much barbarism as not to teach, by 
themselves or others, their children and apprentices so much learning as may enable 
them to read the English tongue, or even an individual unable to read the Holy Word 
of God and the good laws of the colony, was not to be met with.” 
But, in some way, Mr. Cheever ran against the sharp points of the New Haven 
ecclesiastical and social etiquette and was tried by the church for “an offensive car- 
riage in church and public assembly” and “‘a stiff and proud spirit.” The result was 
that he removed to the more liberal colony of Massachusetts, where, in 1650, he is 
found at Ipswich. For eleven years he wrought there as teacher with such vigor 
that he not only left the school “famous in all the country,” but the little settlement 
“ranked in literature and population above all other towns in the county of Essex,” 
a fair illustration of the vital relations in which the school stood to civilization in 
the community in which it was established. During these eleven years he sent 9 
students to Harvard College. The school was not a foreign institution imposed by 
the state or the church, but the most vital part of the body politic, next to the home 
itself, through which circulated the lifeblood of the community. The Ipswich school 
was under the direction.of the town authorities as far as choice of master, the impo- 
sition of tuition fees on each family, and the collection and distribution of funds was 
concerned. Here the good schoolmaster lived on an estate belonging to the town, 
built a barn, and cultivated an orchard. 
In 1661 Mr. Cheever removed to Charlestown, Mass., whose educational affairs were 
evidently in a tangle, stirred up the people to repair the schoolhouse, pay his salary 
punctually, and give him the monopoly of the school-keeping business in the place. 
In nine years he had evidently left education in this settlement, as in New Haven 
and Ipswich, in a condition to go alone, and stepped out and up to his final position 
(the highest in the eastern, perhaps in all the colonies at that time), the mastership 
of the free school that, after 1790, under the name of the Boston Latin School, has 
become famous as one of the most celebrated institutions for the secondary education 
of boys in the United States. The agreement was made, as now, by the governing 
body (then the selectmen of the town), and his salary was fixed at £60 a year and 
the use of the schoolhouse. At this time the school had been in existence thirty-four 
years, established under Master Maude in 1636, and carried on in substantially the 
same way with varied success. But when Master Cheever, after an apprenticeship 
of thirty years, stepped en deck, the good ship righted, and for thirty-eight years, 
till 1708, was the foremost educational authority in the growing town. The school- 
house occupied the site of the present King’s Chapel, corner of Tremont and School 
streets, and the school is described as ‘not only the principal classical school of 
Massachusetts, but of the British colonies, if not of all America.” Pupils were

admitted when able to read, at 6 or 7 years of age, and at once put into the ‘Latin 
Accidence.” It seems to have been a habit of the old gentleman to administer vig- 
orous corporal punishment by thrashing a mischievous boy for hindering his fellows 
from studying. Yet it is recorded that his ‘‘ presence was an agreeable mixture of 
majesty and sweetness, both in his voice and countenance,” and his pupils carried 
away from the school an abiding reverence and affection for their master. He was 
probably the first maker of schoolbooks in the country, having produced “a short 
introduction to the Latin tongue,” which passed through 20 editions before 1790, was 
for more than a century the text-book in most of the Latin schools in New England, 
is called by eminent scholars “the wonder of the age,” and held on till 1838. He 
also tried his hand at theology in a treatise on the coming millennium. 
That old Boston had a chronic habit of fault-finding with its best men is shown by 
a petition of Master Cheever to the colonial governor, Sir Edmund Andros, in 1689, 
after he had already been fifty years at his work, that his arrears of salary might be 
paid and his position secured to him. He died in 1708, at the ageof 94. He was the 
educational patriarch of the colonies, a contemporary of the founders of at least 
four of them, and assisted largely in the schooling of two generations of the fore- 
most people of the day. He was buried from his own school house, the public 
authorities of the colony appearing in state at his funeral. Among his ‘ proud and 
stiff” quirks is recorded his abhorrence of periwigs, then in the height of fashion. 
“He wore his own beard long and pointed, and when he stroked his beard to a point, 
it was a sign to the boys to stand clear.” Dr. Cotton Mather, one of his pupils, 
preached his funeral sermon, from which it is a comfort to learn, New Haven to the 
contrary notwithstanding, that Master Cheever “‘dy’d a candidate for the first 
resurrection.” 
But Master Cheever was only the most notable figure in a generation of these 
stately and faithful old pedagogues, who, from 1633 to the close of the Revolutionary 
era, not disdaining the aid of the good dames and schoolmistresses who prepared 
their work, held the rudder of the infant civilization through the turmoil of a 
hundred tremendous years, dealing with issues of incomparable moment to the cause 
of liberty and union in the Republic that was to come. 
The final outcome of a system of popular education upon the character and 
history of a people is not so much to be estimated by a careful inspection of its 
methods of organization, administration, and instruction, as by its scope and spirit 
and the relation of the school to the general life of the community. One of the 
penalties of a highly developed civilization is a general intensity of living that 
forces every man and woman into a corner to battle for a position always in peril, 
while the broad common interests on which the national character and destiny 
depend are more and more delivered up to the despotism of a body of officials whose 
superior technical skill is often acquired at the expense of the larger gifts and 
graces of a wise and generous manhood. No competent observer will deny that the 
elaborate public-school system of a great American city, even of a considerable vil- 
lage, is in many respects superior to the old-time Boston school of a hundred years 
ago. But this superiority is purchased by an almost complete loss of the intense 
interest in the school by the family and church and, too often, the entire neighbor- 
hood, The hard and fast rules and regulations of the school board of to-day; the 
difficulty even of comprehending the goings-on. and the ways of doing things inside 
the schoolroom; the despotic claim on youthful time and energy, in and out of 
school hours, by the inevitable demand of the enlarged and improved courses of 
study; the improbability that any personal appeal to the authorities can be tried 
on its merits—all these disabilities tend to a loss of interest by the vast majority 
of the patrons of the school. The result is that the school comes to be regarded, 
like Congress or the courts, as one cog of the stupendous machine by which society 
is propelled in these days of sharp division of labor.
-P-A-G-E-720
  672 ; _ EDUCATION. REPORT, 1893-94. 
But the final outcome of any system depends on the question, To what an extent 
is it a vital part of the best life of the whole people? If through the schoolhouse, 
though but a log shanty in the wilderness, flows broad, deep, and clear the current 
of the most intense faith, energy, and consecration of a body of immigrants, just 
beginning the creation of a new state, that school, spite of a hundred defects of man- 
agement and an antiquated style of instruction, will produce the great men and noble 
women that build republican states and make history in a new world. 
Whatever may be said, and a good deal can Ve said, of the numerous defects in 
the colonial system of popular education herein described, it was, to a far greater 
extent than the present common school, in a daily and hourly vital connection with 
the whole body politic. Instead of a government by boards of officials, elected at 
long intervals amid the confusing and exasperating conflicts of partisan politics, 
the people of old Boston, Roxbury, Hartford, New Haven, and all lesser towns had. 
their hand on everything going, even to the ‘stiff and proud” deportment of deacon, 
deputy, occasional preacher, and schoolmaster, Ezekiel Cheever. The tremendous 
concentration of life upon public affairs, church, school, and state, set the entire 
force of a powerful community behind the humblest common school. The children 
might partake of a diet of conic sections, Latin. the Bible, and the hornbook, as the 
common diet in school was; but all the while they were going through the first 
drill of the “‘awkward squad” which, through the often ludicrous experiences of 
“training day” and the muster field, brought out the soldiers that fought at Louis- 
burg, Bennington, Saratoga, and Yorktown, and, under the lead of a crowd of 
extempore rural generals, assisted powerfully at the later ‘“bushwhacking” of 
the British Empire across the Atlantic and beyond the forty-ninth degree of north 
latitude. 3 
It was not alone the superior intelligence of the New England people that accounts 
for the magnificent outbreak of fighting patriotism at Lexington and Bunker Hill; 
for the hoisting of a whole section of the Tory “upper crust” of New England out 
of the country “for good and all” at the evacuation of Boston, and for the pro- 
found influence upon the new Republic of these colonies, inferior in population and. 
in several kinds of influence to their powerful central and southern neighbors. It 
was the phalanx-like organization of New England society for one hundred and 
fifty years, a concentrated community of people who knew just what they wanted 
and proposed to get it at all hazards. For more than half a century before the 
memorable day of Lexington these people had virtually lived with arms in their 
hands. At one time one-sixth of the entire population was on the northern border, 
among the dark woods and gleaming waters of the Adirondack wilderness, in New 
York, braving the threat of imperial France to cut off that mischievous New Eng- 
land from the remainder of the British colonies and destroy them in detail. When 
Burgoyne marched forth from Canada on the same errand, to sever the concentrated 
brain from the long-extended body of the colonial revolt, the same relentless pha- 
lanx of “embattled farmers” blocked his way, leading him and his captured army 
back in sight of the Old South Church and Faneuil Hall. 
The war of the Revolution was largely fought out by the people of the northern 
colonies, and the supply of fighting men was in almost exact ratio to the aetivity of 
the provinces in the education of the people. Massachusetts and Connecticut, the 
two foremost provinces in the school, sent to the field, in militia and continental 
troops, 130,000 men; more than half the soldiers that fought through the war, which, 
added to the contingent of New Hampshire and Rhode Island, 25,000, make 155,000 
of the 218,000 soldiers enlisted for the war, from New England. & 
New York sent 21,000, Pennsylvania 33,000, New Jersey 16,000; in round numbers, 
70,000 from the three middle provinces. The entire southern colonies, almost équal 
in population to the northern, furnished a group of magnificent civic leaders and 
the one supreme military commander; but, in fighting men available for fieid duty, 
outside the home and border guard, furnished in all 75,000; Virginia furnished

nearly one-half, and South Carolina 6,417. It was one of the historical parallels 
that are more than accidents that Lexington Green, where first the old and new 
Anglo-Saxon world met in arms, is now overlooked by the monument commemorat- 
ing the fallen heroes of that ‘glorious day” and by the modest building where 
Horace Mann, more than sixty years later, on the 4th of July, opened the first State 
normal school in America, with three students. Six years ago the same town, 
Lexington, made the great step forward that will span the gap between the rural 
and city common school by building a model schoolhouse and making arrangements 
by which the children of the town may all be carried daily at public expense to 
receive the best instruction in the power of the people to afford. 
General Washington, on arriving at Cambridge, Mass., as commander in chief of the 
revolted colonies, was somewhat worried at the off-hand, independent, free and easy 
ways of his Yankee recruits. But he soon discovered the metal of his new soldiery. 
He said: ‘‘At the end of the war the army was practically composed of New England 
soldiers.” After his retirement from the Presidency he said to a visiting Englishman 
at Mount Vernon: ‘I esteem the New England people greatly. They are the stam- 
ina of the Union and its greatest benefactors. They are continually spreading 
themselves, too, to settle and enlighten less-favored quarters. Dr. Franklin is aNew 
Englander.” The outcome of this ‘spreading themselves” above the southern 
boundary line of Connecticut was due, in no small degree, to the intelligence and 
mental activity generated in the old colonial common school, academy, and college. 
And beyond that was the fact that every New England man or group of good people 
that has “gone west” for the dast one hundred years has carried along the prayers, 
.the personal confidence, and financial good will of a prosperous, intelligent, and 
determined community left behind. Thus the five elements of the old New England 
civilization, declared by John Adams to be ‘Free labor, a free church, the district 
school, town meeting, and training day,” have been planted anew on virgin soil, first 
in western New York, later in the northern section of the original Northwest, thence 
onward to the Pacific Slope, where, enlarged to meet the exigencies of a cosmopol- 
itan population, they have borne a new crop of mighty Commonwealths that will 
never “forget the rock from which they were hewn” in any day of evil omen to 
come. 
If we have seemed to dwell with undue emphasis and elaboration on the early colo- 
nial educational history of New England, it is because of our conviction that here were 
laid the broad and deep foundations of the American common school. To the preser- 
vation of that most original of American institutions must the people of the United 
States look, through all time to come, for the support of a democratic republican 
government, in the American sense of these words of many uncertain meanings— 
Republican and Democratic. But it will now be a not less agreeable task to trace the 
more leisurely evolution of the common-school idea of the 9 colonies of the center and 
the south during the same period. It will appear that the difficulties in their case 
were not so much the hostility or indifference of their people to education, either in 
a general or popular sense, as uncontrollable conditions in their original settlement. 
All but one of them was projected and established on a commercial basis. Their 
immigrants represented such a variety in nationality, class, religion, and political 
ideas that the public energy, available in New England for a united educational, — 
ecclesiastical, and social life, was absorbed for more than a century in learning the 
great American art of living together. This was an achievement in its way as 
important as anything in the new nationality, and sure, ‘in the fullness of time,” 
to bring every Commonwealth into line with the only institution competent to edu- 
eate the generations into a national civic union—the American common school,

EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA AND THE PROVINCES OF THE SOUTH. 
The relation of the four leading New England colonies to the nine British prov- 
inces beyond the Hudson River and bordering the Atlantic coast, in the inaugura- 
tion of the American common school, may be fitly regarded under the figure of the 
orchestra and the opera in one of the majestic musical dramas of Wagner. | First 
appears the orchestra, and through an elaborate introduction announces the theme. 
Then follows the inspiring drama, a marvelous combination of musical, artistic, 
scenic, and architectural effects, emphasized by the uttermost achievement of the 
human voice, to present the conception of the great composer. But all through the 
long-drawn evolution of the splendid creation the orchestra again and again reap- 
pears, recalling the wearied and confused listener to the radical theme, as if there 
were imminent danger that, out of the splendor of its abundance, the glorious spec- 
tacle of human destiny enacted on the stage would overpower and obscure the pro- 
found central idea of the master of many arts. 
Thus, for more than a century and a half of provincial life, from 1620 to 1776, it 
would seem that the providential mission of the New England British provinces of 
North America was an elaborate experimenting on the radical idea of the coming 
Republic; that the people are competent of themselves, without the intervention 
of priest and king, to initiate and control, through their own elected representa- 
tives, all the fundamental institutions and agencies of human society. In its way 
the situation of the Puritan people during this period was not dissimilar to that of 
the Hebrew people in Palestine, or the people of Great Britain sixteen centuries 
later—shut up to themselves to work out a religious and civic polity, with only an 
occasional interference from without, which never amounted to a suppression and 
only acted as a stimulant to their intense and original activity. 
In no respect was the providential call of the Puritan fathers of American civiliza- 
tion more evident than in their experimenting with the bottom fact of human soci- 
ety—the education of the children. Like all the colonies, the parents of New England 
brought to their new home the old educational forms of parental instruction. They 
brought the parochial church school; the ‘‘ free grammar” school or academy, chiefly 
a private corporation, but open to students of every creed, not free from tuition, at 
times subsidized by the State, often chained to the creed and polity of an exclusive 
church; and the college, a group of which constituted the English organization of 
the university. As far as this and almost everything that could be evolved from 
the British European idea of education in the seventeenth century is considered, the 
New England colonies were not essentially in advance of their neighbors except in 
the vigor of their educational public spirit, the intensity of educational interest in 
the family and church, and the number and quality of all sorts of schools. 
But, just at this point, comes in the chronic misapprehension of the majority, even 
of educational American historians, concerning the development of the educational 
life of this early period. The numerous authors of the almost innumerable histories 
of the United States are generally confused and sometimes misleading on this point. 
A recent life of Thomas Jefferson, published in the interesting series of American 
Statesmen, devotes less than’ 5 of its 350 pages to the most cursory mention of the 
educational ideas and labors of the author of the Declaration of Independence. The 
local historians of American education too often appear like men crawling through 
the dense underbrush of a vast forest realm, lost to, themselves and hidden from 
their readers, never appearing upon the open hilltops of observation, where an intel- 
ligent overlook of the entire field can be obtained and the tendencies and character- 
istics of educational affairs be apprehended.

PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE COLONIAL PERIOD. 675 
It is to this chronic failure to obtain the real point of view that we must ascribe 
the controversy that periodically breaks out between the educators of different 
portions of the older States on the claim of priority in the beginnings of the 
American common school. The one element that the American people has added 
to the combination out of which this institution has been developed is the initiative 
of the people in the establishment, organization, support, and supervision of the 
education of every generation for the high functions of American citizenship. 
Here, beyond question, the New England colonies have “the right of way,” prac- 
tically, for the entire century and a half before the Revolution. There were schools, 
and often good schools, of many sorts, supported by the church, by colonial legis- 
lative grants, by taxation of the people, by private corporations, by associations of 
neighbors, by family tutorship, in all the American colonies before that date. But 
in no colony beyond the Hudson River prior to tho declaration of American inde- 
pendence was there anything like a colonial system of common schools for all chil- 
dren, organized, supported, and supervised by the whole people through their duly 
elected representatives, always in their own hands for revision, improvement, cr 
modification of any and every sort. And in giving this fundamental idea to the 
original school life of the country the New England colonies contributed the one 
indispensable motive power that has made the present system of American educa- 
tion essentially different from that of all other Christian nations; the one essential 
element that, while preserved, can be relied on to overcome all defects of quality 
and method, and ‘‘in the fullness of time” make the educational life of the Republic, 
like the Republic itself, a model for every free people on the globe. 
It is now the place to examine, as briefly as the great importance of the investiga- 
tion for the purposes of this essay will permit, the educational ideals and habits of 
the American colonies beyond the Hudson River during the colonial-period. This 
includes the three central provinces, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania; 
and the six, usually regarded as the Southern or the slaveholding States till 1865, 
Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. 
We shall best appreciate the educational position of New England during this 
formative period by contrast with the colonies that were in some essential respects 
farthest removed from the ideas and policy of the Puritans. Of these six Southern 
provinces, Virginia was earliest settled and, until the closo of the great civil war, 
incomparably the most powerful and influential in national affairs. Here we shall 
best discover the prevailing idea of education brought from England, and here can 
we trace the early beginnings of the common-school idea until it flamed forth in the 
splendid conception of a State and national system of education in the magnificent 
but abortive plan of Thomas Jefferson, the foremost educational statesman of that 
early time. 
But, first, let us endeavor to understand the fundamental idea of society that 
appeared in the settlement of Virginia and thence was reproduced through all the 
States of the South for the two hundred and fifty years before the great civil war 
of 1860-1865. We shall then better appreciate the social ideals of the people of this 
and the neighboring provinces; better appreciate the growing conflict between the 
old and the new and the outcome of the contending forces of society in the schooling 
of children and youth. 
In more than one respect Virginia is the most characteristic representative Ameri- 
can State. It was the first American colony, settled in 1607. In 1630 its western 
county, Orange, included the entire region from the Blue Ridge Mountains along an 
indefinite southern boundary line toward the setting sun. Later a treaty with 
France reduced its domain to the immense realm east of the Mississippi, including 
the present Virginia, Kentucky, West Virginia, and the five original Northwestern 
States. 
At the close of the Revolution, Virginia ceded her somewhat visionary right in this 
entire region north of the Ohio River, beyond West Virginia, to the Nation, and recog- 
 
-P-A-G-E-724
  676 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
nized the new State of Kentucky. In 1861 West Virginia, following the example 
of the mother State, ‘‘seceded” from Virginia and became a vigorous companion 
of the great Northwest. The Virginia of to-day is still one of the most favored of 
American States in situation, climate, boundless resources, and undeveloped oppor- 
tunities, capable of supporting a population of 10,000,000 with no hindrance to any 
reasonable aspiration of future eminence. 
Its history is the central romance of American life; a mighty drama, wrought out 
amid a wonderland of natural beauty and sublimity by a people not inferior in orig- 
inal capacity, ambition, and persistence to any in modern history. But its special 
interest to us in the present study of the American common school is its representa- 
tive character and office in the making of the nation. It was the first experiment of 
Old England to reproduce itself in the New World. Virginia was not colonized on 
any theory, but was, for one hundred and fifty years from its settlement, a great 
“shining shore” across the western sea toward which streamed ‘‘every sort and con- 
dition” of the Protestant English people. In its order of society, form of government, 
established church, and sharp distinction of social classes, it was a fair representa- 
tion of Protestant Great Britain before the great English revolution of 1689. 
But no Anglo-Saxon people can remain an annex or imitation. Immediately this 
new colony took up the radical conflict of ‘the classes versus the masses,” of which 
Mr. Gladstone talks to-day. With characteristic pertinacity the Old Dominion 
stuck to that text, elbowing off successive empires of territory that would embarrass, 
keeping outside the entire drift of later European immigration that would compro- 
mise, and only holding fast to the negro, whose status of slavery for two hundred 
and fifty years gave incredible advantage to the dominant class, As in every Euro- 
pean nation, this conflict finally exploded in civil war; the powerful and persistent 
class that had ruled Virginia and led the entire slaveholding section of the Union, 
staking everything, even to the dissolution of the Union, on the perpetuation of its 
control of the only nation in which it was willing to abide. Never was this great 
battle of the ages more splendidly fought out; never by a more illustrious represent- 
ative of the aristocratic order; never by the more potent magnetic power of the 
superior class to confuse and use the masses of the people; never with more phenom- 
enal courage in its soldiery or higher personal character and more consummate military 
skill in its commanders, than in the four terrible years through which Old Virginia 
defied the great Republic in sight of the dome of the national Capitol. 
And never was victory more decisive than in the annihilation of that magnificent 
dominant class as a rival power in American affairs in the fall of Richmond, a gen- 
eration ago. To-day Virginia is a people’s State, only governed by its dominant 
party as long as it does the will of the white masses. And here is being wrought 
out, more completely than clsewhere, the destiny of the negro—first landed on its 
shores as a savage, a pagan, and a slave; now endowed with all the rights of citizen- 
- ship; educated in the common schools; on the whole, perhaps, better off than any- 
where else. And most amazing of all the wonders of American history is the spec- 
tacle of new Virginia striking hands with the Northern Christian people and the 
National Government in the training of the negro and the Indian for American citi- 
zenship in the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute, in full view of the 
beach smote by the prow of the first Dutch slave ship in 1620. 
How this wonderful conflict has gone on—the prolongation of the old English 
fight among the people most thoroughly Anglo-Saxon on this continent—and what 
its final issue portends, as an object lesson to motherland across the sea, is beyond 
comparison the most instructive, thrilling, and suggestive story yet told in the New 
World. What may be in store through the coming years for a Commonwealth that, 
after this fashion, has fought out the tremendous problem of the classes versus the 
masses to its finish, is one of the most interesting and inspiring themes of moral 
speculation and social philosophy. Out of the Old South, represented by the Vir- 
ginia of the past,is to come the most thoroughly original literature of the American

continent. Out of the New South, burdened with the final social problem of human- 
ity—the demonstration that all races of men can dwell together in a Republic in 
freedom, order, mutual appreciation, and mutual helpfulness—is to come the final 
decisive proof that the Christian religion is the one power and the Divine Man the 
one leader, whereby the awful distinctions and repulsions in our humanity, before 
which paganism, secularism, science, and culture stand aghast, may be reconciled in 
the kingdom of God on earth. 
The old assertion that Virginia and the South were settled by the Cavalier, as New 
England by the Puritan, is an exploded romance. The few legitimate representa- 
tives of the British nobility and gentry, largely ‘“‘bad boys” and broken-down 
clergymen, who drifted to Virginia in the one hundred and fifty years before the 
Revolution, were little more than a disturbing element until the breaking out of 
the war sent the majority of them trooping back to the old country. ‘The 
classes” were represented, in the old Dominion, by the great body of landholders— 
chiefly slave owners—that practically owned the country from the Alleghanies to 
the sea for more than two centuries. This class was a composite body; most 
nearly allied to the farmers and country squires of the old home, including a 
small contingent of early Germans and a considerable class of settlers from the 
Northern States. It was not ‘blue blood,” so much as the opportunity of a new 
country for the possession of great estates and the ownership of slaves by any com- 
petent man, that finally welded together that powerful dominant class on the 
Southern Atlantic seaboard, recruited from everywhere, perpetuated in the South- 
west, perhaps in original ability and practical faculty the ablest aristocracy in 
Christendom, that defied the Union in arms in 1860. 
“The masses” in the Old Colony for more than a century were represented by tho 
people who, for various reasons, could not reach this position; crowded off into the 
western wilderness or held in a turbulent vassalage at home; outside exceptional 
youth, almost denied the opportunities for even elementary education; shut out 
from the main avenues to success. Out of the superior class came occasional leaders 
of a popular movement which now and then flashed forth with a portentous glare 
through the monotony of the old colonial life. 
The first experiment of settlement on the coast of the Old Dominion by the Vir- 
ginia Company floundered on for twenty years through a series of blunders and 
disasters. Ten thousand people, too many of the sort that should never leave home 
save for a riddance or on a forlorn hope, were landed upon a new country, and, but 
for a small minority of the superior sort led by Capt. John Smith, the enterprise 
would again and again have gone to wreck. As it was, nearly twenty years after 
the first arrival, but 2,000 of the 10,000 remained, and they with but a flickering 
hope of success. Here was small opportunity for the growth of the educationai 
spirit. The few reliable families probably took such care as was possible of their 
own children and the church and clergy followed the old English way of “feeding 
the lambs” according to the quality and stock of the breed. 
For full half a century all the movements for establishing schools of any sort 
appear to have originated at home from the religious zeal of King James I, the 
romantic idea of converting the ‘‘infidel savages” to Christianity entertained by 
the dignitaries of the Church of England, and from the benevolent desire of « 
few men of unusual intelligence and missionary spirit to do something for a settle- 
ment that had already become a problem more complex than any of the theological 
disputes that vexed the faithful. 
At an early date'there appears to have been a movement in England to raise funds, 
with a somewhat undefined purpose of schooling the Indians. In 1619, under the 
patronage of Sir Edward Sandys, a board of eminent gentlemen was formed in Eng- 
land, including the Earl of Southampton, the early friend of Shakespeare, to estab- 
lish a ‘‘college,” and the legislative body made “humble petition” to the King to 
aid iu the enterprise. Ten thousand acres of land were set apart for ‘‘a university,” 
1,000 of which was to be appropriated for an elementary school for ‘‘the conversion 
   
-P-A-G-E-726
    678 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
of the infidels.” -Private gifts were added, the King made his donation, and a plan 
was formed for the instruction of Indian children from the age of 7 1012 “in reading 
and the principles of Christianity,” and a subsequent training in trades till 21, with 
the intention of merging them in the general body politic. The great estate was 
occupied and a manager appointed. Rev. Mr. Copeland, from the East Indies, 
worked vigorously in behalf of the movement. Mr. Dike was sent over to-be the 
principal of the elementary school at Charles City, with a rectorship and provision 
for support. A squad of workmen were shipped across the Atlantic to erect the 
buildings and high hopes wero excited. 
But the entire plan was largely ‘‘in the air.” The only part of it that had a fair 
chance of pecuniary support, the Indian school, at once ran against a twofold 
obstacle—the unwillingness of the Indans to intrust their children to the suspected 
white newcomers and the reluctance of the settlers to assume the care of preparing 
the young savages for entrance to the seminary. The school was brought to a vio- 
lent end in 1622 by the first Indian massacre, in which the director of the estate, 
a portion of the workmen, and 300 people were slaughtered by the “infidels.” 
It does not seem very clear whether anything except this impracticablo Indian 
school had at any time reliable means of support. The entire scheme, like so 
many of the vast and romantic plans of zealous prelates and a benevolent gentry 
in England for the conversion of the natives, collapsed on the first contact with the 
stubborn facts of the situation. Probably the first school text-book made for 
American use was a little primer constructed by the nephew of Bishop Hall for 
“teaching English to those of inferior station and in allrude countries.” Tho funds 
of this abortive venture were finally diverted to a school in the Bahama Islands, 
where Copeland, the chief actor in the Virginia enterprise, went to die. This 
adventuro, magnified by enthusiastic local narrators to the rank of the first attempt 
to establish a university in the New World, was too early and too absolutely without 
foundation in the sense of educational need among the people to be successful, and 
its violent end probably saved it from a more humiliating collapse. 
Another even more eccentric project for establishing “a college” on an island at 
the mouth of the Susquehanna River, on which its visionary projector spent a com- 
fortable fortune, speedily traveled the same road to ruin. Meanwhile a band of 
Puritans from England had effected a settlement south of tho James River, and 
seemed to be well on the way to the establishment of a prosperous local colony, with 
fair hope of the inevitable school that always sprung up from the sowing of Puritan 
seed. But the jealous colonial governor worried the obnoxious colony till, after 
rejecting a proposition to move to the Bahamas, it effected a lodgment in Maryland, 
where it did yeoman’s service in the building up of that State. 
From time to time other benevolent individuals made gifts of money and land, 
“milch cows,” and various useful appurtenances to establish local schools. It was 
the old English habit of eminent and pious men giving their name and means to the 
founding of a school, under the control of a close corporation, generally bound fast 
to a special church. Several of these seminaries appear to have had a greater or 
Jess term of success, and by 1660 there were, scattered about the sparsely populated 
wilderness in which the colony still remained, a number of little colonial academies 
and several ‘‘petty schools.” But the better sort of the Virginia folk who could 
afford it sent their sons to England for education, The girls were taught at home 
or in small private classes by tutors and governesses. The clergy of the Church of 
England, then the State church of the colony, and every way as intolerant as the 
Puritan Church in New England, kept at their old-time educational work of 
instructing such youth of the respectable class, with a few of the poorer sort, that 
were put under their charge. George Washington seems to have had no educational 
opportunity beside the regulation ‘field school” and a family group of children 
under a master in the home of his brother Lawrence. Te “graduated” at 13, mak- 
ing a big pile of neatly written manuscript schoolbooks, still in existence in the 
library of the State Department at Washington.

But better days were dawning on the disturbed Old Dominion. Her people, by 
dire experience of famine, were slowly learning to appreciate the blunt deliverance 
of Capt. John Smith: ‘Nothing was to be expected from Virginia but by labor.” 
Repeated terrible experiences of savage perfidy and ferocity had disposed of the 
early romanticism of converting the Indians to Christianity, civilization, and citizen- 
ship through the benefactions and benedictions of pious churchmen in England, 
while the people in contact with the ‘noble savage” were rapidly coming to the 
conclusion that unless the Indian priests had their throats cut there was no hope 
to bring the Indians to conversion. Meanwhile, the absorbing pressure of public 
events was enongh to fully occupy the people that remained and challenge the 
uttermost activity of all newcomers to this land of mighty promise. 
In 1624, after sixteen years of desperate attempt at living under the inefficient 
régime of the two Virginia companies, King James I abolished the London com- 
pany, which, in its turbulent goings on at home, had become a thorn in his side from 
its assertion of rights incompatible with the royal prerogative, and proposed to goy- 
ern Virginia by a personal administration, His death cut off this heroic essay. The 
attempt of Charles I to carry out this plan, like all similar efforts of that unfortu- 
nate sovereign, converged upon the closing scene when— 
King Charles at Whitehall 
Stepped out to exchange royal robes for a pall. 
  Had old England been as loyal to the Stuart kings as new Virginia, all this would 
not have come to pass, The colonies stood by their unhappy monarch in the hope- 
less way that was alone possible, and weleomed with open arms the crowd of 
Royalist immigrants who fled across the sea to escape the stringent administration 
of the Commonwealth under Oliver Cromwell. Governor Berkeley consented to 
nurse his wrath in tolerable quietude on his big estate during the rule of the three 
governors appointed by the great Protector. Cavalier and Roundhead agreed to 
enjoy their own good old Virginia life together, despite the turning of things upside 
down at home. Of course, there was great “joy and gladness” at the restoration 
of Charles II in 1660, and staunch old Governor Berkeley came back to his chair of 
state, in which he sat for nearly thirty years. 
But meanwhile a notable change had been coming over the spirit of the leading 
colonists. The inevitable conflict of the “classes versus the masses” had been long 
since inaugurated by the persistent assertion of large local powers by the house of 
burgesses, representing the people, as against the royal government and council 
that stood for the sovereign power. The colony was now divided into 13 counties, 
represented by 35 burgesses, elected by the votes of landholders and householders 
alone, representing the respectability of the country. In 1648 there were but 15,000 
people, 300 African slaves, and a larger contingent of indentured white servants, 
having no public rights until the expiration of their term of service. But in 1670 
the new drift of immigration had raised the population to 40,000, with 6,000 white 
and 2,000 colored people ‘‘in service.” Gradually the always somewhat indefinite 
colonial distinction between Cavalier and Roundhead was becoming even more uncer- 
tain by the substantial agreement of the more influential sort of folk that Virginia, 
in respect to affairs of local concern, was now competent to steer herself. In the 
interegnum between the abdication of Richard Cromwell and the coming in of 
Charles I, the assembly voted that— 
“Whereas by reason of the late distraction [which God in His mercy put a snd- 
den period to], there being in England no resident, absolute, and general-confessed 
power, 
“Be it enacted and confirmed, That the supreme power of the government of this 
country shall be resident in the assembly, and that all writs issue in the name of 
the grand assembly of Virginia, until such a command or commission come out of 
England as shall be by the assembly adjudged lawful.” 
Governor Berkeley was reinstated in his governorship by the same authority. 
 
-P-A-G-E-728
680 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
But now the conflict was transferred to the home field. The newly installed 
Stuart régime proved even more disastrous to the interests of Virginia than to the 
people of the British Islands. The oppressive trade and navigation laws made pros- 
perity impossible. The blundering monarch, ‘‘ Who never said a foolish thing and 
never did a wise one,” had actually made an offhand present of the whole domain of 
Virginia to two noble favorites, for thirty-one years, with an indefinite and inde- 
finable power for mischief. During the régime of the Commonwealth, in 1655, a 
large body of freemen had already been disfranchised and the suffrage limited to 
“freeholders and housekeepers.” The absolute and stupid petty tyranny of old 
Governor Berkeley, with his neglect to protect the people from the hostile Indians, 
conspiring with these causes of discontent, awoke a spirit of revolt, culminating in 
the famous rebellion of Bacon, in'1676, which, but for the sudden death of its brave 
and resolute leader, might have hastened many things. It was significant that one 
of the complaints of the revolting party took the form of the blunt question: “What 
arts, sciences, schools of learning, or manufactures have been promoted by any men 
in authority ?” 5 
It was high time that this question was put and answered. In reply to an inquiry 
from the home government concerning the state of religion and education in the 
colony, the testy old governor had snarled back that there were 48 parishes and the 
clergy well paid, but according to his notion “it would be better if they would pray 
oftener and preach less;” that ‘‘the people, as in England, taught their own ehil- 
dren;” closing with the memorable deliverance: ‘“‘I thank God there are no free 
schools nor printing, and I hope we shall not have these hundred years; for learning 
has brought disobedience into the world, and printing has divulged them and libels 
against the best government. God keep us from both.” The benevolent apology for 
these very plain words, characteristic of the opponents of popular enlightenmentin 
all ages and every land, by some of the later educational historians of the Old 
Dominion, hardly seems to dispose of the accepted understanding of the facts. The 
author of ‘ Virginia,” in the series of American Common wealths, himself thoroughly 
appreciative of the early life of his own State, declares that ‘‘ thirty years later than 
this there was but one free school and a few field schools in the colony.” It wus, 
certainly, none too early that a people, containing such elements of power and prog- 
ress as this rapidly growing colony, should cease to be dependent on the makesbifts 
of educational life on which they had subsisted for more than half a century. 
For by this time a most important new strata of population had been formed in 
the Virginia colony, largely from the coming in of respectable and occasionally dis- 
tinguished people, representing the Royalist party during the progress of the “great 
rebellion” at home. Numbers of these people came across the water during the 
Protectorate, and, not being in good odor in New England, naturally drifted to 
the province that had been faithful beyond all in the darkest hours of the Stuart 
dynasty. The accession of William and Mary to the British throne in 1688-89, made 
a return to England by this class anything but agreeable. The result was that, 
during the generation ending in 1670, there had been landed on the shores of the 
Old Dominion the ancestors of a majority of the illustrious group of men who led 
the State into insurrection in 1776, and before the close of the eighteenth century 
had made Virginia a name of power for all time throughout christendom. The 
ancestors of nearly every eminent Virginian of the Revolutionary period, including 
Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Mason, Henry, Pendleton, Carey, and Peyton, had 
been royalists during the “‘late unpleasantness” over the sea. 
But, transferred to a new land, brought face to face with the rough realities of 
the infamous government of the Stuart restoration, threatened not only with the 
loss of material prosperity and the suppression by James II of their own State 
religion, but also the absolute loss of title to their own lands by the whim of the 
minions of their miserable sovereign, the native Anglo-Saxon passion for personal 
liberty grew apace, These forty years of the life of the province were crowded with

the prophecy of the greater era, yet a century delayed. And among the striking 
contradictions that make the history of the South more romantic than romance 
itself, is the fact that one of the early students of the new State Normal School for 
Girls at Farmdale, Va., was a descendent of the same Governor Berkeley who cursed 
learning and printing, ‘‘in God’s name,” some two hundred years before. 
Out of this fertile new strata of Virginia society, almost a new dominion, and not 
from the logical development of the original educational spirit of 1608, came the 
demand for a school of the higher learning, to which these people, many of them of 
a well-educated ancestry, could send their own sons, without the expense and com- 
plications of a college career over the water. As early as 1660 the colonial assembly 
moved to this effect, requesting that subscriptions be solicited at home and abroad 
to establish a college and free school at the earliest opportunity. But this com- 
mendable resolution, in characteristic colonial style, ‘‘hung fire” for thirty years. 
It was not till 1690 that the local gifts, by public and private donors, supported by 
the royal bounty of £2,000 and 20,000 acres of land, with a tax of a penny a pound 
on all tobacco exported to the neighboring colonies, and the fees belonging to the 
appointment of surveyors of lands, reinforced by various minor taxes, scholarships, 
and emoluments, and backed by a royal charter, set the famous College of William 
and Mary actually on’its feet. The new institution was intrusted by the royal 
charter to a board of 18 local trustees, with ample powers, and it had a representa- 
tive in the general assembly. The curriculum included “ Divinity, philosophy, lan- 
guages, and other good arts and sciences.” A grammar school for the preparation 
of students was attached in due time, and in a few years, by the charity of Robert 
Boyle, a department was added for the education of Indian youth. 
The moving spirit of this important venture was Rev. James Blair, commissary 
of the bishop of London for Virginia. He it was who took up the lagging enter- 
prise in 1691, went to England, and persuaded the joint sovereigns to endow, charter, 
and give their name to the institution. Attorney-General Seymour tried to block the 
wheels, and when the reverend petitioner mildly suggested, “ Virginians, too, have 
souls to save,” blurted out, ‘Damn their souls; let them make tobacco!” Dr. Blair 
became the first president of William and Mary College, holding the office till his 
death, in 1743. He was the first educational statesman of Virginia, and in some 
ways was a champion of “the new education” in this early day. He brought men 
of ability to the chairs of instruction, enlarged the scope of the regulation college 
curriculum, and put his best life into the work. But even he, backed by all the 
rising educational spirit of the colony, could neither at once nor ever afterwards 
make it a people’s college, according to the broader fashion of Harvard and Yale. It 
was never in any special way a representative of or in any shape at all governed by 
the people of Virginia. The president, till the Revolution, was always the bishop’s 
first man in the colony and represented the primacy of the Established Church of 
Great Britain and Virginia. The professors could only be members of this church, 
and were even “hedged in” by a monastic vow of celibacy, violated only on peril 
of expulsion. . 
The institution was munificently endowed, according to the practice of the day. 
In comparison with its munificence, Harvard represented the Puritan age of home- 
spun. But while the New England colleges were born out of the heart of the 
earlier colonial life of Massachusetts and Connecticut; established, supported, and, 
through all their earlier history, administered largely by the representatives of the” 
people; kept in the most intimate relation to the common schools through the 
services of their graduates and students as teachers; while Harvard, and at first 
Yale, was not bound by any ecclesiastical creed and test, William and Mary, till 
the Revolution, remained essentially a British colonial organization, representing 
in this respect the intensely aristocratic ideals of the ruling class in the Old 
Dominion. The accident of its location at Williamsburg, the new capital of the 
province, was a great advantage to its faculty and students, who, during the sessions
-P-A-G-E-730
  
682 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
of the assembly, enjoyed a relief from the monotony of life in a village of 1,000 
people through the presence of the gay and festive spectacle of the wealth, fashion, 
and eminent ability of the entire colony. It was also an advantage to the college to 
have a hold on the State funds, through the avails of various taxes and the licensing 
of land surveyors. But we shall not easily find in anything peculiar to the school 
itself good reason for ascribing to it special eminence as the great American pioneer 
in what is now called university instruction in civics. Neither can we believe that 
George Washington, who was never a student and only knew William and Mary as 
a boy in connection with his licensing as a land surveyor, was through its influence 
“developed into the foremost statesman of America,” although he was its honored 
chancellor at the end of his career, which, as much as is permitted to any genius of 
his sort, was that of an American self-made man. 
Lord Macaulay has well put the fact, in one of his remarkable speeches on educa- 
tion in Parliament, that the foremost men of every historic period are generally 
educated through the type of school and methods of teaching then in vogue. It was 
not remarkable that among the graduates of William and Mary College, for almost 
a century tho sole representative of the higher education south of the Potomac 
River, should have been numbered “27 soldiers of the Revolution, 2 attorneys gen- 
eral, nearly 20 members of Congress, 15 Senators, 17 governors, 37 judges, a lieu- 
tenant-general and other officers, 2 commodores, 12 professors, 4 signers of the Dec- 
Jaration of Independence, 7 Cabinet officers, a Chief Justice, and 3 Presidents of 
the United States.” There were 70,000 people in Virginia at the end of the cight- 
eenth century, and 150,000 in the Southern colonies, of which Virginia was the head 
and front. Tho fact that from such a population, with a fair proportion of aspiring 
and studious youth and a surplus of vigorous executive capacity, only 100 students 
could be gathered up to the close of the war of the Revolution, points to the most 
significant fact of its early history—that, spite of its antiquated organization, it 
received its patronage from, fairly represented the home ideal of education, and was 
identified with the progressive life of the Old Dominion. The majority of the prom- 
ising boys of all these Southern colonies, belonging to the leading families, especially 
in South Carolina, were still sent abroad for their collegiate and professional educa- 
tion. The other fact, that, spite of this and the.eminence of some of its professors, 
the College of William and Mary was always handicapped by its hard and fast 
ecclesiastical organization, and at a later date lost its hold on the progressive life 
of the State through its opposition to the broad educational plans of Thomas Jeffer- 
son, receiving its deathblow by its refusal to follow the capital to Richmond and be 
elevated to the position of a genuine State university, is significant of the growing 
spirit of mental freedom in the State. To-day, under the auspices of the common- 
school authorities, William and Mary has a larger body of students, and is probably 
in some ways a more effective institution of learning than ever before, while under 
the lead of President L. G. Tyler it is becoming the center of a new spirit of histor- 
ical instruction in the State. 
The chief interest this old colonial seat of southern learning has to the student of the 
common school is the fact that the great educational statesman of Virginia and the 
new Republic, Thomas Jefferson, was one of its graduates. At the age of 14 he went 
there, with the preparation of a country private school in the far-off region of the 
Blue Ridge, and studied diligently for the allotted time of four years. But his chief 
* opportunity there was evidently the influence of Dr. Small, professor of mathe- 
matics and philosphy, a born Scotchman, and the friendship of George Wythe, head 
of the Virginia bar, with the intense interest of a very young man in the sessions of 
the general assembly now shaken by the rising agitation of the coming Revolution. 
That he there exhibited any special evidence of interest in his subsequent career as 
the foremost educator of the State and one of the foremost of the Republic, does not 
appear. He certainly lived to find in his alma mater the most persistent opponent 
of his broad plans for the schooling of the youth of the new Commonwealth of Vir- 
ginia,

PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE COLONIAL PERIOD. 683 
From the foundation of William and Mary College, in 1693, to the outbreak of the 
Revolution, in 1776, more than three-fourths of a century, the history of education 
in Virginia is only a repetition of what we have already seen. The free schools 
gradually increased in number, and probably improved in quality; the wealthy 
folk continued to educate their children abroad and somewhat in the North; the 
young women were taught by tutors or in family schools at home. Even Jefferson 
seems not to have appeared as the public advocate of the elaborate system of popu- 
lar education afterwards brought forward during his first term of service in the 
State legislature, in1779. The thirty years before the outbreak of the war had been 
crowded with great and exciting public controversies, and the rising young lawyer 
and publicist recognized that there were many formidable barriers to be surmounted 
before the ‘glittering generalities” of the Declaration of Independence could be 
embodied in the social and civic life of the Old Dominion. The very citadel of the 
régime was found in the intense prejudice of the great majority of the planter class 
against anything resembling the common-school system of New England. 
Probably the most vital educational influence in that direction was the very old- 
time plantation “ field school,” which was the sole embodiment of the people’s 
desire for general education at that time. This was, at least, a voluntary organiza- 
tion, where a group af neighbors united for a school, supported by a tuition fee paid 
by its patrons, not dependent on the church or any outside influence, save the good 
sense of the parents and the willingness of the lively young Americans of the day to 
submit to school discipline. There must have been a good deal of valuable work 
done, with much of little worth, in these extempore organizations. George Wash- 
ington owed all his elementary training, outside the home school of his brother and 
the discipline of his mother, to an arrangement of this sort. Here, in an awkward 
and imperfect rehearsal, was the prophecy of the “good time coming,” when the 
whole people of Virginia, of every race and ‘all sorts and conditions,” would be 
summoned by their gracious Commonwealth to the feast of knowledge. 
It might have been from the observation of the painful inadequacy of this provi- 
sion for the needs of the colony that, with scarcely an exception, the foremost Vir- 
ginia statesmen of the Revolutionary era gathered about Jefferson and battled, with 
a hope beyond defeat, in a contegt prolonged through almost another hundred years, 
for the realization of what was so nobly outlined in the conception and so eloquently 
enforced in support of the plan of this great educational reformer. It willbe one of 
the most interesting features of this essay to note the first splendid outbreak of this 
desire for universal education in Virginia, at the close of the war of Independence, 
prophetic of the steady progress of the educational movement through various suc- 
cesses and defeats up to the final and complete adoption of the American common 
school by Virginia in 1870. 
The original charter of the province of Maryland, granted to Cecil, Lord Balti- 
more, by Charles I, has no mention of education. But there seems to have been a 
somewhat earlier appreciation of the need of educational facilities by the settlers 
than in the neighboring colony of Virginia. The general assembly, in 1696 and 1704, 
passed two acts “for the encouragement of learning and advancement of the tlatives 
of this province,” with. a supplementary act imploring “his sacred majesty for the 
establishment of free schools.” But their “sacred majesties,” William and Mary, 
had other matters more directly concerning their own newly acquired prerogative and 
administration on hand, and there was little action under either statute. Here we 
note again the chronic Southern colonial habit of depending on the royal bounty, 
across the sea, for the schooling of theiryouth. The petitionary act, in 1696, implored 
“his sacred majesty” to establish a free seminary under the name “‘ King William’s 
School,” and includes details of organization and courses of study. When the income 
of this school should exceed £120 a year another similar academy should be founded, 
so that ultimately there should be a “free school” in each county of the province. 
The result of this effort was the establishment of the school at Annapolis, now known 
as St. John’s College.
-P-A-G-E-732
684 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
For the century preceding the Revolution the colony labored at this plan of a 
“free school” in every county and two colleges on the eastern and western shores, 
to be united in one corporation, under the title, ‘The University of Maryland.” 
A historian of this period speaks of the plan thus: ‘Intention good, machinery per- 
fect, but no moncy is furnished to carry out good intentions.” In 1723 an act ‘for 
the encouragement of learning and erecting schools in several counties within this 
province” was passed. It vested the management of a “free school” in a close cor- 
poration, with a plant of 100 acres of land for the master’s foundation. There were 
then twelve counties in the province. These schools were only to be free of tuition 
to certain numbers of the poor. An effort was made to obstruct the coming in of 
“Trishmen” by a tax of 20 shillings on each immigrant from the Emerald Isle, with 
a 20-shilling tax on each negro imported; the avails of the tax to go to the support 
of the new schools. Here was a more advanced idea of popular education, not only 
as concerned tho better class but also the poor, than in any Southern colony at this 
period. These schools, with the proposed colleges, were all to be free from a sec- 
tarian religious test, either for pupils, teachers, or administrators. 
But the history of education in this province is the record of an almost hopeless 
struggle to obtain the funds for the support of the system. 
After a brief success in developing the two colleges, St. John’s and Washington, 
under one management, the project was abandoned and their public funds finally 
withdrawn and distributed among the counties for the support of the academies. 
Some £10,000 had been gathered as a general university fund and this remained the 
sole educational fund of the State until increased by the appropriation of the surplus 
revenue distributed by the United States Government in 1837. During the forty 
years previous to the war of Independence the effort to keep afloat this system of 
education by the combination of public and private support met with only moderate 
success. The colony was greatly agitated by the internecine conflict between the 
feudal government of Lord Baltimore and the uprising of the Protestant people, and 
a vigorous stirring up had been given by the Puritan contingent that had settled near 
Annapolis after being worried out of Virginia by Governor Berkeley. The result 
was the triumph of the popular cause and the temporary dispossession of the feudal 
proprietor. ‘i 
But one good outcome of this anterevolutionary policy was the final establishment 
of the system of county academies or “free schools,” somewhat resembling the later 
academical system of New England, with a permanent annual subsidy for each of 
$1,200. Up to the close of the civil war, with the exception of the establishment of 
the common school system of the city of Baltimore, this was the nearest approach of 
Maryland to the common school for the education of all. The system had a tenacity 
that has endured till the present day. In 1865, when the State established its pres- 
ent system of cducation, these county academies were brought into the common school 
and, to-day, receive a yearly grant from the educational fund of the Commonwealth. 
But here, as in all the Southern colonies before the Revolutionary epoch, we must 
avoid the hasty conclusion that this portion of the country was the abode of uni- 
versal ignorance, from the lack of facilities for popular education. In all of them, 
in Maryland and South Carolina especially, from the first, there was a decided and 
growing cultivated class, educated abroad, by family tutors, by the clergy of the 
churches; in all ways by which devoted parents, through labors and sacrifices that 
honor our human nature, “train up their children in the way they should go,” and 
wherever there was a church there was a fountain of education in the humblest 
administration of the Christian religion. Of whatever sect or nativity, unless 
absolutely unworthy of his high vocation, the priest, minister, rector, or rabbi was 
forced to be the perpetual schoolmaster of his flock. The reading of the Bible in 
the Protestant churches and homes of the early colonists was in itself a great educa- 
tion, and cut of the deep fountains of spiritual and mental life in the B8ok of Books 
came a growing ambition for larger acquirements and for the power that comes from
-P-A-G-E-733

general culture. And the life of a new country, most of all of the Southern province 
so beset by danger, tried by privations, and agitated by contentions, was a daily 
challenge to deep thought, ready wit, and decisive action. 
So, when the call was heard, Maryland fell into line, and Catholic and Protestant, 
Calvinist and Quaker, were found in patriotic accord; each by his own characteristic 
method contending for the political emancipation of the New World. The Catholic 
Church, which here first established itself in the American colonies, and, to-day, 
maintains its primacy in Baltimore, was always a decided educational power, espe- 
cially among its numerous members of the superior class. In any view of the 
educational condition of the old Atlantic South, even till the close of the civil war, 
practically up to the year 1870, these considerations must be kept in mind for a just 
estimate of the special and united force of colonies and States and as a commanding 
element in the development of the social and public life in the colonies and the nation. 
The neighboring colony of Delaware was originally a border settlement, inhabited 
by a mixed multitude from Sweden, Holland, and other parts, alternately governed 
by the Swedes and Dutch. This mixed population and the rivalry between the 
religious organizations was fatal to any well-considered attempt at a system of gen- 
eral education. The clergy seem to have had the matter a good deal to themselves, 
and there is record of some vigorous and useful teachers among this class, always 
and everywhere the ‘men-of-all-work” in the building up of civilization. As late 
as 1791 Robert Caron, of Wilmington, Del., in a pamphlet entitled ‘A Plea for the 
General Establishment of Schools Through the United States,” speaks with great 
contempt of the country schools of the little Commonwealth. ‘‘The schoolhouses 
are sorry hovels, neither wind nor water tight.” ‘The teachers are largely for- 
eigners, shamefully deficient in learning, and not seldom addicted to gross vices—a 
set of blockheads.” ‘Country schools will remain in the present state of despera- 
tion unless incorporated with Government.” 
All the Southern, in common with some of the Central, colonies suffered from this 
nuisance, the educational tramp, frequently a hbroken-down fellow from over the 
water, wandering from place to place for a chance to teach. In Maryland some of 
the “redemptionists” and people brought over as “indentured servants” were util- 
ized in this way. i 
But the fact that Delaware was the first State to come into the new Union and 
has never been far behind in contributing its share of ability to the public councils 
of the nation proves that here, as elsewhere, the people of the more-favored sort 
were not indifferent to the education of their children, and that in some of the 
numerous ways always open to him who has the will to do a good thing the work 
was accomplished. 
The educators of North Carolina have good reason to protest against the careless 
assertions of some, even of the more eminent writers of the recent school of historical 
literature, for their misapprehension of educational affairs in the old North State 
previous to the Revolution. These writers have fallen into a prevalent habit of the 
Northern common-school educational narrators in testing the intelligence and interes, 
in good learning in an American State, at an early period, by its adoption of a 
scheme of universal education similar to the present American common school. 
Tried by this severe test, there is no question that North Carolina would be remanded, 
with little ceremony, to the limbo of universal illiteracy and social obscurity to 
which she has been assigned, not only by some of the schoolmen of the North, but 
by the upper social strata of its neighboring States, Virginia and South Carolina. 
With few exceptions there is no record of any act for the encouragement of 
education by the colonial legislature of North Carolina, either under the original 
rule of the lords proprietors or the subsequent government by the authority of the 
Crown, from the first permanent settlement of the colony, about 1660, to the Revolu- 
tionary epoch. The first act was a permission to the little town of Edenton to build 
a schoolhouse, a town fence, and other conveniencies for an infant settlement, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-734
686 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
the second for the establishment of a free school, in 1749. As late as 1771, on the 
edge of the Revolutionary outbreak, the colonial legislature chartered Queen’s Col- 
lege, at Charlotte, only to encounter a veto by royal proclamation. The Church of 
England was the ecclesiastical law of the land till the political tie was finally sun- 
dered between the provinces and the mother country. 
One of the royal governors, Gabriel Johnston, a graduate of St. Andrews Univer- 
sity, Scotland, made a vigorous assault on his legislature in behalf of general educa- 
tion, and was replied to, in fair spoken words, but with no further attention to the 
matter. There may have been other spasmodic efforts to galvanize this body into 
some interest for assailing the dense illiteracy beyond question prevailing among 
large sections of the “‘common people” of the colony. - But it is safe enough to say 
that nothing in the nature of a beginning of the American common school, as it 
exists in the State of North Carolina to-day, was attempted or seriously thought of 
in the colony during the one hundred and fifteen years before the famous Mecklenburg 
declaration of independence in 1775 and the skirmish at Alamance, May 16, 1771. 
But, as we again have occasion to suggest, there was no such wholesale neglect 
of education in North Carolina during its colonial era as would be inferred from the 
indifference of its government. For the first sixty years after the settlement in the 
pino woods along the shores of the great Atlantic sounds there was nothing that 
could be called a town. Of course, the spiritual leaders, including the missionaries 
of the Church of England sent over ‘‘to convert the natives,” were very positive 
that all education outside their own particular conventicle was the high road to 
everlasting damnation. No general effort, like that of an active New England com- 
munity, with all its people of one mind on matters of church and state and the need 
of training up the children and youth, was possible in a colony so physically and 
socially dispersed through what must have seemed the outskirts of civilized crea- 
tion. And when, a generation later, the advent of the Scotch and North Irish Pres- 
byterians in another portion of the province woke up the first notable revival in 
behalf of education, it was not probable that the colonial legislature, at the risk of 
a veto from the royal governor or the crown, would hasten to respond to the edu- 
cational spirit of this portion of its constituency, or that the people themselves, 
vigorously pushing their own church life in the face of a hostile educational estab- 
lishment, would accept the patronage of a government in league with a church 
especially hateful to the Presbyterian mind of that age. 
So the educational life of North Carolina during the colonial epoch, such as it 
was, came up with no reference to the present common-school idea of the North 
Carolina of 1896. But, underneath this discouraging surface, to an impartial ob- 
server there was from the first a spirit among the people that brought out North 
Carolina as one of the first of all the fifteen Southern States in the support of a sys- 
tem of public instruction which, at the outbreak of the civil war, promised good 
results. On the coast the educational interest was chiefly among the superior fam- 
ilies, of which there was a reasonable number. These people, like all of similar 
origin and social status in the South from the earliest settlement, were eager to pre- 
serve such heritage of good schooling as they had brought from the Old World. By 
tutorship at home, by gathering family groups of students, by the efforts of the 
clergy, and especially by sending their sons abroad or to the North for education, 
they kept alive the divine hunger and thirst for knowledge and good culture, 
The Hill family, celebrated in the State, was of New England origin, and their 
first representative a graduate from Havard and a schoolmaster. This and other 
families of the Cape Fear section were accustomed to send their boys to Harvard 
College for many years. 
For a hundred years the seacoast region of the colony went on in this way; the 
superior class, by all practicable methods, secured the best education possible under 
such adverse conditions; the masses of the common people were left in a condition 
which may be inferred, looked at from the point of view. of the emphatic words ad-

dressed to the legislature in 1736 by Governor Johnston, concerning their better-off 
neighbors: ‘“‘To what purpose, gentlemen,” says the old Scotch governor, ‘is all 
your toil and labor, all your pains and endeavors for the advancement and enriching 
of your families and posterity, if within yourselves you can not afford them such an 
education as may qualify them to be useful to their country, and to enjoy what you 
leave to them with decency ?” 
It was almost a hundred years from the original settlement before this unsatisfac- 
tory condition of education in the northern colony was changed by the advent of the 
Scotch and North Irish immigrants into a different portion of the province. From 
1736 to 1770 two columns of this Presbyterian host moved upon North Carolina. The 
most numerous was 2 prolongation of the original movement from Pennsylvania and 
New Jersey into northern Virginia and the Valley of the Shenandoah; the other, a 
smaller but no less determined crowd, pushed northward from Charleston, 8. C., 
along the great river highways that, under various local names, flow from the splen- 
did mountain realm of western North Carolina through the lowlands to the far-off 
sea. The majority of these people were of the intelligent, industrious, and progress- 
ive type of tho North Irish and Lowland Scotch; but there were also great numbers 
of Scotch Highlanders, implicated in the rebellion in behalf of ‘‘ Prince Charlie,” 
which went to wreck on the bloody field of Culloden. Out of this immigration came 
the first genuine educational impulse to the colony, and from the ranks of this vig- 
orous population was recruited a long and goodly roll of men, eminent through the 
subsequent history of the State. 
But these people were not yet interested in the common school, in the New Eng- 
land sense. The fact that the colony was still under the ecclesiastical domination of 
the Church of England was reason enough why the fighting brotherhood of the Cove- 
nanter stripe should give the colonial authorities “a wide berth.” It was all they 
could do to build up their own churches in peace and to every church attach a paro- 
chial school. In Scotland, a hundred and fifty years before this period, we find the 
beginnings of what has become one of the most vigorous systems of popular educa- 
tion inthe world. But in Scotland the Presbyterian Church was practically a repre- 
sentative popular government built up by the masses of the people inside the shell of 
intolerant royal and aristocratic rule that only collapsed when the handsome head 
of Queen Mary Stuart rolled off the bloody block in Fotheringay Castle. The Scot- 
tish Presbyterian Church and clergy were but the servants; and the schools, though 
tied fast to a stringent ecclesiastical creed and polity, were the schools of the 
people. But in nearly all the southern American colonies there was a legal or prac- 
tical union of the civil power with the Church of England, of greater or less effect, 
upto the Revolution. In Virginia especially there was little peace for the dissenters 
through the entire colonial life. 
It was inevitable that the whole body of dissenting people, rapidly becoming the 
working majority of the inhabitants, shonld make haste, at the first opportunity, to 
establish schools of their own, each denomination striving to become the rival of all 
others in the number and quality of its academical and collegiate foundations. And 
although these States, in due time, were completely emancipated from the shackles 
of an ecclesiastical establishment, yet the old prejudice held on. The very name 
“public school,” organized, supported, and managed by the State, called up the old 
hateful specter of the colonial governor and legislature in league with the Estab- 
lished Church of Great Britain, and the common school was repudiated. This point 
must be taken into consideration in explaining the hostile attitude of the churches, 
which had been the leaders of popular instruction abroad, to the establishment of 
the American people’s school system, especially in the Southern States. 
But these new immigrants from the land of schoolmasters made haste, in their own 
way, to put on the ground the means of education for their own children. Every 
church, however obscure, had something in the shape of a parochial school. A vig- 
orous body of graduates from Princeton College, New Jersey, already the headquar-   
 
-P-A-G-E-736
688 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
ters of this great and intelligent church, came into North Carolina from Pennsylvania 
and New Jersey or returned to their own homes in North Carolina and began the 
good work of building up schools of the better sort, out of which have since been 
developed some of the most useful academic and collegiate institutions of learning 
in the State. A long roll of these men, afterwards distinguished in all departments 
of the colonial life, is printed in the excellent Circular of Information of the 
- National Bureau of Education on ‘‘The history of education in North Carolina.” 
Among seminaries of this description the best known seem to haye been the 
Crowfield Academy, established in 1760, in Mecklenburg County, which has been” 
called the germ of the present Davidson College. Another celebrated school, for the 
day, was the classical seminary established at Charlotte in 1767; afterwards devel- 
oped into Queen’s College. It was largely patronized from the neighboring counties 
of South Carolina, which were also settled by a similar population. The two efforts 
to obtain a charter for this seminary, as Queen’s College, were defeated by the royal 
veto before the Revolution. But one of the first acts of the new State legislature, 
in 1777, was the incorporation of this flourishing academy, with the republican title 
“Liberty Hall.” 
But the most celebrated of all these colonial schools, in the years approaching the 
Revolution, was that established by David Caldwell, in 1766, at a post near the 
present city of Greensboro. Caldwell was a native of Pennsylvania and a graduate 
of Princeton College. He came, a young man, to North Carolina, as a Presbyterian 
missionary and preacher, and began his educational work as an annex to his church. 
His school became the head and front of the secondary education in the State and 
he the foremost apostle of the schooling of the whole people. Numbers of his grad- 
uates were sent to Princeton and, later, to the new University of North Carolina, of 
which he declined the first presidency in his old age, dying in 1824. It was largely 
owing to him and the energetic group of like-minded men that North Carolina was 
the second State to put into its new constitution a clause under which a State 
university and a system of popular education could be built up. In a dark period 
of the war, in December, 1776, these noble words were written in the fundamental 
law of the Commonwealth: ‘A school or schools shall be established by the legisla- 
ture for the convenient instruction of youth, with such salaries to the masters, paid 
by the public, as may enable them to instruct at low prices; and all useful learning 
shall be duly encouraged and promoted in one or more universities.” So did this 
colony, beginning away down upon the sea sands, in the pine forests of the far- 
away eastern shore—for a century or more contemptuously ignored as a sort of 
“backyard” of its more aristocratic neighbors, Virginia and South Carolina—by the 
intelligence, push, and practical common sense of its ‘‘common people,” so “ forge 
ahead” that it placed itself in line as one of the first common-school States of the 
South seventy-five years before its great northern neighbor would consent to a hearty 
adoption of the educational ideas of Jefferson, Washington, Marshall, Cabell, and 
the group of other distinguished advocates of universal education within her own 
borders. 
To this early and vigorous indorsement of the idea of popular education, under 
the direction of the Commonwealth, must we ascribe the prodigous influence of this 
great State, North Carolina, in the work of colonizing the Southwest. While Vir- 
ginia reproduced herself in Kentucky, to-day the most pronounced representative of 
the old, high conservative type of Southern society, Tennessee, the lusty child of 
North Carolina, has become the most powerful and hopeful Commonwealth of the 
Southwest east of the Mississippi. Perhaps no Southern State has “given itself 
away” so generously in this drift of emigration as North Carolina. Indeed, for 
reasons not very clear until a period subsequent to the civil war, North Carolina 
appears to have spent itself so largely in peopling the new Southwest and the south- 
ern tier of counties in the original Northwestern States, that its progress in home 
affairs had been seriously impeded. The three Presidents of the United States that

hailed from Tennessee were born in North Carolina; possibly, Andrew Jackson over 
the border in South Carolina. But in the later educational revival, not only North 
Carolina but Tennessee, its greater child beyond the mountains, has grasped the 
common-school idea with a remarkable energy, and, in proproportion to its wealth 
and opportunity, supported it more efficiently in some ways than any of its neigh- 
bors of the original Southwest. The ‘graded school” superintendents of these 
States, especially of east Tennessee and central North Carolina, are to-day among 
the ablest public school men in the South; fit descendants of the sturdy old Scotch 
and North Irish Presbyterian parsons and schoolmasters, who at once thrashed the 
“three R’s” and the Latin grammar into the heads and preached the Westminster 
Catechism into the hearts of the rising generation, and fought through the great 
~ war of Independence. The story of the effort of the masses of the white people in 
North Carolina to come to some effective organization of the common school in the 
years before 1860, is one of the most interesting in American educational history. 
It is a significant commentary on the scholastic ideal of popular education in Eng- 
land in the seventeenth century that John Locke, the most eminent philosophic 
thinker of his time, himself the author of a celebrated treatise on the training of an 
English gentleman, should have drawn up a constitution for the colony of South Caro- 
lina containing no reference to the fundamental duty of every civilized State, the 
educational preparation of the children and youth for good citizenship. Such was 
the case, and the visionary theory of the philosopher speedily went the way of all 
schemes of civic and sacred affairs that failed to recognize the common needs and 
deal with the actual conditions of common men. 
In dealing with the early educational affairs of this colony, it is an advantage that 
a recent controversy has brought to the front as favorable a statement of the actual 
achievement of its early settlers in this respect as is possible in the present state of 
historical investigation. In fact, the records of the first thirty years of the colonial 
history of South Carolina are absolutely silent concerning any movement in this 
direction sufficiently important to attract public attention.. The settlement of South 
Carolina occurred in 1670, and the earliest record of public interest of this sort men- 
tions the founding of a school in Charleston in 1712 when, under the patronage of 
the State church, largely by the urgency of the ‘Society for the Propagation of the 
Gospel in Foreign Parts,” a parochial school was founded under a permissive law, 
with some assistance from public money. 
In the year 1883 the Hon. Edward McCrady, jr., of Charleston, S. C., in an elab- 
orate and able address before the Historical Society of South Carolina, took up the 
statement of Professor McMaster, in his History of the People of the United States, 
that, during the colonial period, “in the Southern States education was almost 
wholly neglected, but nowhere to such an extent as in South Carolina, In that 
colony, prior to 1730, no such thing as a grammar school existed. Between 1731 
and 1776 there were five. During the Revolution there were none.” 
In disproof of this declaration, which has been repeated in different historical 
publications, Mr. McCrady labors to show that the colony of South Carolina, before 
1776, was in no senso indifferent to education; was indeed in several respects in 
advance of Massachusetts. In making the latter assertion, he declares that, prior to 
the Revolution, ‘‘there was little or no intercourse between New England and old 
England, while there was a close and constant intercourse between the people of 
South Carolina and the mother country.” He quotes the remark of Hon. Hugh 8. 
Legaré, of South Carolina, that ‘‘as most of the youth of opulent families of South 
Carolina were educated in English schools and universities, there can be no doubt 
their attainments in polite literature were very far superior to those of their con- 
temporaries in the North, and the standard of scholarship in Charleston was conse- 
quently much higher than in any other city on the continent.” He also indorses 
the statement of Dr. Samuel Miller, of the College of New Jersey, that ‘while a 
larger number of Northern youth were schooled in college, the Southern students 
ED 94——44 
 
-P-A-G-E-738
  690 i EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
were more accurate, classical scholars, owing to their opportunities of study abroad.” 
Mr. McCrady claims the establishment of a grammar school in Charlestown, Va., in 
1621, previous to the Boston Latin School. He declares that ‘the schools of New 
England were not common schools, in the present sense of the term, although com- 
prising a greater’ part of the children of the ‘settlement.’” Probably confounding 
the Plymouth with the Massachusetts colony, he asserts that ‘it was twenty-three 
years after the commencement of ‘the colony’” that the first effort to establish a 
public school, by law, was made. The statutes of 1642-1647 were “merely direct- 
ory.” ‘We must not be misled by the idea that the common-school, as we know it, 
or anything like it, existed two hundred and forty years ago, even in Massachu- 
setts.” He also asserts that the colony of South Carolina demanded higher attain- 
ments of her schoolmasters than New England, even in colonial days. 
These statements, on both sides, are but new illustrations of a careless habit of 
writing, by authors on the subject of education, concerning different sections of the 
country. As our account of the origin of the common-school system in colonial 
New York, especially in Massachusetts and Connecticut, disposes of these asser- 
tions of Mr. McCrady, it is not necessary to answer them in detail; or his farther 
statement that, previous to the Revolution, there was no superiority of New England 
over his own State in respect to schools. 5 
When we come to the positive portion of this address, we find much to explain 
the position of the author and certainly enough to show carelessness in Professor 
MeMaster. : 
The key to Mr. McCrady’s view of the situation is found in his statement: ‘It 
must be remembered that the difference between Massachusetts and South Carolina 
on the subject of education was, and always has been, that Massachusetts claimed to 
educate her youth generally, rich and poor, by the public or common school system, 
whereas South Carolina has made no such pretense, but, on the contrary, has always 
relied for the education of her sons more on private schools than on public schools.” 
In short, this earnest South Carolinian, in characteristic style, is looking on the other 
side of the shield from the Northern historian he criticises. From his point of view, 
Mr. McCrady does certainly show that, among the ‘‘opulent classes,” even at. this 
early date, there was a creditable desire for the education of their boys. He shows 
that in no other Southern colony was there such a desire among a portion of the 
well-to-do families, not only to give their sons the best educational advantages 
abroad, but to send them to England for professional studies and general training 
in manners. 
In other words, South Carolina was, in some respects, the most “English” of: all 
the American colonies. To such an extent was this true that, until subsequent to 
the Revolution, spite of the great “opulence” of a large class of its leading families, 
there was no attempt to establish a college, although Virginia had supported Wil- 
liam and Mary for home use for seventy-five years. It is shown that of the 114 
young Americans admitted to the bar in London during the eighteenth century 
South Carolina had 44, while Virginia had but 17. It docs not seem to occur to this 
writer that the chief reason why New England did not send its youth to English 
schools and colleges was the fact that Harvard and Yale were already so well known 
that numbers of English youth were sent to these colonies for education. Both the 
common and grammar schools of New England during this period were largely 
taught by the graduates of the several New England and English colleges. 
But the elaborate and interesting statement of Mr. McCrady shows better than 
any counter statement the source of the educational facilities that certainly did exist 
in South Carolina before the Revolutionary period. There were, according to him, at 
the close of the war, “twenty-two schools in the twenty-four parishes and districts 
into which the State was then divided—11 public and 3 charitable grammar schools 
and 8 private schools of which we know.” Of these, none comes under the head of 
what was then in New England regarded as a common school. They were all sem- 
 
-P-A-G-E-739

inaries established and controlled by the different churches, corporate academies, 
family, personal, private, or society schools. One of the best was the academy at 
Dorchester, established by the colony that came south from Dorchester, Mass., and 
tarried fifty years on the way to its final home in St. John’s Parish (afterwards Lib- 
erty County), Ga. Besides these, there were doubtless other schools of 2 humbler 
sort, as in all the other southern colonies. As they were all tuition schools, most of 
them containing special provisions for the schooling of a few ‘‘poor children,” and, 
as South Carolina at this period contained at least 60,000 white people and a school 
population of not less than 15,000, we must infer that the education of the masses 
of the people was in the fashion of tho time. 
The colony of South Carolina contained from the first a remarkable body of able and 
accomplished people. In the graces of polite living, esthetic culture, and the appre- 
ciation and possession of the regulation style of British social upper-class life, they 
probably excelled the sirnilar class in any other Southern colony. But in the more 
substantial quality of executive public capacity they were greatly surpassed by the 
corresponding class in Virginia; and this difference has been a marked characteristic 
of society in the two States to the present day. ‘The Southwest at the present time 
is swarming with teachers in the secondary and higher schools who hail from Vir- 
ginia; while the superior class in South Carolina has from the first inclined rather 
to the life of the gentleman according to the characteristic British type. That the 
“free schools” of South Carolina were not of the first quality is shown by the rush 
of the more favored youth abroad and Northward, while we must take with some 
allowance the assertion that the average South Carolina students, even from the 
English schools, were, in classical or any other line of scholarship, the superiors of | 
the remarkable body of the Congregational clergy of New England, educated in their 
home colleges, Harvard, Brown, and Yale. 
It is historically correct to give to the colony of South Carolina all the distinction 
that comes from a cultivated society—a class, in some respects the superior of any 
in the country, endowed with a remarkable quality of magnetic personality. But 
this is not what this, essay is chiefly concerned with; although, of course, it is inter- 
esting to note the zeal of the better class of South Carolina in good culture, the 
growth of libraries, the indications of literary, artistic, and scientific interest, so 
well set forth in this able and interesting address of Mr. McCrady. 
Of one fact the author of this circular of information can himseif bear witness. 
This is that several of these South Carolina grammar schools, established before or 
near the period of the Revolution, are in existence to-day, sometimes in connection 
with the present system of common-school instruction, which in its present shape 
was inaugurated by the Hon. Hugh L. Thompson, first State superintendent of 
schools, after the full resumption of civie rights by the people of the State in 1876; 
also, there are in Charleston and several of the smaller cities interesting founda- 
tions of charity, orphan asylums, ete., that date from an early period. It has been 
our pleasure to visit the Mount Zion School, at Winnsboro; the Cheraw Lyceum, and 
the schools at Sumter and Camden, with several of the institutions referred to by 
Mr. McCrady in Charleston. 
It was our special opportunity in 1886, at the invitation of the city authorities, 
in company with Hon. Mr. Coward, State superintendent of education, to visit the 
famous old school of the Winyaw Indigo Society of Georgetown, 8. C., and there to 
meet a relative of Washington Alston, greatest of our early American painters, who 
was a native of this littlecity. As early as 1740 the planters of the Georgetown (S. C.) 
district, a vast region of marsh and upland between thegGreat and Little Pedeo 
rivers, backed by 200 miles of forest, on the borders of North Carolina, established 
a monthly club, to talk over the last news and discuss the progress in the culture of 
the indigo plant, then experimented on in what afterwards became the largest rice 
plantations of the State. By 1753 the club found itself in funds to the extent that, 
on the call of the presiding officer at one meeting, it was decided that a rising vote
-P-A-G-E-740
692 ie EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
should be taken on the proposal to establish a ‘free school”; the affirmative to be 
indicated by draining and turning down upon the table the glass which each mem- 
ber held filled with generous wine. Every glass was emptied and turned upside 
down upon the table, and the Winyaw Indigo Society School sprung at once into a 
vigorous and useful existence. 
For one hundred and forty years this local school had been a great blessing to that 
neighborhood, the sons of the gentlemen of the adjoining country being educated 
there, with a generous provision for orphans. Not a few of the famous men of the 
State are numbered in its reports. But in the course of time the great industry 
of the county, rice culture, was broken up; the region became densely populated 
by negroes, and the town lost a good deal of its ancient importance. 
In 1886, on an educational tour through the State, we learned that the public 
funds for common schools in the county were chiefly monopolized by the colored 
people, and that the white children, many of them unable to attend a tuition 
academy, were in danger of educational destitution. The immediate object of our 
visit with the State superintendent of education was to persuade the members of 
the old club to give their schoolhouse, still a suitable building, and such funds as 
the organization retained to the city as a contribution to the founding of an efficient 
public “ graded school,” to supplement the colored side of the State system. 
We found Georgetown a fairyland of greenery; a verdant island amid the great 
marshes at the mouth of two rivers that here pour their waters into the Atlantic, 
slumbering under the shade of its majestic live oaks, with the most attractive old 
colonial church we had yet seen; a striking reproduction of a fine parish church 
of the old England of a century ago; its cemetery and grounds inclosed in high 
walls and shadowed by overhanging trees. At the rink, the only modern building 
we saw, we talked out the evening hour, facing a most attentive audience; the lead- 
ing white people in the center of the great hall, surrounded and brooded over by a 
mighty crowd of the colored folk gathered in a semicircle behind. Our host was of 
the Alston family and an excellent specimen of a rector of the Episcopal Church, 
compelled to do the work of a bishop of souls through a region, as large as some of 
the United States. On the following day we appeared before the members of the 
Indigo Club, including a venerable gentleman who still rejoiced to have come from 
Boston fifty years before. The eloquent State superintendent surpassed himself in 
his plea for the dedication of the old seminary to the broader uses of a free public 
graded school. We left the same day, but soon after our plan was adopted and, at 
the last account, this community rejoiced in the possession of a suitable arrange- 
ment for the education of all classes and both races, free to all under the law for 
graded village and city schools in the State. 
It will be a most attractive study to note the successive attempts of the people 
of South Carolina to establish a suitable system of public instruction for the masses 
of white children; to note the splendid service of some of the noblest of South 
Carolina’s sons in behalf of the common school; the attempt of several different 
legislatures to put a system in operation, and the causes of failure, until the one 
inveterate and perpetual foe of the American common school, the institution of 
negro slavery, went to its own place in 1865. 
As a companion picture to Mr. McCrady’s glowing representation of the sufficiency 
of the colonial school arrangement for the 60,000 white people of South Carolina, we 
may call attention to the account given in Horry & Weems’s Life of Gen. Francis 
Marion of a remarkable deliverance on education by a most characteristic repre- 
sentative of the ‘‘common people” of this State at the close of the Revolutionary 
war. 
The educational record of the colony of Georgia previous to the Revolution is soon 
presented. In some respects the settlement of the province was fortunate. General 
Oglethorpe was an amiable enthusiast, inspired with a desire to found in a new land 
a refuge for a class of poor debtors for whom there was no hope in England. Around   
-P-A-G-E-741
  PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE COLONIAL PERIOD. 693 
this class, doubtless containing a fair amount of good material, he established a 
group of little communities—Hebrews, Catholics, Highland Scotchmen, New England 
yankees, Salzburgers, Moravians, etc.—each planted on his own territory, separated 
beyond the possibility of immediate hearty cooperation. This cosmopolitan assem- 
blage he proposed to hold together by a form of government that no American 
colony was then willing to live under; which forbade the two luxuries of a new 
society organized in a semitropical country, negro slavery and strong drink. Of 
course the experiment went out in a general wrangle, and both the negro slave 
and plenty of good liquor came in. The colony in due time drifted into the regu- 
lation condition of all things provincial. At the breaking out of the Revolution 
Georgia seems to have been under the administration of a colonial governor so pop- 
ular that, fora time, the movement for independence was arrested and only the 
people in St. John’s Parish, of New England origin, sent a delegate to the first 
Colonial Congress. 
Whatever there may have been of educational spirit in the little separate nation- 
alities of which the new colony was composed during the brief period of its colonial 
existence, the most notable enterprise was the attempt to convert and school the 
Indians by a colony of Moravians, who soon abandoned the work and moved to 
Pennsylvania. Afterwards, George Whitfield, the great Methodist evangelist, who, 
witli John Wesley, made Georgia the scene of some of his most devoted early labors, 
built up the celebrated Bethesda Orphan House. 
The idea was suggested by Wesley in 1737, and taken up by Whitfield in 1740 with 
his usual enthusiasm and energy. He contributed £1,000 for its foundation, a 500- 
acre tract of ground was located 10 miles from Savannah, and a venture; quite beyond 
the immediate means of the zealous founders, was at once made with 24 orphans. 
From this time until the death of the great preacher in Massachusetts in 1770 
Whitfield spared no pains to keep this enterprise before the benevolent people of 
England and all the American provinces. He even went to the length of buying a 
plantation in South Carolina and stocking it with negro slaves to increase the fund 
for the education and training of his white orphans. At the time of his death the 
whole number of pupils and workers on the estate amounted to 150 people, entirely 
dependent on his own efforts. 
At one time Whitfield conceived the idea of elevating the establishment into a 
seminary of the same sort as the Log College of Pennsylvania, from whose original 
inception was finally evolved Princeton in New Jersey. At that time, 1764, he states 
that there was no college south of Virginia, and the new town of Savannah might 
be made an educational center for the adjacent country, Florida, and the West Indies. 
But all things of this sort depended on royal favor, and the powers in England failed 
to see the point and refused the charter. Foiled in this, Whitfield fell back on the 
organization of an academy at Bethesda, and he was at work in New England in 
behalf of this project at the time of his death. 
The demise of the great evangelist was speedily followed by the failure of his 
school of benevolence and education, which had been kept alive by passing around 
his clerical hat on two continents. A series of fires and tornadoes twice leveled the 
building to the ground. Finally, in 1808, the legislature of Georgia settled up the 
affairs of the defunct institution and divided the proceeds among several charitable 
and educational institutions. A peculiar interest attaches to this movement from - 
the fact that here was a project for a college in this distant and feeble colony before 
North or South Carolina had started in this direction. A portion of this fund was 
given to the Chatham Academy, which later became a celebrated school and remains 
to-day as the upper grade of the free public school system of the beautiful and 
thriving city of Savannah. 
But out of this cosmopolitan population of the colony was evolved an energetic 
and executive force, which, in time, has given to the people of Georgia the habit, by 
common consent, of declaring their Commonwealth ‘the Empire State of the
-P-A-G-E-742
  694 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
South.” While very different from other Southern States, it can not be questioned 
that out of this original mixture of intelligent and ambitious people, from the first 
attracted thither, the State of Georgia has grown in industrial and general execu- 
tive ability in a remarkable degree. 
Here we leave the six Southern colonies, at the breaking out of the Revolutionary 
war, nearly equal in population to the remaining seven Central and New England 
provinces. We have noted the differences in their conditions of life, the organiza- 
tion of society, and tho form of colonial government in all, which made it next to 
impossible that more should have been achieved in the direction of popular educa- 
tion than we have found. But we haye shown that, among the superior class of 
them all, there was no special lack of educational zeal in their own behalf, and that 
their opportunities of home, foreign, and Northern training had been so well 
improved that, on the appearance of the general emergency, a group of leaders in 
civic and one supreme commander in military affairs appeared, whose names have 
become household words in the annals of the Republic. 
    RAL AMERICAN COLONIES BEFORE THE REVO- 
LUTION. PoruLar EDUCATION IN THE 
NEW YORK. 
The vast unknown realm between the icy coast of Labrador and Cape Henlopen, 
on the southern shore of Delaware Bay, had been given by the Pope of Rome to 
Spain, and the French had explored and partially occupied the Canadas, when 
Henry Hudson,.an Englishman in the service of Holland, first sailed up the “ great 
river of the mountains” to the present site of Albany, N. Y., in 1609. The habit of 
“claiming the earth,” now the prerogative of every American citizen, three centuries 
ago was monopolized by the emperors, kings, popes, and “high mightinesses” of 
Europe. On the strength of this voyage, the States General of Holland, in 1614, 
gave permission to trade, and in 1621 granted a general dispensation to the Dutch 
West India Company, an association of merchants, to occupy and govern an imperial 
domain. This New Netherlands, in the fertile imagination of this ‘ syndicate,” 
ineluded the whole region between the Connecticut River and the Far West, from 
the St. Lawrence River southward, claiming New Jersey and Delaware, besides all of 
New England below Cape Cod. 
But the French had their own views about the Lake Champlain country. The 
obstinate Yankee struck Plymouth Rock, pushed himself ‘‘out West” as far as 
Springfield, Mass., claimed Connecticut and Vermont, and finally drove the afflicted 
Dutchman within the present eastern boundary of New York. An eminent descend- 
ant of the original occupants in 1861 informed us that ‘‘now the Union was about 
to break up, New York would resume its claim on the whole country west of the 
Connecticut River.” We advised him to study a township map of New England, 
reminding him that each of these little empires had fought over its boundary for 
two hundred years, till their outlines were “(as ragged as a hetchel,” and by the time 
that New York had finished with the first “tier” on the west slope of the mountains 
there would probably be a call for a ‘‘compromise.” 
Gradually, by successive reductions, at the beginning of the century the State of 
New York settled down content with the 47,620 square miles of its present area; an 
extent of 311 miles from north to south, and, including Long Island, 412 miles from 
east to west. And surely the Commonwealth beyond the Berkshires may well be 
satisfied with a State more than two-thirds the size of all New England and incom- 
parably more productive; in all but the absence of coal one of the most favored; 
unsurpassed in varied and picturesque natural scenery; the military strategic point 
of the Northern States between the Atlantic and the Mississippi, according to the 
testimony of Washington, Scott, and Grant. Only through the open gate of the 
Lake Erie shore can the East reach the great West without scaling the uplands of

the Alleghany range, as far south as the lowlands of the Gulf States. The harbor of 
New York is the natural home of the commerce of the Atlantic. From the first all 
things pointed to New York as the Empire State of the New World. 
To-day this magnificent Commonwealth has 6,000,000 people—twice the number of 
the new Republic when Washington was inaugurated in Wall street as first President 
of the United States. Its property valuation is $3,000,000,000. One-third the entire 
population of the State is grouped in what is already known as ‘the greater 
metropolis,” not only foremost as the financial but also as the national center of 
art, music, the drama, journalism, and the periodical authorship, out of which our 
characteristic American literature is beginning to emerge. Here are concentrating 
the most vital interests of the Republic. Both the political parties look to New 
York as the decisive battle ground in thé hard-fought conflict for the Presidency. 
And the burning issue of the final triumph of the American common school over its 
enemies will be achieved where the old Dutchmen sat on Manhattan Island two hun- 
dred and seventy years ago, ‘‘with their gable ends to the street,” imbibing good 
liquor, in the jolly days when one-fourth the houses in New Amsterdam were 
temples dedicated to St. Gambrinus. 
Mr. Emerson used to say that “in America, Old England extends to the Allegha- 
nies and New England begins out West.” But in fact the America of the future, as 
respects the quality and mingling of its people, began in New York. It is true that 
for forty years acolony of Dutch traders and great landowners held the spacious realm 
of the Hudson and eastern Mohawk valleys under the rule of what we now calla 
big syndicate, the Dutch West India Company, in a very indefinite way backed by 
the States General of Holland. Little Holland, during the forty years of the Dutch 
occupation of New York, was the foremost of European nations in respect to wealth, 
skilled industry, popular culture, art, eminent scholarship, and the outward forms 
of free government. But the history of that great people at home is only another 
illustration that no European continental State contains, in its radical social organ- 
ization, the elements of a permanent constitutional republic. In 1709 Dean Swift, 
one of the shrewdest men in Europe, said of the Dutch: ‘‘ They are a commonwealth 
founded on a sudden, by a desperate attempt, in a desperate condition, not formed or 
digested into a regular system by mature thought or reason, but huddled up under 
the pressure of sudden exigencies; caleulated for no long duration, and hitherto sub- 
sisting by accident in the midst of contending powers who can not yet agree about 
sharing it among them.” Society in Holland was feudal in the country; the free 
cities ruled virtually by a powerful aristocracy; the people torn in pieces by the 
bitter contentions of sect and party. Holland to-day is, consequently, the most 
prosperous, intelligent, and contented of the smaller kingdoms of Europe. 
Unfortunately, unlike New England, which represented the most progressive ele- 
ment of England, New Amsterdam represented the least advanced element of Hol- 
land. It was a distant colony, absorbed in trade, controlled by a trading company 
which appointed its governors. The offer of 8 miles of land on each side, or 16 
miles on one side of the Hudson, with an indefinite extension beyond, with feudal 
powers to the owner, developed the patroon, the nearest approach to the European 
feudal lord of the manor that ever lifted his head this side.of the water. After two 
hundred years of vain attempt to grapple with its difficulties, this absurd arrange- 
ment exploded in ‘‘the patroon war” of fifty years ago, the only agricultural rebel- 
jion ever known inthe North. With a fair per cent of respectable personal ability 
and character, an intermittent policy of religious toleration, with a state church and 
a few parochial schools, the history of New Netherlands for forty years is a dreary 
record of petty quarrels between the conipany and the landowners, savage Indian 
outbreaks, with all the adjuncts of an intensely aristocratic society. Not until 
twenty years after the settlement was the little gain of a sort of advisory council to 
represent the people accorded by the tyrannical governors. At last the masses were 
so worn out with this exasperating conflict that they “struck” on the appearance of

a British fleet in 1664, refused to defend the city, and compelled testy old Governor’ 
Stuyvesant to haul down the Dutch flag for ‘unconditional surrender.” 
Had the States General accepted the offer of Parson Robinson to send 400 families 
of Puritans to Manhattan things might have gone faster. Even then the colony was 
known for the mixture of population that made up the 8,000 people encamped on 
this imperial domain. The influence of the better side of Holland really never 
appeared until after the English occupation. Then, goaded into activity by the 
rivalry of the Englishman, Scotchman, Protestant Irishman, Huguenot, Yankee, and 
various other peoples, the superior class of the Holland settlers developed into a 
valuable social, industrial, and political element, largely conservative, with a few 
eminent exceptions, having little part or lot in the making of the New York. 
Already was the keynote of the cosmopolitan civilization which dominated the great 
central region of the old colonies between Virginia and New England struck with the 
change of itsname from Dutch New Amsterdam to English New York. For the next 
one hundred years of British oceupation the old eastern New York slowly plodded 
on, almost in the rear of the colonial procession. The great landowners held to their 
vast estates with a death grip, although the class of smaller farmers was gradually 
developed. North of Albany and west of Schenectady extended the vast, sparsely 
peopled wilderness fought over in the almost perpetual French and Indian wars. 
But the population all the time was becoming more cosmopolitan; and, spite of the 
tyrannical policy of the home government, all the time irritating the people, the 
rule of a great nation like England was a prodigious advance upon the petty worri- 
ment by a testy and narrow syndicate of traders. - Next to Virginia, colonial New 
York was the most aristocratic of the thirteen colonies. Yet the assembly struck 
out at an early day with courage, and a majority of the best people, with an eminent 
leadership, were thoroughly patriotic, and the new State had the distinguished honor 
of witnessing the inauguration of Washington as first President of the United States 
in its metropolis. é 
At the close of the war New York was the fifth State in the Union, in 1780 the 
city and Long Island containing 50,000 and the State 233,000—in the rear of Virginia, 
Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Maryland. Mr. Seward tells a story that at this 
time it was thought New York City might become an educational center, but could 
hardly aspire to the commercial importance of Boston, Philadelphia, and Charleston. 
It is said that the ten leading patriot statesmen of the colony represented ten nation- 
alities. More than that number of languages were spoken on Manhattan Island. 
Even the little frontier village of Utica, with its ninety houses, had nine languages 
on hand. 
The colonial history of New York in respect to education must be regarded from 
the standpoint of this peculiar organization of society and strangely cosmopolitan 
mingling of all sorts and conditions of men. The historian of education in New 
York, Mr. Randall, remarks: ‘‘ Prior to the close of the Revolutionary war and the 
organization of the State government very little general attention seems to have 
been bestowed upon the subject of popular education.” 
There is no reliable foundation for the assumption that the type of limited educa- 
tion found in the New Netherlands during the forty years prior to the English occu- 
pation was anything more than the regulaticn parochial school of the Dutch Reformed 
Church, assisted or modified to a certain extent by such methods as were at hand. 
The careful author of Colonial New York says: ‘‘In New Netherlands education was 
neglected. The first colonists, except the officers of the affairs of the company, were 
laborers, artisans, servants, with a few clerks and tradesmen who had been educated at 
the common schools, but never been within the walls of acollege. Their time belonged 
to others, to whom was left the duty of establishing schools and churches. After a 
while, when the monopolizing grasp of the company was loosed and freemen began 
to immigrate, they were not of the highly educated class, but burghers, merchants, 
and traders, who came to better their fortunes. Of educated men, therefore, few

PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE COLONIAL PERIOD. 697 
but clergymen, lawyers, and doctors came to New Netherlands. Schools were not 
neglected, for where do you find an educated minister of the gospel that you do 
not find a school? But the few ‘ministers of the Word,’ stationed in small settle- 
ments, wide apart, among people mostly struggling for the necessaries of life, could 
not found colleges. They could see that the children of their parishioners were taught 
the rudiments of learning, and could themselves teach the classics when required. 
They could do nothing more.” : 
However general or effective the home or church instruction of children and youth 
might have been, there was nothing corresponding to the present common-school 
system of New York during this period. The Dutch. people of the New York prov- 
ince whose children were actually in the schools had nothing of importance to do 
with their management. The church, the Government, the entire constitution of 
their life, were under the virtual control of powers against which they could at 
best protest, and which practically held on to the last. As late as 1649 ‘‘ The Nine,” 
who represented the popular element in the Government, sent a petition to the States 
General, accompanied by an elaborate remonstrance, against the management of the 
West India Company in the province, in which they demanded the abdication of 
the company and the assumption of power by the home government. Their second 
demand was for “a public school, with at least two good masters.” It was asserted 
that, owing to ‘excessive and most flagrant neglect” by the company, the condition 
of New Netherlands was far inferior to that of New England. Three clergymen were 
demanded for the province, and the youth were to be instructed by good school- 
masters. It was 1652 before burgher government was conceded by the States Gen- 
eral to New Amsterdam, with a reservation of the rights of the West India Com- 
pany. But bluff old Governor Peter Stuyvesant stoutly antagonized all these 
reforms, and at the last was practically deposed by his enraged subjects, who 
refused to defend the town against the fleet of the Duke of York and hailed the 
advent of their new English masters as a benediction. 
There is no good evidence that during the century following, under the adminis- 
tration of the British authorities, things were essentially different. ‘Before 1754,” 
says Smith’s History of New York, published in London in 1757, ‘our schools were 
in the lowest order; the instructors want instruction, and through a long and 
shameful neglect of all the arts and sciences our common speech is extremely cor- 
rupt and the evidence of a bad taste, both as to thought and language, and visible 
in all our proceedings, public and private.” These words, of course, apply to the 
masses of the people for whom any system of common schools would be supported in 
the colony. The superior class, of whatever nationality, would seek education 
abroad or in such ways as the upper strata of any society always engages to furnish 
itself with the chief agency and note of its superiority. In 1710 we hear of the first 
school west of Albany; in 1750, of one in Schoharie; in 1710, of a Latin school in New 
York. In 1755 a Dutch chorister and schoolmaster were imported from Holland, 
who held on until 1773, teaching English and Dutch in the same school. No 
beginnings of the American common school are here, outside of the growing desire 
of an improving people, harassed by Indian and French wars on their borders, 
exasperated by tyrannical governors, and absorbed by the conflicts in which the 
assembly of the colony was involved with the Government. 2 
In 1754 King’s College was established in the little city of New York by voluntary 
contributions of the inhabitants of the province, assisted by the general assembly 
and the dominant ecclesiastical corporation, Trinity Church. A Royal charter and 
a grant of money were obtained and the institution was incorporated under a num- 
ber of trustees, ‘‘governors of the college of the province of New York, in the city 
of New York, America,” with full"power of administration. The president of the 
college was to be a member of the Church of England, and a form of prayer with a 
special petition for the college was enjoined. In 1787 twenty-four gentlemen were 
made a close corporation, ‘trustees of Columbia College,” with absolute power.

  698 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
It should be remembered that in estimating the condition of education in New 
York before the Revolution we are not speaking of the Empire State or the metro- 
politan city of to-day, nor, indeed, of the commonwealth and metropolis that imme- 
diately sprang into a vigorous life under the inspiration of the new Republic. As 
late as 1791 New York was only the fifth State in population of the thirteen. Vir- 
ginia had double and Pennsylvania a fifth more people than it. North Carolina and 
Massachusetts were more populous; Maryland was equal; Connecticut and the new 
Western State of Tennessee were nearly alongside. And during the seven years pre- 
ceding this date the State, then with only 341,000 people, had grown really one-half. 
Its scattered population was hedged in by a vast wilderness north of the southern 
shore of Lake Champlain and the entire country west of the eastern settlements on 
the Mohawk River and the Catskill Mountains. 
But even then was laid the foundation of the present superiority of this great Com- 
monwealth in its mixture of various peoples. At the close of the Revolution it was 
found that the discipline and conflicts ‘for the past two hundred years had welded 
together a people that hereafter would develop on a broader line of civic, religious, 
and social policy than was possible in any one of the eastern or southern shore 
States. z 
But the same cause was all the time a great hindrance to the establishment of any 
effective system of common schools, inaugurated, organized, supported, and supervised 
by the whole people, through the instrumentality of State, municipal, and local goy- 
erument. As late as 1806 there were none save parochial and private schools in the 
city of New York, and the “public-school society” was then formed to care for the 
education of a large number of children already outside the educational charge of the 
various religious sects. In Winterbottom’s View of the United States of America, 
published in London in 1795, we learn that with the exception of Columbia College 
there were eight important academies in different parts of the State, and that the 
legislature had already appropriated gratuities for colleges and academies and 
$150,000 to establish an elementary school within the limits of every 4 miles square 
in the State. 
NEW JERSEY. 
As far as concerns the origin of the American common school, the colony of New 
Jersey, previous to the Revolution, has little to be recorded. The pioneer coloni- 
zation of the province by the Dutch and Swedes; the contention over its early 
government; the frequent transformations through which it passed in 70 years, from 
the attempt to establish the feudal domain of New Albion to the final surrender of 
the province to the Crown; and, beyond all, the almost hopeless variety of its pop- 
ulations, including the most extreme representatives of ‘“ every sort and condition,” 
from the Old Testament type of Connecticut Yankee to the Quaker, the Scotch 
Presbyterian, the easy-going New York Dutchman, and the motley crowd that 
drifted into the villages that afterwards became the important cities of the State; 
all these conditions were unfavorable to the cooperation of the people in any system 
for general education. 
About the year 1688 it is recorded that ‘‘the want of clergymen and schoolmasters 
began to be seriously felt, the population of the province being in the neighborhood 
of 10,000. Although schools and schoolmasters were twice made the subjects of leg- 
islation under the proprietary government before 1700, it is impossible to discover 
from the imperfect records to what extent education was fostered. 
“Tn 1693 the inhabitants of every town, by warrant from a justice of the peace, 
might meet and choose three men to make a rate and establish the salary of a school- 
master for as long a time as they might think proper; a majority of the inhabitants 
to compel the payment of any rates levied and uncollected; the act setting forth 
that ‘the cultivation of learning and good manners tells greatly to the good and 
benefit of mankind.’ This act was supplemented by another in 1695 directing the 
choice of three men in each town to be authorized to select a teacher and the most 
convenient place or places where schools should be kept.”
-P-A-G-E-747
PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE COLONIAL PERIOD. 699 
There was doubtless the usual efiort of the clergy of the many sects in the colony 
to attend to their accustomed work of instruction, but the records are full of the 
lack of clerical power to educate the people. Although the new State in 1790 had a 
population of 185,000, the constitution of 1776 contained no allusion to schools or 
education. The first general law constituting a fund for the support of free schools 
was passed in 1816 and the first distribution of its income was deferred to 1829, when 
an act was passed ‘to establish common schools.” Still, it was not until ten years 
later that the towns were compelled to raise a special sum for education every year, 
and not until 1871 that the schools of the State were made entirely free by a State tax. 
But while New Jersey has been slow in the full development of the American com- 
mon school, there is still reserved for her a distinction not inferior to any Common- 
wealth in the early inauguration of one of the most influential centers of the higher 
education in the Union and, through its graduates, the exertion of an influence on 
the general educational development of the Atlantic Southern States second to 
no other. In the carlier years of the eighteenth century, through the zeal of the 
Scotch Presbyterians, then becoming numerous in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, 
was founded the first “log college” by Dr. Tennant, on the Neshaminy Creek, Bucks 
County, Pa., which was the pioneer of the College of New Jersey, now known as 
Princeton University. 
The College of New Jersey was established in 1738 by the labors of Jonathan 
Dickinson; first chartered in 1746 and again in 1748, and in 1752 located at Prince- 
ton. Although never since the Revolution in any vital sense connected with the 
State government, and although, with the exception of a few insignificant gifts, it 
has never received a dollar of its bounty, it has been as certainly identified with that 
Commonwealth as Harvard with Massachusetts or Yale with Connecticut, and is the 
fourth of the illustrious series—Harvard, William and Mary, Yale, and New Jersey. 
Of its great services to the cause of American education from its earliest foundation 
it is unnecessary to speak. It is introduced here to give point to the interesting 
fact of the great impetus given by it, in its earliest days, to the cause of popular 
and secondary schooling in the Southern States. 
The history of education in Virginia and the two Carolinas bears decisive tes- 
timony to the great uplift to these colonies from the advent of the Presbyterian 
population in the Piedmont region at various periods before the Revolution. In 
Virginia it appeared through their settlements in the northeast and the Valley of 
the Shenandoah; in North Carolina in the prolongation of this immigration through 
the beantiful upland county that separates the lowland region of the coast from the 
sublimity of its western wilderness; in South Carolina, in the northwest corner, 
whence many of the most eminent men have come, and which is still one of the most 
progressive portions of the State. Into these sections this population, chiefly of 
Seotch and North Irish origin, poured in asteady flood. Their descendants at a later 
date pushed on to people the new Western States of Kentucky and Tennessee. No 
better population could have been found for the building of an intelligent, steadfast, 
and progressive colony. Scotland had already, for half a century, enjoyed a system 
of public education not inferior to any in Europe, and was destined to send forth a 
steady procession of emigrants that have made their mark in every civilized land, and 
everywhere led the assault on despotic power. 
But the most notable fact of all was the great Scotch Presbyterian crusade against 
ignorance. With the founding of every Presbyterian church in the colonies and 
States there was set up something that took the place of a school. Its clergy from 
the first, like the ministers of the New England Congregationalists, were a body of 
educated men. As soon as the first local “log college” was established students 
began to, throng it from the Southern as well as the Northern provinces. With the 
establishment of the College of New Jersey in the first half of the eighteenth century 
a larger number were attracted to its opportunities. We have already mentioned the 
great obligations of the clergy of North Carolina to its graduates, not only from that 
province, but to eminent men like Caldwell, who emigrated from Pennsylvania. 
     
-P-A-G-E-748
700 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
Later the educational movement in Kentucky and Tennessee, especially at Nash- 
ville, was inaugurated by Dr. Lindsay, whose work still remains in connection with 
the Peabody Normal School in that city. 
The schools established by this body of graduates were of the parochial church 
order, and the secondary and higher education was all in direct or indirect connec- 
tion with the Presbyterian Church. But underneath the Presbyterian ecclesiastical 
polity as it originated in Europe, just as in the Congregational polity developed in 
New England, was the fundamental assertion of the right of the people to control 
the entire organization. The Presbyterian polity is no fixed establishment, but a 
representative organization, at any time capable of reconstruction or of great alter- 
ation by the Christian people who constitute the church. At first, the Presby- 
terians, like all dissenting bodies, had scant welcome in the Southern colonies, all 
of which were, directly or indirectly, under the Church of England. Hence the 
inevitable prejudice of this people against every school in the most remote way 
implicated with the Church of England, which had been the deadly foe of the kirk 
at home. In New Jersey and Pennsylvania, owing to the more liberal ecclesiastical 
atmosphere, this obstacle to popular education was not so formidable, although even 
here, a serious impediment, delaying the establishment of the complete American 
system for many years. But the result was that a general habit of educating all 
children at that time supposed to be capable of education was formed in those por- 
tions of the colonies which were thus settled, and where still are found the best 
fruits of the great revival of popular instruction during the past twenty-five years. 
In its own way, the College of New Jersey at Princeton has been a great nursery 
of eminent men in all departments of the colonial and national life. In its triennial 
catalogue we find the names of 1 President and 3 Vice-Presidents of the United 
States; 3 signers of the Declaration of Independence; 26 members of the Conti- 
nental Congress; 8 members of the convention that formed the Constitution of the 
United States; 22 governors of States; 112 judges of the Supreme Court of the 
United States or different States of the union; 50 Senators of the United States; 160 
Members of the National House of Representatives; 400 names of men occupying 
the highest places in the gift of the people, powerful and influential because of their 
education within its walls. In this college twenty years ago there had been grad- 
uated 900 ministers of the gospel; 220 presidents, professors and teachers in colleges; 
450 doctors and professors of medicine. So has New Jersey vindicated her good 
faith in the American idea of educating the children and youth of the Republic for 
that mental and moral.manhood which is the central idea of good American 
citizenship. 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
The first permanent settlement in Pennsylvania was by the Swedes in 1638. In 
1655 this community passed under the control of the Dutch, only to fall in 1664 
under the government of England, which had already superseded the brief control 
of the States General over the entire region from the Connecticut River in New 
England to the Delaware in Pennsylvania. In 1681 William Penn obtained from 
Charles II a charter for the territory west of the Delaware River, including 3° of 
latitude by 5° of longitude, and later for the whole of York, an additional part of 
which is now the State of Delaware. In 1682 he came to his vast domain and 
endeayored to establish an ideal government, combining a feudal arrangement of 
public affairs, the principle of Quaker nonresistance, and a theory of popular educa- 
tion whose logical application would certainly have destroyed the structure of the 
society of which his schools were a vital part. 
From this period to the breaking out of the Revolutionary war the colony of 
Pennsylvania in many ways was unfavorable soil for the growth of any persistent or 
practicable scheme of common education. The great fertility of the country, the gen- 
eral spirit of religious toleration by the Penn government, and the early peaceful 
 
-P-A-G-E-749

relations with the Indian tribes that were first encountered by the settlers on the 
eastern border account for the rapid. growth of population. The little group of 
possibly 2,000 people in 1682, of several nationalities, had increased and multiplied 
to 434,000 in 1787. During this entire period the colony was in a state of perpetual 
conflict. The original government of Penn, an impracticable and illogical ideal of 
feudal democracy, gave way to the rule of the proprietors and the Crown with endless 
complications. Half a dozen different nationalities flocked thither—Swedes, English, 
Scotch, Welsh, and Irish, with one-third the population in 1790 of German extraction. 
All were in a state of devoted allegiance to their respective ecclesiastical polities, 
and none of these, save possibly the Methodist, had any place for a system of unsec- 
tarian public schools for ‘all orders and conditions” of people. The colonists on the 
western slopes of the Alleghanies were exasperated by their exposed condition and 
in constant peril from the fighting Indians. Parkman, in his history of the con- 
spiracy of Pontiac, declares that the peaceful plan of William Penn in dealing with 
the Indians was effective because on the eastern border he only encountered the 
remnants of conquered tribes that had been subdued by the Six Nations in the north 
and compelled to bear the humiliating title ‘Old Women,” and that as soon as the 
immigrants approached the mountain realm of western Pennsylvania the real fight- 
ing Indians appeared—the same that have confronted the people of every State from 
the beginning to the present day. However this may have been, the neglect of the 
legislature to provide for the defense of the exposed settlers on the western border 
continued for fifty years, and the colony itself was saved from impending anarchy by 
the wisdom and tact of Benjamin Franklin, who stands up as the great peer aa 
of the new Commonwealth through long years to come. 
William Penn himself entertained broad and rational ideas of education, as his 
published writings and plans for the development of schools in his new domain bear 
witness. But like many a political theorist and social reformer who has drawn up 
the plan of an ideal community, he found himself confronted by conditions that 
placed a speedy veto on the logical application of his own scheme to actual affairs. 
His ‘‘Frame of Government,” prepared in 1682 at home, provides that ‘the governor 
and council shall erect and order all public schools and encourage and reward the 
authors of useful sciences and laudable inventions in the said province”; that a 
“committee of manners, education, and arts” shall take cognizance of the life of the 
young, that they may grow up in “virtue and useful knowledge and arts”; also 
that ‘all cZildren in the province of the age of 12 years shall be taught some 
useful trade and skill.” On leaving England he charged his wife ‘to spare no cost 
in the education of his own children.” He saw clearly that the stability of govern- 
ment depends on the intelligence, industry, and virtue of the young, and in his “ Pre- 
cepts and Maxims,” are found ideas far in advance of his age for the management 
of schools and the advancement in learning. But the fact that all these enlightened 
opinions, including his theory of religious liberty and nonresistance, were found 
under the same broad-brimmed hat that covered the head of a great English feudal 
lord and friend of King Charles II is proof that practical statesmanship was not the 
forte of the great Quaker whose name and fame are still cherished as the most pre- 
cious heirloom of the great Commonwealth that bears his name. 
It was at once apparent that these broad ideas of education could not be applied 
in the new colony. Although the “Frame of Government” enacted by the general 
assembly assumed that all people could read the published laws, and declared that 
one-third the provincial council, with the governor, should take under its charge the 
educational affairs of the State, and although in 1683 a statute similar to the New 
England law of 1642, respecting the duty of parents and guardians to instruct their 
children, was passed, yet this law was rejected by the home Government. It was 
reenacted in 1693 only henceforth to be relegated to “innocuous desuetude” for all 
coming time. 
       
-P-A-G-E-750
  702 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
The chief result from this law was the establishment of a few parochial schools 
of the Quaker persuasion in Philadelphia. The first schoolmaster was brought from 
England to establish an elementary school in 1683. The city,council of Philadel- 
phia, by the advice of Penn, was encouraged to set up a “public grammar school,” 
supposed to be the origin of the ‘Friends’ Public School,” now known as “The 
William Penn Charter School.” It was, like the first Dutch school in New 
Amsterdam, a paroehial school, under the charge of a close corporation, encouraged 
and assisted somewhat by the public authorities. It was of the higher secondary 
grade, including in its plan a group of a dozen or more charity schools, which are 
existing at the present day. But it is not certain that the ideas of Penn extended 
beyond a scheme of church education, subsidized by a government in the hands 
of his own religious denomination. If it were broader than this, it was soon found 
impracticable to do more than, in this preliminary way, to encourage the founding 
. of this type of schools. The eminent historian of education in Pennsylvania, Dr. 
Wickersham, says: 
“The advanced educational opinions of the founder of Pennsylvania and his 
immediate followers do not seem to have been established or acted upon by those 
who succeeded them in the management of the affairs of the province, for little 
affecting the interests of education can be found on record emanating from either 
the proprietors, the governors, the provincial council, or the general assembly from 
Penn’s time on to the breaking out of the Revolutionary war. The first quarter 
of the eighteenth century was almost a perfect blank, so far as anything was done 
by the public authorities to provide an education for the people. Indeed, the last 
charter of privileges, granted by Penn himself in 1701, which continued in force 
until the adoption of the Constitution of 1776, contained no section or clause relating 
to education. The provisions in the earlier charters in regard to the establishment 
of public schools were omitted, and the laws based thereupon seemed consequently 
to have died out.” 
“With a few legislative resolutions, none of which were in the direction of the 
common-school idea, the historian of the colony may be dismissed from the consid- 
eration of education for well-nigh a hundred years.” 
In fact, the same conditions of population which in New York contained the origi- 
nal elements of the splendid cosmopolitanism that is now characteristic of American 
civilization were even more marked in Pennsylvania. Therein was hidden the proph- 
ecy of a great future, but only after a long and bitter conflict could the elements 
be adjusted in a Commonwealth competent to do any good thing by the common con- 
sentof the governed. It will be only after many years that the advance gnard of 
the grand army of the American people, compacted of all the stronger elements of all 
the civilized nations, will appear on the field like the head of a column emerging 
from a wilderness, 
But, meanwhile, the educational observer who jumps tothe conclusion that because 
of this neglect of educational affairs by the public authorities, the colony of Penn- 
sylvania must be remanded to the barbarism of illiteracy, and that it came up to 
the union of the old thirteen colonies in a state of gross private and public ignorance, 
will make a capital mistake.. No colony in America included in its ante-Revolution- 
ary immigration a greater amount of industrial energy and personal worth, or con- 
tained better materials for the schooling that was biding its time. Abandoned by 
their distracted government, these various peoples fell back, each on its own reserved 
energy and intelligence, and after a fashion of its own did provide for the training 
of its own children and youth. 
The Quakers went their own way with intelligent persistence. As a body, they 
were a superior folk, although some of their leaders were doubtless hostile to edu- 
cation of the popular type and under the control of the people. The chronicles of 
Pennsylvania bear testimony to the persistent efforts of these good people in this 
direction. Not only did they provide in their churches for the instruction of their
-P-A-G-E-751
  PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE COLONIAL PERIOD. 703 
own children, but their charity schools for the poorer white, and even for the negro» 
youth, were conspicuous among the churches of the country. In proportion to their 
nunbers, it is doubtftl if any religious body in the United States has done more 
charitable educational work than the Friends. These early schools grew, in time, 
into several excellent seminaries and colleges that, to-day, maintain a high rank 
among the institutions of this and other States. It was largely to the early training 
of their youth that these people owe their remarkable industrial and financial pros- 
perity and the civic and social respectability which has made Philadelphia one of. 
the most notable metropolitan cities in the world, and one of the most acceptable 
for the residence of workingmen. 
The advent of the Germans in the colony of Pennsylvania was the beginning of a 
great influx of this people, which has exerted a powerful influence in the Republic. 
As early as 1741 the Moravian brethren in London formed a society for the education 
and conversion of the Indians in America. The Lutheran churches in Germany were 
also pushing in the same direction. In 1746 Pastor Schlotter, of Switzerland, of the 
German Reformed church, appeared in the colonies, and after laboring a few years 
returned to Europe to make known the needs of his people. The London Society 
for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts was stirred up by the representa- 
tion of the forlorn state of the people in respect to ignorance and destitution of 
religious opportunities. A fund of $100,000 was raised and a board of managers was 
appointed to act in some useful connection with the proprietary government of 
Pennsylvania for the promotion of the good cause. In this board of directors in 
1754 appears the name of Benjamin Franklin, the great industrial and educational 
schoolmaster, not only of Pennsylvania, but of the Northern colonies, a school- 
master ‘of all work,” without whom the people would never have been brought to 
the point of following the lead of Washington and Jefferson from the year of 
rebellion in 1776 to the formation of the new Republic in 1788. Schools were estab- 
lished in many localities; a printing press was set up; a newspaper, tracts, school- 
books, and other documents were published, and the education of girls was included 
in the plan of the managers. . But this movement, like the original plan of William 
Penn, ran against the obstinate hostility of the mass of the people for whom it was 
devised. The clergy were alarmed; the people were opposed to learning the English 
language; local magnates saw in the movement a device for the suppression of their 
own petty authority. The opposition was encouraged by the reluctance to enter 
into any general system of schools by the influential families. So, with all these 
efforts, there seems to have been at no time more than 1,000 pupils under instruction. 
In 1760 there were only 440 under instruction, and in 1763 the experiment died a 
natural death. 
The Episcopalians, Catholics, and Presbyterians in the colony, in the same way, 
struck out, each according to its own distinctive plan of parochial schools. But no 
scheme of church parochial instruction has succeeded in our country except under 
very peculiar conditions and for a brief period in educating the people. It was only 
successful in Scotland as long as the influential mass of the Scotch people were of one 
mind in ecclesiastical affairs. The immigrating people from the Scotch and north of 
Treland Presbyterian stock became a great power in building up a superior education 
in Pennsylvania. Indeed, Pennsylvania and New Jersey became the headquarters of 
these people, and from their habit of coupling an elementary school with every 
church and the preference of their people for an educated ministry came, as we 
have already shown, the most important results, not only in the Central, but in the 
Southern and, later, the new Western States of the Union. The great native wealth 
of the mineral lands of Pennsylvania, with the western slope beyond the Alleghanies, 
fell largely into the hands of this prudent and progressive people, and, years before 
the State could agree on any general system of education for the whole, this body of 
immigrants were at work, earnestly ‘training up their children in the way they 
should go.” We have already called attention to the good results of the remarkable

colony from Connecticut in the valley of Wyoming. New England, in the language 
of Washington, was always ‘spreading itself,” and wherever it secured a foothold 
testified to its unshaken faith in universal education. 
Below and outside of all this work of the different churches was the informal 
action of the people themselves. In the border land, which included much of Penn- 
sylvania till long after the Revolution, this was the most potent influence in awaken- 
ing the desire for an established system of common schools. Through the wide 
spaces of this extended territory were scattered little groups of children, gathered 
in neighborhood schools, organized and cared for by the parents, often taught by 
traveling teachers. Of course there was a great deal of crude and almost useless 
work going on in these little centers of primary schooling. But among the best 
uses of any common-school system is the education of the families of the children 
and youth through their care for it. And here was generated, in this work of caring 
for the details of school life among a great multitude of the “common people” of 
this new State, the spiris that stood behind Thaddeus Stevens and his coadjutor half 
a century later in the desperate conflict for the rights of the children. 
This great diversity of religious organization and the ecclesiastical polity of allthe 
denominations, which for almost two centuries postponed the establishment of a com- 
plete system of common schools in Pennsylvania, had its compensation somewhat 
in the vigorous efforts of the clerical leaders of each of these great bodies of the 
people to build up the secondary and higher education. It would be interesting, 
were it the object of this essay, to follow out the lines of this energetic policy 
which, a century ago, made Pennsylvania the center of so much that is valuable in 
this department of education. The special interest that attaches to the labors of 
two of these denominations—the Moravians, from Germany and Switzerland, and the 
Presbyterians, from Scotland and the north of Ireland—may now briefly be noted. 
From the Moravians came the establishment of a central school as early as 1739, 
from which has grown up a system of educational institutions of all kinds, whose 
central point is the village of Bethlehem, Pa. The Moravian Brothers, organized as 
followers of John Huss, at their beginning developed that special zeal and capacity 
for education which has made their name distinguished in proportion to their num- 
bers. One of their eminent bishops was the famous John Amos Comenius, the 
fountain head among the moderns of that method of pedagogic science which, as 
further illustrated in the teachings of Pestalozzi, Froebel, and a growing multitude 
of educational reformers, has found in our country its most enthusiastic popular 
reception and has now become the ideal of every superior common school. It is a 
forcible illustration of the characteristic habit of always reaching out through the 
world for the highest aids in education that, in the latter half of the seventeenth 
century, Comenius was invited to the presidency of Harvard College, Massachusetts ; 
in the quaint language of Dr. Cotton Mather, ‘‘To come over into New England and 
illuminate this college and country in the quality of president.” That he did not 
accept this invitation seems almost a national calamity, since it condemned our own 
land to a wearisome pilgrimage of one hundred and fifty years, out of the lowlands 
of the mechanical and empirical school keeping, up to the inspiration of half a 
century ago through the introduction of the methods of the new education by Horace 
Mann and the splendid body of his associates, even more powerfully renewed in the 
generation since the close of our civil war. 
The Moravians first appeared in Georgia in 1735 as missionaries to the Indians, but, 
soon discouraged by the small results of the venture, were attracted by the religious 
toleration of Pennsylvania to that colony, where they arrived, under the leadership 
of Peter Beker, at Germantown, in 1739. On his passage he found the great Methodist 
preacher, George Whitfield, who proposed the establishment of a school for negro 
youth. A tract of 5,000 acres was purchased and located in Northampton, held on 
condition of paying a red rose in June in each year forever. That red rose was a fit 
emblem of the perpetual blessing that has blossomed out from this original plant of

the tree of knowledge in the wilderness of Pennsylvania. Out of it came, in due 
season, schools at which were introduced many of the improved methods of the great 
bishop teacher, Comenius—in many portions of the State elementary schools for 
children, coeducational seminaries, and schools for negroes and Indians. Many of 
the European peculiarities of this Moravian community have been dropped, but their 
great institutions ot learning at Bethlehem, Nazareth, and Lititz, Pa., with the famous. 
seminary for girls at Salem, N. C., still attest the persistence and wisdom of their 
educational policy. These schools at different times have attracted large numbers of 
students from all sections and every part of the Union. Indirectly they have con- 
tributed to the full adoption of the common school, for nowhere is the great work 
of Comenius at present more honored than in the New World, hardly recognized as. 
existing in his ‘‘orbis pictus.” 
Even more powerful and extended was the influence of the Presbyterian people, 
who began coming to Pennsylvania soon after its settlement from Scotland and the 
north of Ireland, and to-day constitute one of the most important elements of its 
composite population. At once these little presbyteries in imitation of the home 
custom, established parochial schools, but soon the desire for an educated ministry, 
also inherited from the home example, stirred the waters for an education of a higher 
grade. The ‘Log College,” established by Rey. Mr. Tennant at Neshaminy, Bucks. 
County, was only a frontier log cabin 20 by 20 feet. But here for twenty years this. 
persistent son of old Ireland trained a group of earnest students and made it the colo- 
nial cradle of the collegiate, academic, and ecclesiastical seminaries that now rank 
second to none in the Union—Princeton University, New Jersey; Jefferson, Pennsyl- 
vania; Hampden Sydney, Virginia; Union, New York, and others only less celebrated. 
A stout volume might be filled with the catalogues of the numerous schools of the 
higher grade in all parts of the Union which date from this humble day of ‘first 
things” in the wilderness of Pennsylvania. . No body of the American people has 
contributed more powerfully to all the elements of our nationality—patriotism in 
war, intelligence and probity in citizenship, persistent industry by the most advanced. 
methods, social morality, and practical religion. 
From all these individual developments of school life, perhaps more effective from. 
the sharp rivalry of sect, nationality, and social caste, was slowly evolved the grow- 
ing body of the superior strata of Pennsylvania people, which for half a century 
was trained in such a university as was vouchsafed to no other American colony— 
the colonial life and labors of Benjamin Franklin. Nothing so fully proclaims the 
strange oversight of American written history as the fact that only within the past 
twenty-five years has the story of the educational training of the old North, under 
Benjamin Franklin, and, later, of the more recent South, under Thomas Jefferson,, 
been accounted worthy even of ‘‘brief mention.” It is just being understood by our 
thoughtful people that we are more indebted to the educational influences repre- 
sented by these two men than to any other cause. Both Franklin and Jefferson were 
less abundantly endowed with a special outfit of executive ability in the ordinary 
routine of statesmanship than several of the leaders of that eventful period, although 
both succeeded in ‘diffusing themselves” as an irresistible motive power through 
the entire body politic. But without the educational labors of Franklin during the 
fifty years previous and of Jefferson for almost half a century following the estab- 
lishment of the National Government, even Washington would have failed in his. 
magnificent leadership, having no reliable people to lead ; and the South would 
have lost that uplift of enthusiasm for the secondary and higher and the aspiration 
for universal education which, more than all other influences, saved it from being 
destroyed by ‘the peculiar institution” which came so near achieving the separation. 
of the Union in 1860-1865. 
In this great education of the colonial people of the North Franklin began his: 
work by the establishment of himself as a printer in the little city of Philadelphia 
at the age of 23. His great educational work was well begun before Thomas Jef-

ferson was born; and before the writer of the Declaration of Independence ‘had 
made the first announcement of his comprehensive educational policy to Virginia, 
the work-of Franklin was virtually accomplished. To record the steps inthis series 
of great labors, which became a true university of ‘the people of the Northern -colo- 
nies from 172) to 1776, aperiod of more than forty-five years.of this, in-some respects 
most remarkable of American men, ‘fitly called “a born teacher of men, ranking 
among the most distinguished moralists who have ever lived,” is all the limits of 
this essay will permit. ; 
In 1729, on ‘his return from London, where his real manhood «was sprouted, ho 
opened his printing office «nd speedily led the profession ‘in ‘the colonies. The 
first newspaper of any ability, the Penusylvania Gazette, was ‘hiscreation. At 26 
he organized the first subscription library, ‘‘the mother of all the North American 
subscription libraries.” In 1782: he began the publication of Poor Richard’s Almanac, 
asort.of annual people’s magazine of practical information, wit, wisdom, and good 
culture to the masses of the colonial people. This.continued twenty-five years, ¢ir- 
culated 10,000-copies a year, and is rightly called ‘‘one of the most important publi- 
cations in the world, the revered and-popular schoolmaster of a great nation during 
its period of tutelage.” In ‘that and his journal he organized the present-system of 
business advertising. This unique publication is descriped by its author in these 
words: “‘Not a tenth part of the wisdom was my own, ‘but rather the gleanings that 
Thad made-of the science of all ages and nations.” But here Franklin becamethe 
father:of American journalism, that powerful influence which, in our day, has become 
‘the people’s high school and the modifier and complement of all American institu- 
tions and agencies for the mental and religious training of the citizen. The Junto 
Club, a'small secret organization of the foremost young men of Philadelphia, meet- 
ing to discuss and inaugurate schemes of public: benefit, was the prolific parent of 
numbers of similar-organizations, and is being revived to-day in the association of 
influential citizens for the reform and direction of our distracted municipal ‘life. 
Becoming postmaster of Philadelphia, and afterwards Postmaster-General of the 
colonies in 1737, at the age of 31, he was inspired with the worthy ambition of the 
most entertaining of modern English novelists, Anthony Trollope, to establish a post- 
office in reach of every family, thus bringing the people of the colony in touch with 
one another by a regular dissemination of news. Meanwhile he had not forgotten 
the good push of the old Latin school in Boston, in which ‘he was for a little time a 
student. He learned all the medern languages then taught, and was rapidly gaining 
the reputation for scientific obscrvation that brought him, wself-edueated boy, to the 
high distinction of a degree from Harvard and Yale and attracted the attention of the 
greatestuniversities of the world. Atthe age of 30 he was the moving spirit of thenew 
“Philosophical Society,” and was especially interested in investigation and experi- 
menting in the directions of the natural sciences, agriculture, and manufactures. 
Along with these labors, all touching-on the most vital educational influences of a 
new country, went-a-series of ingenious‘and valuable corresponding movements in 
public, municipal, and domestic life—the invention of the Franklin stove, the organi- 
zation of the-fire ‘brigade, the night watch, and the city hospital. There seemed 
to be nothing-on which this master spirit of the early American life did not lay his 
hands. Everywhere ‘his ideas of the training of the mind went hand in ‘hand with 
that practical education ‘in religion and morality which he always declared ‘the 
foundations of all successful human-existence. 
Meanwhile he cooperated heartily with the effort to-establisha scheme of common 
education for the rapidly increasing ‘German population of the colony, and sug- 
gested its most useful and practical feature, the setting up of a printing press, the 
publication of a newspaper, schoolbooks, and many useful pamphlets. But even ‘ho 
was not strong enough to resist the conservatism-of the clergy of this people and the 
effort came to naught, with the later enterprise of the Franklin‘College for Germans, 
at Lancaster. It was only through these trials and sacrifices, just beginning to be

appreciated, that this hostility to the common schooling of all American children for 
a common citizenship has been overcome in Pennsylvania, even in these later years. 
But the most notable educational scheme inaugurated by Franklin was the estab- 
lishment of the “Academy and Charitabie School of Pennsylvania,” in 1743. In 
1749 this infant enterprise was initiated by a board, of which Franklin was the 
chairman. A pamphlet, entitled ‘‘Proposals relating to the education of the people 
of Pennsylvania,” was one of the earliest and still remains one of the ablest eduea- 
tional documents prepared in America, It develops, with great clearness and wen- 
derful common sense, an ideal of a seminary ef learning, remarkable for that day. 
His ideas of a suitable loeation, of school buildings, methods of instruction and use 
of apparatus, the advanced idea that the “rector should be a correet, pure speaker 
of the English tongue,” drawing, clegant writing, instruction in English, ete., were 
the nearest approach to the most approved way of instruction by eur present system 
of ‘language lessons.” The training of the voice in elocution and debate; the 
thorough study of the classic and modern languages, without neglect of the mother 
tongue; a broader study of the natural sciences than prevailed anywhere in America 
at that time; the constant regard to moral discipline and correct living by the 
students; the annex of charity schools, which, beginning in the Friends’ School, con- 
tinued til] 1876 a feature in the present University of Pennsylvania—all ‘these were 
‘set forth in this early programme of the secondary and higher education, not sur- 
passed in any subsequent publication in the country. 
The reasons assigned for the establishment of this school ina later appeal to tho 
city council of Philadelphia were (1) the necessity of educating American children 
at home; (2) that a larger class could be trained for the growing duties of public 
life; (3) that the present type of common-school teachers could be superseded by a 
body of trained scholars and respectable young men; (4) that the people themselves, 
of different nationalities and classes, could be fused ina commen citizenship; (5) 
that the city which originated such an institution would greatly profit by it in all 
ways. 
Founded bya combination of public and municipal contributions, placed under 
the control of a corporation representing various sects in religion, Franklin him- 
self elected as “‘an honest man of no sect,” the school was chartered in 1753 as an 
academy, and in 1755 by the provincial assembly with the three departments of , 
charity school, academy,and college. At once it received 300 students; in 1763, 400, 
one-third in the college department, many from the South and the West Indies, with 
asprinkling of Indian boys. Dr. Williai Smith was the first president, and remained 
in this position till the college was developed into the University of Pennsylvania at 
the close of the Revolutionary war. The indefatigable president raised $30,000, and 
is said to have added $100,000 to the funds of the new institution. The medical 
department, established in 1765, was the earliest of all schools of medicine in the 
Union. Tho law school came later. The college lost its charter and property dur- 
ing the tumult of the war, but emerged at the formation of the euuee in 1789 
with more than its usual prestige. 
Much of this valuable service of Franklin was rendered before the birth.of Thomas 
Jefferson and much during Jefferson’s school days. At the age of 44 Franklin, the 
great American ‘man of all work,” retired from private business, ostensibly for lit- 
erary leisure, but only to step out and up into the broader sphere of activity which 
landed him in the Colenial Congress at the age of 70, in many respects the most 
remarkable contribution of the colonial life to the new Republic. 
It is impossible to estimate the intensity of the influence of such a man.atisuch a 
critical period of the development ofa people. Dr. Franklin was the splendidcarly 
contribution of New England to the life of the Central American colonies. He rep- 
resented not the original Puritan influence that had wrought out the essential ele- 
meuts of the native civilization, but that broader clement of cosmopolitanism in 
on, government, society, and education, without which all other gifts would

have remained the special possession of a few prosperous provinces and not the char- 
acterization of an American civilization. Old England, with all its obstinacy and 
conceit of private personality and narrow and involved habits of life, has given to 
the modern world a group of the broadest-minded leaders of the race. In the same 
way New England, with a large body of its home-loving class so immersed in mak- 
ing its own town or city a model community that it can not appreciate the fact that 
the nation can not be a magnified Massachusetts or Connecticut, has yet given to the 
Republic, in every department of American life, an abundant share of the broadest- 
minded and progressive leadership of the country. And nowhere better than in 
the Pennsylvania of the colonial epoch could such a man find the most conspicuous 
opportunity to put forth his unique and all-pervading influence, to set in motion 
agencies and institutions which, in the progress of the years, would bring into har- 
mony the most antagonistic classes and, dut of the most hopeless diversity, build a 
State in more than one respect a model Commonwealth. 
It was largely through the influence of this greatest of American popular educators 
that Philadelphia, the city of his adoption, at the breaking out of the war was found 
to be the foremost of American communities in science, letters, and polite society, 
and was eminently the fit place for the session of the first Colonial Congress, the 
Declaration of Independence, and the formation of the new nationality; all repre- 
sented by the old bell that once more, on the late memorial year, renewed its travels, 
passing from its home to the great representative city of the new Northwest; wher- 
ever it went, as in the old time, ‘‘ proclaiming liberty throughout the land to all the 
inhabitants thereof.” 
Tur Epocu oF THE REVOLUTION AND ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NATIONAL 
GOVERNMENT, 1775-1800. 
We have now reviewed, somewhat in detail, the course of educational development 
in the thirteen American colonies, from the settlement of each to the breaking out of 
the war of Independence. Our aim in this examination has not been the recapitu- 
lation of the details of educational history so much as the endeavor to ascertain to 
what extent the educational practices in each of these provinces were an anticipa- 
tion of the American common school. : 
The one characteristic quality of the American system of common-school education 
which differentiates it from the public schools of all European countries is that, 
from the foundation stone upward, it is the attempt of a free people to educate itself. 
In the American common school the responsible people, armed with the right of 
suffrage, initiate the movement for a system of public education through their legal 
representatives, chosen by free election or by legal process in towns, counties, 
municipalities, and States. They put the system in legal shape; support it by per- 
manent State or local funds and taxation, all under the control of the people; 
establish the conditions of attendance and the rules and regulations for the conduct 
of teachers and pupils; determine the character and extent of the courses of study 
and methods of mental, moral, «esthetic, and industrial training. In short, through 
the republican agency of a flexible majority, always open for correction at the polls, 
the people, organized as the Commonwealth, take in charge everything connected 
with the educational training of children and youth, so far as concerns the qualifica- 
tion for good American citizenship. 
But, while more than one-half the States of the Union have assumed the right to 
demand a certain amount of schooling for all children, no State has presumed to 
interfere with the right of the parent in respect to the method by which this shall 
be secured—whether by home, neighborhood, private, public, or any system that 
produces the desired result. On the contrary, all the States, at different times, have 
aided and encouraged many sorts of schools by subsidies, exemption from taxation, 
and other favorable legislation, although the tendency everywhere at present is to 
limit Government aid strictly to institutions under State control.
-P-A-G-E-757
  ‘PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE COLONIAL PERIOD. 709 
This idea of universal education underlies the action of the Government of the 
United ‘States in its vast system of national subsidies for education, by perpetual 
grants of public domain, gifts of money, and the support of a National Bureau of 
Education. The Government is also involved in the practice of national, State, and 
local encouragement of literature, art, music, the founding of libraries and museums, 
and whatever directly and often indirectly ministers to the education of a people. 
It is also in intimate connection with the national and State laws for the freedom of 
religion and the protection of all forms of worship against public or private inter- 
ference, even to the extent of exempting vast amounts of ecclesiastical property 
from taxation. And even more intimately connected with the educational system is 
the entire body of legislation, every year becoming more stringent, for the limita- 
tion of exclusive and arbitrary parental authority and the protection of children 
from the injustice of home or corporate tyranny and greed through vagrant, labor, 
and industrial laws. The State even follows the child and youth into the house of 
correction and the prison, and, by a wise and humane direction of his mental, moral, 
and manual training there, seeks to dry up the fountains of youthful depravity. 
In this sense what we call the American system of universal education is nothing 
more nor less than the chief motive power of our American civilization, so inextri- 
cably intertwined with our republican form of government and order of society 
that to abolish or to essentially modify it would be equivalent to placing a new soul 
inside the body of our entire American life. 
It is therefore absolutely essential to the rectitude of history that in telling the 
story of the American common school the author of this essay should endeavor to 
show, as clearly as possible, the educational habits of the American people from the 
beginning as the best guide to the characteristics and career of each State and section 
of the Republic. For only by a careful consideration of this ‘making of a people” 
during the earliest period of its occupation of a new country can any fair judgment 
be passed on any portion of its subsequent history. We have endeavored to set 
forth, with such accuracy and fairness as we could command, the facts concerning 
education in the thirteen New England, Central, and Southern American colonies 
before the opening of the great epoch of the war of Independence. If these facts 
have been correctly stated and their relations to the general development of indi- 
vidual, social, and civic affairs have been actually indicated, a new light will be shed 
upon the history of the epoch of the Revolution and the establishment of the 
National Government, including the twenty-five years from the beginning of the war 
to the opening of the nineteenth century. 
An analysis of the system of education inaugurated at the settlement of Massa- 
chusetts and Connecticut, and incorporated into the permanent policy of the New 
England colonies during the one hundred and fifty years previous to the Revolu- 
tion, and the relations which that system of youthful training bore to the forma- 
tion of what is regarded as the Puritan Society, finds complete illustration in the 
history of New England during the war for independence. We have shown how, 
by a fortunate unity of sentiment on the fundamental question of all civiliza- 
tion, the control of public affairs by the mass of the people in the New England 
colonies, the direction of the church, government, education, and in large degree 
of social and private life were practically in the hands of the responsible people 
of each community. The New England school from the first, in all its departments, 
was the people’s method of educating the children for the duties of American life. 
Thus, while the development of a stalwart and obstinate personal independence was 
the inevitable result of the Puritan idea of sole direct responsibility to God in 
thought and action, this harmony of feeling and opinion produced the most compact 
form of society then on the globe. Nowhere in the American provinces had there 
been such a triumphant success among a free people in the art of liying together as 
in these colonies. Thus at the breaking out of the war, after the first “big lift,” 
that landed the small upper-class Tory contingent over in the Province of Nova

710 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-94. 
‘Scotia, there was virtually no conflict of political opinion in New England till the 
end of the war. These four-colonies, though inferior to the central and southern 
in population, furnished ‘one-half, probably a majority, of the permanent soldiery. 
Washington stated that:at the close of the war the majority of the soldiers were 
from New England, with the hearty addition: “God Wless the New England troops.” 
But just this unanimity of sentiment and action was doubtless: somewhat a bar to 
the development of eminent civil and military leadership. Fortunately, by all.odds 
the greatest son.of New England was no longer an inhabitant of ‘his own native city. 
The great agitators, like Sam Adams, Otis, Mayhew, and Warren, the statesmen.of 
the John Adams type, and the military men, with the exception .of ‘Greene, were 
hardly in ‘the foremost rank. The social and public atmosphere of colonial New 
England was not then favorable to ‘the growth of men-of great cutive capacity 
in military or ‘civic affairs. A people ‘individually the most-obstinate and -unman- 
agealle and unitedly the most compact and uncompromising on the face of the 
earth did not relish the habit of “training under” great Jeaders in:any department 
of life. 
Tt was reserved for the central and southern colonies to furnish this indispensable 
Jeadership during the memorable era of twenty-five years from the opening gun at 
“Lexington to the close of the century. Owing to the great diversity of the national 
origin, religious bélief, and social statusof the populations of the ‘Central States— 
New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey—there ‘had ‘been no effective general sys- 
tem of education there for the masses of the people during the long years since the 
adventof the Dutch, Swedish, and British settlers.on the banks-of the Hudson and 
the Delaware. ‘The schooling of these generations ‘had ‘been in family, neighbor- 
‘hood, private, and parochial schools, with a moderate supply of academical and 
‘higher seminaries, generally under the control of religious ‘sects or private close 
corporations. 
Thus the peculiar characteristics.of every set of people had been perpetuated and 
fixed with the passing years. At'the breaking out of the war the Germans .and the 
different classes of the British people in'Pennsylvania and the Dutch and English 
of Now York were to.a great extent separate peoples, even the unity of language 
was not yet:achieved. The wide-difference of religious creeds and politics intensi- 
fied this separation. Theextremes-of social life, all the way from the feudal patroon 
to the feeble tenant on his estate, added to this inevitable distinction. 
Insucha-condition of affairs it was unreasonable to expect the same almost unani- 
mous response of the mass of the people tothe call of the united provinces as in 
New England. ‘These colonies from ‘the first, though in their public policy not 
behind others, were greatly disturbed by a widespread disloyalty to the patriot 
eause. At the darkest crisis of the conflict there was almost seen in-some sections 
danger of a“‘stampede” of submission to the royalist cause. All the leading cities 
of these colonics, exeepting Albany, were at different times in »possession of the 
enemy. New York was almost destroyed by its occupation during the entire period 
of the war. 
‘But from this inevitableseparation ofthe superior class from the masses.of ‘the 
people and their education in private and collegiate schools at home and abread these 
colonies found themselves in pos ion.of a body of remarkable men of great social 
and civic reputation who, atthe outbreak of hostilities, grasped the reins of public 
affairs and held these important provinces up to their duty through the discourage- 
ments and perils-of the conflict. At thehead oi this illustrious company was Ben- 
jamin Franklin, ‘the great public schoolmaster of the central colony of Pennsylvania 
for fifty years, to whom the country owed more than to any other man for such 
political unanimity as was-secured among the people. It is‘only necessary to recall 
the Jong list of eminent statesmen, jurists, financiers, and administrators in. these 
eolonies during the turbulent years succeeding the advent of peace, the formative 
period of the National Government, to see that here was illustrated the peculiar 
       
  
   
-P-A-G-E-759
  
PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE COLONIAL PERIOD. vid 
power of such an order of society to develop strong and politic leaders of communi- 
ties in the hour of imminent peril. 
Even more conspicuous was the illustration of this fact in the Southern States. 
From the settlement of Virginia, in 1607, to the first bloodshed of the great war, in 
North Carolina in 1771, there had been no effective system of public education seri- 
ously attempted. While the superior class in various ways did secure moderate 
scholastic training for their own children, there was at the bottom of society a 
great body of people almost entirely deprived of the opportunity of schooling, to 
say nothing ofthe negro slayes who were simply a burden and hindrance from the 
first. sna 
But through the concentrated force of the Southern colonial governments and 
the high aristocratic type of social and educational life there had been developed 
a ‘splendid superior class; not an aristocracy of blood and heritage, inthe European 
sense, but a group of the descendants of the powerful conservative class that was 
drifted into the section, as one stratum of British immigration. The more favored 
of these people sent their sons to England for education or supplied the want at 
home, as in the case of William :and Mary College, Virginia. 
The result was the remarkable body of men, especially from the Old Dpouitedea: 
who, at the beginning, came to the front and iar a long generation were the chief 
administrators of the Continental and National Government. It can not be denied 
that this original constitution of Southern ‘society was highly favorable, in its 
superior class, to the development of a habit of command in jprivate and execu- 
tive capacity in certain departments of public affairs, in peace and war. And it 
appears nothing less than a Providential circumstance that, while the foundation of 
the new government was in constant peril of wreck on the reef of an obstinate idea 
of colonial independence, while each colony was esteeming itself a little nation and 
contending, amid a noisy crowd of rival nationalities, for its uttermost rights and 
privileges, the leaders of public affairs should so largely have come from the South, 
where this tendency was strongest. We owe it greatly to the firmness of Washing- 
ton, Marshall, and Madison, and to the comprehensive and intense patriotism of Jef- 
ferson and the statesmen that adopted the opposing theories of these great leaders, 
that the influential class of the Southern colonies, the planters, were persuaded to 
come into the Union on the basis of a nationality which proved itself powerfulenough, 
in the day of peril in 1860, to overwhelm the entire industrial and social organism of 
their States in absolute ruin and place in the amended Constitution of the United 
States a repudiation of the extreme theory of State independence, which was the 
radical question involved in the civil war. 
In 1788 it would have been impossible to form a union had it not been for the wise 
and patriotic mediation of this group of statesmen, with Washington, Jefferson, and 
Franklin towering above the heads of all contemporaries as beacon lights for the 
ship of staté, tossed on a stormy sea, And in no other school could this body of 
statesmen have been trained for this emergency than in the Southern society before 
the war of the Revolution. The time had not yet come theré for the establishment 
of the people’s common training school of citizenship; indeed, it was to be deferred 
yet more than half a century, and only to come after a conflict more terrible than 
the original struggle for republican institutions. But there was something during 
the closing twenty-five years of the eighteenth century more important than this— 
the possibility of a union that would insure a great republican nationality in the 
New World. This secured, all good things were bound to come in duc time. 
Up to 1776 there had been ten colleges established in the thirteen provinces, iol 
ing Hampden-Sidney, Virginia, founded in that year—eight in the New England and 
Central colonies and two'in Virginia. Only two of these, Harvard’ and the Univer- 
sity of Pennsylvania, could be regarded unsectarian in religion. Fora generation 
an increasing number of the superior young men of the South had been graduated 
from these Northern schools, especially Harvard, Princeton, and the University of    
 
-P-A-G-E-760
  712 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
Pennsylvania. Besides these there were probably less than one hundred acade- 
mies or secondary schools of real importance in all the thirteen colonies at this time. 
But out of this somewhat meager supply—even for a new country, at that time con- 
taining a white population of some 2,000,000—the more ambitious young men of the 
different provinces had managed to get an education that served them well in the 
emergencies of public life to which they were exposed. These, with the considera- 
bie class educated in European schools and a few men of transcendent native genius, 
like Franklin and Washington, as nearly self-educated as men of that type can be, 
were largely represented in public life from the opening Colonial Congress to that 
great assembly which framed the Constitution of the United States. Of the mem- 
bers of the latter body 45 were graduates of colleges, and all were of the class now 
regarded as educated. Not a member personally represented the uneducated masses 
that did exist in all, and especially in the Central and Southern colonies. Of the 
55 members of the convention that framed the Constitution of the United States 45 
had received collegiate instruction, 9 had studied at Princeton, 4 in Yale, 3 in Har- 
"vard, 2in Columbia, 1 in the University of Pennsylvania, probably 7 in William and 
Mary; 1 had been a student in St. Andrew’s, Scotland; 1 hailed from Glasgow, 
and 1 from Oxford; 3 had read law in the Temple, London. Franklin had been 
a scholar in the Boston Latin School, and had made great use of the Philadelphia 
library. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society in England and LL. D. from Oxford, 
Edinburgh, and St. Andrew’s. Roger Sherman had labored as a shoemaker to send his 
younger brothers to college, and was the treasurer of Yale and a judge of the superior 
court of Connecticut; except Franklin, the oldest member of the convention. Wash- 
ington had become LL. D. of Harvard years before, and was afterwards chancellor 
of William and Mary, Virginia. 
Happily, the day had not dawned when ignorance, vulgarity, and the power to 
lead a rabble were considered qualifications for elevation to the most important 
offices of public trust; nor even the other insanity of free government, that a nom- 
inal majority secured by any and all means is that ‘voice of the people” which 
may be accepted as the ‘voice of God.” Chatham and Burke declared in Par- 
liament that the leaders of the American people in this memorable struggle for 
independence were men of extraordinary power, and Gladstone has added his testi- 
mony that the American scheme of government is the supreme effort of eminent 
statesmanship in history. So, through the influence of the different systems of edu- 
cation working through the social organisms of the old thirteen colonies, came 
forth that beautiful combination of elements which fashioned the American Repub- 
lic before the great clock had struck the hour that ushered in the memorablo 
nineteenth century. 
The immediate period of the war of Independence was in no sense a favorable 
time for the inauguration of schemes of education; in fact, it was with the greatest 
difficulty that the schools already established could be kept open. Two of the 
colleges were closed, a majority of the academies suspended their sessions, and the 
elementary education of the people of all sorts was greatly disturbed. Yet during 
these years of peril to the success of the patriotic cause, and in some respects to the 
existence of the colonial life, even in the condition under which it embarked in 
the desperate contest, the spirit of education was not completely stifled. 
Between the years 1776 and 1785 five new colleges had been established: Washing- 
ton and Lee, Virginia; Washington and St. John’s, Maryland; Nashville, Tennessee ; 
and Dickinson, Pennsylvania—four in the old South and one in the new territory of 
Tennessee, beyond the mountains. Only one of these, Dickinson, Pennsylvania, 
was under ecclesiastical control, the remainder being established by their States 
and nonsectarian. Of these, Nashville, Tennessee, no longer exists, save in its new 
connection with a different organization. 
Between 1784—the close of the war—and 1796 nine additional colleges had been 
created: Georgetown, District of Columbia; the University of North Carolina; the
-P-A-G-E-761
  PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE COLONIAL PERIOD. 713 
University of Vermont; the University of East Tennessee; Williams College, Mas- 
sachusetts; Bowdoin, Maine; Union, New York; Middlebury, Vermont; and Fred- 
erick, Maryland. Of these, Georgetown, District of Columbia, was and is Roman 
Catholic; Middlebury, Vermont, and Williams, Massachusetts, are Congregational; 
and the remaining six nonsectarian, three of them under State supervision. Williams 
and Middlebury, to-day, like Harvard and Yale, the University of Pennsylvania, and 
Columbia, New York, are nonsectarian colleges, under the control of private corpora- 
tions and, to some extent, of associations of their own alumni. 
This fact of the gradual withdrawal of college life from ecclesiastical control indi- 
cates a growing jealousy of the interference of the church with education, especially 
in institutionssupported, subsidized, or in any way implicated withthe State. Like 
all periods of great social and civic agitation and transition, the Revolutionary 
epoch had shaken the foundation of theological belief and disturbed the ecclesiastical 
polity of all the churches. The Congregational Church of New England was the 
only religious body that had no occasion to change its ecclesiastical polity, since 
this was the only form of church organization original to America. But within 
the twenty-five years following the organization of the National Government all the 
churches transferred: from abroad, save the Roman Catholic, had reorganized under 
conditions adapted to the new order of affairs, which, first in the history of the world, 
cut off, with a decided and evidently unchangeable determination of the people, 
all connection between church and state in the National Government, a provision 
adopted in the Constitution of all the present States of the Union. . 
At the close of the century New York had nineteen academies and Massachusetts 
as many, while the Central and Southern States were probably as well supplied. 
In fact, there were a greater number of colleges and possibly of academies of the 
first class in the United States in proportion to the white population at that time 
than at present; the development of the higher grades of the grammar, free high, 
and normal, and the preparatory department of the majority of State universities, 
which constitute the upper story of the common-school system, haying to a consid- 
erable extent supplied the demand for these departments of instruction. Besides, 
until the establishment of the elementary and grammar departments of the common 
school, especially in the South, large numbers of the children and youth now edu- 
cated. in public were compelled to use the private schools. With the exception of a 
small number of these academies established by the fraternities of the Masonic and 
other orders, neighborhood, private, and in some cases institutions supported by the 
cooperation of municipal governments, the majority of these secondary schools were 
the fruit of the great revival among the different religious sects which broke forth 
at the beginning of the present century, on account of the separation of church and 
state. 
Yet from the first the development of the American common school in all its 
departments through all States of the Union has never gone on ina spirit of hostility 
to any sort of private or denominational schemes of instruction. Neither, by any 
legislative enactment, have the people in any way interfered with the development 
of the broad realm of educational life outside the common school. In this also does 
the American differ from the corresponding systems of public education in Europe in 
avoiding conflict with the liberty of this region of school life. Even the logic of 
the public-school laws and the spirit of the constitutional safeguards of the people 
against ecclesiastical and private invasion of popular rights has been and still is 
occasionally sacrificed through the great desire of public authorities to give aid and 
comfort to all worthy enterprises for the schooling and general culture of the people. 
Between the close of the Revolutionary war and the renewal of the conflict against 
Great Britain in 1812 only ten of the States then in the Union had placed in their new 
constitutions a recognition of the obligation of an American Commonwealth to edu- 
cate the whole people. Of these Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and 
Vermont were New England States, and their constitutional provisions were but a 
more formal declaration of what had been the statute law and common practice of

   those colonies from their earliest settlement. An examination of these provisions 
will not only define the attitude of these Commonwealths to the common school, but 
also to the colleges established under the colonial regime and at this period to a lim- 
ited degree administered under the auspices of the State. 
MASSACHUSETTS, 
It is stated in Barnard’s American Journal of Education that “the article on 
education in the constitution of Massachusetts of 1780 is one of the first of the sort 
ever incorporated into the organic law of a State.” Although Massachusetts was 
anticipated by four States, her action in 1780 shows in what a decided way the Bay 
State “put down its foot,” at the beginning of its existence as one of the United 
States of America, in behalf of the obligation of educating the whole people, the 
practice of which was coeval with her existence, the first public action in the matter 
having been taken in 1642, within ten years of the settlement of the Massachusetts 
colony. 
The article on education in the constitution of 1780 was a part of the second con- 
stitution framed, that of 1778 having been rejected by the people. Section 2, making 
it imperative on legislators and magistrates “‘to cherish the interests of literaturo 
and the sciences, and all seminaries of them,” was framed by John Adams, and has 
been retained until this day without the slightest alteration. 
THE UNIVERSITY AT CAMBRIDGE, AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF LITERATURE, ETC. 
Section I.—The University. 
Art. 1. Whereas our wise and pious ancestors, so early as the year one thousand 
six hundred and thirty-six, laid the foundation of Harvard College, in which univer- 
sity many persons of great eminence have, by the blessing of God, been initiated 
into those arts and sciences which qualified them for publie employments, both in 
church and state; and whereas the encouragement of the arts and sciences, and all 
good literature, tends to the honor of Gop, the advantage of the Christian religion, 
and the great benefit of this and the other United States of America—it is declared 
that the president and fellows of Harvard College, in their corporate capacity, and 
their successors in that capacity, their officers and servants, shall have, hold, use, 
exercise, and enjoy all the powers, authorities, rights, liberties, privileges, immuni- 
ties, and franchises which they now have, or are entitled to have, hold, use, exercise, 
and enjoy; and the sameare hereby ratified and confirmed unto them, tho said presi- 
dent and fellows of Harvard College, and to their successors, and to their officers 
and servants, respectively, forever. 
2, And whereas there have been at sundry times, by divers persons, gifts, grants, 
devises of houses, lands, tenements, goods, chattels, legacies, and conveyances, here- 
tofore made, either to Harvard College in Cambridge, in New England, or to the 
president and fellows of Harvard College, or to the said college by seme other descrip- 
tion under several charters successively; it is declared that all the said gifts, grants, 
devises, legacies and conveyances are hereby forever confirmed unto the president 
and fellows of Harvard College and to their successors in the capacity aforesaid, 
according to the true intent and meaning of the donor or donors, grantor or grantors, 
devisor or devisors. 
3. And whereas, by an act of the general court of the colony of Massachusetts Bay, 
passed in the year one thousand six hundred and forty-two, the governor and deputy 
governor, for the time being, and all the magistrates of that jurisdiction, were, with 
the president, and a number of the clergy in the said act described, constituted the 
overseers of Harvard College; and it being necessary in this new constitution 0 
government to ascertain who shall be deemed successors to the said governor, deputy, 
governor, and magistrates, it is declared that the governor, lieutenant-governer, 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-763

council, and senate of this Commonwealth are, and shall be deemed, their successors, 
who, with the president.of Harvard College for the time being, together with the 
ministers of the Congregational churches in the towns of Cambridge, Watertown, 
Charlestown, Boston, Roxbury, and Dorchester, mentioned in-the said act, shall be, _ 
and hereby are, vested with all the powers and authority belonging or in any way 
appertaining to the overseers of Harvard College: Provided, That nothing herein shall 
‘be construed to prevent the legislature of this Commonwealth from making such 
alterations in the government of said university as shall be conducive to its advan- 
tago and the interest of the republic ef letters, in as full a manner as might have 
been done by the legislature of the late Province of the Massachusetts Bay. 
Srcrion II.—The cxcouragement of literature. 
Wisdom ard knowledge, as well as virtue, diffused generally among the body of 
the people, being necessary for the preservation of their rights and liberties; and as 
these depend upon spreading the opportunities and advantages of education in the 
various parts of the country and among the different orders of the people, it shall 
pe the duty of the legislatures and magistrates, in all future periods of this Common- 
wealth, to cherish the interest of literature and the sciences, and all seminaries of 
them; especially the university at Cambridge, public schools, and grammar schools 
in the towns; to encourage private societies and public institutions, by rewards and 
immunities, for the promotion of agriculture, arts, sciences, commerce, trades, manu- 
factures, and a natural history of the country; to countenance and inculeate the 
principles of humanity and general benevolence, public and private charity, indus- 
try and frugality, honesty and punctuality in all their dealings, sincerity, good 
humor, and all social affections, and generous sentiments, among the people. 
The following article was ratified in 1857 as an amendment to the constitution: 
“Art, XX. No person shall have theright to vote, or be eligible under the consti- 
tution of this Commonwealth, who shall not be able to read the constitution in the 
English language and write his name: Provided, however, That the provisions of this 
amendment shall not apply to any person prevented by a physical disability from 
complying with its requisitions, nor to any person who now has the right to vote, 
nor to any persons who shall be sixty years of age.or upwards at the time this amend- 
ment shall take effect.” 
John Adams, second President of the United States, drew up the second section, 
under which, with subsequent additions, the present elaborate system of the com- 
mon schools of Massachusetts is supported. He relates that his attention was called 
to the importance of scientific associations and eollections of natural history, etc.,. 
by his observation in Europe, and that, after his return, at his earnest suggestion, 
this portion of the constitution relating to “the encouragement of private societies 
and public institutions by rewards for the promotion of agriculture, arts, science, 
commerce, trades, manufactures, and.a natural history of the country,” was inserted 
in the fundamental law and written by himself. Also, that the following clause, 
defining the public obligation to recognize to the uttermost the duty to ‘counte- 
nance and inculcate” the entire code of ‘Christian morality, including, as by a quiet 
criticism of the oppressive Puritan solemnity, ‘good humor, social affections, and 
generous sentiments among the people,” was his own work. Another result of his 
influence was the establishment of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a 
scientific association resembling that established in Philadelphia by Dr. Franklin 
in 1780, At this date Massachusetts had a population of 300,000; by 1800, increased 
to 423,000.   
        
  CONN 
  ‘TICUT. 
~The State of Connecticut at this period was still living under the colonial school 
statute of 1650, which was but a free revision of the previous local laws of the colo- 
nies of Hartford and New Haven, and in large measure a copy of the early legislation 
 
-P-A-G-E-764
  
  716 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
of Massachusetts. Under this direction the common-school system of public instruc- 
tion was maintained for two hundred years. In 1795 the legislature established “a 
permanent and irreducible fund, the income of which shall be applied to the support 
of common or public schools.” This, in continuation of the policy of 1733, was the 
first public-school fund established in the United States. It was derived from the 
public lands, ‘‘a portion of the territory of Ohio, now known as the Connecticut 
reserve, because it was reserved by the State for its own use when it ceded its claim 
to the whole national domain beyond of the same width as its own territory.” In 
1800 the population of Connecticut was 251,000. 
NEW HAMPSHIRE, 
The State of New Hampshire, with a population in 1790 of 142,000, in 1784 placed 
in its constitution the following provision: 
“ENCOURAGEMENT OF LITERATURE, ETC. 
“Knowledge and learning generally diffused through a community being essential 
to the preservation of a free government, and spreading the opportunities and advan- 
tages of education through the various parts of the country being highly conducive 
to promote this end, it shall be the duty of the legislators and magistrates, in all 
future periods of this government, to cherish the interest of literature and the sciences 
and all seminaries and public schools; to encourage public and private institutions, 
rewards and immunities for the promotion of agriculture, arts, sciences, commerce, 
trades, manufactures, and natural history of the country; to countenance and 
inculeate the principles of humanity and general benevolence, public and private 
charity, industry and economy, honesty and punctuality, sincerity, sobriety, and all 
social affections and generous sentiments among the people.” 
This, with only verbal alterations, was copied from the provision in the constitu- 
tion of Massachusetts. 
The present State of Maine was then a portion of Massachusetts and subject to 
the constitution and laws of that State. 
RHODE ISLAND AND VERMONT, 
Rhode Island, with less than 70,000 people, had not yet come into the great sister- 
hood of common-school Commonwealths. Vermont, the first State admitted to the 
Union, in 1791, with 85,000 people in 1790 and only 162,000 in 1800, in its amended 
constitution of 1793 placed in her fundamental law the following provisions: 
“Src. 40.—A school or schools shall be established in each town by the legislature, 
for the convenient instruction of youth, with such salaries to the masters paid by 
each town; making proper use of school lands in each town, thereby to enable them 
to instruct youth at low prices. One grammar school in each county, and one uni- 
versity in this State ought to be established by direction of the general assembly. 
“Src. 41. Laws for the encouragement of virtue and prevention of vice and immo- 
rality ought to be constantly kept in force and duly executed; and acompetent num- 
ber of schools ought to be maintained in each town for the convenient instruction 
of youth, and one or more grammar schools be incorporated and properly supported 
in each county in this State. And all religious societies or bodies of men that may 
be hereafter united or incorporated for the advancement of religion and learning, or 
for other pious and charitable purposes, shall be encouraged and protected in the 
enjoyment of the privileges, immunities, and estates which they in justice ought to 
enjoy, under such regulations as the general assembly of this State shall direct.” 
NEW YORK. 
The first constitution of the State of New York, in 1777, contained no reference to 
education. In 1792 the new Commonwealth had a population of 340,000. At the 
first session of the legislature after the adoption of the revised constitution of 1787 
 
-P-A-G-E-765
  PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE COLONIAL PERIOD. 717 
Governor George Clinton spoke out after this fashion: ‘Neglect of the education of 
youth is one of the evil consequences of the war. Perhaps there is scarce anything 
more worthy your attention than the revival and encouragement of seminaries of 
learning, and nothing by which we can more satisfactorily express our gratitude to 
the Supreme Being for his past favors, since piety and virtue are generally the off- 
spring of an enlightened understanding.” 
The legislature at once responded by organizing the board known as “The regents 
of the University of New York,” and placed it in general charge of the colleges and 
academies of the State. Whether, on the whole, the organization of this time- 
honored body, which seems in late years to have taken on a new life, has been a help 
or a hindrance to the growth of an effective system of common schools in New York 
during the past century is a question still earnestly discussed by the educators of 
the Empire State. But it seems to have gone about its work at first with favorable 
intentions toward popular instruction. 
In 1789 an act was passed by which two lots in each township of public land should . 
be set apart ‘‘for gospel and school purposes.” The State at this time was pos- 
sessed of 7,000,000 acres of wild Jand in what is now. known as northern and western 
New York. The regents appealed to the legislature in behalf of the education 
of the people and children to the extent of “‘reading and as much of writing and 
arithmetic as to enable them, when they come forward into active life, to trans- 
act with accuracy and dispatch the business of, life.” This, with the repeated 
reminders of the great governor, George Clinton, moved the legislature in 1792 to 
appoint a committee of its members to frame a scheme of popular instruction. The 
soul of this, as of so many of the subsequent movements in New York in behalf 
of common schools, was a native of Connecticut, Mr. Adam Comstock, a represent- 
ative from Saratoga. Another restless and somewhat ‘‘cranky” son of the ‘land of 
steady habits,” Jedediah Peck, a representative from Otsego County, appears to have 
held the laboring oar in the management of this frail craft of universal education 
through the turbulent seas of these early experiments for schooling the children in 
the Empire State. 
On April 9, 1792, Governor Clinton signed the first of the numerous legislative 
acts under which the State of New York has risen to its present high eminence in 
popular education. It appropriated the sum of $50,000 annually for five years to 
encourage and maintain schools where the children of the State could receive “a 
good English education.” The board of supervisors of each county was required to 
raise by tax asum equal to one-half the State grant. The electors of the county 
were authorized to choose commissioners, to whom should be intrusted the super- , 
vision and direction of the schools and the handling of the public-school moneys. 
A local board of trustees could be chosen by the votes of each school district, to 
cooperate with the commissioners in all matters relating to the choice of teachers 
and general management of the schools. 
As there were in the State at this time probably in the neighborhood of 50,000 
children of the practical school age, 6 to 14, this arrangement of $75,000 raised by taxa- 
tion at best could only be regarded as a fair beginning of the greatest work that 
confronts the statesmanship of an American Commonwealth—the sufficient and 
unceasing provision for the demand even for elementary education. That the people 
eagerly caught at even this meager provision is proved by the fact that in the only 
year in which even a partial report was made, 1798, there were 1,352 schools and 
nearly 60,000 children under instruction during some part of the school year. 
Why an opening so promising should have languished before the end of the first 
five years’ appropriation, and why it should have been “substantially abandoned” 
by the year 1800, has not been clearly explained. 
But the colonial history of New York lets us into the real cause of the failure of 
its experiment. The new Commonwealth was not yet abreast with its great advo- 
cates and leaders of public education who had enacted the first law. While the 
 
-P-A-G-E-766
718 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
successive governors like Clinton, Lewis, Jay, and Tompkins, representing a noble 
array of enlightened friends of public education, saw and deplored the difficulties 
in the path of a general training of the young citizens of the Commonwealth, tho 
“Middle estate,” which rules everywhere in America, was in no present accord with 
this policy. The high, aristocratic, social tendency which succeeded the breaking 
up of the patroon feudalism of th. early Dutch settlers; the absorption of the reli- 
gious sects in a chronic war of creeds and polities; the indifference of great masses 
of the people who, well enough disposed to send their children to school, had still 
no fixed determination to compel their politica: leaders to open the wide door for the 
teaching of the masses; the sharp division of nationalities that still parceled the 
dwellers in the several localities almost into separate and hostile peoples—these, with 
other characteristic obstacles, broke down the experiment and left the Common- 
wealth for the first dozen years of the new century without a system of public 
education. 
The corner stone of the present common-school fund of the State was laid in 1805, 
in the dedication of 500,000 acres of public land. 
NEW JERSEY. 
At the adoption of its first State constitution, in 1776, New Jersey contained a 
population of 184,000. This instrument contained no allusion to schools or educa- 
tion. It was not till 1816 that the first act to create a fund for the support of free 
schools was adopted, and the first distribution of the income of this fund was post: 
poned till 1829, while the first constitutional provision for free education appears in 
1844. 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
Dr. James P. Wickersham, in his admirable History ef Education in Pennsylvania, 
a model for all similar works, draws a discouraging picture of the condition of that 
Commonwealth during the Revolutionary epoch. In 1790 Pennsylvania was the 
second American State in population, containing 435,000 people; only surpassed by 
Virginia, with 442,000 whites and more than 300,000 negroes, and in available resources, 
if not in actual valuation, the wealthiest of the original thirteen. Yet the unhappy 
contentions of the past one hundred and fifty years among its heterogeneous classes 
of immigrants, intensified by the disagreements of religious sects, the jealousies of 
rival classes, and the conflict of the Government and the masses at home with the 
original semifeudal government of the Penn family, had so distracted the leading 
people and impoverished great masses of the scattered rural settlers that it seemed 
less probable than ever that any decisive action could be taken for the encouragement 
of general education by the State. 
Says Dr. Wickersham: “At the time of the breaking out of the Revolutionary 
war the condition of education in Pennsylvania was probably less promising than 
at any other period before or since. The population of the State was about 350,000, 
for the most part scattered over a large extent of territory. The liberally educated 
men among the earliest settlers had gone down to their graves, and in most cases 
their learning had been buried with them. Life in the New World had proved 
unfavorable to the transmission of intellectual tastes, and scholars were more numer- 
ous among the fathers than among theirsons. The mass of the people were too poor, 
teo busy in earning a livelihood, too severely pressed by the hardships they were 
compelled to endure in an American wilderness, too much absorbed in the political 
and religious agitations and controversies that long distracted the provinee, to make 
the necessary effort to provide means adequate to the purpose for the education of 
their children. Penn and his immediate successors strongly favored education, and 
the earlier assemblies passed some wholesome laws relating tothe establishment of 
schools; but for more than fifty years before the Revolution the subject was almost 
totally neglected by the public authorities. The several religious denominations

established a large number of schools, and in many neighborhoods the people in 
general united in providing the means of an elementary education; but all that was 
done in this way came far short of-covering the whole field. In 1775 not only 
was the number of scholarly men in the province small, but comparatively few grown 
persons could do more than read, write, and caleulate according to the elementary 
rules of arithmetic, and many remained wholly illiterate. There was little demand 
for higher institutions of learning, and few existed. The college and the Friends’ 
public school m Philadelphia, the academy at Germantown, and scarcely a half a 
dozen private classical schools in the older settled counties, with in all an attend- 
ance of three or four hundred students, absolutely exhaust the advantages of this 
character enjoyed at home by our Revolutionary fathers.” 
Still the friends of popular education, under the inspiration of the Declaration of 
Independence, succeeded in placing in the provisional constitution of the State, 
framed in the same year with the immortal Declaration, 1776, the following bricf 
provision: 
“Section 45. Laws for the encouragement of virtue and prevention of vice and 
immorality shall be made and constantly kept in force, and provision shall be made 
for their due execution; and all religious societies or bodies of men heretofore united 
or incorporated for the advancement of religion or learning, or for other pious and 
charitable parposes, shall be encouraged and protected in the enjoyment of the privi- 
leges, immunities, and estates which they were accustomed to enjoy, or could of 
right have enjoyed, under the laws and former constitution of this State. 
“A school or schools shall be established in each county by the legislature, for 
the convenient instruction of youths, with such salaries to the masters, paid by the 
public, as may enable them to instruct youth at low prices; and all useful learning 
shall be duly encouraged and promoted in one or more universities.” 
Of this brief reference to education in the provisional constitution in 1776 Dr. 
Wickersham says: 
“This provision, broad for the time, contemplates two things: The establishment 
of schools for elementary instruction, and of institutions of a more advanced grade 
for higher instruction. * * * The framers of the constitution of 1776, in adopt- 
ing this provision, were approaching free-school ground, but if they saw it at all it 
was only in the dim distance. 
“The period of the Revolution, as might well be supposed, was almost wholly an 
educational blank. The only act relating to education passed by the general assem- 
bly during the war was one abrogating the charter of the college, academy, and 
charitable school of Philadelphia, and founding upon its ruins the University gf 
Pennsylvania. ‘This was done in the heat of the Revolutionary struggle, on account 
of the alleged disloyalty of some of the trustees and professors connected with the 
old institution.” 
In 1790 this original provision was renewed and placed in the revised constitution 
of the State, where it remained, the only clause in the fundamental law referring to 
education until 1874. But it was only through the persistence of Timothy Picker- 
ing, a member of the convention, a native of Massachusetts, and a representative.of 
the New England settlers of the Wyoming Valley district, where publie schools had 
long been sustained under local law, that the effort to throw the responsibility of 
the legislature to establish schools upon the several counties, thus, as the historian 
remarks, “making any law establishing free schools or making the schools free even 
to the poor unconstitutional,” was defeated, and the clause finally worded as follows: 
“Suc. 1. The legislature shall, as soon as conveniently may be, provide by law 
for the establishment of schools throughout the State, in such a manner that the 
poor may be tanght gratis. 
“Sno, 2. The arts and sciences shall be promoted in one or more seminaries of

  720 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
But although it is comparatively easy to place even liberal provisions in a consti- 
tution and to formulate them into law, neither constitutions nor laws enforce them- 
selves. The majority of the leading classes in Pennsylvania were opposed to any 
scheme of public instruction that would loosen the grip on education already held 
by the different religious bodies in the State. The University of Pennsylvania was 
reconstructed and purged of Toryism during the war and the State began by a com- 
mendable show of liberality in granting to this and various new denominational 
colleges and seminaries properties from confiscated and other public lands. The 
legislature enacted that 60,000 acres of public land should be appropriated and pub 
in fit shape to be sold “for the sole and express purpose of aiding public schools.” 
But the public schools never received any benefit from this appropriation; the rev- 
enue, if any, of this domain, according to a time-honored practice in all States not 
supporting the common school, being quietly appropriated by the various private 
and denominational schools, which, under the name “college,” or whatever higher 
title could magnify their importance, were always on the watch to replenish their 
scanty finances. 
Indeed, the final provision in the constitution of 1780 was so read for forty years 
as to evade the obligation to establish a system of schools common to all classes and 
conditions of the people. Under the provision, ‘“‘The poor may be taught gratui- 
tously,” the practice for many years was simply to provide for the education of 
the children of the poor in the neighborhood and church schools, thus preventing the 
original intent of the constitutional provision and forcing the State virtually to sub- 
sidize this class of institutions. The original educational heresy that still vitiates 
the public-school system of England, that common schools are schools for the poor 
who can not educate their children in the same way as their better-off neighbors, 
had then full possession of the American mind from Pennsylvania down to the Gulf 
and out to the borders of Mexico. 
But we need not infer from this disheartening record that the faith in universal 
education as the motive power of an American State was dead or inactive in Penn- 
sylvania. Among the most eminent and powerful advocates of the common school 
was Dr. Benjamin Rush, of Philadelphia, the friend and colaborer of Dr. Franklin in 
all that related to the elevation of the people in his State and the true glory of his 
city. As early as 1786 Dr. Rush addressed to the legislature and citizens of Pennsyl- 
vania a practical and comprehensive ‘‘plan for establishing public schools.” It was, 
in substance, the same plan that Thomas Jefferson and George Wythe had presented. 
to the legislature of Virginia in 1779. It provided for a State university, subsidized 
by the State; for four colleges, one for the German population of the Commonwealth, 
established at convenient localities; and for free schools for every one hundred fami- 
lies, where the children might be schooled in elementary studies in English and Ger- 
man. In support of this plan of free education he wrote these noble words, which 
will bear publication alongside the Declaration of Independence as a concise and 
unanswerable statement of the grounds of the public support of universal education: 
“Tet there be free schools established in every township, or in districts consisting 
of 100 families. In these schools let children be taught to read and write the 
English and German languages and the use of figures. Such parents as can afford 
to send their children from home and are disposed to extend their education may 
remove them from the free school to one of the colleges. 
“By this plan the whole State will be tied together by one system of education. 
The university will, in time, furnish masters for the colleges, and the colleges will 
furnish masters for the free schools, while the free schools, in their turn, will supply 
the colleges and the university with scholars, students, and pupils. The same sys- 
tems of grammar, oratory, and philosophy will be taught in every part of the State, 
and the literary features of Pennsylvania will thus designate one great and enlight- 
ened family.

“Bat how shall we bear the expense of these literary institutions? I answer, these 
institutions wil] lessen our taxes. They will enlighten us in the great business of 
finance; they will teach us all the modern improvements and advantages of inland 
navigation. They will defend us from hasty and expensive experiment in govern- 
ment, by unfolding to us the experience and folly of past ages, and thus, instead of 
adding to our taxes and debts, they will furnish us with the true secret of lessening 
and discharging both of them. * * * Every member of the community is inter- 
ested in the propagation of virtue and knowledge in the State. But I will go further 
and add, it will be true economy in individuals to support public schools. * * * 
I conceive the education of our youth in this country to be peculiarly necessary in 
Pennsylvania, where our citizens are composed of the natives of so many different 
Kingdoms in Europe. Our schools of learning, by producing one general and uni- 
form system of education, will render the mass of the people more homogeneous, and 
thereby fit them more easily for uniform and peaceable government. * * * 
“The only foundation for a useful education in a republic is to be laid in religion. 
Without this there can be no virtue, and without virtue there can be no liberty, and 
liberty is the object and life of all republican governments. * * * Our country 
includes family, friends, and property, and should be preferred to them all. Let our 
pupil be taught that he does not belong to himself, but that he is public property. 
Let him be taught to love his family, but let him be taught at the same time that he 
must forsake and even forget them when the welfare of his country requires it. He 
must watch for the State as if its liberties depended upon his vigilance alone, 
but he must do this in such a manner as not to defraud his creditors or neglect his. 
amet fe pe ® 
“To assist in rendering religious, moral, and political instruction more effectual 
upon the minds of our youth it will be necessary to subject their bodies to physicah 
discipline.” 
Who can now estimate the consequences of the rej ection of these wise and patriotie 
plans for the education of the whole people presented to Virginiaand Pennsylvania, 
the two most populous and influential American states in the opening decade of the 
Republic, by Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Rush? Had the ruling class of people 
in these States honestly adopted and wisely organized and administered this system 
of public training for American citizenship, their powerful influence at the center 
of the nation might have prevented the country from drifting through the conten- 
tions of seventy-five years into the horrors of a great civil war. One century of 
effective popular education would have so enlightened the masses of the American 
people that slavery would have been abolished by some action of the General Gov- 
ernmentsatisfactory to all parties, and American history would have vindicated the 
prophecies and expectations of the great fathers of the Republic. 
NORTH CAROLINA. 
The first Southern States which moved in the constitutional recognition of edu ‘a~ 
tion were North Carolina and Georgia. 
North Carolina, with a population of 288,000, in 1776, at the beginning of the Revo- 
lution, placed in her constitution the following clause: 
“Arr, 41, That a school or schools shall be established by the legislature for the 
convenient instruction of youth, with such salaries to the masters paid by the pub- 
lic as may enable them to instruct at low prices; and all useful learning shall be 
duly encouraged and promoted in one or more universities.” 
This was followed by the establishment of the University of North Carolina, in. 
1789. The State moved with a commendable degree of activity in chartering ‘‘sem- 
inaries of learning;” Liberty Hall, at Charlotte, being one of the first fruits of State 
independence.

  NESS’ 
  Tennessee, the first. child of North Carolina, was, until 1790,:subject to the consti- 
tution and laws of the mother State. In 1796 it was admitted to the Union, with a 
population of 36,000. The. original constitution of Tennessee contained no distineé 
provision for education, although tho following reference is found in the constitution 
of 1796: 
Art. I, Sec. 12. No member of the General Assembly shall bo eligible to any office 
 orplace of trust, except to the office of a justice of the peace, or a:trusteo of any 
literary institution. where the power of appointment to such office.or place.of trust 
is vested in their own body, 
DELAWARE, 
Delaware was the first State to adopt the Federal Constittition in 1787, and in 1790 
had a population of 60,000. Its constitution in 1792 provided that ‘*the legislature 
shall, as soon as conv mtly may be, provide by law * * * for establishing 
schools and promoting arts and sciences.” But while an act in 1796 proposed “to 
create a fund sufficient to establish schools,” and while this was followed by a series 
of legislative provisions that ordered the founding and support of schools “for poor 
children” and ‘free schools,” yet it is only within a few years that this State com- 
pelled its people to the duty of local taxation, without which constitutions and 
statutes are powerless to teach the children. But at an early period the chief city 
of Delaware, Wilmington, established its present system of public education. 
      
   
GEORGIA. 
The State of Georgia in 1790 contained a population of 82,500, 2,900 of whom wero 
negro slaves. In its constitution of 1777 it asserted that ‘schools shall be erected 
in each county, and supported at the general expense of ‘the State,” with the power 
to make liberal appropriations for seminaries of learning. In 1783 the legislature 
gave 1,000 acres of land ‘to each county for the support of ‘free schools, and in the 
year following 40,000 acres for the endowment of an academy in each city. The 
University of Georgia was chartered in 1785. One of the original provisions con- 
nected with this establishment was a law that every youth under the age of 16 sent 
abroad to be educated for three years:shall be regarded an alien and seerael of the 
right to hold any public office in the Commonwealth. 
The State at once set abont-establ shing a group of academies, several of which 
became celebrated in'their- day, and remain as'the secondary department of the pres- 
ent common-school system in the older cities. Of these are the academy of Rich- 
mond County, at Augusta, and Chatham Academy, at Savannah. By 1798 six of 
these seminaries had been established. Thus at an early period the State entered 
upon its favorite practice of chartering academies of all degrees of efficiency, chiefly 
denominational. 
The head and front of this early system of academical education in Georgi 
the famous Sunbury Academy, located in Liberty County, the seat:of the or 
New England immigration of which we have already given an account. In 1788 it 
was founded by the confiscation of the property of Tories in the country, $5,000 of 
which was used to erect the first building. In 1793 Rev. William MeWhir, a Pres- 
byterian clergyman, educated at Belfast, Ireland, after a service of ten years Alex- 
andria, Va., came to Georgia, and for thirty years was the principal of this institution. 
_ A historian of Georgia remarks: ‘‘This teacher did more than all others ‘to estab- 
lish a standard of scholarship and hibits of study and discipline unusnal ‘in that 
period and among those people.” Great numbers of the superior youth of the State 
owed their schooling to this seminary, and until the civil war the fame of Liberty 
County, Ga., as a nursery for clergymen, teachers, and men of science was bright, 
especially through the Gulf regiun of the South.    
   
     
   
-P-A-G-E-771
  
PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE COLONIAL PERIOD. 423 
In 1783 tho establishment of a free school in the town of Washington was the 
result of a legislative gift of 1,000 acres of land for such an institution in all the 
counties of the State. 
In 1798 the State incorporated in its constitution the following provision : 
“The arts and sciences shall be promoted in one or more seminaries of learning ; 
and the legislature shall, as soon as conveniently may be, give such further donations 
and privileges to those already established as may be necessary to secure the objects 
of their institution ; and it shall be the duty of the general assembly, at their next 
session, to provide effectual measures for the improvement and permanent security 
of the funds and endowment of such institutions.” 
In Georgia, as in Pennsylvania, the experiment was attempted of establishing a 
scheme of education for the children of the white poor. It failed, as it was fore- 
ordained to failure, by the very conditions of American society in every Southern State. 
Meanwhile the well-to-do people of the better sort, in conformity with tbe original 
English method adopted in the Southern States, educated their children in private 
or denominational seminaries, which, with all their deficiencies, did furnish a fair 
amount of education and largely contributed to that reputation for industrial enter- 
prise and executive ability which long ago gave to Georgia the proud title, ‘ Empire 
State of the South.” 
KENTUCKY. 
Beyond the mountains old Virginia had already entered upen that wonderful 
career of colonization which has made her not only the ‘‘ Mother of Presidents” but 
the fruitful mother of States. The western territory, now the great Stato of Ken- 
tucky, was oceupied as early as 1775 by a movement of vigorous and adventurons 
people, largely from the southwestern portion of Virginia. During the war of the 
Revolution the new territory was the headquarters of the military operations by 
which the British power that still guarded the back door of the future Republic, the 
entire country from the Alleghanies to the Mississippi, was held at bay, crippled, and 
finally destroyed, while Washington, commanding the soldiery of the eastern proy- 
inces, was defending the great front door of the new America, facing the nations of 
the world. | 
But at the close of the war a further immigration of men of large native ability, 
with an appreciation of the value of popular education far above the average eastern 
Virginia planter, brought forward the subject of public instruction. Private schools 
had already been established by tho early settlers, and schools whose reputation has 
survived to the present day were founded by private associations, societies, and the 
different churches. | 
But in 1780 the legislature, under the lead of Col. John Todd, appropriated cer- 
tain Jands in Kentucky, contiscated from British subjects, as a foundation for a uni- 
versity in that territory. Twenty thonsand acres were thus appropriated and released 
from public taxation. Tho teachers in the school were exempted from military duty. 
The board of trustees included many of the foremost men of the coming Common- 
wealth. The preamble of the law of Virginia founding the Transylvania Seminary 
reads thus: 
“It is to the interest of the Commonwealth always to encourage and promote every 
design which may tend to the improvement of the mind and the diffusion of useful 
knowledge, even among the most remote citizens, where situation in a barbarous 
neighborhood and a savage intercourse might vtherwise render them unfriendly to 
science.” 
Under this leadership an academy was established in Lincoln ‘County in 1785, 
with James Mitchell as principal, at a yearly salary of $100, In 1789 theschool was 
removed to Lexington, and in 1793 was furnished with grounds and a two-story 
brick building by local subscription, Thus was established the famous Transyl- 
vania University, at which through the early years of Kentucky many of the most

celebrated men of the State were educated, and which, after a stormy history of a 
hundred years, seems at last fully established as a flourishing, institution of the 
higher order under the auspices of the Christian denomination. 
There is no recognition of education in the early constitution of Kentucky, and 
although the State continued to donate generous gifts of land and money to institu- 
tions of learning, and schools for elementary instruction were established by 
churches and private enterprise, it was many years before the common-school idea 
of Jefferson had scaled the great mountain barrier that separated the original 
thirteen States from the new Southwest, which, together with Tennessee and Ken- 
tucky, now has spread itself toward the far-off shores of the Pacific Ocean. 
MARYLAND AND SOUTH CAROLINA. 
The States of Maryland and South Carolina, during the memorable twenty-five 
years that followed the breaking out of the war of Independence, made no demon_ 
stration in behalf of universal education that demands attention in this connection. 
In the year 1800 Maryland had a white population of 247,000 and 125,000 negroes; 
total, 372,000. South Carolina contained 196,000 white and 150,000 colored people; 
total, 346,000. Neither of these States placed in its earlier constitutions, poth 
formed in 1776, any recognition of education. Indeed, it was not till the close of 
the civil war, 1864, that the present elaborate provision was made a part of the 
fundamental law of Maryland, under which a system of public instruction for both 
races has been maintained for nearly thirty years. 
But indirectly both these States deserve ‘‘honorable mention” in the great strug- 
gle in the Continental and Confederation Congress that ended with the cession of 
the entire northwest, between the present landmarks of West Virginia and the Ohio 
and Mississippi rivers, first to the Congress representing the thirteen confeder- 
ated States and afterwards to the National Government, and in the subsequent 
dedication of a vast public domain to the education of the whole people west of the 
Alleghenies. 
In the year 1777, at the darkest period of the struggle for Independence, on the 
proposal of a clause in the Articles of Confederation providing that the cost of the 
war should be defrayed out of “‘a common treasury supplied by the several States,” 
the State of Maryland introduced a proposition fraught with the most far-reaching 
consequences not only to the general welfare but to the establishment of the American 
common school as the permanent system of universal education forthe future Repub- 
lic. This proposition reads as follows: “The United States in Congress assembled 
shall have the sole and exclusive right and power to ascertain and fix the western 
boundary of such States as claimed to the Mississippi or South Sea, and lay out, the 
land beyond the boundary so ascertained into separate and independent States, from 
time to time, as the numbers and circumstances of the people thereof may require.” 
Even before this, at the Albany Congress in 1754, the original movement for 
colonial unity, called and greatly influenced by Benjamin Franklin, the same idea 
had taken form in a proposition that the boundaries of all the present colonies 
should terminate at the Appalachian Mountains, and the vast wilderness beyond 
should be open to settlement by ‘colonies of His Majesty’s Protestant subjects.” 
But to the State of Maryland, whick had no personal claim to this unoccupied 
territory, belongs the honor of presenting this issue in the above-mentioned propo- 
sition at the formation of the Confederation, and of standing by it, as the sole con- 
dition of her entrance into this league, until by other methods than she proposed, 
but with even more efficacy, the United States came in absolute possession of the 
“old Northwest,” including the great States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, 
Wisconsin, and a portion of Minnesota. 
It is not essential to this essay to trace this long and deeply interesting discussion 
in Congress which, after eight years, resulted in the famous land ordinance of 1785. 
The most complete account of this is found in the valuable history of the “Old
-P-A-G-E-773
PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE COLONIAL PERIOD 725 
Northwest,” by Dr. B. A. Einsdale, professor in the University of Michigan, and 
the essay on the action of Maryland, by Prof H. Be Adams, of Johns Hopkins Uni- 
versity, Baltimore. Enough to say that by this momentous act the original group 
of thirteen colonies, up to that time loosely held together by a common cause in the 
struggle for independence, liable to be hurled off into a common ruin by the perils 
of the war, found themselves bound together by the common possession of a public 
domain as extensive as the present Empire of Germany or the Republic of France. 
The most reliable of American historians do not hesitate to say that here stepped to 
the front, out of the confusion of colonial contention, the great central idea of 
American nationality that was only established, beyond question, by the resulé 
of the civil war in 1865. For out of this came the establishment of the original 
Confederation of the thirteen States, and thence the formation of the National 
Government. 
The land ordinance of 1785 first introduced three of the most important factors in 
the development of this immense wilderness into the majestic group of Common- 
wealths that now stretch from the Alleghanies to the Northern Pacific Ocean. 
(1.) This entire territory should be divided into townships of 1 square mile, 640 
acres, each. This was the transfer of the New England township system of land 
division, so landed by Thomas Jefferson, who desired to introduce it, too late for 
success, into Virginia at the foundation of the State government. 
(2.) The establishment of a system of accurate land surveys and the settlement of 
the whole country according to the surveyor’srod and line. When we consider the 
indescribable evils that have come out of the old-time careless and fraudulent meth- 
ods of dividing the landed possessions of the original emigrants beyond the Alle- 
ghanies, we can appreciate the declaration of Daniel Webster, that ‘‘in transferring 
her own system of land surveys to the Northwest, New England conferred a boon on 
the nation that entitled her to perpetual remembrance.” 
(3) But the third feature of this ordinance, without which no system of land 
division would have secured this splendid patrimony and the Union from future perils 
impossible then to estimate, was the dedication of the sixteenth section of each town- 
ship for the support of public schools, which has well been characterized as ‘a far- 
reaching act of statesmanship that is of perpetual interest.” For then the American 
common school which, even in its formative state, existed only east of the Hudson 
River, was lifted up into national proportions and therefore assured the opportunity 
“to have free course, run and be glorified” in every community of the American 
Republic through all time to come. 
It is an impressive commentary on the fact that by no one section of the Union can 
be claimed the sole honor of the final adoption of any essential feature of our present 
American society that, while New England did first commence and establish for her 
own especial use the American common school, it is also true that the original idea 
of New England was local and limited, and to the great Middle and Southern States 
must we look for that broad idea of extension of territory which has given to the 
Republic its present amplitude of dimension. To Maryland, therefore, belongs 
the honor, in the Congress of the colonies, of insisting on that common possession 
of the old Northwest, whose logical effect was the accession of Louisiana and our 
Pacific.possessions. And we shall sec hereafter that the same State vainly protested 
against the policy which so long denied to the old Atlantic States a participation in 
this original educational land grant, an injustice which as yet has been only partially 
corrected by the recent dedication of great landed properties on condition of their 
application for agricultural and mechanical colleges, in all the States of the Union. 
SOUTH CAROLINA. 
South Carolina may also claim due honor, not only as to her own representation, 
but as the representative of the entire South below Virginia, through the action of 
her memter, Mr. Kane, her delegate on the committee in the Congress of the Confed-
-P-A-G-E-774
  726 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
eration, whereby the great ordinance of 1787 for the government of the Northwest 
was established. This ordinance was not only the corner stone of the civilization of 
the old Northwest, but the prophecy of the revised Constitution of the United 
States, in virtue of its absolute prohibition of slavery and its idea of perpetual 
* national aid to universal cdueation. 
Thus, at the formation of the Republic, every State was providentially pledged, 
through tho leadership of its foremost men, responding to the common inspiration of 
its foremost people, to perpetual fidelity to the germ of nationality which required 
yet a full century for its completo dévelopment, and will demand another century 
for the revelation of its ultimate destiny as the central and directing power of the 
higher ideal of the Republic which is to be. 
VIRGINIA. 
But, of all colonial movements in the direction of universal education during this 
formative period of American affairs, the precedence must be given to the work of 
Thomas Jefferson and the group of his eminent associates, in behalf of the estab- 
lishment of a complete system of public instruction for the State of Virginia. The 
beginnings of important events which ripen at once into success in tho life of a 
Commonwealth are often less worthy the notice of the historian than the lessons of 
the profound statesmanship which glance along the coming years and proposes far 
beyond what the people are yet ready to adopt. 
Such was the history of the greit movement in behalf of public education, inan- 
gurated in Virginia by Thomas Jefferson in 1779. No plan for the training of Ameri- 
ean youth for American citizenship, all things considered, more complete, better 
thought out, and more wisely adjusted to the growing needs of a new republic, has 
been given to the country. Its only defect was its failure to appreciate the con- 
dition of the ruling planter class of the State, on whose approbation and hearty 
support the success of any schemo of education depended. Within the short space 
of twenty years this great opportunity was offered to the Old Dominion, fiercely 
debated, and enacted as law on the statute book in asbapo intended to insure its 
partial defeat. But this was only the preliminary skirmish of a conflict which, from 
that day on, was always breaking out afresh in the State and gathering new heart 
from every defeat until, at the close of the civil war, in 1870 Virginia at last estab- 
lished a system of public instruction including every feature of Jefferson’s scheme 
rejected almost a hundred years before. 
It could be devoutly wished that the materials were at hand to trace the formation 
of this remarkable system in the mind of the great educational statesman of the 
South from its carliest conception until its appearance, full formed, in the legislaiure 
of 1779, in the thirty-sixth year of its anthor’s life. Something must be a: bed to 
his birth and carly training previous to his appearance at the College of William and 
Mary at the age of 17, Thomas Jefferson was born in 1743. His parental ancestor 
had come to Virginia from Wales before the sailing of the Mayflower. The family, of 
the “middle class,” attracted no attention till the advent of Peter, the father of 
Thomas, who, in 1738, became a considerable landholder on the western border land 
of the colony and married one of the Randolphs. It has been remarked by a recent 
biographer of Jefferson that ‘neither Washington, Jefferson, nor Madison, until 
they became distingnished, would haye been entitled to take rank in tho exclusive 
coterie of the old Virginia families.” But evidently Madam Peter was disposed to 
push her own social claims for all they were worth. Born in the Shadwell Parish of 
London, in the somewhat equivocal language of her great. son, “her family traced

His father’s plantation was out on the western border land of the seacoast and

the northeast. Dut no such opportunity for social education was afforded to Jeffer- 
son as to his greater contemporary, who lived alongside and studied with all his 
anighta fine “object lesson” of British high life inthe colonies in the great-establish- 
ment of Lord Fairfax on the Potomac. Jeterson’s father cultivated a big farm of 
1,500 acres, including the future Monticello and the grounds of the University of 
Virginia. We wasa Virginia militia colonel, a member of tho house of burgesses, 
and, at his death, a rising man in the colony. Te died at 50, leaving Thomas,.a boy 
of 14, student at some little Virginia county templo of the ¢ cs, with the means 
of obtaining an education at William and Mary and afterwards establishing himself 
among his own people. 
Thomas first appears to us in college atthe age of 17, where he studied diligently 
and graduated. During these years he must have been a close observ r of the con- 
dition of the different classes of people, especially in the border region whero he 
lived. He had donbtless thonght long and seriously enisuch matters as the union 
of church and state, the existence of primegeniture and family cntailment of estates, 
and other features of the existing order of socicty against which the masses of the 
people were already chafing with ominous threateningsof revolt. Therapid growth 
of negro slavery in the colony, tho negro clement immediately after the Revolution 
being three-sevenths of the entire population, could not fail to weigh-on his mind 
and heart. And below all theso institutions that faced outward toward far-off 
Europe yawned the deep abyss under ihe foundations of society itself, the fearful 
slough of the colonial illiteracy, into which he never leoked till the day of his death 
without a shudder. 
From such a youth, solemnized by deeply brooding thought and ripened by the 
great family affliction, he was transferred to the heart of the colonial aristocratic 
life, the littlo ‘capital city of Williamsburg. With only 1,000 peuple of all sorts, 
with a group of Government and educational buildings, environed by a straggling 
: village in an all-outdoors surrounding country, it was still the center of the politi- 
cal, social, and educational life of the proudest old colony on the continent. 
Here at-once he found his “‘ fute” in the person of his professor of mathematics-and 
philoswuphy, William Small, who, in the words of his pupil, “probably fixed the des- 
tinies of my life.” He says: “Ihad the incessant wish that I should even beeomo. 
what they (Dr. Small, George Wythe, and Peyton Randolph) were. Under tempta- 
tions and difficulties I would ask myself, What would Dr. Small, Mr. Wythe, and 
Peyton Randolph doin thissituation? What course in it will insure me their appro- 
bation”? Dr. Small afterwards returned to Scotland, and there was of great servico 
to James Watt in the crisis of Lis long struggle to bring the steam engine out from 
the realm of theory to the mighty agency of human civilization it has now become. 
Through bis energetic influence the disheartened inventor was set once more on his 
financial legs.. Dr. Small died just after Watt had made his first suecessful steam 
engine, and one of lis last acts was the drawing up of a petition to Parliament in 
behalf of the invention. His introduction to the financial friend of Watt by Denja- 
min Franklin was another coincidence in the life of that most versatile educator of 
the American people before the establishment of the national life. 
Beside Dr. Small, the foremost representative of good learning in the college, young 
Jefferson was also the close friend of George Wythe, father of tho Virginia bar and 
instructor of John Marshall. He also appears to have becn an intimate associate of 
Governor Francis Farquhar, who represented well the most attractive side of high 
life across the water. In such a notable inner circle all things pertaining to the 
welfare of the Commonwealth, no less than the more profound concerns of religion, 
morality, and education would be gone over, at the instance of ono so restless, rad- 
ical, and mature as the youthful student. The legislature of Virginia was already 
in the threes of the carly conflict with the mother country. 
In one respect young Jefferson did not avail himself of his college opportunities, 
eyen ‘such as they were. Ho seems from the first, and through life, to have «on-

ceived a dislike, ranging closely on disgust, for all metaphysical and ethical spec- 
ulations pertaining to the human side of philosophy. Our modern educators, who 
draw their claborate systems from the rival schools of ancient and modern philoso- 
phy, will bo somewhat at a loss to understand how, under this great disadvantage, 
Jefferson managed to get on paper a practical system of education so well adjusted 
to the needs of all classes of the people of his State that it has survived the indif- 
ference, hostility, and active resistance of a century, and to-day appears virtually 
as conceived by its author in the organized system of public instruction in Virginia. 
At the completion of his college career and of his law studies under Wythe he 
returned to his native county, married in 1772 the daughter of a wealthy lawyer, at 
whose death in 1774 ho found himself possessed of an estate of 5,000 acres, with 52 
slaves and an income, large for that time and country, of $5,000 per annum. The 
seven years of his active professional life, from 1767 to 1774, had brought an unusual 
success, though Jefferson was never esteemed a great lawyer or advocate. He had 
the old Virginia worship for land and the life of a planter, and always half regarded 
the growth of manufactures and cities as hostile to the Republic. 
In 1765, standing in the doorway of the house of burgesses at Williamsburg, 
Jefferson had listened, entranced, to the famous patriotic speech of his old associate 
and friend, Patrick Henry; and, in 1769, became a member of the same legislative 
body at the age of 26. During the next seven years he was swept along by the 
mighty current of events, and in 1776, after the great distinction of the authorship 
of the Declaration of Independence, declined a further seat in the Continental Con- 
gress and returned to his native State as a member of the legislature. Here he was 
to lead in the great work of the transformation of the old colonial Dominion into the 
new Commonwealth of Virginia, which, for a long generation, stood before the world 
as the ‘Mother of Presidents” and, in greater decree than any other, the director 
of the public policy of the United States of America. 
Here, first, does Jefferson appear in the position of a full-grown advocate of uni- 
versal cducation. There were, however, many barriers to be surmounted before 
this, the citadel of the old order, could be stormed. A complete system of courts 
was to be established. The colonial system of entail of property was next assailed, 
and, under the assault of this radical young leader of the people, went down ina 
day, carrying with it, the only “aristocracy” of the old British sort that ever 
existed in America. Primogeniture followed in the sweep of this destructive legis- 
lation. Last of all, the union between state and church, so fruitful of evil through 
the entire life of the colony, and in its later years a perpetual irritation to the 
rapidly increasing body of dissenters, went by the board in 1786, when the bill 
for. establishing religious freedom was finally passed. This remarkable body of 
legislation wrought a change almost as great in the social order and public life of 
the State as the subsequent abolition of slavery at the close of the civil war, a hun- 
dred years later. The transferal of the seat of government from Williamsburg to 
Richmond sealed the fate of the old colonial capital, and the proud new Common- 
wealth began its existence as a ‘‘city seton a hill.” This important legislation was 
inaugurated and most of it completed during the two years of Jefferson’s member- 
ship of the house of delegates. It was, in itself, a record of progressive statesmanship 
which, in connection with his more prominent service as author of the Declaration 
of Independence and member of the Colonial Congress, has been granted by Provi- 
dence to no other man in our country at the age of 36. 
But while the great theoretical philosopher of American democracy had already 
laid the foundations of his future eminence in state and national affairs in the heart 
of the masses of the people, he had waked up in his own State an implacable, hostile 
party among the section of the landed, social, and ecclesiastical aristocracy that 
had been so ruthlessly despoiled of time-honored prerogatives. It was easy enough, 
in the triumphal progress which the remaining thirty years of his public life became, 
to scout at and despise this relentless opposition party at home. But it had its

revenge in postponing for almost a century the final and greatest victory of Jeffer- 
son’s twin policy of freedom and education, and embittered his closing years of 
pecuniary embarrassment at Monticello with the greatest sorrow of his life, the 
failure of his scheme of universal education. 
This plan, as it lay in the mind and was afterwards outlined in the words of its 
author, was a comprehensive scheme, including the abolition of negro slayery and 
the industrial training of the young freedmen for their future, either at home or col- 
onized in Africa. While this feature did not appear in the original bill, presented in 
1779 to the legislature for the education of the people, an amendment to a digest of 
existing laws relating to the slave code was withholden, to be presented at the fit 
time. This statute, the joint work of Wythe, who emancipated his own slaves, and 
Jefferson, who did not, contemplated the freedom of all negroes born of slave parents 
after the passage of the act, and their residence with their parents till the age of 18 
for females and 21 for males, during which they should be instructed, at public 
expense, in a manner somewhat similar to the present system at the Hampton (Va.) 
Normal and Industrial Institute. They might then be colonized as a ‘‘free and inde- 
pendent people,” under the protection of the National Government, while a white 
immigration was to be invited from abroad to fill the industrial gap caused by their 
exportation. 
But here the defeated class threw up its strong line of defense, only to be battered 
down by the cannon of the Republic in 1865. This wasemphatically a home question, 
touching the most vital interest of every planter in Virginia, implying his complete 
transformation to a New York or New England farmer, with all the intolerable con- 
sequences the relentless logic of that change implied. It was in vain that Marshall 
and Washington and the majority of the greatest minds of that period were at heart, 
and after a sort in public, favorable to the policy. It was already too late to assail 
an institution so thoroughly rooted in the habits of the people that only asocial and 
political revolution could tear it out of its place. It was proposed, among other 
theories of the day, that the public lands of the nation should be utilized to bear the 
great burden of this change. But all that was then accomplished was the prohibi- 
tion of the foreign slave trade by the Virginia legislature in 1788, the year before 
its prospective abolition after 1808 by the clause in the Constitution of the United 
States. 
But another barrier to the complete emancipation of Virginia from the shackles 
of colonial dependence on a prolongation of the aristocratic element of British 
society remained to be surmounted, the peril of illiteracy in the lower strata of the 
superior race. 
In 1782 Jefferson wrote his famous book, Notes on the State of Virginia, for the 
edification of M. de Marbois, secretary of the French legation to the United States. 
In that most attractive volume, declared ‘‘a classic” by Humboldt, he argues with 
prophetic wisdom against an undue encouragement of immigration from Europe. 
He takes the ground that in a new country, just embarked in the experiment of a 
government founded upon the most advanced principles of the British constitution, 
reenforced by elements drawn from a broad view of the nature of man, it would be 
a dangerous experiment to mix with the present population a large number of people 
reared in Old World ideas, and who would either adhere to the political views in 
which they were educated or react into the wildest excesses of unbridled freedom. 
He estimates that according to the present rate of increase the 567,614 people then 
in the State, including West Virginia, by the yoar 1862 would reach the number of 
4,540,912, a population greater than the natural resources of the Commonwealth 
could support, nnless the cost of living could be materially reduced. He also 
indulges the hope that by the State prohibition of the slave trade the 270,000 negro 
slaves, at that time nearly one-half of the whole people and increasing faster than tne 
whites, will decrease. ‘‘This will in some measure stop the increase of this great 
political and moral evil while the minds of our citizens may be ripening for a 
complete emancipation of human nature.”

  730 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94, 
Already, in the legislature of 1779, had Jefferson introduced his scheme of universal 
education, accompanied with an amendment for tho gradual emancipation, fit train- 
ing, and subsequent exportation of the slave population, at public expense. Ina 
chapter of his notes on Virginia he outlines the main features of the plan of educa- 
tion for tho white children and youth of the State. This we hero reproduce, as the 
best sketch of the author's ideas, with his plan for its incorporation into the educa- 
tional and social life of the Commonwealth. 
Under “Query 14,” pages 216-221, Fourth American Edition, Notes on Virginia, we 
read: ‘‘Another object of the revisal is, to diffuse knowledge more generally through 
the mass of the people. This bill proposes to lay off every county into small 
districts of 5 or G miles square, called hundreds, and in each of them to establish a 
school for teaching reading, writing, and arithmetic. Tho tutor to be supported by 
the hundred and every person in it entitled to send their children three years gratis 
and as much longer as they please, paying forit. These schools to be under a visitor 
who is annually to chuse the boy, of best genius in the school, of those whose parents 
are too poor to give them further education, and to send him forward to one of the 
grammar schools, of which twenty are proposed to bo erected in different parts 
of the country, for teaching Greek, Latin, geography, and the higher branches of 
numerical arithmetic. Of the boys thus sent in ono year, trial is to be made at the 
grammar schools 1 or 2 years, and the best genius of the whole selected, and con- 
tinued 6 years, and the residue dismissed. By this means 20 of the best geniuses 
will be raked from the rubbish annually, and be instructed, at the public expence, so 
far as the grammar schools go. At the end of G years instruction, one half are to be 
discontinued (from among whom the grammar schools’ will probably be supplied 
with future masters;) and the other half, who are to be chosen for the superiority of 
their parts and disposition, are to be sent and continued three years in the study of 
such sciences as they shall chuse, at William and Mary college, the plan of which 
is proposed to be enlarged, as will be hereafter explained, and extended to all the 
useful sciences. Tho ultimate result of the whole scheme of education would be the 
teaching all tho’ children of the state reading, writing, and common arithmetic: 
turning out 10 annually of superior genius, well taught in Greek, Latin, geography, 
and the higher branches of arithmetic: turning out 10 others annually, of still 
superior parts, who, to those branches of learning, shall have added such of the 
sciences as their genius shall have led them to; the furnishing to the wealthier 
part of the people convenient schools, at which their children may be educated at 
their own expence. 
“The general objects of this law are to provide an education adapted to the years, 
to the capacity, and the condition of every one, and directed to their freedom and 
happiness. Specific det: were not proper for the law. These must be the business 
of the visitors entrusted with its execution. The first stage of this education being 
the schools of the hundreds wherein the great mass of the people will receive their 
instraction, the principal foundations of future order will be laid here. Instead 
therefore of putting the Bible and Testament into the hands of the children at an 
age when their judgments are not sufficiently matured for religious inquiries, their 
memories may here be stored with the most useful facts from Grecian, Roman, 
European and American history. The first elements of morality too may be instilled 
into their minds; such as, when further developed as their judgments advance in 
strength, may teach them how to work out their own greatest happiness, by 
shewing them that it does not depend on the condition of life in which chance has 
placed them, but isalways the result of a good conscience, good health, occupation, 
and freedom in all just pursuits, 
“Those whom cither the wealth of their parents or the adoption of the state shall 
destine to higher degrees of learning, wiil go on to the grammar schools, which 
constitute the next stage, there to bo instrneted in the languages. The learning 
Greck and Latin, I am told, is going into disuso in Europe. I know not what their 
manners and occupations may call for: but it would be very ill-judged in us to follow    
   
-P-A-G-E-779
PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE COLONIAL PERIOD. Wl 
their example in this instance. Thero is a certain period of life, say from 8 to 15 or 
16 years of age, when the mind like the body is not yet firm enough for laborious 
and close operations. If applied to such, it falls an early victim to premature exer- 
tien: exhibiting indeed at first, in these young and tender subjects, the Mattering 
appearance of their being men while they aro yet children, but ending in reducing 
them to be children when they should be men. Tho memory is then most suscepti- 
ble and tenacious of impressions; and tho learning of languages being chiefly a 
work of memory, it seems precisely fitted to the powers of this period, which is]ong 
enough too for acquiring the most useful languages ancient and modern. I do not 
pretend that language is science. It is only an instrument for the attainment of 
science. But that time is not lost which is employed in providing tools for future 
operations: more especially as in this case the books put into the hands of the youth 
for this purpose may be suchas will at the same time impress their minds with useful 
facts and good principles. If this period be suffered to pass in idleness, the mind 
becomes lethargic and impotent, as would tho body it inhabits if unexercised during 
the samo time. The sympathy between body and mind during their rise, progress 
and decline, is too strict and obvious to endanger our being misled while we reason 
from the one to the other. 
‘As soon as they are of sufficient age, it is supposed they will be sent on from the 
grammar schools to the university, which constitutes our third and last stage, there 
to study those sciences which may be adapted to their views. By that part of our 
plan which prescribes the selection of the youths of genius from among the classes 
of the poor, we hope to avail tho state of thoso talents which nature has sown as 
liberally among the poor as the rich, but which perish without use, if not sought for 
and cultivated. But of the views of this law none is more important, none more 
legitimate, than that of rendering the people safe, as they are the ultimate 
guardians of their own liberty. For this purpose the reading in the first stage, 
where they will receive their whole education, is proposed, as has been said, to be 
chiefly historical. History by apprising them of the past will enable them to judge 
of the future; it will avail them of the experience of other times and other nations; 
it will qualify them as judges of the actions and designs of men; it will enable them 
to know ambition under every disguiso it may assume; and knowing it, to defeat its 
views. In every government on earth is some trace of human weakness, some germ 
of corruption and degeneracy, which cunning will discover, and wickedness insen- 
sibly open, cultivate and improve. Every government degenerates when trusted to 
the rulers of the people alone. The people themselves then aro its only safe deposi- 
tories. And to render them safe their minds must be improved to a certain degree. 
This indeed is not all that is necessary, thongh it be essentially necessary. An 
amendment of onr constitution must here come in aid of the public education. The 
influence over government must be shared among allthe people. If every individual 
which composes their mass participates of the ultimate authority, the government 
will besafe; becauso the corrupting the whole mass will execed any private resources 
of wealth: and public ones cannot be provided but by levies on the people. In 
this case every man would have to pay his own price. The government of Great 
Britain has been corrupted, becanse but 1 man in 10 has a right to vote for members 
of parliament. The sellers of the government therefore get nine-tenths of their 
price clear. It has been thought that corruption is restrained by confining the right 
of suffrage to a few of the wealthier of the people: but it would be moro effectually 
restrained by an extension of that right to such numbers as would bid defiance to 
the means of corruption. 
“Lastly, it is proposed, by a bill in this revisal, to begin a public library and 
gallery, by laying out a certain sum annnally in books, paintings, and statues.” 
This idea and plan was adhered to by Jefferson with an almost desperate tenacity 
to the end of his life. In 1821 he wrote to his fast friend and, from the first, colaborer 
in the good cause, Joseph Cabell, on his proposition to retire from public life: 
“T know well your devotion to your country and your foresight of the awful scenes     
       
-P-A-G-E-780
  732 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
coming on her, sooner or later. With this foresight what service can we ever render 
her equal to this? * * * Health, time, labor—on what, in the single life which 
nature has given us, can these be better bestowed than on this immortal boon to our 
country? The exertions and the mortifications are temporary; the benefit eternal. 
* * * J will die in the last ditch, and so I hope you will, my friend. * * * 
Nature will not give you a second life wherein to atone for the omissions of this. 
* * * Do not think of deserting us, but view the sacrifices that seem to stand in 
your way as the lesser duties and such as ought to be postponed to this the greatest 
of all. Continue with us in these holy labors until, having seen their accomplish- 
ment, we may say, with old Simeon, ‘Nune dimittis, Domine.’” 
At this time there was little hope that anything below the apex of the solid pyramid 
of legislation for popular education could be secured. But with all the humiliating 
revelations of the forty years of conflict with the relentless enemies of universal 
education in Virginia, the faith of Jefferson soared above the submission to defeat, 
and ho wrote to John Adams, in 1823: ‘You and I shall look down from another 
world on these glorious achievements to man, which will add to the joys even of 
Heaven.” 
In the first flush of enthusiastic philosophic and patriotic contemplation of the 
possible advantages of universal education Jefferson anticipated all that has been 
achieved and is actually in operation to-day in his own and every State in the Union. 
Julius Melbourne, an educated and worthy colored man, whose Life and Opinions, 
published in 1847, read like a romance, reports a conversation at a dinner at Monti- 
cello, in 1815, in company with Chief Justice Marshall, William Wirt, Samuel Dexter, 
of Boston, and Dr. Samuel L. Mitchell, of New York, in which the retired statesman 
gives full expression, not only to his well-known opinions on the institution of 
slavery, but argues with great cogency against the scientific theory of the natural 
inferiority of the negro race broached by the New York doctor. He stated also that 
“he intended the University of Virginia should be for the instruction of all sects 
and colors,” and experienced deep anxiety for the improvement of the minds of “ our 
colored brethren.” 
"Many of the statesmen of the Revolutionary epoch and the following generation 
were more distinguished for executive faculty in public affairs than Jefferson. It is 
doubtful if, in the functions of the practical statesman, he was equal to Washington, 
who, under his majestic exterior and impressive habit of reticence, was the most 
astute manager of men in the carly days of the Republic. But, certainly, in the 
maryclous appreciation of and sympathy with the progressive element of human 
nature among ‘‘all sorts and conditions of men,” with an undying faith in the final 
triumph of human nature over all its enemies, including its own weakness and sin, 
and in a forward-looking prophetic view of the career of the American people, his 
genius was almost supreme. And in no respect was this genius so profound and 
prophetic as in his ideals and plans for the education of the American people. Inhis 
character as a politico-philosophic educator he was so far in advance of his own time 
that the educational public of no part of the Union has caught up with the full com- 
prehension of what he proposed. The great work on popular education compiled 
from ‘“‘the correspondence of Jefferson and Cabell” has been permitted to fall out of 
print, and the record of the educational services of the great statesman to his own 
State and the nation is practically a blank to nine-tenths of the students in the 
universities and colleges of all the United States. 
The story of the reception of Jefferson’s original plan for the organization of edu- 
cation in Virginia in 1779 is soon told. Even he, with his intimate knowledge of the 
people of Virginia, did not realize that this was the home thrust in the duel between 
«the classes and the masses” which would have ‘‘finished the course” of the great 
consolidated order of society into which the colony had solidified during the expe 
rience of two hundred years. With negro slavery established as an unalterable 
feature of its industrial system, with the old British method of educating the higher

class for governing, with the masses left to the claim of charity and the whim of an 
absolute State for even tho crumbs that fell from the table of knowledge, that side 
of Virginia might well hold itself quite impregnable, with no fear of defeat save in 
an almost impossible revolution. The regulation planter had no idea of taxing 
himself to school his poor neighbor’s children or the family of the energetic farmer 
in the vast northern and western sections of the State. He fought through forty 
years, with an obstinacy that almost broke the heart of the great statesman, to pre- 
vent the establishment of the University of Virginia as a ‘new departure,” pledg- 
ing the allegiance of the State to the higher education, and when conquered by its 
final establishment after the death of Jefferson, captured the institution and worked 
it in the interest of his class until 1865, 
But the most formidable opposition was found, as always, in the clerical party and 
that element of lay churchmen, even more irreconcilable than its educated leaders. 
Of course, the clerical and lay advocates of church privilege had no use for any sys- 
tem of education, high or low, that emancipated the mind of youth from the control 
of Christian education of the ultrasectarian sort. Neither could the clerical and lay 
leaders of the dissenting religious bodies intrust themselves to a State system of 
education, until the complete rupture of the Commonwealth from ecclesiastical 
domination should be assured. To this was added the absolute conviction of a pow- 
erful Janded class and of a corresponding prejudice in the middle estate of a society 
thus organized, of the sole right and duty of the family, aided by the clergyman, to 
educate the child. 
The College of William and Mary from the first opposed the educational scheme of 
its most distinguished son. And this long and bitter controversy between the con- 
tending parties, with the refusal of the corporation of William and Mary to accept 
the proposition of a removal to Richmond in connection with the establishment of 
the Univerisity of Virginia, was the most powerful cause of the gradual decline of 
this venerable institution. Happily, in these latter days, the wisdom of the original 
idea of Jefferson has prevailed, and the College of William and Mary is now enjoying 
a new life, in connection with its departinent of pedagogy, with a larger attendance 
of students than since its foundation. 
For seventeen years, till 1796, the legislature seems to have been under the control 
of these adverse elements. Jefferson’s plan for the emancipation of the slaves, 
which was an integral’ part of his original scheme, was never permitted to appear. 
And it was regarded a wiso policy to ignore the demands of the rising class of peo- 
ple who stood behind Jefferson and many of the foremost men of the State in their 
desire for a practical system of graduated education, including all white youth and 
both sexes, and the dissemination of good literature among the people. But in 1796 
a provisional act was passed by which a majority of the acting justices of each 
county could initiate a system of schools supported. by public taxation. The evi- 
dent weakness of such a law was seen and denounced at once by Jefferson. Of 
course the respectable judicial gentlemen of the old estate did not propose to bur- 
den their order with an imposition so odious as taxation for the schooling of other 
people’schildren, We can not perhaps severely condemn the state of public opinion 
in colonial Old Virginia a hundred years ago, for, under the guise of admitted obli- 
gation to the masses, Jefferson’s school system simply announced a day of doom for 
the ancient order. Of course the law of 1796, as was the intention of its framers, 
fell dead; and the State waited another generation for an approach to the idea of 
educating the whole people of the foremost Commonwealth in the Union. 
Some of our later historians of education have speculated on the consequences of 
this repudiation of the educational scheme of Jefferson by his own State at the 
beginning of the national life. It is suggested that, after all, the Old Dominion 
may well be satisfied with the glorious record of great men developed by the Revo- 
lution, and even the temporary splendor of a social order that was bound up with 
the persistent denial for a century of the fundamental right of human nature ina

Republic—the right of every child toa training for republican citizenship by the 
aid and under tho protection of the Commonwealth. But neither Jefferson, nor 
Washington, nor Wythe, nor Marshall, nor Cabell, nor any other publicist of the 
first class, educated in the stern university of the old colonial life of Virginia, 
entertained this opinion. They all, with one accord, prophesied what did como to 
‘pass from the rejection of the schemo of general cnlightenment offered at tho 
opening lifo of the Commonwealth. Tho failure to realize the population of the 
State, as estimated by Jefferson, was not the least of theso consequences. The 
increaso between 1782 and 1862 did not amount to one-half this expectation, and of 
this increaso the negro contingent was a full third. Meanwhilo, the most valuable 
portion of tho Stato remained only partialiy developed; its boundless resources in 
mines, timber, and water power for manufactures were largely neglected. Tho 
drifting away of multitudes of her most active and progressive young people, whoso 
places wero not supplied either by a reliable home or foreign class of immigrants, 
had, by 1862, built up several rival States out of its original domain. West Virginia 
seceded from old Virginia, for tho Union, at the breaking out of the civil war, and is 
now growing into a powerful Commonwealth, having been estranged by the policy 
of the class that resisted Jefferson to the last. 
As a natural consequence, tho genius and progressive talent educated in the differ- 
entischools of the Old Dominion was constantly attracted from homo to more hopeful 
positions in the Northwest and Southwest. And it does not need that any member 
of that illustrious brotherhood of the fathers should rise from the dead to remind us 
that, had this scheme of universal education been honestly and heartily adopted by 
tho people of Virginia at the founding of the Government of the United States, the 
entire South would have followed, and all the horrors seen in vision by the great 
prophetic fathers would have been averted. There would haye been no more prob- 
ability of such a result as the civil war of 1861-1865 in the South had the masses of 
the people been educated as in many of the States of the Union than that New Eng- 
Jand should have demanded independence to establish a constitutional monarchy 
and a landed aristocracy in response to the “English” yearnings of a class whoso 
exclusivo obscurity is their chief titlo to eminence. But so wasit ordered. But wo 
may all share to-day in that glowing anticipation of tho great educator-statesman 
of Old Virginia, of “joy in Heaven” over the final adoption of his majestic ideal of 
republican society by his own beloved State.          
  THE NEW REPUBLIC AND EDUCATION. 
But now all local and State agitation in behalf of the American common school 
-isfor the time merged in that supreme act of the American people, the grandest 
new departure of that ago of great achievements—the passage of the ordinance of 
1787 for the settlement of tho Northwest Territory and the dedication of a vast 
public domain of the new nation to the sacred use of universal education in the 
States admitted to the Union thenceforth through all coming time. 
Volumes have been written and controversies almost innumerable, like the swarms 
of flying things about the great electric light at a street corner, have raged about 
that master work of carly American statesmanship—the ordinanco for the govern- 
ment of the Northwest Territory, passed July 13, 1787, by tho unanimous votes of 
the eight States then represented in the Congress of the Confederation assembled in 
New York, and confirmed in all its essential features among the earliest acts of the 
Congress of the United States, Angust 7, 178). It is no part of this essay to give a 
detailed account of the long and involved negotiations between Congress and the 
several States concerning tho disposal of the vast uninhabited wilderness beyond 
the mountains, into whoso possession somebody had come by the happy termination 
of the war of independence. Suffice to say that, basing their claims on grounds 
more or less reliable, but mostly running back to the original grants of an imperial 
territory by a home government to successive colonies of Protestant immigrants,

six of these States represented in the Continental Congress supposed themselves the 
owners of immense tracts of unsettled country, extending from the Alleghanies to 
the Mississippi. At this period thero were less than 4,000,000 people in the country, 
98 per cent of whom were distributed along the Atlantic Coast and extending some 
250 miles inland. The remaining 2 per cent er less wero chiefly clustered in isolated 
settlements within the territory of what afterwards became the States of Kentucky 
and Tennessee. Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, 
Virginia, and the Carolinas were the chief centers of population in what is now 
included in the fifteen great States between the Atlantic and the Mississippi. 
Beyond the Father of Waters, Spain was stil. the undisputed mistress of a territory 
more extensive than the entire area of the country wrested from Great Britain in 
the Revolutionary war. 
The formation of the Government of the Confederation during the war hinged on 
the solution of the troublesome question, To whom should this vast unoceupied 
country belong? Virginia, always foremostin the councils of the time, claimed not 
only a present authority over Kentucky, but tho entireregion now occupied by the five 
States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and a portion of Minnesota, 
The claims of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New York overlapped and competed 
with this wholesale pretension. South of Kentucky the Carolinas and Georgia were 
encouraged to prefer their rights of eminent domain over all that is now included in 
Tennessee and portions of Alabama and Mississippi. 
The Statoof Maryland, with no claim of her own, in behalf of other States in simi- 
lar position, made the earlicst and most persistent stand against the absorption of 
this domain by the six Commonwealths. After a long and embittered conflict, in 
which it seemed again and again that tho hope even of a league so frail as the old 
Confederation wonll be wrecked, a reviving sense of patriotism brought in “an era 
of good feeling,” and all the contending parties ceded their lands to the new Congress 
of the Confederation, to be disposed of for the common good by the creation, in due 
time, of new States. 
But now came up the question, equally important and fraught with consequences 
“to tho future of the new Confederation impossible even now to estimate, What will 
the country do with its new imperial annex? It was not then so apparent as now, 
save to the few prophetic minds of tho period, that this looso and jealous club of 
colonies had assumed a portentons obligation in coming in possession of a common 
property so vast that it created acommoa interest which in time would override all 
consideration of arate colonial or extreme State rights. A family that has been 
kept apart for years, or in a state of ‘armed neutrality,” by the obstinate individu- 
ality of all its members, may well be appalled when it suddenly becomes the joint 
heir of a fortune of millions. Each member will think more than once before he per- 
sists in his own selfish interest to the hindrance of the founding of a great family. 
So, as the fortunes of the war varied, and as more than one colony might well bethink 
itself of its own fate in caso of failure, the emerging of this great question, like the 
appearance of a new world first revealed from the western mount of vision, seems to 
haye cooled the heated brains of wrangling statesmen and brought to the front the 
question of nationality as never before. For six years Congress was oceupied, more 
or less, with the question of what to do, especially with a portion of this domain 
some 255,873 square miles in extent, a territory larger than any European nationsave 
Russia, already believed to be one of the favored spots of the earth for the future 
occupation of man. 
ial proposition to Congress for an ordinance for the organization of 
the territory in question was made by a committee, of which Thomas Jefferson was 
chairman. It was quite unlike tho final ordinance of 1787. But the fifth “article 
of compact,” evidently the work of Jefferson, provided that after the year 1890 
negro slavery in all the ten States to be earved out of the Northwest Territory 
should not exist. At that time slavery did exist through the entire extent of the

  736 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
United States, save in Massachusetts, where it had been abolished by decision of 
the supreme court in 1780. The French settlers, the majority of the residents in 
these 265,878 square milles of wilderness, were slayeholders, and the adjacent Ter- 
ritories of Kentucky and Tennessee were already committed to this institution. The 
provision of Jefferson, while it bore new testimony to his lifelong disapproval of 
slavery, was another indication of the flexible political policy which was often the 
enigma of his long and celebrated career. For under this condition, by which the 
institution was to be tolerated during the fourteen years of territorial existence 
before 1800, it would have been practically impossible that it should not have been 
naturalized. As it was, before that date even the Territory of Ohio was greatly 
agitated by the efforts of the already alarmed slaveholders to repudiate the ordi- 
nance of 1787. Gen. William Henry Iarrison, governor of the Territory and after- 
wards President of the United States, became the president of a great organization 
to break the compact, and Jefferson himself favored the toleration of slavery for a 
term of years. But in this, as in the previous collision with the real governing class 
of his own State, he found himself in advance of his time. The clause for freedom 
in his bill was defeated and the remaining portions of the ordinance, though passed, 
became a dead letter. Mr. Jefferson Jeft Congress seventeen days after this action 
for a long residence as minister to France, and had no further direct concern with 
the forming of the fundamental law of this portion of the Northwest. 
On February 16, 1785, Rufus King, of Massachusetts, prepared an article that 
went further than the original proposition of Jefferson. It prohibited slavery in 
all the States formed out of this territory, and made the provision an unalterable 
part of tho compact between them and the thirteen original States. This provision 
slept the sleep of death in committee. 
On April 26, 1787, a fourth proposition was reported to Congress, in a plan of gov- 
ernment for this territory, which contained no reference to slavery, religion, educa- 
tion, civil rights, obligations of contracts, etc., and five days before the passage of 
the final ordinance of 1787 this was the only bill before the Congress of the Con- 
federation in the city of New York. 
At this juncture, as by one of those interpositions of Divine Providence in which 
the believers in such direction of American affairs have abounding faith, a “new 
departure” was taken in the entire attitude of Congress. On July 9 another com- 
mittee, consisting of three Southern and two Northern members, was appointed; 
Carrington and Lee of Virginia, Kean of South Carolina, Nathan Dane of Massa- 
chusetts, and White of New York. Two days later this committee reported the bill, 
which, with the addition of the antislavery clause, accepted as an amendment offered 
by Nathan Dane on July 10, became the famous ordinance of 1787. On the 13th was 
passed this ordinance, which later, with the Constitution of the United States, gave 
to the present Republic its first existence and policy. 
The accepted explanation of this sudden and momentous change of front and the 
unanimous consent of the Confederated States, represented by Massachusetts, New 
York, Virginia, and South Carolina, in its passage of this great charter of republi- 
can government, cven before the formation of the National Union, is the appearance 
on the stage, at the opportune moment, of Dr. Manassah Cutler, a clergyman, 
scientist, statesman, and gentleman of remarkable personal accomplishments, from 
Ipswich Hamlet, Essex County, Mass., as the agent of the first association of reli- 
able people who had appeared before Congress “talking business” about the 
settlement of the Northwest. Previous to this, in 1783, Timothy Pickering, of 
Massachusetts, had drawn up ‘a proposition for settling a new State by such 
officers and soldiers of the Federal Army as should associate for that purpose.” 
Other influential people from the same part of the country, Gen. Rufus Putnam 
among them, had been considering the.same proposition. But ‘the total exclu- 
sion of slavery from the State was to form an essential and uneradicable part of the 
constitution.” Massachusetts, in her constitution of 1780, had abolished slavery,
-P-A-G-E-785

PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE COLONIAL PERIOD. 737 
established public schools for general education, and enacted the most advanced 
code of laws concerning the liberties and natural rights of man, civil jurisprudence, 
and public polity which the world had then seen. No plan of organization could 
have succeeded unless the New England men had felt that they were taking their 
Jaws and institutions with them to their new western home. 
An association had been formed in Boston composed of a large number of the most 
respectable and influential veterans of the Revolution. They proposed, as an open 
door of relief for the prevailing financial depression, poverty, and disaffection of the 
country, that Congress should accept the certificates of indebtedness in which the 
Government was paying its creditors, then worth 12 cents on a dollar, in exchange 
for a great belt of land in the Territory of Ohio, to be at once occupied by a bona- 
fide colony with the intention of establishing a new commonwealth. Dr. Cutler 
appeared at New York with full power to act for ‘‘the Ohio company ” and after- 
wards for a new combination, representing the purchase of 5,000,000 acres in the 
southeast corner of Ohio. For this land $3,000,000 in scrip was to be paid, thus 
representing a real cost of less than 10 cents per acre. 
Here was ‘a condition and not a theory” presented for the first time to this noisy 
debating society, the Congress of the Confederation. The conditions were inexor- 
able, for no immigrating body of New England people would ‘go West” unless they 
could carry along their own New England institutions. They would remove beyond 
the mountains only on condition they could carry there the radical ideas inscribed - 
in the constitution of Massachusetts of 1780. These were: Free soil and expanded 
ideas of freedom in religion and universal education, including the university under 
State control, with other.principles and practices now the commonplace of American 
society but at that time warmly debated even among the foremost minds of the day. 
Dr. Cutler did not appear importunate, New England was not dying to go West; 
was rather indifferent and skeptical concerning this section. Other lands in plenty 
for colonization could be had in half a dozen States cast of the Alleghanies. 
The result was that Dr. Cutler was invited to suggest amendments to the bill. 
He placed in it, as he asserts, and it has now been incontestably proved, the pro- 
hibition of slavery and the memorable clause: ‘‘ Religion, morality, and knowledge 
being essential to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the 
means of education shall forever be encouraged.” With no essential modification, 
as proposed in his draft, the ordinance was passed on July 18, and the good doctor 
returned to Massachusetts to set in motion the first wave of that resistless tide of 
emigration which, in a hundred years, has made the great Northwest the presené 
center and political arbiter of the Republic. 
It is only necessary to glance at the terms of this great ‘‘ compact” to realize its 
importance to the future of the Republic. In its several articles it prohibited for- 
ever slavery. It gave the American common school, including the State University, 
heretofore a Jocal institution, a national indorsement and placed upon it, at once 
and forever, the great seal of national approval. It guaranteed religious liberty im 
its broadest application to a society, itself the best product of the cighteen centuries: 
of Christian education in the civilized nations of the earth. It also asserted the 
obligation of States and Government to favor religion and morality in that generab 
application to public and private affairs without which American society will 
collapse into a hopeless anarchy. It provided for the obligation of contracts—the 
first time such a provision was found in the fundamental law of any civilized 
country. It forbade primogeniture, affirmed the right of habeas corpus and triak 
by jury, a proportional representation in the legislature, judicial proceedings 
according to the course of the common Jaw, with all the guaranties of our presené. 
advanced ideas of government. All were included in principle, and some of them 
expressed in the language of the constitution of Massachusetts. The provision 
that, before all others, has made the American Republic what it is, the guaranty of 
universal education by public aid, had always been the common habit of New Eng- 
ED 94 47

land and was her greatest contribution to the life of the new Union that only a few 
weeks later was born in the adoption of the Constitution of the United States of 
America by the convention in Philadelphia. 
Along with this ordinance a part of the legislation that gave it effeet was the pro- 
vision in the land ordinance of 1785 that assigned the sixteenth section of each town- 
ship, containing 640 acres, for public education. By the insistence of Dr. Cutler, as 
tho condition of the Ohio purchase, there was inserted the additional provision of 
two additionai townships of the State for a university, and one for the support of an 
educated ministry. The provision for the support of religion seems to have been of 
little effect. But the great endowment of education by the gift of one thirty-sixth 
of the entire area of this vast territory was the corner stone on which, first, the old 
Northwest, and afterwards, the entire Union from the Alleghanies to the Pacific 
Ocean, has built up its comprehensive system of education, including every grade 
from the little country district school to the university for academical and industrial 
education. Under this magnificent endowment, unprecedented in human history, 
nearly 60,000,000 acres of land for common schools, besides 1,000,000 acres for uni- 
versity uses, have been given to the States of the Northwest and Pacifie Coast, with 
additional money endowments to the States from the act of 1890; and to the whole 
body of States not less than 140,000 acres. The States admitted to the Union after 
its formation, with populations largely built up of emigrants from foreign lands, have 
been able by this means to put on the ground, at once, such a provision for popular 
instruction as no other nation in the world at present enjoys. 
But we shall greatly mistake if we claim for any one man, however efficient at the 
last event, or any section of the country, the sole or even the chief honor for this 
great victory of universal education over its numerous and powerful enemies in 1787. 
Neyer before that eventful week had the friends of the new American common school 
found a common ground upon which they could work together for good. Under 
the conditions then and for many succeeding years existing in all the eight States 
beyond the Hudson River it was impossible to establish anything like a satisfac- 
tory system of public instruction for all classes and conditions of people. But here 
was a new world, a vast empire, awaiting the coming of new generations—the morn- 
ing land of the new republic. Here, as by common cousent, what could not be done 
elsewhere could be achieved. Without the consent of the nine of the thirteen States 
which were slave-holding, and none of them public-school Commonwealths, no one 
of these features of the great ‘‘compact” could have been included in the ordinance 
of 1787. But all united, save one member, to vote in the ‘‘good time coming” to 
mankind. 
No other explanation can be found of that remarkable fact, without which Ameri- 
ean history will remain a perpetual puzzle, than this: That, in every colony of the 
original thirteen, great masses of the people, represented by the wisest leaders of the 
old American life, believed in and were determined to obtain the precious boon of 
education for their children. It was finally obtained by the nnanimous consent of 
all the original States. Here is the one satisfactory explanation of the people’s 
real intent, that, in 1787, before the Constitution of the United States was formed, the 
confedcrated thirteen American States dedicated to education, in the only territory 
over which they had exclusive control, an endowment of public land such as never 
has been given by any other people since the world was made. 
Here, then, is the upland from which the new educational departure in American 
life is to be made. Here is prefigured the ideal of Republican institutions, the gos- 
pel of American Democracy, embodied in the immortal words of this ordinance, set 
up like a beacon light for the guidance of the nation through the stormy passage yet 
before it in the long years to come,

CHAPTER XVII 
ROBERT CHARLES WINTHROP AND THE PEABODY 
EDUCATION FUND FOR THE SOUTH, 
By Rey. A. D. Mayo, LL. D. 
The death of Robert Charles Winthrop, in Boston, Mass., November 
16, 1894, has called forth a great variety of notable memorial tributes 
from the press and the various public and private associations with 
which he had been connected during his long and laborious life. It 
only remains that a more extended notice than has yet been given to 
his services in what may fitly be called the department of educational 
statesmanship should be added to this long procession of eloquent 
commemoration. The sole purpose of the present essay is the attempt 
to place this, in his own estimation by far the most interesting and 
influential of his numerous and important contributions to the “general 
welfare” of the Republic, in its proper relations. And my excuse for 
undertaking this work is that for the past fifteen years my own lot 
has been cast in a ministry of education through all our Southern 
States, no week of which has failed to bring me in contact with the 
powerful and beneficent work of the Peabody Education Fund, with 
which the closing twenty-eight years of the long life of Mr. Winthrop 
were identified as the president and animating spirit of this organiza- 
tion for the blessing of a whole section of the country and a benedic- 
tion to the Republic. 
We shall see that by family descent, by personal aptitude, culture, 
and environment this great and good man would be found among the 
foremost in the long line of the public men of his State and section in 
that general service to education which is perhaps the most decisive 
test of a genuine American statesmanship. But the service I com- 
memorate is of a far more radical and comprehensive quality. It was 
after the voluntary retirement of Mr, Winthrop from a distinguished 
political career, which had only received a temporary check during the 
turbulent years before the outbreak of our civil war, at the age of 57, 
amid surroundings which were a great temptation to a dignified retire- 
ment from all public labors and responsibilities, that he was summoned 
by George Peabody as confidential friend and adviser in what was then 
the greatest series. of personal benefactions ever made to education 
and still remains the most memorable public demonstration in history 
by a private citizen in behalf of national peace and good will. It was 
indeed a “red letter day” in modern civilization when George Pea- 
739

body, sitting in the hall of Robert C. Winthrop’s beautiful home in 
Brookline, Mass., under the portrait of Benjamin Franklin, the educa- 
tor of the central American colonies for the war of Independence, 
opened his leather wallet and brought forth, one by one, the documents 
and securities of the proposed donations to education in his native 
land, involving, with their subsequent additions, an expenditure of 
nearly $10,000,000, and invited his old friend to be henceforth his 
“alter ego,” adviser, and most responsible administrator of the greatest 
of all these donations. Well might even a man already so generously 
adorned with public honors and private regards as Mr. Winthrop 
declare with prophetic enthusiasm: “This is the greatest honor of my 
life.” From that hour he gave himself, heart and soul and mind and 
strength, to this mighty work of national reconciliation on the line of 
_ education, through the twenty-eight remaining best years of his life. 
And at the close he declared that he regarded the work to which he 
had been thus providentially called the most important service he had 
been able to render to his country. 
As in all the highest things done in this world, the superior element 
of this service was personal. Here was the one man, so fashioned by 
honorable descent, by broad general culture, by eminent social rela- 
tions and easy pecuniary estate, by long and valuable public service in 
the critical years of the national life, and perhaps by the widest per- 
sonal acquaintance of any American with famous people at home and 
abroad, by close and familiar contact with the inner life of universities, 
charitable and historical associations, and, above all, by an intelligent 
and invincible faith in the American system of universal education, 
that in looking across the sea it is no wonder that George Peabody saw 
his venerable forehead lifted above all others as the true yokefellow 
in his inspired charity for American children and youth. 
But even this remarkable outfit of qualifications for such a position 
would have failed of the result without the personal peculiarity of this 
man, at once so positive and resolute in his ideals and in his dealing 
with affairs, so generous and forbearing, so consecrated to liberty and 
union, and yet so tactful and honorable toward all who had, by the 
terrible fate of civil war, seemed for a time arrayed in implacable hos- 
tility to both, so immovably fixed in his confidence in the American 
common school as the corner stone of American society, and yet so 
courteous, appreciative, and patient toward communities and people 
which for two centuries had not included it in their scheme of educa- 
tion. It must have been in recognition of this personal quality in his 
ancestral line that the friends and neighbors of the old Winthrops in 
the mother country placed on the tablet above the family tomb in 
Groton church, Suffolk: “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall 
be called the children of God.” 
We have here no controversy with that “science of history ” which 
leaves out God and man as motive powers, and remands human life to

WINTHROP’ AND THE PEABODY FUND. TAL 
the dreary monotony of an upward fatalistic evolution of inevitable 
events. But if there was a God in our Israel in the days of the 
fathers, He is our God to-day; never more abundantly manifested 
than in the history of the development of the American common 
school in the sixteen Southern States of this Republic during the 
past thirty years. And if any men of our “grand and awful time” 
can fitly be named as “coworkers with God,” it is that committee of 
forty-eight, the trustees, agents, and educators of the Peabody Educa- 
tion Fund, of which the illustrious brotherhood, George Peabody and 
Robert Charles Winthrop, were the acknowledged head, and of which 
Barnas Sears, Dr. J. L. M. Curry, Eben Stearns, and William H. Payne 
for a generation have been members. 
This service of Mr. Winthrop consisted, first, of an intimate relation, 
so constant and confidential that its details can never be known, with 
Mr. Peabody during the few closing years of his life, and, after his 
death, of the acknowledged headship of the administration of his 
magnificent benefaction, Although George Peabody, from his wide 
acquaintance in our country and remarkable practical knowledge of 
men, was able to nominate the original sixteen trustees of his fund and 
to indicate the general lines of operation in its use and distribution, yet, 
from the nature of the case, he must have depended largely on Mr. 
Winthrop at every step of the details of the organization, the selec- 
tion of the indispensable executive agents, the methods of approach to 
the Southern communities, and the most effective way of distributing 
a fund apparently so large and yet so easy to be set adrift downstream 
in a freshet of sentimental, sectarian, or patriotic charity. 
It was Mr. Winthrop who sought out and almost “laid violent hands 
upon” President Barnas Sears, of Brown University, Rhode Island, as 
the first agent of the organization, and who encouraged Dr. Sears to sum-. 
mon Dr. Eben Stearns to a new lease of life, more crowded with splen- 
did success than all that went before, in the first mastership of the 
Peabody Normal School. It was Mr. Winthrop who, with admirable 
recognition of the best educational traditions of the State of Tennessee 
and the city of Nashville, married this first great normal school of the 
South to the old university projected by Dr. Lindsey, and by him held 
up with marvelous courage, faith, and sacrifice through a long and 
anxious life. It was Mr. Winthrop who, even before the death of Dr. 
Sears, had, at his suggestion, fixed his eyes on Dr. J. L. M. Curry, who 
began his public life in the legislature of Alabama as an advocate for 
the public school and, at the close of the war, like so many of the ablest 
leaders of the Confederacy, had retired to a college professorship and 
p®esidency, as his probable successor. Mr. Winthrop had, with Dr. 
Samuel Green, of Boston, shouldered the entire responsibility of admin- 
istering the Peabody Education Fund during Dr. Curry’s two years’ 
absence as minister at the Court of Spain, that he might return to his 
most honorable position as agent both of the Peabody and Slater  
-P-A-G-E-790
742 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
educational funds of the South. It was Mr. Winthrop who earnestly 
cooperated in bringing Dr. William H. Payne from the University of 
Michigan to Nashville as the successor of Dr. Stearns. It was he who, 
from first to last, insisted that the Peabody Fund should be solely used 
for the education of all the children of the South in the American com- 
mon school and, when the income of the fund proved insufficient to 
continue the work of subsidizing many schools, pleaded with Congress 
and the country for that national aid to education, especially for the 
overcoming of Southern illiteracy, and, on the failure of that, cooperated 
so vigorously in concentrating the benefits of the fund on the training 
of teachers for the new common schools of the South. And all this was 
done as the genuine expression of an intense and patient consecration 
of himself to this great and good work, whereby he exalted the private 
citizen of Boston to a position of educational statesmanship, in its 
ultimate results second to that of no man during the years since the 
elose of the war of brothers sent for the punishment of our national 
transgressions and to assure the perpetual union of American States 
in a Republic such as was never before known in the annals of mankind. 
We use the phrase “educational statesmanship” advisedly, for in 
our country it has a peculiar significance, and, like the common school, 
is one of the most characteristic features of our order of republican 
society. The schoolmen of different sections of the Union are in fre- 
quent controversy concerning the real origin of the common school 
that now, after a steady growth of two hundred and fifty years, has 
become a vital part of the organization of every State and Territory 
and is more and more regarded as that stone so long “rejected by the 
builders” of the national life, only to become “the head of the corner.” 
Of course, no human institution so beneficent and so comprehensive 
in its influence as the American common school ever sprung full grown 
from the brain of any great educator or was finally developed by any 
people save through the experimenting and varied experience of many 
years. There had been free schools established by the clergy of great 
churches, the gifts of benevolent individuals, the governments of feudal 
towns, and exclusive guilds and associations of private families, in all 
civilized lands, before the Pilgrims came to Plymouth Rock. Even 
they, though abiding for eleven years in Holland, the country that up 
to that date had done the most for popular education, were so little 
impressed with what they saw abroad that for many years no public 
school was established in the original Puritan colony. The public 
schools of Manhattan Island, under the Dutch régime, were church 
parochial schcols, subsidized by the trading company that for sixty- 
eight years misgoverned the valley of the Hudson and finally collapsed 
by the revolt of its own worried and exasperated people. 
For the first time in human history the whole responsible people of 
the two leading New England colonies, Massachusetts and Connecticut, 
voted to establish schools fashioned somewhat after the style of the 
English free schools of the day, but, in their case, the true children of

the people. If there is anything that can reconcile us to the persistent 
religious bigotry of the early settlers of New England it is the fact 
that under that tremendous and peculiar régime, where a set of the 
most obstinately individual people on God’s earth agreed to live 
together as a church that kept all outsiders “ out in the cold, 4 what we 
call the “religious question” never came up as a hindrance to a system 
of popular education. Every American colony beyond the Hudson was 
so distracted by. its cosmopolitan and sectarian religious conformation 
that it was impossible that any general scheme for schooling the chil- 
dren together could be adopted. But in Massachusetts and Connecti- 
cut the people, with the exception of an insignificant minority, for 
almost a century were practically of one mind about their church 
affairs, and were at liberty to plant deep and strong the radical idea 
of New England life, that the responsible people of a community should 
make the church, make the state, and make the school. 
The old-time New England parson, the scarecrow of all the small 
children of the rival churches, was simply a minister, elected to his 
place for life, but dependent on his people for his living and every 
opportunity of usefulness, from the first kept in his own somewhat 
expanded sphere by a public opinion that no ecclesiastic was strong 
enough to permanently withstand. The Massachusetts and Connecti- 
eut colonies were from the beginning virtual republics, by open pro- 
test or indirect policy holding the civil and religious domination of the 
mother country at arm’s length for one hundred and fifty years. 
The common school of New England was from the beginning a peo- 
ple’s school. John Winthrop, first governor of the Massachusetts Bay 
Colony, contributed generously with Vane and Bellingham to found 
the first schools in Boston. At once the neighboring settlements “‘fol- 
lowed suit” and schools were established by the voluntary contributions 
of the people, reenforced by a rate imposed on everybody who would 
not contribute. The whole scheme was clinched by the original series 
of the laws of 1647, compelling every family to school its children and 
every town of sufficient population to support a free school to fit boys 
for the university. Governor John Winthrop, the American ances- 
tor of Robert C. Winthrop, by a speech in the general court, secured 
the appropriation of a sum larger than all the remaining colonial 
tax to found the college that later became Harvard University. Te 
contributed a collection of books, was one of its fast friends, and, 
under his administration in the various high positions occupied by 
him the first school legislation of Massachusetts was enacted, which 
was the real beginning of the present American common school. The 
same result followed the administration of the “two Johns,” both gov- 
ernors of Connecticut, son and grandson of John Winthrop. 
Before the war of the Revolution that colony could boast of what no 
American State to-day can affirm—that there was no illiteracy within 
its borders. 
The one essential feature of the American common school, which 
 
-P-A-G-E-792
  744 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
differentiates it from the great European systems of public education, 
is this: That it is a school “‘of the people, by the people, for the people.” 
The legal voters of the community establish a school system for all the 
children. They pay for it and make it free or otherwise; send their 
children; choose its officers and teachers; through an elective board 
arrange all. the details of its organization, instruction, and discipline, 
and supervise it through officials responsible to themselves. An 
American State legislature is only an elected and temporary commit- 
tee of the whole people, its only function in education being every year 
to respond to the public opinion of its masters. 
The common school, thus established, is the animating soul of our 
entire scheme of American universal education, beyond itself, indi- 
rectly but inevitably, modifying and molding all private, corporate, 
and parochial organizations, academic, industrial, professional, and 
wsthetic. Because of this, like our government and order of society, 
it only grows with the people, and may reach conditions of success 
impossible to any rival system, however complete, but with a narrower 
base, in other lands. 
Out of this radical organization there naturally grows up an educa- 
tional public, apart from the teachers and professional educators, who 
in former times and still in other countries maintain an almost des- 
potic control of the entire realm of education. In every community in 
the United States, however benighted or enlightened, I find this edu- 
cational public, the superior people of every class, race, religion, and 
condition, who believe in the American system of universal education 
and are determined that in this respect ‘the Republic shall receive 
no harm.” They are the people who insist on the schooling of all chil- 
dren for American citizenship; persuade or force the community to 
support public schools and agitate for their constant improvement; 
insist that the best of its kind is “none too good” for the humblest 
child destined to the loftiest earthly position—sovereign citizenship 
in the world’s chief Republic; take the responsibility to “revise and 
correct” the educational schemes of professional ecclesiastics, scholars 
and schoolmen; and, by a roundabout common sense and knowledge 
of the necessities and capabilities of the.community at any given time, 
decide finally what shall be done. 
As representative of this educational public there has grown up 
in every American community an office, not sharply defined, but none 
the less inevitable, which we may call educational statesmanship. It 
appears in public life, in legislature and Congress, where the ability is 
demanded to formulate the people’s will in any special direction con- 
cerning education. But its most effective development is not unfre- 
quently found outside of politics. Indeed, partisan politics is. one of 
the most dangerous enemies of the American common school. Oftener 
than otherwise, the true educational statesman is found in some influ- 
ential, broad-minded, persistent man or woman citizen whose life is
-P-A-G-E-793

consecrated to the education of the community into right ideas con- 
cerning this the most vital moving power of the State. 
Herein is one of the chronic failures of the teaching class, sometimes 
even of the most eminent educators, to understand the “ true inward- 
ness” of the educational system of which they are a part, and no 
observer of American affairs from abroad has fully comprehended it. 
For it is the most characteristic feature of our American system of 
universal education, through all its complex and comprehensive organ- 
ism ‘working together for good,” that it can not be dominated by a 
professional class of any sort. The priest, the politician, and the 
teacher are only its representatives and ministers. In the last resort 
it is the decision of the educational public, representing the whole peo- 
ple, itself represented by the educational statesmanship of any portion 
of the land, which determines the organization and sets the gauge for 
the practical ongoing of the people’s school. 
It seems little short of a special providence that George Peabody was 
born and until early manhood lived in New England, the home of this the 
most peculiar development of the national life. All his own education 
he owed to the country and village district school of the Massachusetts 
of nearly a century ago. But so impressed had he been by what came 
to him there that, although his fortune and fame were acquired in that 
portion of his own country where this system of schooling was not 
established, and in England, which has not yet built on the final foun- 
dations of public education; yet when he came to make his splendid gift 
for the children of the South, he tied it up with conditions that made 
it practically impossible it should be used in any other way than it was. 
In nominating his original board of trustees he not only provided for 
a fair representation of the New England, Central, Western, and South- 
ern States, but selected the sixteen men that, by their high character 
and exalted position, would be above all suspicion either of incapacity 
or self-seeking, and would be eminent representatives of the educa- 
tional public I have described. 
Without the little country district school of New England, in the 
earliest years of the Republic, there would have been no story of this 
sort to be told. George Peabody, born in the part of the old town of 
Danvers, Essex County, Mass., which now bears his own name, on 
February 18, 1795, came into the world that faced the average New 
England boy of a hundred years ago. His ancestry was good, but his 
family poor, and his only education was in the district school of the 
day. But no university ever left on its fondest graduate a stronger and 
more affectionate remembrance than that same old time New England 
country district school, as every thoughtful man there taught, thrashed, 
and persuaded into self-knowledge and self-help can testify. 
At the age of 11 he was apprenticed to the seminary next in value 
for a student of American life, an old-time New England country store, 
where the clerk was expected to do all sorts of work and face all sorts 
 
-P-A-G-E-794
  746 “EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
of people in selling all sorts of merchandise, from a “point of ile,” a 
jug of New England rum, and a gallon of ‘them molasses” up to a 
farmer’s ax, “a pound of Epsom salts,” and the outfit of a rural 
bride. He “came, saw, and conquered,” and, at 14, like so many 
“down East” boys eager to “go West,” compromised a while on Ver- 
mont, returning to Newburyport, Mass., without a dollar. He drew in 
the same harness well nigh through his “teens,” till he was “burned 
out.” 
Invited then by his uncle, he moved to Georgetown, D. C. There 
we find him what we now call the “traveling man” of a firm of mer- 
chants in that little city, and afterwards as the active partner of a 
larger establishment in Baltimore, where his first $5,000 was made. No 
better “training school” for a successful man of affairs could be found 
thanthemiddle and border Southern States—Pennsylvania, New Jersey, 
Maryland, Virginia—of those years, all of which were traversed by 
this indefatigable -young fellow, year after year, bent on traffic and 
studying men and things as only young George Peabody could “take 
them in.” He shouldered arms in the war of 1812 as a home guard in 
the siege of Washington. His first earnings went to his mother, and 
one of the last uses of his great wealth was to build and consecrate a 
beautiful church to her memory, in her native town, with the annex of 
a generous gift for the general welfare of the place. By 1827 he was 
found, like Ben Franklin before him, in London, where at last, in 1837, 
he was established as a broker and general operator in exchange, and 
there his great fortune of $15,000,000 was made. 
All this time he remained an American of the enlarged New England 
type—his name never in the London directory, but himself broadened 
and enriched by contact with other parts of his own and residence in 
foreign countries. He tells us that from his early manhood he con- 
templated the use to which he finally devoted two-thirds of his fortune. 
In well-known public and in many private ways he manifested his 
affectionate and practical interest in his countrymen. But it was after 
the age of 50, during the remaining twenty years of his life, that his 
most notable benefactions were made. Like the modest gift of Dr. 
Franklin, whose donation to Boston at his death is now rising in a 
great public institution for free instruction in mechanical trades, George 
Peabody gave to London, in 1852, a sum of $2,500,000, which, he esti- 
mated, with careful handling, would, in two hundred years afford sub- 
stantial aid to two-thirds of the industrious poor of that vast world- 
receptacle of mingled splendor and misery. 
Then began his gifts to his own country; first to his native town, 
then to the city of his early adoption, in the splendid “Peabody Insti- 
tute,” of Baltimore. In a memorable interview with Robert C, Win- 
throp, after long correspondence, in October, 1866, he opened his budget 
of blessings, culminating in his donation of $1,000,000, besides an addi- 
tional $1,500,000 in the securities of a Southern State, for the education

of the children of the South, with a list of sixteen life trustees to attend 
to its management and distribution. A subsequent visit to America, 
the year of his death, completed this romance of magnificent munifi- 
cence, he leaving to the Peabody Education Fund another $1,000,000, 
with the expectation that the more than a million and a half additional 
in the paper of the two States that afterwards failed to return the 
clasp of the hand held out in behalf of the children would become 
available. The public benefactions of Mr. Peabody amount nearly to 
the great sum of $10,000,000, while $5,000,000 were used, as he said, 
_ “to make everyone of his near relatives rich.” 
One of the conditions of the Southern gift had been that Mr. Robert C. 
Winthrop should be the permanent president and Hon. Hamilton Fish, 
of New York, and Bishop McIlvaine, of Ohio, the first vice-presidents of 
the board of sixteen trustees; thus including the Eastern, Central, and 
Western States in the organization of this large national trust. 
Certainly no man in America was better qualified in every way than 
Robert C. Winthrop for this presidency. Born into the upper realm of 
the New England social estate, he was, by inheritance and family tra- 
dition, a natural friend of education. His American ancestor, John 
Winthrop, first governor of Massachusetts, through his entire colonial 
life of eleven years, had a hand in everything called education in that 
little colony of the better sort of English folk more than two bundred 
years before. During his administration the foundations of the Ameri- 
ean common school, from the country and village district to the State 
university, were laid in the new colony. And of that other notable 
organization of a broad and free Christianity, although a born ehureh- 
man who never withdrew his respect from his spiritual mother, the 
New England Congregational Church, the child of the people, he became 
a faithful and influential member, not infrequently a preacher of remark- 
able power. His son, John Winthrop, jr., and another descendant of 
the family, both governors of Connecticut, were not behind their father 
and grandfather in the same good work. Another member of the family 
became a noted professor of Harvard College, esteemed as one of the 
foremost scientific men of that early day. Like all these old families of 
New England, worthies and unworthies, the house of Winthrop blos- 
somed out, until its record includes a roll as honorable as any in the 
land. 
Robert Charles Winthrop was born in Boston in 1809. He told me 
of the escape he and the occupant of the adjoining seat in the 
National House of Representatives, Mr. Robert Barnwell Rhett, had 
from exchanging places in the then two representative hostile States 
of the Union, Massachusetts and South Carolina. At an early period 
the father of Winthrop removed to Charleston, S.C. One of Mr. Win- . 
throp’s brothers, I understood, was born, lived, and died in that city. 
The parents of Mr. Rhett, if they ever carried out their purpose of 
going to Boston, returned in time to save their famous son. from becom-

ing an Abolitionist of the Wendell Phillips type. Whether Mr. Win- 
throp could have been entirely changed from the broad and thoughtful 
conservatism of his nature, even by birth and residence in the Palmetto 
State, is questionable, though he might well have become the same sort 
of man as his friend, the ideal planter, governor, and publicist, Hon. 
William Aiken, afterwards a zealous and life-long member of the board 
of Peabody trustees. 
At an early age young Winthrop had begun to climb the ladder of 
old-time Whig statesmanship, whose foot for twenty years rested on 
the threshold of every promising well-born son of Massachusetts. He 
was graduated from Harvard at 19, studied law three years in the 
office of Daniel Webster, and was admitted to the bar at the age of 
22. At 25 we find him in the legislature of Massachusetts, where he 
remained for six years, becoming the speaker of the house of repre- 
sentatives of the “great and general court” of his State in 1840. At 
the age of 31 he represented Boston in Congress, where he remained 
for ten years. Once elected Speaker of the National House of Repre- 
sentatives, he was defeated for reelection, after a desperate struggle of 
three weeks, by 3 votes. He was appointed to a seat in the Senate of 
the United States to fill the unexpired term of Daniel Webster, who 
had been promoted to Secretary of State, in 1850, and met his first 
rebuff at home in the effort to secure a reelection to the Senate— 
defeated by the test of the rising political antislavery sentiment of 
Massachusetts. He should have ended his public career, like his great 
ancestor, as governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and only 
. failed because the present method of election by a plurality vote had 
not then been adopted. 
It must have been a great deal more than a disappointment and dis- 
gust over the uncertainties of a political career that determined the 
final retirement of Mr. Winthrop from public station in 1851, at the age 
of 42, for he was a devoted friend of the Union during the civil war, 
and up to 1864 an occasional advocate on the platform of the conserva- 
tive candidates for the Presidency. It is intimated, and doubtless 
true, that at different times he had offers of high public position. But, 
happily for his city, his State, and his country, he had already found 
his way to that highest upland of American life, where, recognized as 
“the first citizen” at home, he found himself promoted to the most 
honorable position in the Republic—educational statesman out of 
office. Here, lifted above the contentions, triumphs, and defeats of 
politics, he could preside at the making of the citizenship of the new 
Republic and in the inauguration through half the Union of that 
great agency of popular education, the common school, without which 
our actual “liberty and union” becomes only the dim and distant echo 
of those far-resounding names. 
Through all these years he was taking the elementary “course of 
study” which would graduate him later into the presidency of the

“ WINTHROP AND THE PEABODY FUND. 749 
Peabody Education Fund. For twenty-five years he was president of 
the Boston Provident Association, one of the most reliable of the many 
charities of that charitable city. For thirty years he was president of 
the Massachusetts Historical Society, and its archives bear learned and 
eloquent testimony to his faithful labors there, including his valuable 
biography of John Winthrop. For eight years he was president of 
the alumni of his alma mater, “Fair Harvard,” and always a most 
devoted son of the firstborn of our great American universities. He 
was chairman of the overseers of the poor of Boston, and in many 
good ways a laborious citizen of his native city. He naturally stepped 
into the chairmanship of the board of commissioners charged with the 
erection of the Boston Public Library building in 1858. Now, this insti- 
tution, on stepping into its spacious new home, with its collection of 
more than 600,000 books, has become only second to the National 
Library at Washington. 
All this while his eminent gift of noble and inspiring oratory was at 
the command of every good cause, ready to pay tribute to every supe- 
rior man. It is said that he pronounced no less than 150 memorial 
orations or eulogies upon as many eminent Americans, besides others 
commemorating celebrated men of other lands. The four collected 
volumes of his addresses and speeches will always remain a model for 
that style of public address. At the founding of the Winthrop Com- 
mon Schoolhouse in Boston he spoke noble words concerning the price- 
less heritage of New England to the Republic, the common school. © 
One of the most eloquent and discriminating of the many important 
addresses called forth in New England by the great revival of popular 
education, under the leadership of Horace Mann, was Mr. Winthrop’s 
admirable oration before a library society in Boston in 1838, entitled 
“Free Schools and Free Government.” It contained a definition of 
education that should be printed as a “broadside” and hung up in every 
normal school in the land. At a gathering of farmers in Hampshire 
County, Mass., he outlined the policy of agricultural education now 
everywhere in operation, and paid this eloquent tribute to the common 
school: 
  Other nations may boast of their magnificent gems and monster diamonds. Our 
Kohinoor is our common-school system. This is our ‘‘mountain of light”; not 
snatched, indeed, as a prize from a barbarous foe, not destined to deck a royal brow, 
or to irradiate a crystal palace, but whose pure and penetrating ray illumines every 
brow and enlightens every mind and cheers every heart and every hearthstone in 
the land, and which supplies from its exhaustless mines ornaments of grace unto the 
head and chains upon the neck of every son and daughter of Massachusetts. 
At the dedication of the Boston Public Library he anticipated what 
has since become a commonplace of educational policy, the union of the 
free library with the common school, whereby Massachusetts now has 
placed a free school library before 90 per cent of all the children of the 
‘State. 
His commemoration addresses on Webster, Bowdoin, Franklin, J. Q. 
 
-P-A-G-E-798

Adams, and numerous other notable characters of his own generation 
were models of that often most dreary realm of oratory. He was the 
orator at the beginning and completion of the National Washington 
Monument, first by position and afterwards by invitation of Congress. 
And, above all, I rank his matchless address at the centennial celebra- 
tion in Yorktown, Va., in October, 1881, which should be printed for 
* “supplementary reading” in history in every American school. These, 
with great numbers of addresses and other interesting papers, declare 
him one of the most versatile and instructive public speakers and 
writers of his day. 
Dr. James Walker, greatest of the old-time parson presidents of Har- 
vard, said to me, “The oration will die with Robert C. Winthrop.” 
Indeed, of this superb Yorktown oration it may almost be said—what 
Wagner writes of the ninth symphony of Beethoven—that here the 
summit pinnacle of music had been scaled and hereafter the musical 
drama, the marriage of all the fine arts set to music, was only possible. 
The oration before a cultured or popular audience, or even as a belated 
intruder in the national Senate, is now but a reminiscence. The place 
of the orator is to-day occupied by the man who, with his mind crowded 
with the facts and weighty reasons of his theme, takes his hearers into 
his confidence and leads them on, through every agency of instructive, 
persuasive, and magnetic speech, to the irresistible conviction at the 
close. 
And all this time was Mr. Winthyop one of the best beloved and 
honored men in the true “upper ten” of his own and other lands; and 
his last volume, “written for his grandchildren,” is a delightful record 
of such an acquaintance with the most eminent people of many countries 
as probably no other American can boast. 
So there was no mistake made when George Peabody took Robert 
C. Winthrop into his confidence on the autumn day when he sat in his 
hall at Brookline, under the portrait of Benjamin Franklin, and 
unfolded the inspiring record of his own contemplated beneficence in the 
way of “aid and comfort” to education; a benefaction still for thought- 
ful charity, variety, and practical utility unrivaled even by the maguifi- 
cent bequests of which it was the precursor and often the suggestion. 
George Peabody knew the man of whom he said, two years after the 
organization of the trust, “Mr. Winthrop, to whom I am so much 
indebted for cordial sympathy and careful, consistent, and wise coun- 
sel in this matter.” Deliberate words, every one “a word of truth and 
soberness.” 
At once Mr. Winthrop recognized that he had heard his divine 
“call” and declared with prophetic foresight, “This is the greatest 
honor of my life.” Indeed, what reward can be given to any man 
more grateful and more weighted with high responsibility and grand 
opportunity than, at the end of an honorable public career, to hear the- 
summons to the perpetual service of neighborhood, State, or nation, 
 
-P-A-G-E-799

with a standing commission from the people to labor in the school, the 
church, and the charities that so ennoble our age and are the real 
motive powers of the highest national life? No member of that illus- 
trious group of Peabody trustees, however great may have been his 
former services and distinctions, but must have felt that this was 
indeed the richest honor and most precious opportunity for beneficent 
and influential work in his career. It was reserved for one of this 
body to solve our old civic puzzle, “ What use has the country for an 
ex-President of the United States?” Rutherford B. Hayes retired from 
one of the purest and most useful administrations of that supreme 
American office only to step upward, hand in hand with his admirable 
wife, into a no less eminent career of laborious and helpful service in 
behalf of education, charity, and all things included in the religion of 
the Golden Rule, the Lord’s Prayer, the Beatitudes, and the Sermon on 
the Mount. 
On a memorable day, February 8, 1867—the board of Peabody trus- 
tees held its first meeting, in Willard’s Hotel in Washington. It is 
recorded, as one of the many spectacles and occasions of which a noble 
gallery of educational memorial pictures might be painted, that this 
meeting was opened with prayer by the venerable Bishop Mellvaine, 
while General Grant knelt beside him in humble supplication to the God. 
of all the children. Another picture might well be George Peabody and 
Robert C. Wintrop, seated under the portrait of Benjamin Franklin, 
taking high counsel together in behalf of Young America. Still 
another, when, at a meeting, about the year 1870, in the city of Hous- 
ton, Tex., called in behalf of education, in the midst of aimless and 
inconclusive debate, a plain, elderly, stranger gentleman arose and 
asked permission to speak, announcing himself as Barnas Sears, and in 
a voice scarcely above a whisper (for he was a victim of the “great 
American catarrh” through his entire first visit to this then distant 
land) told the people that he was the agent of the Peabody Education 
Fund and would be happy to supplement any appropriation for a com- 
mon school, free to all the children, to the extent of one-third its cost, 
and thus notably assisted at the beginning of the now rapidly expand- 
ing public-school system of that most extensive of the United States. 
Still others, a succession of memorable pictures, commemorating the 
death and burial of this man, of whom Victor Hugo wrote, ‘On the earth 
there are men of hate and men of love; of the latter is George Peabody,

funeral oration by Robert C. Winthrop, president of the Peabody Edu- 
cation Fund. The donor had said, in a voice trembling through happy 
tears at his final gift of $1,000,000, at Newport, “This I give to the 
suffering South for the good of the whole country.” Well might George 
Peabody say, at the dedication of the Peabody Institute at Baltimore, 
“May not this institution be a common ground where all may meet, 
burying forever differences and animosities, forgetting past separations 
and estrangements, weaving the bonds of mutual attachments to the 
city, to the State, and to the nation?” Supported by the blessed faith 
in God and in the Son of God, “who took little children in his arms 
and blessed them,” this childless man wrote these words, “Education, 
a debt due from the present to future generations.” On his death bed 
he said, “It is a great mystery, but I shall know all soon.” Well 
might the solemnities of that memorable funeral at Danvers be closed 
by the impressive words of Mr. Winthrop, ‘‘ And so we bid thee fare- 
well, brave, honest, noble-hearted friend of mankind.” 
It would be por unprofitable and discourteous here to seheinain 
the history of the Peabody Education Fund, now in preparation by its 
agent, Dr. J. L. M. Curry, probably to be issued in 1897 at the close 
of the thirty years named in Mr. Peabody’s original communication, 
whereby at that date two-thirds of the trustees are empowered to 
appropriate the bulk of the funds to such educational institutions or 
agencies as then may approve themselves as suitable beneficiaries. 
But time enough has elapsed to reveal to the educational public of the 
whole country the wonderful influence of this unique organization of 
national beneficence upon the South and the profound significance of 
its policy to the future of the whole United States. 
In estimating this influence, the establishment of schools and the 
distribution of the income of the fund, already amounting to nearly the 
entire original available sum, leaving that untouched, with the plant- 
ing of what Mr. Winthrop loved to call “our great normal college at 
_ Nashville,” are of subordinate importance. They are at best revela- 
tions and illustrations of the central policy of a board of management 
without question the most eminent and widely representative of the 
true educational public of the country ever gathered and held together 
for an entire generation in the United States. 
At the late memorial meeting of the Massachusetts Historical Society 
Mr, Charles Francis Adams suggested that the true place of Mr. Win- 
throp would have been the presidency of a “great national academy,” 
similar to the European organizations of that sort. But if the Old 
World civilization of the last five hundred years has ever presented 
the spectacle of sueh a private consecration of large possessions to the 
educational and charitable uplift of mankind on two continents as that 
of George Peabody; or if any body of men, on the whole representing

of education in a dozen great Commonwealths in the industrial, public, 
and social condition of our Southern States at the close of our civil 
war; orif even the splendid personality of Mr. Winthrop, decorated 
with the gorgeous regalia in’ which the Old World still delights to 
envelop its superior official class, would have seemed more venerable 
than in his own continuous, modest presiding over that illustrious 
group of gentlemen, the trustees of the Peabody Education Fund, I am 
unable to comprehend the significance of the past century in the march 
of human events. 
The appointment of the original body of trustees and the arrange- 
ment for its continuous life was in itself a master stroke of educational 
statesmanship by Mr. Peabody. So wisely and well was this arranged 
that probably there has never been in any country a working board, 
intrusted with great educational funds, that represented so varied and 
in almost every person so eminent an array of high character, ability, 
and large experience in affairs, combined with distinguished station. 
Here have been found three Presidents of the United States, two Chief 
Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, and several dis- 
tinguished members of the State judiciaries; famous military men, both 
of the Union and Confederate armies; Members of Congress, Cabinet 
Ministers, two bishops of the church, financiers like Drexel and Morgan, 
mayors of cities, and a generous representation of that most reliable 
class, the men of substance and character identified with the educational 
progress of their own localities. 
Indeed, the majority of these men had been or were then in exalted 
public station. The Army and the Navy were represented by Grant and 
Farragut; the law by Evarts and Clifford; business by several of the 
most conspicuous financiers of the land. The ideal Southern planter 
was found in Governor Aiken, of South Carolina; the Northern and 
Southern retired gentlemen of cultivated proclivities by Eaton, Brad- 
ford, Russel, and McAllister. It was only at a later period that the 
professional educator appeared, in the person of the distinguished 
president, D. C. Gilman, of Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore. 
And it is a remarkable fact that such a board, composed of men bur- — 
dened with great affairs, living widely apart, has never in its thirty-three 
meetings, extending over twenty-eight years, failed of a quorum. The 
President of the United States, Mr. Cleveland, on one occasion tele- 
graphed to New York that, although detained at the capital by imper- 
ative duties, he would come if necessary to the transaction of business. 
Mr. Winthrop, appointed by Mr. Peabody as permanent chairman of this 
“great school committee,” was never absent but three times from his 
post—once when detained abroad by sickness in his family and twice 
almost held by force at home by the insistence of physicians and friends 
on account of the infirmities of age. : 
Perhaps the most powerful and perpetual significance of the life of 
the Peabody board of trustees has been in this, that it has demonstrated 
ED 94——48  
-P-A-G-E-802
  754 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
to the satisfaction of the people of the South and of the whole country 
that only along the educational line of operation has there been or can- 
there be surveyed and built the grand highway of sectional reconciliation 
and national unity in American affairs. We have only praise for the per- 
sistent and self-sacrificing efforts of the educational missions, established 
and supported through the expenditure of many millions of dollars in 
the South by the various Christian churches of the Northern States 
during the past generation, especially for the general uplift of the col- 
ored folk. But, by the nature of the case, these religious bodies were 
forced to somewhat antagonize their corresponding Southern organiza- 
tions and for years to work under a cloud of misapprehension. Sectional 
reconciliation along the ecclesiastical lines of operation has not been and 
can not be an immediate or permanent success. It hardly required the 
prophetic foresight of men like Governor Andrew, of Massachusetts, in 
1866, President Hayes in 1876, and others of the higher type of states- 
man for the past quarter of a century to anticipate the certain failure 
of any partisan political policy to unite the people of all the States. It 
is a chronic delusion of the average leader of the industrial interests 
of the country that money is the only real bond that holds the nation 
together. But below all the material interests of mankind, in the awful 
depths of our mysterious human nature, slumber the terrible animal 
forces, the furious passions, ambitions, and blind elemental powers 
that rock society in periodical earthquakes or overwhelm nations in 
the hot lava or tidal wave of revolution. The experience of mankind 
points to but one successful line of approach along which the “men 
of good will” and the women of true love can proceed with hope of 
permanent success in a condition of affairs such as prevailed in our 
Southern States when George Peabody, under the October sun, went 
out to Brookline to unfold his plan of the reconstruction of the Repub- 
lic, bearing gifts “to the suffering South for the good of the whole 
country.” e 
And what a magnificent success has been scored by this act of edu- 
cational statesmanship, amid the trials and failures of the past thirty 
years. That Dr. Barnas Sears, a New England man, obnoxious to the 
leading Southern people on every line of his political creed, an eminent 
leader of a rival religious sect, proposing a system of universal popu- 
lar education hardly thought of before except in the original plan of 
“Thomas Jefferson, and rejected as the prime educational heresy by 
the State of Jefferson for two hundred years—that he, as agent of the 
Peabody Fund, should have gone through all these States, meeting every 
order and condition of their people without a jar, everywhere welcomed 
by the superior class in city and Commonwealth as a new commentary 
on the Old Scripture, “‘How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet 
of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace,” is one of the 
marvels even of our marvelous American history. The record of the 
almost unanimous testimony of the progressive leaders of Southern
-P-A-G-E-803
WINTHROP AND THE PEABODY FUND. 155 
education is like reading the Sermon on the Mount upon the deck of a 
vessel, storm tossed and in imminent peril of going to the bottom of 
the sea. 
But all this was only the new American commentary on the old 
Hebrew prophet, “A little child shall lead them.” In these years of 
material and spiritual prostration, poverty, discouragement, and exas- 
peration the hearts of all good men and women through all the South- 
land turned from the almost unendurable present to the baby in the 
cradle, the little children crowding the home, the boys and girls driven 
to the edge of a premature manhood and womanhood by the snarling 
of “the wolf at the door.” From all that was disheartening and hope- 
less in private and public affairs, they looked upward, as the hapless suf- 
ferers on earth, to the group of rejoicing saints and angels in the upper 
sky in Raphael’s mighty canvas, to this association of remarkable men, 
the foremost in the land, representing all sections, every creed, and 
varied stations in life. They were solemnized by the closing scenes in 
the life and death of their great benefactor, and they took out a new 
lease of hope, pride, and energy for the coming days. 
With the comment of my own ministry of education through every 
State of the South, now these fifteen years, I have just read through 
the four volumes which contain the sayings and doings of the managers 
of the Peabody Education Fund, from their first meeting in Wash- 
ington, February 8, 1867, to their ia assembly, October 5, 1894, when 
the final words of their honored president were read. And I asa 
entreat every public man, every right-minded citizen inclined to 
despond concerning American affairs, to “go and do likewise.” I do 
not envy any man, however “wise in his own conceit,” who can get up 
from a careful reading of that record without profound gratitude and® 
thanksgiving to the God of nations that, in this providential way, the 
people of the whole country have had before them an “object lesson” 
of the way to heal the wounds of the nation and bind the hearts of all 
men in a union such as nowhere else has been seen. 
It was indeed a most significant response to the almost unanimous 
action of the old Congress of the Confederation, dedicating the six- 
teenth sections of the vast wilderness of the national domain to the 
schooling of the children, a hundred years before. If for nothing else, 
the Peabody Education Fund would be splendidly justified in its 
adwinistration, by inaugurating the policy of reconciliation on educa- 
tional lines through the thirty perilous years of the opening era of the 
new Republic. 
It is difficult for the educators of our great Northern States, ban 
and nurtured in the faith in the American common school as the heart 
of the American system of universal education, to realize what a sig- 
nificant and profoundly influential step was taken when, at the sugges- 
tion of George Peabody, the trustees of the fund indorsed the idea of 
its sole use in the education of the children and youth of the South in  
-P-A-G-E-804
  756 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94, 
the American common school, organized, disciplined, instructed, sup- 
ported, and supervised by the whole people, free to all who come, 
reaching from the little plantation primary to the State university. 
George Peabody had passed his entire manhood in States and coun- 
tries which had not yet adopted this arrangement for the training of 
the children and youth through intelligent, moral, and efficient man- 
hood and womanhood. Perhaps all of these trustees were college- 
bred men of the period when the academy and university held their 
heads high above the country district school. Several of them were 
from States, localities, and surroundings hitherto indifferent or hostile 
to such an experiment. But happily they were all men of large obser- 
vation and experience in the real life of the American people. So 
when the question came up, How shall this gift to the suffering South 
for the good of the whole country be used? they gravitated, after 
deliberate consideration, to the conclusion to lay the broad founda- 
tions of the American common school, first in its elementary depart- 
ment, where even to-day 90 per cent of American children obtain their 
only education from books and teachers, and proceed onward and 
upward as time and experience might dictate.” 
This should be an impressive warning to all people, however “supe- 
rior,” who are. now plotting against the people’s university, that when 
the real common sense and the most enlightened, reliable, and patriotie 
public opinion is brought to bear on any or all the plans for overturn- 
ing, undermining, or essentially reconstructing the American common 
school, the result will always be like a Northern April sun playing 
upon the drifts of a belated April snowstorm. The drifts will dissolve 
and disappear in a slough of slime and slush, but the April sun will _ 
* shine on. 
Again was the rare wisdom of that notable “school committee” 
abundantly demonstrated when the real ‘““American Academy,” of which 
Robert C. Winthrop was perpetual president, indicated by its own 
example the true method of educational administration. “It put down 
its foot, for good,” on the road, worn broad and solid by the American 
educational public, that the American system of universal education 
is never to pass from the control of the whole people, acting through 
their own chosen representatives. The air is full, even to-day, of elab- 
orate plans for transferring the responsibility for the education of the 
20,000,000 American children and youth from the old-time church and 
priesthood to the new domination of despotic chiefs, self-perpetuating 
boards, or cliques of expert scholars. All those schemes would be fail- 
ures if attempted, and none of them will ever become a fact. 
But the policy of the Peabody trustees also reaffirmed the growing 
idea of the American educational public, in turning to the highest expert 
ability of the land for the details of organization, discipline, and instrue- 
tion, all that concerns the datly and hourly going on of school life in 
every community. As by anirresistible intuition, Mr. Winthrop turned
-P-A-G-E-805
  WINTHROP AND THE PEABODY FUND. T5T 
to President Barnas Sears, of Brown University, Rhode Island, scholar, 
divine, professor, university president, State superintendent of common 
schools, as the one man who could most fitly go forth to the Southern 
people bearing the message of “peace and good will,” clothed in the 
simple garb of the children’s common school. Dr. Sears called Dr. Eben 
Stearns, from what seemed to him an ideal position at the close of a 
long and laborious life, to come to Tennessee and once more engage in 
the founding of the first normal school for the teachers of an entire 
section of the Union. No two men in the country were in all ways 
better fitted for the work in hand. As scholars and schoolmen of 
national reputation they commanded the respect of the highest culture 
and most competent educational leadership in all these Southern States. 
By lifelong service they had been in constant contact with the people’s 
common school in its original home. They were, above all, the two 
men to hold fast to their own “high calling” of a people’s schooling 
with a holy obstinacy that would challenge martyrdom; yet, conserva- 
tive, cautious, conciliatory by nature, culture, and experience, they 
were willing to wait for peoples, cities, and States to come round and 
appreciate what they had in store for the children’s good. 
From the first, there was the most complete sympathy between the 
board of trustees and these admirable men. Mr. Winthrop said of 
the original plan of operation drawn up by Dr. Sears: “It was a 
perfect chart of our course, as the writer of it has proved to be a per- - 
fect pilot.” Dr. Sears himself put the whole philosophy of the “new 
education” into one sentence, in his address to the Virginia constitu- 
tional convention in 1868: “The object of the Peabody Education 
Fund is free schools for the whole people, neither more nor less. We 
have nothing in view but what is comprised therein.” : 
As an object lesson of the perfect working of the American system 
of universal education, under the absolute control of the whole people, 
administered in all its details by an expert corps of tried and experi- 
enced officials, this policy of the board of Peabody trustees was of 
inestimable value to the new schools of the section where its work 
was done. It quietly waved aside the sectarian priest, the partisan 
politician, the high-stepping social magnate, and the narrow-minded 
schoolman, and called the people, represented by their most reliable 
men in hamlet, city, and State, to assume their rightful oversight of 
this, the most precious American heritage. 
At the same time it labored in season and out of season to build up 
in the home field a genuine professional class of teachers and educa- 
tors, competent to face the vast and increasing needs of these sixteen 
American Commonwealths. 
And as an indispensable condition of this achievement, in the selection 
of the four remarkable men, without whose professional and administra- 
tive ability the whole scheme would have been a failure, we note another 
display of executive wisdom. It was fit that the first general agent
-P-A-G-E-806
  158 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
and first master of the Peabody normal school should be selected from 
the group of tried and best-known educators of the State that gave to 
the country George Peabody and Robert C. Winthrop. Here were two 
men, representing New England and New York, where the American 
system originated, and where, in 1866, it had reached its highest success. 
But when their places were to be filled by their successors, it was just 
as fit that the general agency should be held by Dr. J. L. M. Curry, a 
man who by birth, culture, and public career represented both the old 
and new orderof Southern affairs. And when the place of Dr. Stearns 
was vacant, it was just as evident that his successor, Dr. William H. 
Payne, should come from the State of the great Northwest, Michigan, in 
which, at that time, the American common-school system in allits grades 
was perhaps most completely illustrated. Soshould every section of the 
new Republic have its fit representative in the administrative force of 
this wise and beneficent scheme. 
Even more conspicuous was the wisdom, so rare even to-day in the 
educational dealing of the North with the South, displayed by the 
board in its method of approach to the part of the country it was 
commissioned to assist. It would have been “as easy as preaching” 
to have gone to these States with a loud and indignant proclamation 
of the imminent danger to which they were exposed by their almost 
entire destitution of suitable arrangements for schooling the masses 
of their people. The personal letters and reports of Drs. Sears and 
Stearns for the first ten years revealed a condition in this respect that 
drew from Southern educators and statesmen, hike Governor Hugh 8S. 
Thompson, of South Carolina, a cry of apprehension on the verge of 
despair. In State after State, in city after city, a fourth, a third, some- 
times almost a half of the people above 10 years of age were found in 
ignorance of letters. The streets of the villages and the wide spaces 
of the open country were swarming with untaught children and youth 
wandering “as sheep without a shepherd.” The old system of the 
secondary and higher education, brought over from the mother country 
a century before, for the schooling of the children of the well-to-do 
folk, was greatly broken down by the war, and there was nothing yet 
established to take its place. No considerable body, even of the more 
intelligent people in those States, ever realized the full extent of this 
peril from the lack of the elementary instruction of the coming genera- 
tion of Southern children, from 1866 to 1880; and by reason of a some- 
what sensational and often distorted and exaggerated publication, the 
educational public of the North was in even a lower depth of mis- 
information. 
But of all this we heard little from these men who, of all others, were 
best acquainted with the actual condition. They had other work to 
do than the vain effort to bring 15,000,000 people to the ‘anxious 
seat” by parading their needs before mankind. And they counted 
safely on the sufficient knowledge of the Southern educational public 
as a fulcrum for the educational lever they proposed to put under the .

  WINTHROP AND THE PEABODY FUND. 759 
‘mudsills” of every State. So they appealed to the Southern people in 
the only way by which any community deserving of help and competent 
for cooperation must be approached by anybody proposing to do them 
a service in a matter so complex and vast as the training of their chil- 
dren for citizenship in our American Republic. 
They called to their attention that George Peabody, and Robert C. 
Winthrop, and Barnas Sears, and Eben Stearns, and Dr. Curry, and 
William H. Payne came to them as the representatives of an illustrious 
official company of the foremost men of the Union, representing all that 
was most inspiring and memorable in the educational history of their 
own past. They did not forget to remind Virginia of Thomas Jeffer- 
son, still chief among American educational statesmen in and out of 
office; of the illustrious company of the Revolutionary fathers and 
their broad plans for the education of the white people and the eman- 
cipation of the slaves; of the leadership of Maryland and Virginia and 
the cooperation of the entire old Atlantic South with the entire North 
in the original consecration of public lands to the common and superior 
schooling of the people of the new Northwest, the first record of asimi- 
lar action in history. They reminded the Southern people that for one 
hundred years this idea of universal education had never for a day 
been absent from the minds and hearts of its greatest public men— 
indeed, that almost every eminent publicist of the South had put on 
record his profound conviction of the imperative necessity of such an 
adaptation of the American system as was possible under the present 
order of society. 
They reminded the people of North Carolina that their State was one | 
of the earliest in the South to move in the establishment of the higher 
education, and had come nearer an effective system of public schools 
in 1860 than any other State below its border. They rehearsed again 
the heroic fight of old Dr. Breckinridge for the preservation of the 
school funds of Kentucky, whereby the children of that Common- 
wealth are to-day enjoying increasing opportunities for free education. 
They recalled the repeated efforts in South Carolina and Louisiana to 
establish a working system of popular instruction; the setting apart of 
a magnificent land fund for the children by the wise founders of the 
Republic of Texas; the persistent labors of Governor Brown in Missis- - 
sippi and of Lindsay and his associates in Tennessee to the same end. 
They did not forget how young Curry had labored in the legislature of 
his own State in similar fashion; and they told anew the story how the 
State superintendent of schools in Alabama, at the breaking out of the 
civil war, traveled and slept with the records of his office, as the old 
monk stood by his precious missal, through the dreary and dreadful 
days of the French Revolution, in the Cathedral of Rouen; and they 
did not forget that Baltimore, and Charleston, and New Orleans, and 
Louisville, and St. Louis, and other important cities had built up the 
common school before 1860. 
They encouraged the republication, “with note and comment,” of the  
-P-A-G-E-808
  760 _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
splendid appeals of Dr. Thornwell, of South Carolina; the eloquent and 
racy address of Governor Henry A. Wise, of Virginia; the prophetic 
report of Dr. Edward Joynes, in The Last Days of the Confederacy; 
and they pointed to the volumes of Southern legislative documents, 
appeals, resolutions, speeches, and sermons that of themselves consti- 
tute a copious educational literature during the years before the civil 
war out of which could be gathered to-day a library most valuable for 
the instruction and inspiration of the whole American people. And 
they understood why it was that all this did not eventuate in the estab- 
lishment of the common school in the South before 1860, outside a few 
cities, and its partial adoption by three of the States. 
They sympathized with the mass of the plain white people of the 
South, who for one hundred years had, in their own half-conscious and 
ineffectual way, pleaded for the better education of their children. 
They heard the loud cry, as from the depths, of the emancipated race 
for the Bible and the “blue-back spelling book” as the assurance of 
security and success for their new-found freedom. 
Happily, out of the sore deprivation and mortal necessities of these 
States from 1866 to 1876 came the providential opportunity to origi- 
nate the American common school. The old-time prosperous families 
could no longer educate their children in expensive private schools, 
send them abroad, or tutor them at home. All things in the South 
pointed to a new era in the education of the people. Dr. Sears reported, 
after his earliest visits, that he found a remarkable unanimity of feel- 
ing on the necessity of a new departure, and everywhere met the 
responsible class of people ready to be convinced. He had but little 
money to give, scarcely a third of the expense of establishing a school 
anywhere, and that only asa temporary subsidy. But at the end of 
eight years he reports a practical agreement among the influential 
classes of the Southern people to establish the common school as a per- 
petual and vital element in the State. 
Every Commonwealth soon had a common-school organization, more 
or less effective. Two million children were enrolled in the new 
schools. Twenty-four cities and 200 villages, at first assisted by the 
fund, had soon been able to get on without it, and were supporting the 
graded system of public instruction free to all classes and both races. 
Included in this multitude were half a million of the children of the 
freedmen, for whom their white neighbors were and are still taxed, 
substantially to pay the cost of education. Never was there a more 
triumphant vindication of the wisdom of the policy of encouragement, 
inspiration, appeal to the higher public opinion of communities and 
States to wake out of their sleep and clothe themselves anew in the beau- 
tiful garments of intelligence, prosperity, and power, than this admin- 
istration of the Peabody Education Fund, adhered to for thirty years, 
till, by the common consent of the educational public of the entire 
country, it is now recognized as the one safe and sure plan in “building 
for the children of the South.”
-P-A-G-E-809
  
WINTHROP AND THE PEABODY FUND. 761 
And not only along these broad lines of educational policy, but in 
the method of using the gift at its disposal, did the Peabody board of 
trustees, from the first, under the acknowledged leadership of Mr. 
Winthrop, move on to a complete and unexampled success. The fate 
of large educational funds in all portions of our country during the 
past century has too often been a warning and a discouragement to 
the most generous giver. Large as it appeared, the entire gratuity of 
George Peabody was little more than the annual present school 
expenditure of the city of Boston, and barely half the educational 
budget of the New York and Chicago of today. How it was so 
managed that a sum as large as the original endowment has been 
already expended, while the original $2,000,000 is still “in the bank,” 
ready in two more years to be used in the endowment of such institu- 
tions as may best be entitled to it, is a lesson to all administrators of 
public or donated funds for the benefit of the children. 
This policy finally included three separate and progressive steps. 
First, it demonstrated that in our country popular education is not 
best promoted by subsidizing a school “ within an inch of its life,” thus 
destroying all sense of personal and corporate responsibility and demor- 
alizing childhood and youth by an indiscriminate and extravagant 
ministering to its wants. Every intelligent boy in an American common 
school knows that, at “one and twenty,” he will be compelled, according 
to his means, to support and become responsible for the system of 
public education by which he is now receiving his best outfit for a 
successful life. In 1866 the Southern people still lingered too much in 
the old conceit that even in a Republic “taxation is tyranny.” It 
would have been easy enough to demoralize these communities, even 
by an unwise distribution of the sums at the disposal of the Peabody 
trustees. So they struck the true American idea to show the people 
what could be done in the matter of public education, by well-placed 
specimens of good common schools at strategic educational centers; 
contributing for a brief period to their establishment and trusting to 
the common sense and practical energy of the people in due time, of 
themselves, to support their own system of instruction. 
For twelve years this policy was followed, with remarkable discre- 
tion and astonishing success. In 1880, on my first visit to the South, 
I found these public schools everywhere acknowledged models and 
centers of light. Their boards of education were composed of the 
leading men of the community, who gave character to the movement 
and from the first assured its success. It would be impossible to 
make a Northern public fuily understand the enthusiasm I witnessed in 
scores of villages and cities, extending to the ‘whole region round- 
about,” awakened by the strange and beautiful spectacle of all the 
children “‘ going to school together,” instructed, disciplined, and inter- 
ested in a way that had never been known before ‘‘in the memory of 
the oldest inhabitant.” Of course, mistakes were made, and some of 
these ventures came to naught. But I am certain that no $2,000,000
-P-A-G-E-810
  762 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
has ever been handled to better effect than this sum actually expended 
in the past twenty-eight years as the income of another $2,000,000, in 
subsidizing the new common school of the South. ; 
Nobody claims that this great good work was done without that 
hearty cooperation of the various forces essential to that style of 
achievement. It has been the work of the Southern educational pub- 
lic, aroused to its imperative needs, released at last from the dark curse 
that for two hundred years had bound these Commonwealths with a 
chain more grievous than the shackles of the slave, awakened to the 
natural activity and practical executive energy of every free and pro- 
gressive Anglo-Saxon people. But no one agency has scored so deep 
a record in this splendid achievement as the work of the Peabody edu- 
cation fund, under the direction of its board of trustees, led by its 
devoted president; its decisions being enforced and often greatly 
determined by the wise counsel and admirable administration of its 
agents, themselves honorary members of the organization. 
Then, as the desperate needs of the South in this respect became ~ 
more and more evident, Dr. Sears urged the necessity of national aid 
to Southern education. A very able and conclusive report was made 
to the board by Hon. A. H. H. Stuart, of Virginia, as chairman of a 
committee of which Chief Justice Waite and William M. Evarts were 
the remaining members. 
This report was indorsed and made the basis of a memorial to Con- 
gress, prepared by Dr. Curry, presented at three sessions, and enforced 
by him in public speeches, appearances before Congressional commit- 
tees, and by that persistent lobbying for righteousness and humanity 
which is at the bottom of most of the good things done in public affairs. 
Mr. Winthrop espoused this idea with all his heart and soul and 
strength. For ten years he never failed to call attention to it in his 
annual address to the board, and this beneficent organization was one 
of the most influential of the numerous agencies enlisted in its behalf. 
Well did he say: t 
The welfare of our whole country is at stake in the education of its children. Tho 
free common schools are essential to any worthy or rightful citizenship of our Repub- 
lic; illiteracy degrades the dignity of the clective franchise, and exposes it to unjust 
manipulation and suppression ; universal suffrage is a farce, and may prove a tragedy 
without universal instruction; ignorance anywhere is danger everywhere; the 
safety of our institutions demands imperatively that every man who has a vote 
should be able to read it, and write and understand it; slavery is but half abolished, 
emancipation is but half completed, while millions of free men, with votes in their 
hands, are left without education. 
First, under the lead of Hon. George F.:-Hoar, the House of Repre- 
sentatives, and afterwards the Senate of the United States, under the 
lead of the venerable Senator Justin S. Morrill, of Vermont, rose to the 
occasion. Finally, under the brave and persistent advocacy of Hon. 
Henry W. Blair, of New Hampshire, seconded by a noble demonstra- 
tion in behalf of the common school by the most distinguished Senators
-P-A-G-E-811
  WINTHROP AND THE PEABODY FUND. 763 
from the ex-Confederate States, in a debate beyond comparison the 
most memorable for broad and patriotic sentiment of any since the 
close of the civil war, the Senate, at three successive sessions of Con- 
gress, passed a bill that would have advanced the entire condition of 
affairs in the South twenty years. Oh, that. Robert C. Winthrop had 
then, through one session, sat in the Speaker's chair of the National 
House of Representatives, to “pack” the Committee on Education 
and Labor and secure to its report in behalf of the children its “right 
of way” to an inevitable enactment into righteous and beneficent law! 
But when that great hope expired the board of Peabody trustees 
unanimously agreed to concentrate the decreasing income of the fund, 
for several years not $75,000 and at best rarely in excess of $100,000 
a year, to the training of teachers for the new schools of the South. 
For the past fifteen years this policy has been pursued. The Central 
Normal School, at Nashville, has been enlarged, reorganized, buttressed, 
and made strong to receive the final endowment that may make it the 
great central normal college of the South. In every Southern State 
at least one, and in several more than one, school of the sort has been 
subsidized, often called into existence, by the offer of aid for a succes- 
sion of years. The old-time school institute, little more than a school- 
teacher’s picnic framed in a narrow rim of miscellaneous public oratory, 
has evolved into a normal school and has now become a powerful 
agency, gathering every year the best teachers of the whole country to 
instruct, aid, and inspire the instructors in all varieties of schools. 
In all these successive steps the Peabody fund has been a shining 
example of the true policy of the administration of public education 
in all parts of the Union. The people of the United States must learn 
to, put their hands deep into their own pockets if they propose to keep 
abreast of the world’s movement for the children. The state can do 
little more than supply a general organization of forces and agencies to 
aid the people in doing their own work. No bureaucratic system, such 
as prevails in the European continental nations, can take the place of 
our national method of training American children for good citizen- 
ship of the Republic we all pray these United States may become. It 
has been nothing short of a public blessing that this great “school 
committee” has, for now almost thirty years, shown the people of the 
South the straight gate and narrow way of self-help that alone leads 
to educational salvation. Through all these eventful years this asso- 
ciation of wise men, under the leadership of Robert C. Withrop, the 
foremost educational statesman of the land, has kept itself in constant 
cooperation with the public authorities of all the States that have 
received its aid. The moneys have been given directly to the State 
superintendents of schools and by them distributed under the well- 
understood conditions of the contributor. In this way it has so quietly 
instructed, as it has gone along with, the school authorities of cities and 
States that it has been a constant educator in public policy, always 
 
-P-A-G-E-812
764 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
adapting itself to the conditions of the schools. Even the two States 
that “in their haste” repudiated their own obligations in its hands 
have been received back to its favor and to-day are among the most 
enthusiastic of the entire group. In all things the Peabody Education 
Fund has illustrated the far-reaching and Christian policy of the Chief 
of the Apostles, “All things to all men, but one thing to” the children 
of the South. 
Fer the results of this campaign of a generation under the general- 
ship of Robert C. Winthrop we may refer to the annual reports of the 
Peabody board of trustees, now gathered up into a valuable series of 
volumes rich in historical interest. Enough to say that the imminent 
dangers to Southern education during the years from 1867 to 1880 were 
that the new movement for the common school would be “switched 
off” from the broad American to a narrow side track, or be “ stamped 
out” during the bitter conflict over the readjustment of State indebt- 
edness at the loud call for public economy raised by its enemies. We 
can see by what has already been shown how both these calamities 
were greatly averted by the presence on the ground of an organization 
representing the most distinguished men of both sections, absolutely 
committed to the whole American idea of popular education, ready to 
offer “ material aid” on condition of continued exertion by the commu- 
nity or State that solicited its beneficence. : 
And it was a great point that at this emergency the general agent 
elected to fill the place of the lamented Dr. Sears was a man in whom 
the Southern people had absolute confidence, with whom no fault could 
be found, and while one of the most ardent and devoted laborers in the 
“lost cause” of the Confederacy, no man now excels him in his whole- 
souled consecration to the new order that came in at the close of the 
war. As the grandest ship laboring through overwhelming seas and 
buffeted by tempests steers right onward under the guidance of an 
invisible helm, so the Peabody Education Fund in this emergency was 
“the steering apparatus” of the new Southern common school. 
Of course, all these efforts would have been useless had they not 
been everywhere heartily and persistently supported by the educa- 
tional public of the South. In the final estimate of history it will be 
shown that the Southern people, led by their own educational public, 
during the past thirty years have done more in behalf of universal 
education than any people under similar circumstances since the world 
began. 
It would be easy to crowd these pages with illustrations of the way 
in which the Peabody Education Fund, under the wise, powerful, and 
progressive administration of its president, became the golden hinge 
on which the front door of the Southern common school swung to and 
fro through all its early years of peril, until the later period of its 
assured self-support. 
One of the first State superintendents of Southern schools in the
-P-A-G-E-813

days of reconstruction to welcome the advent of Dr. Sears was Gen. 
John Eaton, then State commissioner of education in Tennessee. The 
subsequent promotion of this great and good friend of education to 
the post of United States Commissioner of Education, at Washington, 
by the man who best knew him, President Grant, was the assurance 
that the Peabody Education Fund would be henceforth the true yoke- 
fellow of this other child of the new Republic, the National Bureau of 
Education. From that day the Peabody fund has had no more effect- 
ive ally than the National Bureau of Education, now grown from a 
little office, with an income of $5,060, to a department of the Govern- 
ment in all but the name, known and honored at home and abroad. 
And nowhere are its merits more intelligently and warmly appreciated 
and its “aid and comfort” more often invoked than in the Southern 
States, where Winthrop and Sears and Curry have always felt its 
strong supporting hands under their arms. 
I must also relate the most recent of the contrasts which make the 
history of this Republic for the past generation read like a romance. 
In the year 1845 no man on the floor of Congress argued more power- 
fully, with more prophetic eloquence, against the proposed admission 
of Texas to the Union, on the ground of the danger of increasing the 
area of negro slavery, than Robert C. Winthrop, representing the city ” 
of Boston. Texas was admitted to the Union, and the great conflict 
of sections, foretold by Channing and Webster and Winthrop, came, 
as predicted. But fifty years later the association of teachers, repre- 
senting the common schools of new Texas, no longer a ‘Lone Star,” 
but one of the most hopeful of the new planets that have ‘sailed into 
the ken” of the patriotic eye in the firmament of the Union, assembled 
at Galveston, received with an enthusiastic welcome Dr. William T. 
Harris, the distinguished United States Commissioner of Education, 
and, by a unanimous rising vote, adopted this resolution: 
Whereas the sad intelligence has reached us of the death of that scholar and states- 
man, patriot and philanthropist, the Hon. Robert C. Winthrop, the last of a historie 
family that connects our present generation with the liberty-loving fathers of 1620; 
and 
Whereas it seems meet that we of the South should feel more than an ordinary 
interest in the life and death of this great and good man, who for twenty-eight years, 
as chairman of the Peabody Educational Fund, has contributed his wise and great 
administrative ability in judiciously directing the disbursements of the princely 
provision of Mr. George Peabody for the education of the children of the South, and 
at a time when war had desolated our fair land and destroyed every means for the 
instruction of the masses, as the personal and true friend of Mr, Peabody, was the 
first to whom he made known his noble purpose—the gift of so large an amount that 
the available fund accruing from it has reached in the aggregate over $2,250,000 in 
aid of existing or in establishing other schools; and 
Whereas in the administration of this fund our people have been taught the 
invaluable lesson that that is the greatest help that helps one to help himself: 
Therefore, be it 
Resolved, That in the death of the Hon, Robert C. Winthrop philanthropy has lost 
its most liberal contributor, patriotism its strongest advocate, statesmanship its 
   
-P-A-G-E-814
  766 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
brightest example, republican institutions their bravest defender, and while the 
whole country has sustained an irreparable loss, the South especially has lost at this 
time its truest and most sympathetic friend—the director and dispenser of the 
largest single benefaction in its far-reaching results ever bequeathed to any people 
by any one individual. 
One of the most interesting of all the tributes is that of Governor 
B. R. Tillman, of South Carolina, at the laying of the corner stone of 
the Winthrop Normal and Industrial College for Young White Women, 
on May 12, 1894, at Rock Hill in that State. Thirteen years ago, in 
1881, I first visited South Carolina and, under the courteous guidance 
of its accomplished State superintendent of education, afterwards 
governor, Hugh S. Thompson, was introduced to a large portion of its 
territory. At that time the capital city, Columbia, had no reliable 
system of public instruction; indeed, the people had refused to vote 
the taxation necessary to establish one the day before I reached the 
place. But in the following year the old university town thought 
better of it, took up the enterprise in a decided and liberal fashion, and 
placed at the head of its new graded schools for both races Mr. D. B. 
Johnson, one of the most promising of the young Southern superin- 
tendents of schools I had met in my previous visit to North Carolina. 
One summer day in 1886 T introduced Mr, Johnson to Mr. Winthrop, 
in his beautiful home at Brookline. The young superintendent told his 
story and asked for the consideration of his favorite project, the estab- 
lishment of a city training school for teachers, by the Peabody trustees. 
As if by instinct, Mr. Winthrop responded to the plea. A grant of 
$2,000 was made, and when I next visited Columbia I found the Win- 
throp training school for teachers in full operation, under the close and 
affectionate observation of the president of the Peabody board, as if 
the favored child of his old age. In due time this excellent school, in 
whose instruction Northern and Southern teachers were employed, was 
adopted by the State, which gave to it the first money ever voted by a 
South Carolina legislature for the higher education of women, and 
made it practically a State institution. 
On the 12th of May, 1894, one of the largest assemblies ever gathered 
in the Palmetto State on an educational occasion swarmed the enter- 
prising new village of Rock Hill, up in the northwest, to lay the corner 
stone of one of the noblest school buildings in the South. The new 
institution is named “The Winthrop Normal and Industrial College.” 
Governor Tillman in his address declared: 
Iknow you will all unite with me in the prayer that this grand, good old man may 
be spared at least to see the fruition of our hopes in the assembling within theso 
walls of the 600 South Carolina girls for whom we are preparing. This school is the 
one thing and the only thing upon which the men of South Carolina are at present united. 
May this point of union grow and spread, that the inspirations of this day may prove 
a harbinger and help to hasten the restoration of that harmony and friendly feeling 
which once existed and which must necessarily return before we can have any great 
degreo of prosperity. 
Henceforth the name of Robert C. Winthrop is associated with the
-P-A-G-E-815

public higher education of the women of South Carolina. No more 
heartfelt tribute has been rendered to his memory than in the resolu- 
tions passed by the girls of the Winthrop Normal School, and his 
birthday is.a holiday in the institution. And if it be, as some of our 
foreign-born citizens declare, a greater honor to be adopted by an 
American Commonwealth than to become a citizen by the accident of 
birth, Mr. Winthrop might well congratulate himself that, failing to be 
born a citizen of South Carolina in the old contentious days “before 
the flood,” the day of his adoption was reserved for the happier time 
when this proud old State has on her hands no contention outside her 
own borders; while the name of this son of Massachusetts is now quoted 
as the “harbinger and help” in the present unfortunate era of domes- 
tie distraction; and over his portrait, wreathed in roses and clematis on 
every birthday: by the young women of South Carolina, may be written 
again, as on the tablet above the tomb of his ancestors in Groton 
Church, England, “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be 
called the children of God.” 
It was a hope expressed by George Peabody that while his own gift 
should be used. for the schooling of the masses in the elementary edu- 
cation in which the South up to 1860 had been so deficient, other men 
would follow his example and give of the abundance of their substance 
for the rehabilitation of the secondary and higher education of both 
races and all classes in all these States. This hope has been realized, 
and since the memorable October day when this “ great citizen of the 
world and brother of mankind” unloaded his leathern wallet under the 
portrait of Benjamin Franklin before Robert C. Winthrop more than 
$10,000,000 has been donated for this end in the South; the larger 
part by Southern men and women, or by men who, like George Pea- 
body, had become citizens of that section and remembered it when 
they “came into their kingdom” of great wealth;—Cornelius Vander- 
bilt and Johns Hopkins and Enoch Pratt; Paul Tulane and Mrs. New- 
come and Miss Howard; Corcoran and McCormick and Ball and 
Rosenberg; Thomas and Hawkins; Fayerweather and Rockefeller and 
Dupont; Mrs. Stone and Slater and Hand; McMillan and good Mary 
Hemenway; and, perhaps least known of all, Austin of Boston, who, 
in fond remembrance of Thomas Jefferson, the political idol of his 
youth, named the University of Virginia the residuary legatee of his 
estate, said to be the largest private gift ever made to the child of 
Jefierson’s old age; Clemson of South Carolina and Miller of Virginia, 
who by large benefactions have inaugurated industrial education in 
noble foundations in both those States. These, with a great multitude 
of donors of smaller sums, but with equal consecration, have taken the 
little children and the dear boys and girls of the Southland into their 
arms and blessed them in the most practical and Christian way, by 
“helping them to help themselves” in the race for good manhood and 
womanhood and good American citizenship.
-P-A-G-E-816
  768 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
And in this roll of honor, among the most honorable, will abide the 
many hundreds of devoted men and women from the north country and 
the Canadas who have given years of self-sacrificing toil, and so often 
their lives, to the service of the children and youth of both races in 
these schools. How far the prodigious activity of all the Northern 
churches for the schooling of the freedmen in the South has been stim- 
ulated by George Peabody’s original gift can not be known. But it is 
certain that all these movements have been held in close and fraternal 
sympathy with the Peabody education fund, and, perhaps, by its influ- 
ence kept in closer. touch with the central educational reliance of the 
South—the common school. 
I heard Richard Cobden declare, almost forty years ago, before the 
teachers and pupils of Dr. Eben Stearns’s Albany (N. Y.) Female 
Academy, that one of the most prominent characteristics of American 
society he had observed was that while the first notion of a man with 
a new fortune in England was to “found a family,” the American mil- 
lionaire seemed interested to found a great school, a hospital, a library, 
or some institution or agency of large public utility. “And this,” con- 
tinued Mr. Cobden, ‘shows me that you are a more civilized people 
than we.” If that were true forty years ago, it may be that the exam- 
ple of George Peabody in London, that made his name a household 
word in every English home, was influential in giving an impulse 
to the present era of splendid educational gifts, and the recent move- 
ments for popular education in Great Britain. So does the life of one 
good man, fitly placed, like a tall, central light-house, illuminate all 
nations and shoot broad gleams of radiance athwart the clouds and 
storms of history, a blessed response to the song of the angels over the 
cradle at Bethlehem: “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, 
good will toward men.” 
There is small need of dwelling upon the personal character, gifts, 
and graces of this admirable man, Robert C. Winthrop, who, in a way so 
gracious and so beneficent, united the passing and coming social order, 
blending the old and new ideal of the true Christian gentleman and 
citizen in a fashion so complete that we know not which most to admire. 
It was permitted to George Peabody to live through the earliest years 
of the administration of his great educational charity, and die full in 
the faith that it was in the hands of those who would do their utter- 
most to make it a blessing to the nation and the people he loved so 
well. To Mr. Winthrop was granted an extension of years, in which 
the disappointments and hostilities of his early public manhood were 
outlived to enjoy the growing happiness of another youth, blessed by the 
love of myriads of children and the gathering reverence and gratitude 
of all wise and good men in the Republic. 
But this life, so rich in the record of all these years, was not to close 
without a final “all hail” to the future. His last published address, 
read at the meeting of the Peabody trustees October 4, 1894, contains
-P-A-G-E-817
WINTHROP AND THE PEABODY FUND. 16S 
a whole-souled welcome to the coming era of the higher education of 
American young women. At the conclusion of a mention of the recens 
ceremony of laying the corner stone of the Winthrop Normal an@ 
Industrial College of South Carolina, which the Peabody fund ha@® 
assisted in its opening as the Columbia City Training School for Teach- 
ers, he writes: “An article in the August number of the New Englan@® 
Magazine says that ‘ the history of the higher education of women covers: 
barely a century. The Harvard annex and coeducation in the univer- 
sities form what one would call the brilliant close, except that in humar 
progress there is no close; it is a story without an end.” But surely,” 
added Mr. Winthrop, “South Carolina is not to be omitted from having 
made one of the most important and conspicuous contributions to this: 
‘prilliant close,’ if so it is to be called, as we by no means agree. The 
higher education of woman and her contribution to the education of 
the country are only in the beginning, and their results remain to be- 
developed. South Carolina may well be proud of the part she is taking 
in a cause which can have no close in our day and generation.” Here 
is the true culmination of the career of this illustrious educationah 
statesman, who with a firm grasp held on to all that is really precious 
and abiding in the past, while his dying eyes, through the mist of 
approaching death, were lifted toward the morning, radiant with the 
splendor of the ‘‘dayspring from on high.” 
No tribute remains to be paid to the name and fame of George Pea- 
body, unless the repeated suggestion of Dr. Curry that the Southerr 
States aided by his fund unite to place his statue in the national 
capital. But how can we best commemorate the name and fame of 
Robert C. Winthrop, foremost of American educational statesmen, the 
friend of Peabody—two men who loved each other in life, and in their 
death were not divided? Statue and portrait and memorial address. 
and celebrations of his birthday and, in due time, his biography will 
follow, as in a solemn and grateful procession of national remembrance. 
But there yet seems to be one method so appropriate that it should 
commend itself to the educational public of the whole country. 
On my own last visit to Mr. Winthrop, more than a year ago, at his 
home in Boston, I was impressed with the fact remarked upon by 
Bishop Lawrence, at the commemorative service of the Massachusetts 
Historical Society, of his effort, through the growing weariness and 
infirmity of age, to maintain to the last the beautiful courtesy that was 
so marked a feature of his splendid manhood. He came into the room, 
aided by his faithful manservant, really too ill to receive anybody so 
little a familiar acquaintance as myself. In the half hour he was 
able to give me I spoke of what has more and more forced itself upon 
my attention as the year of the final distribution of the Peabody fund 
of $2,000,000 approaches—the feeling that this unique central educa- 
tional organization should not be dissolved, and that in no way could 
the cause of Southern education in the generation to come be so ad- 
ED 94——49 
 
-P-A-G-E-818
770 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
vanced as by a new gift of other millions to carry on the work after the 
original fund has been depleted, as proposed by its donor. He rallied 
at the mention of the idea with the momentary enthusiasm of youth; 
indeed, so heartily that he seemed almost overcome by the proposition, 
and could only respond in a few almost wandering sentences. On the 
following day I received a letter from him containing an almost pathetie 
regret at his own apparent indifference to my proposition the day 
before; but urging me, by all the influence I possessed as a laborer in 
the cause of Southern education, to publish everywhere my conviction 
of the great need, with his own full indorsement. 
Now, as never before, does this idea rise up as the fit close of the 
present tribute to the lives and united services of George Peabody and 
Robert ©. Winthrop. Never was a louder call for a new departure in 
this great central ministry of education than now. Two broad avenues 
of advance lie open before us. 
(1) The State of Mississippi has led the way in what may become a 
reconciliation. The election laws of Massachusetts and other New 
England States have recently been incorporated in the new constitu- 
tion of this Southern State to the extent, of providing for an educational 
qualification for the suffrage, or a fair understanding of the constitu- 
tion of the State. While I write, the word comes that the leading col- 
ored men of an important section of Mississippi have formed a league 
to promote the education of their people, especially for the duties of 
eivie life. No American State will long desire or dare to suppress the 
vote of any class of citizens as well qualified to assume the sacred 
responsibilities of the ballot and the jury box as the colored youth of 
all our States may become by a new and vigorous campaign of educa- 
tion through another generation, 
(2) And now comes a new summons, from the white people of the 
mountain country of the old South—the magnificent Appalachian 
region, extending through eight States, as extensive as the German 
Empire, and declared by experts in all ways, save its distance from the 
seaboard, as rich in natural resources—to give to their 2,000,000 of 
people the bread and water of that education which may be the sole out- 
fit of their children for success in life and good American citizenship. 
Why should this “great American academy” disband in the face of 
such an opportunity as this? The dedication of a new Winthrop edu- 
cational benefaction, to supplement the Peabody Education Fund, would 
be a fit tribute to him who was beloved in life and “not divided in 
death” from his great and good compeer. Let the new wealth of the 
South unite with the vast opulence of the eld East and the rising gen- 
erosity of the mighty West to raise this monument to the man we 
commemorate. 
And, in the reorganization of this larger Peabody-Winthrop educa- 
tional fund, let it not be forgotten what has been done in the past thirty 
years by the noble women of the South and the North, the East and
-P-A-G-E-819
  WINTHROP AND THE PEABODY FUND. 771 
» the West, for the uplifting of the children and youth and, through them, 
for the advancement of the Republic. Let this most characteristic and 
phophetic movement for the higher and broader education of American 
women be recognized by including in the management of this greater 
fund a fit representation of the foremost educational womanhood of 
the country; a just tribute to the great service of the daughters of the 
Republic in that cause of human enlargement, of which ‘there is no 
close,” this wondrous “ story without an end.” 
And thus may the inspiring words of the orator of the Yorktown 
Centennial celebration, standing almost in sight of the beach where 
the first shipload of Englishmen landed almost three centuries ago, be 
lifted from eloquent prophecy to practical fruition. Speaking of the 
Peabody Education Fund, Mr. Winthrop there said: 
It has been thus far as a voice crying in the wilderness—calling the people of the 
South to undertake the great work for themselves, and preparing the way for its 
successful prosecution. It may be looked back upon, one of these days, if not now, 
as ‘‘the littie leaven which has leavened the whole lump.” But the whole lump 
must be kneaded and molded and worked over, with unceasing activity and energy, 
by every town, village, and district for itself, or there will be no sufficient bread 
for the hungry and famished masses. And there must be aids and appropriations 
and endowments, by cities and States, and by the nation at large through its public 
lands, if in no other way, and to an amount compared with which the gift of George 
Peabody—munificent as it was for an individual benefaction—is but the small dust 
of the balance. 
Then, rising to his mighty theme, he said: ’ ghty ” 
It is one of the great rights of a free people to be educated and trained up from 
childhood to that ability to govern themselyes which is the largest element in 
republican self-government. It is primarily a right of our children, and they are 
not able to enforce and vindicate it for themselves. But let us beware of subjecting 
ourselves to the ineffable reproach of robbing the children of their bread and casting 
it before dogs, by wasting untold millions on corrupt and extravagant projects, and 
starving our common schools. The whole field of our Union is now open to educa- 
tion, and the whole field of the Union must be occupied. This Government must 
stand or fall with free schools. These and these alone can supply the firm founda- 
tion, and that foundation must, at this very moment, be extended and strengthened 
and rendered immovable and indestructible.

CHAPTER I. 
COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE AND THE MECHANIC 
ARTS.! 
The collection of statistics concerning the expenditure of the funds granted to 
the several States and Territories for the benefit of colleges of agriculture and the 
mechanic arts by the act of Congress of August 30, 1890, together with statistics 
concerning the condition and progress of the various institutions as required by the 
above-mentioned act, has been continued during the past year. The summarized 
statistics concerning professors, students, property, etc., are given on pp. 129-182. 
Considerable correspondence is still required in order to obtain satisfactory reports 
from the treasurers of some of the institutions. The law of August 30, 1890, is 
restrictive and designates the special purposes for which the money authorized by 
it may be expended. It distinctly states that the money thus appropriated shall 
“be applied only to instruction in agriculture, the mechanic arts, the English lan- 
guage, and the various branches of mathematical, physical, natural, and economic 
science, with special reference to their applications in the industries of life, and to 
the facilities for such instruction.” 
Notwithstanding the plain language above quoted, this Bureau has been compelled 
during the year to order the refunding of sums of money paid out of what is popu- 
larly known as the “ Morrill fund” for the salaries of treasurer, secretary, and pro- 
fessor of ancient and modern languages. Another item of expenditure which has 
been disallowed in the few cases in which it had been charged is what is known as 
“exchange.” This is the amount charged in a few States by the banks cashing the 
checks by which the money granted by Congress is paid to the several States and 
Territories. Such charge is also held as improper. The law appropriates a certain 
sum of money to certain institutions for certain purposes, and it is held that the 
entire sum thus appropriated must be expended for the special purposes mentioned 
in the act. If any charge is made for cashing the checks, such charge must be paid 
with other funds. 
It is also held that no part of the funds granted by the act of August 30, 1890, can 
be expended for purely administrative purposes. The law does not establish new 
institutions, but simply provides for the more complete endowment and support of 
colleges already established under the provisions of an act of Congress approved 
July 2, 1862, and does not provide for administrative expenses, but provides that all 
of the money granted by it shall be used for instruction in certain specified branches 
of study. In the few cases where new institutions have been called into existence 
in order to obtain the benefits of the act of August 30, 1890, and where the lands 
granted by the act of July 2, 1862, have not yet been converted into income-produc- 
ing property, the several States and Territories where such institutions are located 
are in duty bound to provide the funds required for administrative purposes and for 
other necessary expenses not provided for in the act of August 30, 1890. 
The expenditures from the Morrill fund for the year ended June 30, 1894, were as 
follows:

AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 795 
Since the passage of the act of August 30, 1890, the legislatures of several States 
have taken the funds derived from the acts of July 2, 1862, and August 30, 1890, from 
the institutions which had formerly held them and established new institutions. In 
New Hampshire the funds were taken from Dartmouth College, at Hanover, and a 
new institution established at Durham. In Rhode Island, Brown University, at 
Providence, relinquished the funds to a new college established at Kingston. In 
Connecticut there is at present a legal contest between Yale University and the 
State of Connecticut, due to the fact that the legislature has passed an act making 
the Storrs Agricultural College, at Storrs, the beneficiary under the acts of July 2, 
1862, and August 30, 1890, In the two Carolinas the agricultural departments have 
been taken from the State universities and new institutions established at Raleigh, 
N. C., and at Fort Hill, 8. C. 
The reports received from the presidents of the institutions included under this 
category show that the institutions are in a flourishing condition and are doing good 
work, as will be seen from the following abstracts taken from said reports: 
Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama, Auburn, Ala.—The material 
improvements made during the year were the construction of a barn and a tobacco 
house at the experiment station, and the building of an electrical laboratory and 
also a veterinary laboratory on the campus. The equipment of the scientific depart- 
ments was increased with valuable apparatus, At the close of the session there were 
50 graduates, 38 receiving the degree of bachelor of science, and 12 postgraduate 
degrees. Among the graduates were 3 young women, the first female graduates of 
this college. 
State Normal and Industrial School, Normal, Ala.—In our last report the condition 
of the school was good and the prospects for another year bright. The anticipated 
has been fully realized both in the literary and in the industrial departments. 
Eighteen were graduated from the literary department. Our graduates and under- 
graduates are doing a good work throughout the State. Nearly all the important 
towns in North Alabama are supplied with teachers from this institution, and their 
efforts are being crowned with abundant success. The industrial department is well 
planned and the work well done. Eighteen were graduated from this department, 
making the total number of graduates for the year 36. During the year a large 
puilding for the mechanic arts department and cottages have been erected by the 
students, and another still larger building for dormitory purposes is now in course 
of erection. The various industrial departments are well patronized by the sur- 
rounding community; wagons, buggies, farm implements, boots, shoes, dresses, ete., 
being satisfactorily made. There is marked improvement in every department. 
University of Arizona, Tucson, Ariz—A reorganization of the university occurred 
May 30, 1894, and Dr. Theo. B. Comstock, acting last year as the president of the 
faculty, was unanimously elected president of the university, with duties of a chief 
executive officer, supervising all departments. The three main divisions of the 
university are (1) the university proper (educational), (2) the bureau of mines (for 
investigation), and (3) the agricultural experiment station (for investigation). The 
number of students has greatly increased, and indications are that many more will 
enter in September, 1894. Heretofore it has not been feasible to furnish boarding 
accommodations for students, but this serious defect has now been remedied. The 
first senior class will be graduated in 1895. 
Arkansas Industrial University, Fayetteville, Ark.—The department of classic lan- 
guages (Latin and Greek) has been divided, a professor of Latin elected, and the 
faculty increased by an additional member. The teaching force in practical mechan- 
ics has been improved. A new brick laboratory building for chemistry and physics 
has been erected, and additions madé to the equipment in chemistry, physics, biology, 
mineralogy, geology, mechanics, and engineering. There is a very marked increase 
in the thoroughness and efficiency of the military department. Arrangements have 
been perfected for accrediting a large number of high schools to the university. 
This, it is believed, will increase the number in collegiate classes and diminish that 
   
-P-A-G-E-844
  796 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
in the preparatory classes. The university is becoming more widely and favorably 
known throughout the State. 
State Agricultural College, Fort Collins, Colo.—The year has been one of marked 
progress and improvement along all lines, new buildings have been erected, old ones 
remodeled, additional appliances have been purchased for all departments, and much 
done to elevate and strengthen the educational tone of the institution. The enroll- 
ment of students shows a gratifying increase over that of previous years, and alto- 
gether the college may be said to have had a very satisfactory year. The work of 
the experiment station has been pushed with diligence, and the work is partially 
evidenced by the bulletins issued. There is a yast amount of work that has been 
performed or is still progressing, the results of which will be published as soon as 
practicable. 
State College for Colored Students, Dover, Del.—Nothing worthy of special notice 
has occurred during the year, excepting that women have been admitted as day stu- 
dents. The farm has been improved in fertility and general appearance and some 
additions have been made to the equipment of the shop. 
Florida Agriculiural College, Lake City, Fla.—The year has been one of activity and 
prosperity. All departments of the college have been doing good work. Complete 
agricultural and mechanical courses of study have been adopted and introduced, 
and the equipment for the mechanical department has been much improved. The 
attendance for the year was 187, an increase over the preceding year of more than 
125 per cent. 
Georgia State College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts, Athens, Ga.—The con- 
dition of the college is satisfactory. It has an efficient corps of competent and 
enthusiastic officers and the educational work done by it is sound and of a high 
grade Paucity of students still continues to be the chief discouraging feature of 
our work. For the past session this may be in part accounted for by the real or 
fancied financial depression of the year. It is mainly due, however, to the lack of 
preparatory schools, especially in the rural districts. Moreover, the superior adyan- 
tages in profit and pleasure as yet afforded in this State by mercantile pursuits and 
other professions operate to deter a large number of students from entering the tech- 
nical courses provided by this college. The preparatory instruction introduced dur- 
ing the past year has aided in securing a number of students who otherwise could 
not have entered the institution. The winter course in agriculture is an acceptable 
feature, but the number of students is still small. Farmers’ institutes, under the 
auspices of the college, were held during the year at 21 places. The attendance 
was large and the interest manifested gratifying. The officers of the college take 
advantage of these meetings to encourage among the people a desire and demand for 
technical education. 
University of Idaho, Moscow, Idaho.—During the year ending June 30, 1894, the 
University of Idaho enjoyed a year of remarkable prosperity. Notwithstanding the 
hard times which necessarily affect the inhabitants of a new State more seriously 
than the older communities, the attendance was largely in excess of the previous 
year. The faculty was increased to 11 at the beginning. of the scholastic year, 
September 20, 1894. The detail of an army officer es professor of military science 
and tactics makes a faculty of 12 professors and instructors. The director of music 
is not a member of the faculty, as his department is a private enterprise and depend- 
ent wholly upon tuition receipts for support. 
The library during the year received a number of books by purchase and donation; 
the technical libraries were largely increased by the purchase of works of the latest 
authorities. During the year the laboratories received additional equipment, the 
biological receiving the most attention. The crowning feature of the year was the 
partial completion of the main part and wing of the main or administration building. 
About thirty-three rooms are now available for scholastic purposes. Laboratory 
facilities for next year will be largely increased. A suit of four rooms is devoted to 
chemical laboratory (for instruction and station work), one room is devoted to
-P-A-G-E-845
  
AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 797 
zoological laboratory, one to botanical, one to physical, and one to agricultural. 
These rooms have water, sewers, light, and gas. The apparatus is not so extensive 
as could be desired, but everything is well selected and well adapted to our demands. 
The assaying furnaces are temporarily located in the chemical laboratory and in 
@ room not now in general use. A class of seven was formed in agriculture, the 
preparatory course. 
Peace and harmony prevail within the institution. Faculty is able and progres- 
sive. The work done is of an excellent order. 
University of Illinois, Champaign, Ill.—The year ending June 30, 1894, was conspic- 
uously the most successful one in the history of the university, as indicated by the 
number of students and of instructors, by the expenditures for buildings and equip- 
ment, and by published reports and documents. The increase in the number of stu- 
dents over the preceding year was 29, while the increase in the number of instructors 
was 17. Engineering hall, the best building on the campus, is nearing completion. 
Purdue University, La Fayette, Ind.—The new mechanical engineering building, which 
was completed in the early part of January, was partly destroyed by fire on the night 
of January 23, 1894, the loss being estimated at $150,000, The laboratories connected 
with the building destroyed haye been reconstructed, and all the apparatus and 
machinery necessary to equip the same have been purchased. The number of stu- 
dents has increased to 682. The preparatory department, which has been greatly 
reduced during the past year by stringent requirements, will not be maintained in 
the future. 
Towa Agricultural College, Ames, Iowa.—The year 1894 has been one of healthy 
condition and marked progress. About $10,000 have been expended in refitting the 
dormitories; the two upper floors of the main building were made entirely new by 
new lathing, plastering, and woodwork; a new experimental barn at a cost of $4,000 
has been completed; a new ladies’ hall is in process of erection, and will cost about 
$50,000; a new athletic grounds, embracing 12 acres, have been laid out and graded. 
The school year has been noted for thrift and general progress, both among our 
students and the faculty. The graduating class numbered 63—the largest in the his- 
tory of the college. 
Kansas State Agricultural College, Manhattan, Kans.—The college year 1893-94 has 
been a prosperous one in the stability of an efficient faculty, an attendance fully up 
to reasonable expectations, an excellent body of post-graduate students, a greatly 
enlarged provision for departments of botany and zoology, with library and museum 
facilities for all departments, and an improved course of study. The new buildings 
will be ready for occupancy before the opening of college in September, 1894, and 
promise superior advantages for an increased number of students. During the win- 
ter a special course of 36 lectures to farmers was given at the college and attended 
by about 40 farmers, mostly from the immediate neighborhood. Fifteen farmers’ 
institutes were held in various parts of the State, under the auspices of the college, 
without aid from State funds. 
Agricultural and Mechanical College of Kentucky, Lexington, Ky.—The board of 
trustees in June, 1894, established a chair of physics. The department of mechan- 
ical engineering has attracted much attention, both locally and throughout the 
State, by the excellence of its equipment and the excellence of its training. Satis- 
factory work has also been done in all the departments of natural science. A 
popular course of lectures on agriculture, including agricultural chemistry, horti- 
culture, entomology, veterinary science, etc., was carried on during the year with 
satisfactory results. 
State Normal School for Colored Persons, Frankfort, Ky.—A new mechanical shop 
costing $766 was erected, and the dormitory completed. The enrollment was greater 
than that of any previous year. Some valuable practical experiments were made in 
the agricultural department. 
Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, 
La.—The session of 1893-94 has been a most satisfactory one in the increased number 
   
-P-A-G-E-846
    798 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
. and improved progress and deportment of students. The students have choice of five 
parallel courses of study, in which the aim is to combine theory and practice as much 
as possible. The course in mechanics and engineering 1s the most popular. In this 
and the course in agriculture students receive one year’s training in the machine 
shop. The agricultural course is thorough. We have no farm on which the students 
labor, but they study the experiments in connection with the theory of the class- 
room, and the facilities for shop and laboratory work are becoming more useful every 
year. 
Southern University, New Orleans, La.—In the interest of the higher grades of this 
institution, the board of trustees, in October, 1893, discontinued the very lowest 
grades, containing about 250 younger pupils, leaving 304 pupils in the school. The 
college department at the same time was advanced. All departments have improved 
during the session. At the close of the session a bequest of $3,000 for the general use 
of the University was received and $300 was appropriated from the Peabody fund. 
The legislature appropriated $8,000 to purchase a farm of 100 acres, which was hith- 
erto rented by the college at $800 per annum. The school issteadily moving forward. 
The agricultural and mechanical department is quite young, but both sections are 
hard at work training, developing, and educating the classes in their respective 
pursuits. 
Maine State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, Orono, Me.—The condition of 
the college is satisfactory and its progress encouraging. It has had more students 
than ever before, and its work has been well done. New courses have been estab- 
lished, known as the electrical engineering, library economy, pharmacy, and prepara- 
tory medicine. : ss : 
Maryland Agricultural College, College Park, Md.—The condition and progress of 
this institution is encouraging. There were enrolled 123 students, against 108 for the 
previous year. A substantial brick building was erected during the year, the lower 
story of which has been fitted up for and is used as a gymnasium, while the second 
floor makes a bright and roomy library. Nine young men received the degree of 
B. 8. in June, 1894. 
Massachusetts Agricultural College, Amherst, Mass.—The condition of the college 
during the year has been exceedingly prosperous. We enrolled 214 students—the 
largest number in the history of the college—while the graduating class, 33 in number 
and more than 15 per cent of all the students in attendance, is the largest ever grad- 
uated from the institution. An assistant in zoology and a second assistant in botany 
and horticulture have been added to the faculty, making a total of 18 professors and 
assistants. The results of the elective system in the studies of the senior year have 
been most gratifying. Not only has there been a marked increase in the interest 
shown in study by the members of this class, but this interest has been communi- 
cated to the other classes also, so that a general quickening of the intellectual life 
of the students has been apparent. Twenty-three students were enrolled inthe two 
years’ course, and the practical character of the instruction received has been fully. 
appreciated by them. Valuable courses of lectures were given by Sir Henry Gilbert, 
of the Rothamsted Station, England; by Dr. B. E. Fernow, and by Maj. Henry E. 
Alvord. New barns, costing $36,000, were erected during the year. These include a 
main fodder barn, with wings for cattle, sheep, and swine, and a horse barn. In 
connection with the main barn a dairy school has been equipped, in which practical 
‘instruction will be given to students. The old barn, erected in 1869, was destroyed 
by fire on June 8, 1894. The most serious loss in connection with the fire was that of 
valuable agricultural implements that had been secured as a nucleus to an agricul- 
tural museum. 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, Mass.—There were enrolled 1,157 
students—an increase of 97 over 1892-93. A new course of study in naval architec- 
ture has been successfully inaugurated. The graduating class was the largest in 
the history of the institution. Land to the value of $277,000 has been purchased, to
-P-A-G-E-847
  AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 799 
allow for future expansion, but the scanty means of the Institute made it necessary 
to put a mortgage of $240,000 on land and buildings to secure the purchase money. 
Michigan State Agricultural College, Agricultural College, Mich.—There were few 
changes in the reguiar courses of study during the year. A special course in dairy 
husbandry was inaugurated, commencing the first week in January and continuing 
six weeks. On account of limited room only 25 pupils could be accommodated. 
The success which was accorded the course demonstrates the desirability of dairy 
instruction in this State. Among the improvements during the year are the follow- 
ing: Addition of over 1,000 volumes to the library; the building of an additional 
gallery in the library; the erection of a foundry; the rearrangement of and new 
equipment for the blacksmith shop; increased room in the woodworking shop; a 
50-horsepower engine for running the machinery of the shops (built by the students) ; 
40,000 feet of stone walk were laid; a new sewer system put in; and an electric- 
light plant instituted for lighting the grounds and the corridors of the dormitories. 
A large amount of new apparatus for the various laboratories was purchased. The 
general condition of the college is excellent. 
University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minn.—The agricultural department is in a 
more prosperous condition than ever before. A new building, costing $30,000, was 
erected in 1893 and has been used during the present year as a drill hall for the students 
in the school of agriculture. Military science and drill have been successfully intro- 
duced and have been taken by the students with much enthusiasm. Blacksmithing 
has been added to the course of study, The shopwork has been enlarged. Much 
more attention has been paid to practical agriculture than heretofore. The courssin 
breeding and stock raising has been extended and improved. Large numbers of 
experiments in horticulture and agriculture have been in progress at the experiment 
station and have been open to the observation of the students. The teaching force 
has been enlarged and the total number of students has risen to more than 200 
devoted exclusively to the work of agriculture, The training of the school continues ~ 
to fit the students for practical work on the farm, many of the students who have not 
completed the course spending the summer in supplementary work at the university 
farm, and all the graduates going to their homes tosecure farm work. The university 
will ask the coming legislature for further appropriations for buildings, as the 
present accommodations are inadequate to meet the needs of the increasing number 
of students. The experiment station, the college of agriculture, and the school of 
agriculture have been conducted with absolute harmony, and the promise for the 
future is very bright. 
Agricultural and Mechanical College of Mississippi, Agricultural College, Miss.—The 
session of 1893-94 has been most satisfactory. The prescribed courses in agriculture 
and in mechanic arts run parallel to each other, and students are permitted to select 
which they prefer. Experience shows that they divide about equally between the 
two courses. The facilities for practical work are becoming more attractive and 
useful to the students. Every student is compelled to do work in the field, shops, or 
laboratories. 
Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College, Westside, Miss.—A large two-story frame 
building for recitation and dormitory purposes has been completed. A well-equipped 
printing office has been added. Courses of study in printing, blacksmithing, and car- 
pentry have been arranged. Lands on the farm have been cleared, graded hogs and 
cows bought, and the farm department is in better condition than ever before. At 
the last meeting of the board of trustees they granted a shoemaking department, 
raising horses, a business course, and other improvements. The outlook of the 
school is hopeful. 
School of Mines and Metallurgy of the University of the State of Missouri, Rolla, Mo.— 
The last year was the most prosperous in the history of the school. The number of 
students has more than doubled in five years, and there has been a notable advance 
in their grade and capacity. A new mining and metallurgical laboratory is being 
 
-P-A-G-E-848
800 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
built, a new chair of mining and metallurgy has been added, the courses of study 
have been greatly strengthened, and entrance requirements haye been somewhat 
advanced. 
Montana College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, Bozeman, Mont.—We have as yet 
received nothing from the sale of public lands, An appropriation of $15,000 for the 
institution was made by the last legislature, but owing to the fact that the previous 
legislative appropriation made exceeded the amount that the State constitution 
allows the appropriation was not available. In consideration of this fact, Mr. Nelson 
Story, of Bozeman, placed the Bozeman Academy building at the disposal of the 
college. The Bozeman school board likewise gave us space in the Bozeman high 
school building, so that we have been able to carry on the work of the institution. 
Owing to the excellent system of public schools in this neighborhood, we have had a 
very desirable class of students apply for entrance, and we have no cause to com- 
plain of the outlook for the future of the institution. The work this first year has 
been largely preparatory, and it has not been necessary to equip some of the depart- 
ments in consequence. Our chemical and engineering departments are well sup- 
plied with apparatus. Our physical, veterinary, and business departments are 
fairly equipped. Other departments, including the mechanical, will receive atten- 
tion the coming year. 
University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebr.—The changes in condition and progress of 
the Industrial College have been neither many nor striking. The college has 
received its full proportion of the entire number of students, especial gains being 
made in the departments of agriculture, horticulture, and electrical engineering. 
The number of students in shopwork has largely increased. Tho addition of ample 
facilities for forge work (at an expense of $1,600 for addition to building and about 
$2,500 in equipment) has quickened the interest of both students and the public in 
this department. The only enlargement of work is shown in a three years’ course 
in architecture, which is meeting with much favor. 
State University of Nevada, Reno, Nev.—This was the most successful year in the 
history of the institution. The faculty was increased by 1, making the entire num- 
ber 18; the number of students was 192. The standard was raised at the beginning 
of the year, and thorough, substantial work was done in all departments. A quartz 
mill was erected for the mining department, and now the graduates are fairly pro- 
ficient in mining, metallurgy, and assaying. The mechanical department, with its 
opportunities for work in wood and iron, continues very popular among the students. 
New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts, Durham, N. H.—The 
first year in the new location has been marked by a decided advance. Of the 51 
members of the freshmen class, 20 have taken the agricultural course. During the 
winter an institute course in agriculture was carried on with a maximum attendance 
of 100. This was free and open to all without examination. Progress has been made 
in extending the study of agriculture by a nonresident course. The results, while 
at present tentative, are gratifying, as students are enrolled from all parts of the 
country. The buildings are practically completed and have been in constant use 
during the year. 
Rutgers College, New Brunswick, N. J.—Special attention has been given in the 
extension department during the year to agricultural work. Five courses in agri- 
culture and 1 course in botany, each course of 6 lectures, have been given. The 
total attendance at the 36 lectures was 388 persons, and the average attendance 309. 
The total attendance at the class hours was 379 persons, and the average attend- 
ance 292, 
New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arte, Las Cruces, N. Mex.—The 
organization and equipment of the college has been made more complete. The most 
notable event of the year was the graduation of the first class of 4 young men and 1 
young woman. Of these, 3 had pursued the course in agriculture, 1 the course in civil 
engineering, and 1 the ladies’ course. One of them, a native Mexican, was immedi- 
ately employed as assistant to the agriculturist on the farm; another is foreman and

partner on the largest alfalfa and stock ranch in the valley; and the other 3 are 
teachers in the common schools of the Territory. The college continues to lack 
buildings necessary for the proper conducting of the several departments. Owing 
chiefly to financial depression, the attendance at the college has not been quite so 
large as during the previous year, but the work and the college spirit have improved 
greatly. 
Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y.—Through the generosity of Hiram W. Sibley, a 
new building for the use of the college of mechanic arts was erected at an expense 
of $55,000. An appropriation of $50,000 by the legislature for a dairy husbandry 
building furnished means for the erection of a two-story building (45 by 90) of white 
sandstone. A very complete museum of classical archeology was dedicated. Two 
new assistant professors in geology were appointed. A short course in agriculture, 
extending through the winter term, was attended by 61 special students. 
North Carolina College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts, Raleigh, N. C.—The 
college now closes its fifth year with an attendance of 192 students and a graduating 
class of 8. There have now been 27 graduates, 20 in the mechanical course and 7 in 
the agricultural course. Of all these not one is idle, but all are self-supporting in 
honorable employment, which would indicate that this college is fulfilling its mission 
so far, and it is certainly growing in popular favor. The faculty has been increased, 
and it has been found necessary to have a preparatory department with 1 tutor. 
The agricultural department has been greatly advanced during the past session and 
is increasing in popularity with the student body which has heretofore greatly 
preferred the mechanical course. 
Agricultural and Mechanical College for the Colored Race, Greensboro, N. C.—This 
college began its first session as a separate and distinct institution on November 6, 
1893; but as the plastering was still incomplete, and the heating apparatus not 
placed in position, very little could be done unti! January 2, 1894. After that date 
the school opened with splendid prospects of success, and students continued to 
come until the close of the session. The number enrolled was 56. 
North Dakota Agricultural College, Fargo, N. Dak.—During the year the main build- 
ing was completed and a dormitory, mechanical laboratory, farmhouse, and barn 
erected. With the added conveniences the work of the college is now carried on 
thoroughly, following rigidly the lines of requirements of the acts of Congress 
creating and endowing agricultural colleges. 
Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.—There were 383 students in the technical 
schools. Of this number 72 were in the school of agriculture, 265 in the school of 
engineering, 9 in the school of veterinary medicine, and 36 in the school of phar- 
macy. Numerous additions were made to the equipment of the school of agriculture. 
The outfit of the shops was increased by $10,000 worth of new tools and machines. 
The courses in mechanical and electrical engineering were so modified as to admit of 
a considerable addition to the amount of shopwork required in those courses. 
State Agricultural College of Oregon, Corvallis, Oreg.—The work of the college has 
been very satisfactory. The number of students in the advanced classes has greatly 
increased. A number of farmers’ institutes have been held in different parts of 
the State, and a farmers’ short course of one month has been added to the work 
of the college. This course was well patronized last winter. 
Pennsylvania State College, State College, Pa.—It is gratifying to be able to report 
that the same general and steady growth which the college has experienced for 
several years past has continued during the year ending June 30, 1894. The num- 
ber of students was larger than ever before, with a corresponding increase in the 
teaching force and equipment, and the class entering in September, 1893, had, on 
the whole, a better preparation than any preceding class. 
At the opening of the college year ‘the new engineering building, which consti- 
tutes the most important addition yet made to the facilities for instruction, was 
ready for use and fully occupied. It is built of red pressed brick, with brownstone 
ED 94——51 
 
-P-A-G-E-850
  802 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
trimmings. It is of massive, substantial appearance, its only pretension to orna- 
mentation being the use of brown sandstone, to accentuate certain features, and the 
finials and crockets which mark the backbone and ribs of the structure. These 
break the monotony of straight lines and give an added touch of color to the 
whole. The most striking feature of the front is the great stone arched entrance, 
supported on short cylindrical columns on either side and extended above into a 
projection from the rooms of the different floors. 
The building is three stories high, with basement under the whole, having in the 
rear a wing of one story and attic. It faces the roadway a total length of 266 feet 
and extends 208 feet to the rear, making a total of 50,824 square feet, or about 1+ 
acres. The floor space covers more than 2} acres, with 57 different rooms. 
The building was originally designed to accommodate only the two departments of 
civil engineering and mechanical engineering, and all its appointments of lecture 
rooms, offices, laboratories, shops, drafting rooms, museums, department libraries, 
ete., are admirably adapted to the purposes intended, and it is generally conceded to 
have no superior in the United States. At present, however, owing to lack of suit- 
able quarters elsewhere, the two departments of electrical engineering and mining 
engineering are temporarily accommodated in the same building. 
A few important changes in the courses of instruction were inaugurated at the 
beginning of the year. The first of these changes was the separation of the depart- 
ment of electrical engineering from that of physics, of which it had previously been 
a branch, and the erection of it into an independent department with its separate 
equipment and teaching force.- It took rank at once as one of the strongestand most 
popular departments of the institution. 
* Another highly important change was the establishmentofa department of mining 
and geology, for which the legislature of 1893 made provision. This department 
immediately drew students from other courses, and gives promise of meeting an 
urgent want. Its usefulness to the public has been greatly increased by the publi- 
cation and free distribution of a quarterly bulletin, largely devoted to subjects of 
practical mining interest. 
One of the most interesting and significant features of the year’s work has been 
the rapid developement of: the short courses in agriculture and dairying. These 
courses are confined to the winter session exclusively; are open to any person of 
good moral character without examination as to educational qualifications, and the 
instruction relates almost entirely to practical subjects, so that the information 
acquired can be applied directly to the daily work of the farm. All instructors who 
have had these branches in charge express in the highest terms their surprise and 
gratification at the eagerness and success with which these students, many of them 
without careful previous training, grasp comparatively difficult subjects. I am 
strongly inclined to believe that in this direction, with such modification and devel- 
opment as experience may suggest, will be found eventually a key to the solution 
of the difficult problem of education in agriculture. 
The inerease in the number of teaching force over the previous year was 9, and in 
that of the experiment station staff, 2. 
Rhode Island College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, Kingston, R. I.—The institu- 
tion has made especial progress in its mechanical department during the past year. 
The other departments have been well sustained. 
Clemson Agricultural College, Clemson College, S. C.—The mechanical building has 
been enlarged and more fully equipped at a cost of $10,000. A dairy and cheese 
factory has been completed at a cost of about $5,000. The main building was 
destroyed by fire May 22, 1894. A new building is in process of erection and will be 
ready for use by February 15, 1895. The farm has been enlarged by the purchase of 
285 acres of land at a cost of $10,000, making “a total of about 1,100 acres belonging 
to the college. 
Claflin University, Orangeburg, S. C.—We have developed especially in the depart- 
ment of mechanic arts. The plant is large and complete. Nearly all students are 
     
-P-A-G-E-851
  AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 803 
required to take full courses in from two to four departments. The outlook for both 
the agricultural and mechanical departments is encouraging. 
South Dakota Agricultural College, Brookings, S. Dak.—The young men’s dormitory 
has been transformed into a laboratory for the botanical department, class rooms 
for mechanical drawing and for the work in industrial art, and for the library. 
The old quarters of the library have been converted into a physical laboratory. A 
system of waterworks was also provided, by which all parts of the institution have 
been furnished with an abundance of good water. 
University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tenn.—The university made marked progress 
during the year. The noteworthy departure of the year was the admission of 
women to the academic department of the university with all privileges of scholar- 
ships, ete. Women have to be 17 years of age and meet the same requirements with 
regard to admission as men, Fifty-six women were admitted to the freshman, 
sophomore, and junior classes of the various courses and made an excellent record for 
both work and conduct, A separate building was fitted up with reading rooms, 
study rooms, society hall, lunch room, and toilet room for their exclusive accomo- 
dation while at the college. They boarded in private families in town selected by 
the faculty. 
The attendance upon the college of agriculture and mechanie arts was the largest 
in the history of the institution, reaching a total of 334 for the year. 
Among the material improvements which have been ordered and are now under 
way are an office and dormitory building on the college farm for the accommodation 
of agricultural students, anda drilland athletic ground. Thenew dormitory will con- 
tain ample accommodations for the special agricultural students who have hitherto 
had to live with the other students in the regular college dormitories, together with 
dining rooms, kitchens, and other facilities for their cooperative boarding club. Its 
location on the college farm will enable them to give much closer attention to the 
practical work of the department. 
Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, College Station, Tex.—The attendance 
during the past session was at all times as great as our accommodations warrant. 
A characteristic feature added was the provision made by the legislature for addi- 
tional student labor; the larger part was educational, for which no compensation 
was allowed. Students performed noneducational labor when required by the 
college and received compensation according to industry, faithfulness, and effi- 
ciency. 
Prairie View State Normal School, Prairie View, Tex.—All departments showed 
marked progress. Students take readily to industrial pursuits. 
Agricultural College of Utah, Logan, Utah.—The new laundry, kitchen rooms, and 
culinary rooms of the domestic arts department, rooms for dairy department, shops 
for iron mechanism, forge shops, wood shops, drawing rooms, and laboratories of the 
new building have been found excellently adapted to their purpose. The college 
graduated its first class of 15 members this year. The commercial course has been 
extended to four years. 
University of Vermont and State Agricultural College, Burlington, Vt.—T wo new build- 
ings are being erected, and will cost, with equipments, $250,000, The number of stu- 
dents in the industrial departments is increasing, both actually and relatively. A 
valuable tract of land, 18 acres, has been pur sad: 
Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College, Blacksburg, Va.—The faculty has ie 
increased by the addition of three assistants—1 in mechanical engineering, 1 in Eng- 
lish, and 1 in mathematics. New buildings erected were a creamery and cheese fac- 
tory, cottage for horticultural foreman, and a dormitory containing 55 rooms. Large 
and important additions were made to the equipment of the departments of electrical 
and mechanical engineering; new lathes, benches, and machines were put in the wood 
shop; foundry put in running order; steam laundry put in operation, and large addi- 
tions made to the apparatus in the different scientific departments. ‘Two new pieces 
of artillery were purchased; 20 cows were added to the dairy herd, and pigs of

improved breed were obtained. The degrees conferred were as follows: 9 B.S.; 1 
A.M.; 1M.E.; 1C.E, 
Washington Agricultural College and School of Science, Pullman, Wash.—A short 
course in agriculture is offered for the benefit of those who come from the farm and 
go back soon to the farm. The course in domestic economy was well attended by 
young women. ‘The course in agriculture was attended by 25 young men. 
West Virginia University, Morgantown, W. Va.—The number of students has been 
greater than in any other vear in the history of the university. The full agricultural 
course has been extended to four years. Special effort is being made to develop the 
department of mechanical and electrical engineering and mechanic arts. Extensive 
additions have been made to the equipment and the capacity of the buildings will 
be doubled. About $10,000 were expended on buildings for the experiment station. 
University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis.—During the year the horticultural building 
has been erected at a cost of $23,167, $14,200 of which sum was by direct appropria- 
tion from the legislature of 1893 for that purpose. The same legislature appropriated 
$800 for tobacco investigations. One hundted and three students took the dairy 
course; we could have had twice this number had there been accommodations. The 
legislature of 1893 appropriated $25,000 for an addition to the present mechanical 
building, and these improvements are now well under way. 
University of Wyoming, Laramie, Wyo.—The equipment of the various laboratories 
has been improved, and the facilities for instruction are much better than heretofore. 
Wyoming is not an agricultural State and our students are not disposed to pursue a 
strictly agricultural course; but the mechanical engineering course is quite popular 
with the students, many, in scientific courses of the university, availing themselves 
of the opportunity offered in manual training afforded by the workshop of the 
mechanical department. 
THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE. 
[The following address was delivered by the Commissioner of Education at the 
annual meeting of the Association of American Agricultural Colleges and Experi- 
ment Stations, held at Washington, D. C., in 1894.] 
I thank you, Mr. President, for your kind allusions to me personally. In the few 
remarks which I have to make I propose to call attention to the twofold relation 
which the agricultural college bears, namely, on the one hand, to the Department of 
Agriculture, and on the other hand, to the Bureau of Education. The Department 
of Agriculture assists it by making wise and useful experiments in regard to plants 
and animals, the selection of the best methods of training and cultivating, the 
modes of adaptation to climate and soil. We, in other Departments of the Govern- 
ment here in Washington, are proud of what the Agricultural Department does in 
these and in other lines; but my Bureau wishes to be kept in mind by the managers 
of agricultural colleges for its interest in methods of teaching and school manage- 
ment. I shall speak at length of the method of teaching agriculture as a branch of 
study. The agricultural population in any country is the most conservative class of 
all its people. They follow the methods of their predecessor; they are patriarchal 
in their ways. You have dealt with them and do not need assurances from me. You 
could read us a lesson on this subject; but I was born on a farm and had the educa- 
tion of a farmer and know something about the prejudices and conceits that he 
harbors. The farmer believes his vocation to be the one which secures the most 
personal independence of all employments, because he raises what he eats and often 
the raw material for clothing. He thinks of an ideal civilization in some far distant 
future which shall have no cities, but only farms. I could make a long story of the 
development of my own ideas in this regard. I could tell how I changed my former 
ideas and came to see that farming is the most dependent of the employments, and 
that instead of farm life, urban life is the life of the future and of the highest 
civilization.. Farming will in that period become market gardening and be as 
   
-P-A-G-E-853
AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 805 
profitable as manufacturing and commerce are. I began by supposing that the 
farmer produced most of the wealth of the country, but when I investigated the 
questions of political economy I learned that it is the manufacturer and commercial 
vocations which add most to the value of our productions. 
The raw material furnished by the farmer constitutes one-fourth or one-fifth of 
the wealth of the country, and the three-fourths or four-fifths which includes the 
other wealth of the country is furnished by the manufacturer and trader and the 
one who transports the goods. Looking into the problem of the education of the 
farmer one meets first these curious facts: He finds the farmer the most conserva- 
tive person and the person who is the most ignorant of the true basis of modern 
civilization, which rests on productive industry and the application of machinery 
to the performance of the drudgery of the world. All this points directly to the 
significance of the agricultural and mechanical college. It shows its great power 
and usefulness. The agricultural college takes a boy from this place and another 
from that place, educates him, teaches him what his gifted fellow-men have been 
doing in the way of inventing new methods of creating wealth, increasing the pro- 
duction of farms, aiding human labor by machinery. It sends him back to his com- 
munity charged with information and with a spirit of inquiry. The college may 
profitably set its students to reporting upon the condition of their local communities, 
‘discussing the methods in vogue, and especially making note of the enterprising 
citizens of their localities. This suggests what we call ‘‘ university extension,” now 
creating so much interest in this country and England. University extension seems 
to be the very field of greatest usefulness open to the agricultural college. I defer 
to your better wisdom in this matter. It seems to me that such extension of higher 
education and of secondary education promises to enable us to take account of twe 
kinds of youth in the community. One kind of youth we have provided for. He 
is the boy who wants the old-fashioned education and his parents can afford to pay 
for it. 
We make him pass strict examinations in the elementary work, and promote him 
step «after step when he has completed the course prescribed. Hitherto we have 
included the other kind of boy—the boy who has great talent in some particular 
direction, but has not a taste for the old-fashioned education, and will not pass 
through a course of study extended through many years. The secondary school and 
the college lose their hold of this class of youth; but a great many of our successful 
men come from this class. Perhaps they would have taken a regular course of edu- 
cation in the schools if their parents had furnished the money for it. A great many 
of our millionaires are not college bred; many of our inventors are not college bred; 
they have, nevertheless, become giants in their special provinces. They have been 
gifted in special powers. It would be interesting could we trace in every case the 
history of these men back through their infancy and study their heredity also. We 
should see how the brain, nerves, and energy of the family worked to develop a man 
who has a faculty of secreting wealth, as the adipose tissue is secreted in the body. 
It is a matter of congratulation that the agricultural college is about to take hold 
of this work and look after the sporadic individual who is; good in some particular 
line but has no activity for general studies, or at least no taste for them. His whole 
soul goes out in activity on some particular line. It may be entomology, or astronomy, 
or meteorology, or botany, or archwology; or it may be a much narrower province, 
such as the cultivation of the potato, the improvement of the beet root for the table, 
or for sugar-making purposes. We shall agree that the schools ought to get hold of 
such men. I believe it is one of the important functions of the agricultural college 
to look out for the youth who do not come to school, but who show eminent capacity 
in particular lines relating to the industries, or especially agriculture. My neigh- 
bor, Mr. Bull, in Concord, Mass., invented the Concord grape by a long series of 
experiments on the native grapes of his region. 
I do not mention this function of the agricultural college as seeming to offer advice 
to you who are present, for I well know that you are the most competent men in the
-P-A-G-E-854
  806 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
United States to understand the work of the agricultural colleges, and I believe that 
you have found out or are in the process of finding out the lines in which to best 
direct their work. This annual conference of agricultural college presidents is itself 
sufficient evidence that what each discovers in the course of the year is brought to the 
attention of all his fellows. There is a constant process of reinforcing each agricul- 
tural college by the experience of all similar institutions. 
While I as an outsider am not competent to suggest new lines of work, I claim to 
know enough about the subject to arouse in me the desire to get brief reports on the . 
progress made by the faculties of your institutions in reducing agriculture and kin- 
dred branches of industry to apedagogical form. The branches of instruction in the 
old colleges have long since been reduced to such a form. The studies of Latin and 
Greek, mathematics, history, geography, grammar have been so arranged that the les- 
son that lies nearest to the pupil’s mind is placed at the beginning. It is followed by 
a second lesson which presupposes the first lesson and builds upon it, a third lesson, a 
fourth lesson, and all the rest follow; each one building on what has gone before it 
and adding some new matter of consideration that is important and useful. It is 
essential to the pedagogical form that the first lesson shall be useful and good if no 
other lesson follows it. It is essential that if you cut off the seriesof lessons at any 
point that all shall be useful and valuable up to that point. It is bad pedagogical 
form to oblige the pupil to learn a series of lessons which are nothing in themselves 
but the mere scaffolding to an important idea by and by to be developed. 
In your branches of mechanical industry you find that much has been done to 
reduce these to a pedagogical form. In the public schools of many cities, especially 
in Massachusetts, cooking is taught in a series of progressive lessons. Its pedagogic 
form has been fully developed. I take it that in the study of agriculture whatever 
branches are taught as preliminary discipline should have practical illustrations 
drawn from the soils, plants, and animals at every step. As in all other branches, 
we must get hold of the interest of a pupil, both hereditary and acquired, and fasten 
one by one our studies to this interest. I desire to get from each agricultural collego 
brief reports of progress made in reducing the various features of this field of study 
toa pedagogical form, being confident that when this reduction is complete, instruc- 
tion in agriculture will not only be well managed in your institutions, but also will 
find its way into the elementary schools of the farming districts. 
I read some time ago in Thorold Rodgers, in his book entitled “Six Hundred Years 
of Wages,” Chapter XVI, the following’: 
“We owe the improvements in English agriculture to Holland. From this country 
we borrowed, at the beginning of the seventeenth century, the cultivation of winter 
roots, and at that of the eighteenth century the artificial grasses. The Dutch had 
practiced agriculture with the patient and minute industry of market gardeners. 
They had tried successfully to cultivate everything to the uttermost which could be 
used for human food or could give innocent gratification to a refined taste. They 
taught agriculture and they taught gardening. They were the first people to sur- 
round their homesteads with flower beds, with groves, with trim parterres, with the 
Jinest turf, to improve fruit trees, to seck out and perfect edible roots and herbs, at once 
for man and cattle. We owe to the Dutch that scurvy and leprosy have been banished 
from England; that continuous crops have taken the place of barren fallows; that 
the true rotation of crops has been discovered and perfected; that the population of 
these islands has been increased, and that the cattle and sheep in England are ten times 
what they were in numbers and déhree times what they were in size and quality. 
Even now the ancient agricultural skill of the Hollander is not extinct. The 
gardeners of Haarlem still purvey roots and bulbs of flowers for the civilized world, and 
there is much which the English agriculturist of the present day could learn with 
advantage from the industry, patience, and skill of the Dutch farmer, and perhaps 
will learn, when England is relieved from the curse of her present land system and 
her tenant farmers till the land under the same guarantees as the Dutchman does.”
-P-A-G-E-855
  AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 807 
It would seem from this quotation that England changed her agriculture from the 
old-fashioned style of raising staple crops to the more lucrative and highly developed 
farming known by us as “market gardening.” I think that it is one of the most 
important subjects connected with the study of agriculture—this matter of market 
gardening. I can see that it is very important to detail intelligent students or com- 
mittees of students from each class to study the methods of the market gardeners 
who live in the suburbs of the nearest large cities. The States remote from cities 
show a much less profitable farming than those States whose farmers reside in the 
neighborhood of the great cities. Some years ago I found that the farmers of Maine 
averaged about $300 a family, counting their total productions at market prices; 
while the farmers of Connecticut averaged only a little less than $600 a year, because 
of their nearness to New York and its densely populated suburbs. What an interest- 
ing seminarium or college conference could be held with a class of agricultural 
students who discussed in a round-table style the report of a committee of their 
classmates who had been inquiring into the market gardens and ascertaining what 
erops are raised and in what order of succession; how many in the year; how the 
gardeners meet the first demands of the market in the spring; how they use forcing 
houses; how they handle transportation; how they get to market; how they live— 
that is to say, how they sleep and eat while on the way to the city and while there. 
All these little practical items become interesting and suggestive when discussed in 
this way. The uneducated person lives and acts, but does not think about the method 
of his living and acting. School education sets the individual at once to considering 
the method in which things are done. What an interesting thing it would be to 
compare the methods of market gardeners in New Orleans, Cincinnati, Boston, New 
York, Chicago, St. Louis, Baltimore, etc. Set to study these processes, the students 
of the agricultural college become centers of information and directive power for 
their neighborhoods when they return as graduates to their homes. 
It has been found that university extension stands in need of endowment much 
more than the regular teaching work of the colleges of the country. There should 
be fellowships founded by wealthy men interested in agriculture, so that young men 
of genius may repair to the college on these fellowships and have their necessary 
expenses all provided for. This is the one country of the world for endowment of 
educational institutions by private munificence. I presume that each college presi- 
dent knows of certain persons who would be glad to erect monuments for their 
families in the shape of scholarships in the State university, if they were sure that 
the money would increase the practical acumen of students who seek higher educa- 
tion. I believe that in this direction large endowments may be expected in tho 
near future, and that a proper account of the practical work done by agricultural 
students when published in the Annual Report of the Commissioner of Education 
will be found the best means of attracting m men of wealth numerous endow- 
ments for the purpose of founding fellowships in agriculture. Many of the wealthy 
men of this country look askance at the liberal education furnished in our colleges 
and universities. Many have devoted large sums to establish nondescript institutes, 
with the hope that they would better fit young men for industry and the practical 
demands of life. They want something, but they do not know how to obtain what 
they want. I believe that it isin the future of these land-grant colleges, founded 
for agricultural and mechanical instruction, to solve this problem and to hold up for 
the would-be practical philanthropists a kind of education which makes the most 
of the talents of the youth and to stimulate him to original investigation and to 
lead him onward into the necessary abstruse and highly technical studies which 
are necessary in order to endow him with power to solve the highest problems. I 
have ventured to make these remarks in order to show more clearly what kind of 
contributions I should like from the presidents and professors of agricultural col- 
Jeges who will kindly undertake to record for me these items of progress in the 
development of the pedagogical form for the new branches of instruction.

  CHAPTER II. 
FORESTRY EDUCATION. 
By C. WELLMAN Parks, C. E., Special Agent of the Bureau of Education to the Antwerp 
Exposition. 
Probably no other great subject is receiving so little attention in the United 
States as the science of forestry. Its importance is not generally appreciated and 
doubtless most people look upon it as a subject of secondary importance to all but 
farmers and lumbermen. Americans, who are so apt to invent mechanical appli- 
ances to effect economies in manufacturing, should excel in the treatment of the 
greater questions of political and social economy. So long as the forest is consid- 
ered only as a source of timber and wood and continues to supply these commodities 
in such quantity that the market prices are not materially increased, it may be 
difficult to impress the people with the idea that forestry is a question which 
demands immediate consideration. But there is no nation of Europe which has not 
learned that forest science is a subject of national importance, and we can not hope 
to ignore it for many more generations. 
Nearly every European nation owns extensive forests, which are so well managed 
by State forest directors that they are the source of considerable public revenues. 
Among the largest and best managed of the national forests are the Prussian forests, 
of 6,200,000 acres; the French forests, of 2,200,000 acres; the Bavarian forests, of 
2,300,000 acres, and the Austrian forests, of 2,330,000 acres. The following table 
shows the area, approximate annual cost, and approximate annual income from each 
of the above forests:

Of the 70,000,000 acres of forest land owned by the United States about 17,000,000 
acres have been reserved for permanent forests. Besides the forest land owned by the 
United States, there are about 400,000,000 acres of forest land owned by individuals. 
At present we are using, annually, 500,000,000 cubic feet of wood for railroads, 
another 500,000,000 cubic feet for fencing, 4,000,000,000 cubic feet for lumber, and 
about 17,000,000,000 cubic feet for all other purposes. If forests were properly man- 
aged, the annual growth of 300,000,000 acres would produce this amount of wood. 
Under present conditions it is probable that not over a third of the consumption is 
supplied by annual growth, the balance being taken from the original store of the 
forests; that is, we are not only using the interest but are impairing the nation’s 
809

    SLO: -EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
capital. If this means deforesting one or two million acres per year, the nation may, 
from the point of view of timber and wood supply, continue for another century to 
ignore the subject. 
It must be remembered, however, that much of the forest land is so far removed 
from the populous parts of the country that its wood is practically unavailable on 
account of the cost of transportation; so it is desirable to reduce the consumption of 
forest produce by substituting other materials where practicable, and by taking such 
precautions as will increase the life of timber. This is specially true as regards 
railroad ties, for the tie maker generally wastes more wood than he uses. Often he 
destroys a fine, large oak to make a single tie, which he sells for less than 50 cents. 
But of much greater importance than its value as a source of timber and wood is 
the influence of a forest upon agriculture, trade, and transportation. 
No agricultural crop can be a success without a proper mixture of sun and water, 
and over much of the country the farmers have reason to fear drought until their 
crops are either ruined or harvested. Their experience has been such that they do 
not expect a full crop oftener than once in three or four years. If they could be 
assured that their crops would be frequently watered they would feel that time 
expended in planting is not wasted time. Anything, which is not too expensive, 
that can insure a proper supply of water should be made use of; and it is believed 
that a forest, more than any other thing, can do this. If so, our high lands should 
be covered with forests. An assured and properly used water supply would increase 
the income from farm lands by at least $5 per acre, which would warrant the expendi- 
ture of from $50 to $100 per acre to provide such a supply. At the prices for which 
forest land is being sold in New England this would represent from 10 to 30 acres of 
mountain forest. Of the total areas of valleys the best tenth might be divided into 
farms to be worked by their owners and the other nine-tenths kept in forest. The 
increased taxable value of the farms would be sufficient reason for the State to own 
and preserve the forest, for the interest on the investmenf, would be more than met 
by the increased taxes on the improvements, even if the forest itself yielded no direct 
income. 
Turning from agriculture to manufacturing, we find that nearly all manufacturers 
are using steam engines, and that the natural energy of the streams is wasted, 
‘because water power can not be relied upon, the streams getting beyond control 
after thaws and storms, and at some other times becoming almost dry. The floods 
are liable to do great damage to buildings and goods, and the dry stages require 
either a suspension of operation or supplementary power. 
This condition, which has come about with the cutting of the forests and the set- 
tlement of lands upstream, causes us to consider whether the farms are worth as 
much as the forests and uniform water power which they have caused to disappear. 
In the case of steam power, man mines and transports coal at great expense, and in 
converting it into mechanical energy is forced by nature to waste five-sixths of the 
inherent energy. In the case of water power, nature transports the fuel and allows 
man to use five-sixths of the inherent energy. For the protection of our coal supply, 
wasteful steam engines should, wherever practicable, be displaced by water motors 
or by electric motors driven by electricity gerierated by water power and trans- 
mitted to the distant points where it is needed. The Goyernment should, by 
. restoring the forests, improve the flow of streams, and thus encourage the substitu- 
tion of economical water wheels for wasteful steam engines. 
Turning from manufacturing to transportation, the Erie Canal and Hudson River 
will be mentioned as examples of water highways that have been injured by the 
destruction of the forests. For many years the Mohawk River furnished sufficient 
rater to operate the eastern end of the Erie Canal, but when much land had been 
improved the floods and droughts came and made it necessary to find an additional 
supply of water, so the Black River was tapped. These same floods and droughts 
changed the flow in the Hudson to such an extent that adjacent lands and buildings 
were damaged by the floods, and navigation was impeded by the droughts and the 
   
-P-A-G-E-859

silt deposited by the receding floods. Millions of dollars are being expended to 
remedy these evils, “not by removing the source of the evils but by removing the ~ 
effects. 
Fortunately natural forest land is held to be of so little value that States can 
acquire it without great expense, and if forests are so important to the farmer, 
manufacturer, and transporter, it would seem that the Government should own and 
manage the forests for the benefit of all citizens of the State. Another reason for 
State ownership of forests is that a State can wait a century for the crop which is 
so slow growing that it can not return an early crop to the planter. 
Forestry, then, should receive attention, because a properly managed forest will 
furnish a continuous supply of useful forest products; because it will furnish uni- 
form power to manufacturers, and because it will regulate the flow of water and 
silt in navigable and irrigating streams, thus insuring good crops and cheap trans- 
portation. 
The proper management of forests requires a considerable number of highly edu- 
cated forest engineers, and every European nation has at least one state school in 
which to educate such men. France has its school at Nancy; Italy has its school at 
Vallambrosa; Spain has its school in the Escorial, and nearly every other nation has 
a school at or near the capital of the country, Among the important forest schools 
in Germany are the Prussian schools at Neustadt, Eberswald, and Miinden; the 
Saxon school at Tharandt, the Badenese school at Carlsruhe, and the Bavarian schools 
at Aschaffenburg and Munich. Until recently England had no forest school, but, 
recognizing the importance of having trained forest engineers, sent state pupils to 
the schools at Nancy, Carlsruhe, and Zurich to be trained for service in the forest 
departments of India, South Africa, and other colonies. 
One ean not doubt that such a school is needed in this country, for, to avoid rob- 
bing future generations, the present generation must keep the country in as good 
natural condition as it is to-day; and this can not be done without specially trained 
men to direct the use and stop the abuse of natural resources. This generation is 
robbing future generations by wasting coal, oil, gas, and wood. The Nationa! and 
State governments should combine to stop this abuse, and, while thus protecting 
the interests of the citizens, they may draw from the forests and streams a consider- 
able income which should reduce the tax rates on property owned by individuals, 
Three hundred million acres of forest, managed as state forests are managed in 
France and Germany, would require perhaps 30,000 trained men and, providing the 
market prices were alike in Germany and the United States, would yield a net 
income of over $250,000,000. As the market prices are not now the same in both 
countries no such profits could be expected, but the rapid increase of population in 
this country may be depended upon to soon make the conditions here what they 
now are in Germany. 5 
The following brief description of typical European schools will give some idea 
of their plans, methods, and equipment, and may be of value in deciding upon the 
form of school best suited to the conditions which prevail in this country. 
The French National Forestry School, established at Nancy in 1824, has from the 
beginning been devoted exclusively to the education of forest engineers; and, while 
maintained especially for the education of candidates for the French forest service, 
it has been open to other French students who disclaimed any intention of ever 
becoming candidates for positions in the state forest service. Of both classes of 
French students the average number in attendance has been about 40. At the 
request of the Belgian and British governments, state pupils from those nations 
have also been allowed to study at the school. 
Until 1888 the first part of the course was devoted to the study of mathematics 
and fundamental sciences preparatory to the advanced professional work of the latter 
part of the course. At that time, it having been decided that some of the prelimi- 
nary work could as well be done elsewhere, and that the faculty at Nancy, if relieved 
of this work, could give better attention to the professional part of the course, the   
-P-A-G-E-860
      
812 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
President of France decreed that henceforth all state pupils of thé National 
Forestry School at Nancy should be chosen from the graduates of the National Agro- 
nomic Institute of France, an institution revived in 1876, and established in the 
Conservatoire des Arts et Métiérs at Paris, 
In the latter institution there is a three-yea course of instruction given by a 
teaching staff of about 50 professors and others. Of those graduates who wish to 
enter the national forestry service, the 10 or 12 who stand highest in the classes are 
given purses of 1,500 frances and appointments to the National Forestry School at 
Nancy. 
Since this arrangement went into effect the course of instruction at Nancy has 
been shortened to two years, of which time thirteen months are given to theory and 
seven months to practice. The subjects taught by the 7 professors may be classed 
under four heads. (1) Natural science applied to forestry (forest meteorology, 
forest life and growth, forest estimates, etc.); (2) legal science applied to forestry 
(civil and criminal laws, game laws, forest laws, etc.); (3) administrative science 
applied to methods and plans for working forests; (4) mathematical science applied 
to topography, surveying, mapping, hydraulics, and the construction of roads, 
buildings, bridges, mills, and dams. 
A forest experiment station, of very great value to the school, is conducted by the 
director in a forest of about 6,500 acres set apart for this purpose. Here the student 
of forest science has a chance to become familiar with the practical management of 
the forest and forest nursery, the taking of meteorological observations, and the 
methods of forest research. 
The United States Government having already set apart over 17,000,000 acres of 
land, to be kept in forest, should be interested in the education of men to manage this 
immense property. It is a question whether this interest should be shown by encour- 
aging the States to properly educate candidates for this service or by providing a 
national school for forest officers, similar to those already established for army and 
naval officers. Ifa national school were to be established, it might well be modeled 
to some extent after the schoolat Nancy, but it should be located in Washington, and 
the chief of the Forestry Division of the Department of Agriculture should be its 
nominal director. A deputy might represent him in minor details of management. 
The Commissioner of Lands should be president of the regents. The students should 
be drawn from the agricultural and scientific schools of the country, and should be 
kept in the national school for one or two years. Special attention should be paid to 
social and political economy as well as to the subjects relating to the technical work- 
ing of forests. 
While the school at Nancy might be a good example to follow in planning a national 
school, it would not seem to be as good a model for an economical state school as one 
of the arrangements given below. 
The class of institution represented by the schools of Baden and Switzerland is 
better adapted to the requirements of States which may find it desirable to educate 
forest officers. The forest school of Baden is a school in the Polytechnicum at Carls- 
ruhe, and the forest instruction in Switzerland is given in one of the three depart- 
ments of the forest and agricultural school of the Polytechnic. 
At Carlsruhe, the Polytechnicum was established in 1832, and two years later 
the school of forestry was opened. Being one small school (35 students) of a large 
institution (775 students) the school of forestry is much more economically officered 
and managed than it would be if it were conducted as an independent institution. 
The special teaching force required consists of 2 professors and 2 assistants, all work 
not done by these men being done by other teachers of the Polytechnicum in con- 
nection with similar work for other schools, Of the hundred hours’ instruction per 
week given in winter to the four forestry classes, the special teachers give forty-four 
hours, and they give forty-four hours out of the total of seventy-five hours given in 
summer to the three classes. 
It will be noticed that the course consists of four winter and three summer terms 
  , 
   
-P-A-G-E-861
FORESTRY EDUCATION. 813 
the winter terms lasting from October 1 to March 15, and the summer terms from 
April 15 to July 31. 
Besides the other numerous collections belonging to the Polytechnicum, there are 
two special collections for the forestry students, an arboretum, and a collection of 
objects of importance in forest work. 
The course of instruction, based upon history, science, and art, and given by lec- 
tures, examinations, and laboratory work, is offered to citizens of Baden who have 
completed a full course at a gymnasium and wish to enter the State-forest service. 
For two years the studies do not relate directly to forestry, but are fundamental, 
and prepare the students for the forestry studies, which are given in the last two 
years. 
At the end of the second year examinations in natural philosophy and mathe- 
matics are held by the professors of the Polytechnicum, and these examinations are 
open not only to the students who have attended the two lower classes at the Poly- 
technicum but also to foreigners.who have not attended these classes. Cundidates 
who pass these examinations are then admitted to the work of the upper classes. 
At the end of the course final examinations are held by a board consisting of the 
forest directors, a lawyer, and professors of agriculture, mathematics, and forest 
management. Successful candidates then become assistants to district-forest direc- 
tors and are in line for promotion whenever vacancies occur. 
The course of study for 1894-95 is as follows:

In Zurich, as mentioned above, forestry instruction is given in the Agricultural 
and Forestry School of the United Polytechnics. For some years a similar arrange- 
ment existed at Carlsruhe, but of late years the agricultural part has not been in 
operation. In Carlsruhe there is a three and a half years’ course, and in Zurich a 
three years’ course. In Carlsruhe there are 2 special professors ; in Zurich there are 3. 
Twenty professors belonging to other of the Zurich polytechnic schools also give 
instruction to forestry students. At Carlsruhe the forestry school*has no special 
building; at Zurich the agricultural and forestry school has a special four-story 
building 115 feet long and 57 feet wide. The high basement is here counted as one 
story. This building contains laboratories, museums, lecture rooms, and studies for 
the professors and assistants. The north end of the second floor is used for an agri- 
cultural chemical laboratory large enough to accommodate about 20 students. Con- 
nected with this laboratory are furnace and balance rooms, a reference library, and 
a collection of chemical preparations. The Plant Physiological Institute for the 
study of general botany (morphology, anatomy, physiology, pathology, and crypto- 
gamic art) is provided on the upper floor with auditorium, physiological laboratory, 
museum, apparatus room, and a microscopical laboratory furnished with 25 micro- 
scopes and about 2,500 slides. 
The forest school museum is arranged in two parts, part one being of natural 
science and part two of forest science. Part one, devoted to the science of soils and 
plant growth, contains an herbarium, a collection of woods, saps, resins, barks, nuts, 
and other products; a collection of useful and i ious mammals, birds, and insects, 
and a series of sections of the same tree cut at different heights. Part two, devoted 
to forest exploitation, instruction, statistics, and hydraulics, contains a collection of 
tools, models of coal and tar kilns, contrivances for transportation of wood, forest 
maps and charts, models and sections to illustrate drainage methods, models of 
game, and a rich forest literature. 
Besides the museums and laboratories already mentioned there is an arboretum 
and also an experiment station in the Zurich forest.

FORESTRY EDUCATION. 815 
Instruction in the following subjects is given to forestry students: 
WINTER SESSION. 
General forestry, forest policy, forest protection, forest guards, forest climate, forest 
culture, forest products, general law, political economy, general botany, pathology 
of plants, general geology, mathematics, topography, and map and plan drawing. 
SUMMER SESSION. 
Forest history, forest laws, forest growth, forest valuation, forest practice and 
technology, forest roads and hydraulics, forest botany, plant physiology, microscopy, 
varieties of wood, petrography, soils, organic and agricultural chemistry, meteor- 
ology, experimental physics, mathematics, topography, map and plan drawing, and 
general law. 
At the beginning of the third year examinations are held in mathematics, physics, 
chemistry, agricultural chemistry, general and special botany, zoology, general 
geology, climatology, meteorology, and political economy. At the end of the courso 
oral examinations are held in forest policy, forest management, forest protection, 
forest growth, forest valuation, forest revenues, wood measurement, surveying, earth 
constructions, hydraulics, and general law. 
Candidates for graduation are required to prepare a thesis and a set of working 
plans. 
If it were decided that American forest officers should be educated in schools mod- 
eled after those of Zurich and Carlsruhe, our land-grant colleges would furnish the 
opportunity; for, while they are now devoted almost exclusively to the study of 
agriculture and the mechanic arts, they could easily be sufficiently expanded to 
provide for the proper education of forest engineers. In most cases it would be 
necessary to add professorships of law, political economy, and forestry, and it would 
probably be desirable to add a post-graduate year to the present course. 
But a third class of institution, represented by the Bavarian system, is probably 
much better than anything described above, and could be quite easily provided in | 
most of the States. Thissystem makes forestry a university study, and, by requiring 
forestry students to live and study at a university, secures for forest officers a body 
of broad-minded men who are well able to deal with matters of public policy. 
In 1807, seven years before the principality of Aschaffenburg became a part of the 
Kingdom of Bavaria, a private forest institute was opened in Aschaffenburg, and 
the prince primate, who took a great interest in the school, desired to make it a 
public institution; but for various reasons was only able to grant it a part of the 
Spessart forest for its home and support. After the consolidation a reseript, dated 
September 22, 1815, continued the institute in possession of its property and privi- . 
leges, although it was thought that the institute could not do all that should be 
required of a forest institute. At that time there were seven teachers, of whom the 
director was forest master of the Spessart; three other teachers were professors in 
other schools, and another was a physician. 
The Bayarian general forest administration, after considering the means available 
for the education of forest officials, determined that while a forest academy might 
be of advantage in training men for the subordinate positions in the forest service, 
the university must be depended upon to prepare men for the higher positions. 
By the consolidation Aschaffenburg had lost its importance as 4 seat of govern- 
ment. In consideration of this, and also on account of the forest institute already 
established, it was decided in 1819 to establish a national forest academy in Aschaf- 
fenburg, although a central location would have been more convenient for the peo- 
ple. Thisacademy was not satisfactory, so was closed in 1832, but was again opened 
in 1843 because a school was much needed and no other place considered seemed to 
offer better facilities. 
It is the function of this academy to prepare young men, who wish to enter the 
Bavarian forest service, in the fundamental and accessory sciences so far as may be 
 
-P-A-G-E-864
  816 EDUCATION REPORT, 1898-94. 
necessary to qualify them for pursuing an exhaustive study of forest science ina 
university and in the forest experimental institute in Munich. All candidates for 
the Bavarian State forest service must and other students may take the two-year 
course at the academy. 
Instruction is given by a director, a forest director, and professors of mathematics, 
physics, botany, zoology, chemistry, and drawing; and the subjects taught are 
algebra, geometry, trigonometry, analytical geometry, calculus, inorganic and organic 
chemistry, physics, botany, zoology, mineralogy, mensuration, surveying, map draw- 
ing, clements of sylvaculture, forest guards, road making, and hunting. 
After finishing the course at Aschaffenburg, forest-service candidates must con- 
tinue their studies for at least two years at a German university and must attend at 
least one year at the practical exercises in the forest experiment station at Munich. 
This last work may be done during the second year of attendance at the university. 
At the university in Munich students are instructed in political economy, jurispru- 
dence, and professional forestry. The six forestry professors are members of the 
faculty of political economy. 
The following subjects    e taught at the university: 
WINTER SESSION. 
Sylvaculture and forest conservation, 5 hours per week; soils, 4 hours; natural 
laws regulating agriculture and sylvaculture with work in forest chemistry labora- 
tory, 3 hours; measurement of wood, 4 hours; forest surveying, 3 hours; forest 
statistics, 4 hours; microscopic study of plants, 4 hours; microscopy, 3 hours; State 
forests, 5 hours; forest history, 3 hours. 
SUMMER SESSION. 
Forest exploitation and forest technology, 5 hours; conservation of woods and 
forests, 1 hour; climatology and meteorology, 4 hours; chemistry of plants, 3 hours; 
rentability and income of forests, 2 hours; forest culture, 3 hours; vegetable 
pathology, 3 hours; forest administration, 5 hours; road making, 2 hours; land 
surveying, 3 hours, and forest policy, 2 hours. 
Final examinations are held in Munich every year and are open to any student at 
the university whether he intends to enter the forest service or not. 
If this class of institution shall become the model to be followed in establishing 
American forestry schools, there are already a half dozen or more good universities 
in which such schools can be established. It is not desirable to have too many 
institutions undertake this work, but there is room for ten if they be properly 
distributed. 
Tho admirable report of the New York forest commission for 1893 gives detailed 
information relating to the Adirondack and Catskill forests, from which it would 
appear that the demand in that-State for trained forest directors will soon be felt 
and will have to be met. 
There are in the Adirondack forest about 3,500,000 acres, of which the State owns 
about 750,000 acres and 45 clubs and individuals own about 950,000 acres. In the 
Catskills there are about 2,000,000 acres, of which the State owns about 50,000 acres. 
Probably a single school would provide for the mountain region of New England 
and New York, and this region should require about 30 graduates per year. 
Other schools should be provided for the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coast regions, 
the Alleghany and Rocky Mountain regions, and the upper and lower plains of the 
Mississippi Valley. E 
[In connection with the preceding article on forestry education by Professor Parks 
it may be well to state that-while there are no special schools of forestry in the 
United States, some instruction in forestry is given in a number of the colleges of 
agriculture and the mechanic arts endowed by the.acts of Congress of July 2, 1862, 
and August 30, 1890.]

FORESTRY EDUCATION. 817 
The instruction in this subject is not very extended, covering, in nearly all cases, 
but one term of the college year. It is carried on mainly by lectures and such text- 
books as Hough’s Elements of Forestry and Fuller’s Practical Forestry, the lectures 
and instruction being given by either the professor of horticulture or the professor 
of botany. There is not, so far as known by this Bureau, a separa‘e and distinct 
professorship of forestry in any institution in the United States. The subject is, 
however, receiving increasing attention in this country, as is evidenced by the 
creation of State forestry commissions. 
Tho instruction in forestry given by the land-grant institutions, as shown by their 
catalogues, is as follows: 
Colorado Agricullural College.—Lectures are given on the gathering and preserva- 
tion of forest-tree seed, the planting of seed, and the care of seedlings; on the value 
of trees for timber and ornament, for hedges, screens, and shelter belts. (Fall term.) 
University of Ilinois.—Forest trees and their uses, their natural distribution, and 
their art l production, The relations of forest and climate are studied, and the 
general topics of forestry legislation and economy are discussed. (Lectures, winter 
term; half study.)

South Dakota Agricultural College.—Yorestry follows the work in botany and horti- 
culture, extending throngh two terms of the junior year. The work in this depart- 
ment consists of lectures upon the propagation and planting of forest trees in groves 
and along streets; the value of shelter belts; the influence of forests upon wind and 
rainfall, followed by a study of the habits and characters of trees best suited to 
South Dakota. The lecture work is supplemented by practical work in the forest 
plantation upon the college grounds. 
Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas.—The management and planting of 
woodlands; consideration of the réle they play in the economy of nature. Hough’s 
Elements of Forestry, and North American Sylva, by Michaux. (Fourth year, winter 
term.) 
Agricultural College of Utah.—Forestry will receive considerable attention. Stn- 
dents will have opportunity to work upon the forestry grounds of the college and 
to note methods of planting and care of the several kinds of trees, and to observe 
their habits and rapidity of growth. 
Washington Agricultural College and School of Science.—The nursery already affords 
a large variety of trees from which the arboretum will be formed and the campus 
ornamented. This will afford the opportunity for the study of a large number of 
varieties, their habits of life, the best methods of cultivating forest trees, and mak- 
ing tree plantations. The attention for the present will be directed rather to the creation and preservation of young forests than to the care of old forests, though 
some lectures will be given upon the latter and collateral readings required.

  CHAPTER II. 
GEOLOGY IN THE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES OF THE 
UNITED STATES, 
By T. C. Hopxins. 
The subject matter of the following notes and statistical tables on geology in the 
colleges has been obtained from the following sources: (1) The replies received from 
a circular sent out by the Bureau of Education to the different colleges; (2) the 
college catalogues, circulars, and announcements; (3) personal correspondence and 
interviews; (4) special contributions from other geologists. Prof. J. F, Kemp, 
Columbia College, New York; Mr. L.S. Griswold, Harvard University, Massachusetts ; 
Mr. J. A. Bownocker, Yale University, Connecticut, and Mr. C. E. Siebenthal, 
Indiana University, Indiana, kindly contributed the artieles on those institutions. 
Prof. G. D. Harris, Cornell University, contributed information from that institution. 
The material is arranged alphabetically by States and by the locality of the college, 
except, that in the deseriptive part, the colleges having strong departments of geology 
are generally described first, irrespective of locality. : 
The material was collected and arranged with three classes of people in mind, to 
whom the matter might be of interest: and value: (1) Teachers of geology who are 
desirous of knowing what geological work is being done in other institutions and 
what facilities others have for doing the work; (2) prospective students in geology, 
especially graduate students, who are desirous of comparing the facilities in the 
different institutions; (3) the large class of educators who are interested from the 
standpoint of general education. 
It would be interesting in this connection to have statistics on geology im the high 
schools, seminaries, and normal schools, but such are not available at present. 
The tables and notes were made out from the original sources with considerable 
eare, but a revision would no doubt correct many minor points, and would enable 
the placing of mineralogy in a separate column in the general table. A number of 
institutions give mineralogy part of a term or part of a year in connection with 
geology, so that it was not possible in some instances to determine the time devoted 
to each subject; but as some institutions make mmeralogy entirely independent of 
geology it would be better to have placed it in a separate column, 
A like difficulty is encountered in attempting to tabulate statistics in the eom- 
paratively modern branches of petregraphy and physiography whieh are being intro- 
duced rapidly into most of the higher grade institutions, but which in many of them, 
as yet, form only partial courses along with general geology or mineralogy. 
Economie geology has been introduced in many institutions within the last few 
years. Among some of tho leading institutions offering special facilities m this line 
might be mentioned Columbia College, Harvard University, University of Chicago, 
Cornell University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
The figures relative to the cost of equipment and number of specimens are for the 
most part only approximations, but as they are furnished either by the head of the 
department. or the president: of the institution they will be close enough to give a 
819 
   
-P-A-G-E-868
  820 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94, 
basis for comparison. In some of the older institutions, as Harvard and Yale, where 
the large and valuable collections, are the growth of many decades, no fair approxi- 
mation of either the number or value could be given. 
Among other points of terest shown in the tables is the wide difference in the 
number and strength of the departments of geology in States so closely allied in 
position, size, population, and wealth, as New York and Pennsylvania, or Illinois 
and Indiana. Thus Pennsylvania having geology in 24 colleges has a separate 
department of geology in only J, and that the Philadelphia high school; while New 
York with geology in 22 institutions has separate departments in 9, a number of 
them being quite strong departments. 
While there are 7 ladies teaching geology in the colleges with two exceptions 
they are in small colleges, whero only elementary text-book instruction is attempted. 
The two exceptions are Miss Sarah Y. De Normandie, at Wellesley College; and Miss 
Florence Bascom, recently Ph. D, in geology from Johns Hopkins, now (1894) at the 
Ohio State University, but recently elected to Bryn Mawr College. 
It will be noticed that instruction in geology, while combined in different places 
with a great many different subjects, is more frequently combined with the biologic 
sciences than any other, although combinations with chemistry or mathematics are 
not infrequent. In alargo number of tho small colleges instruction in all the natural 
sciences, including geology, is given by one instructor. 
ALABAMA. 
In Alabama geology is tanght in 6 different institutions, but in only 1, the State 
University, is it a separate department. 
The University of Alabama.—Geology was taught at this university in 1831, the 
year the university was founded, by J. F. Wallis, who was succeeded in 1834 by 
F. T. Bramby. At present it is taught by Eugene A. Smith, who is also State 
geologist. 
The specimens collected by the State geological survey are available for instrue- 
tion, so that the department is not lacking in illustrative material. The number of 
mineral specimens is estimated at 2,000, and rocks and fossils at 20,000, valued at 
$10,000. Professor Smith’s private library is available for reference. 
A four years’ course is given, comprising (1) physical geography, (2) mineralogy, 
and crystallography, (3) general geology, (4) economic geology and special geology 
of Alabama, The full course of four years is required of students in mining engi- 
neering. Three years are required of scientific and civil engineering students, with 
the privilege of electing the fourth year. In the classical course ono year in gen- 
eral geology is required. 
At the Alabama Polytechnic Institute, Auburn, Ala., geology was first taught in 
1859 by Prof. John Darby. The present instructor is P. H. Mell, professor of geology 
and botany. Geology is taught for one year and mineralogy for part of a year. 
Post-graduate instruction is also given in geology. In 1893-91 there were 43 students 
in geology, 1 being a graduate student, and 2 in mineralogy. Special attention is 
given to the geology of Alabama, and economic geology is taught to some extent. 
Geology is required of all students in the senior year, 
ARIZONA, 
Arizona has at present bnt 1 institution in which geology is taught, the Univer- 
sity of Arizona at Tucson, founded in 1891. Theodore B. Comstock, president of the 
university, teaches geology, mineralogy, and mining. There are three courses of 
one term each offered in mineralogy and petrography and five in geology. The first 
includes physical aud determinative mineralogy and petrography. The geology 
includes (1) physiography, (2) structural, (3) dynamical and stratigraphical geology, 
(4) engineering geology, and (5) paleontology. he number of specimens in the 
collections is estimated at 3,500, valued at $3,000. . Along with the coliections of the

former Territorial geologist tre institution has received the Arizona collection from 
the World’s Fair. 
ARKANSAS, 
Geology is taught in 5 institutions in Arkansas, but forms a separate department 
in none. In the Arkansas Industrial University, at Fayetteville, biology and geology 
are combined 1n one department, with J. F. McNeil, professor, and S. E. Meek, adjunct 
professor. There are two terms’ work in structural, dynamical, and physical geology, 
whicb is carried on by means of recitations, lectures, field and laboratory work. 
Two terms are devoted to historical geology, one to economic geology, one to paleon- 
tology, and ono year to agricultural geology, making nine terms in all. The 
geological laboratory is provided with barometers, compasses, levels, pedometers, 
drawing apparatus, section-cutting machines, and paleontological collections. 
Hendrix College, at Conway, has one term in mineralogy and two in geology, taught 
by G. H. Burr, professor of natural and physical science. 
CALIFORNIA. 
Geology is taught in California in 7 different colleges, but it is a separate depart- 
ment in only two, the State University, at Berkeley, and Stanford University, Palo 
Alto, both of which have an able faculty in geology, and are well equipped for prac- 
tical work. The head professor in each institution has had charge of the department 
of geology since the opening of the respective universities in 1869 and 1892. The 
State as well as the institution is fortun ate in both cases in having at the head of th 
department a man of international reputation. 
University of California, Berkeley, Cal.—Joseph Le Conte, professor of geology and 
natural history; Andrew C. Lawson, associate professor of geology and mineralogy; 
¥. L. Ransom, fellow in mineralogy; J.C. Merriam, fellow in paleontology. Geology 
was taught in the University of California at its opening in 1869 by Professor Le 
Conte, who has been there since that date. 
The institution, being an old one for a Western State, has accumulated much val- 
uable illustrative and working material. The estimated value of the mineral and 
rock collections is $28,000; instruments, maps, ctc., $8,000. There are 1,382 volumes 
in the geological library and 55,000 specimens in the mineral and rock collections. 
The equipment is being added to constantly; a new building for geology is in con- 
templation, and it is expected that a paleontologist will soon be added to the teach- 
ing force. 
Five courses are offered in geology, one of which is a graduate course; and two 
courses in mineralogy. Professor Le Conte offers a course in general geology, Pro- 
fessor Lawson offers courses in field geology, petrography, graduate courso in crystal- 
lography, mineralogical terminology, and descriptive mineralogy, F. L. Ransom a 
course in the mineralogical laboratory, and Dr, Merriam a course in general paleon- 
tology. 
The department of geology issues bulletins from time to time, giving, in the form 
of memoirs, results of research by some member or members of the faculty or grad- 
uate students, the object being an incentive to original research by the graduate 
student and an opportunity to give the results of his work to the scientific world. 
Four numbers of the bulletin were issued in 1893-94. 
The California division of the United States Geological Survey has made its head- 
quarters at the university since 1891, which enables students to see something of the 
practical side of the subject and come in contact with working geologists. 
In the two upper classes in 1893-94 about 40 per cent of the students elected geol- 
ogy. There were four graduate students taking geology as a major study and three 
as a minor, 
Leland Stanford Junior University, Palo Alto, Cal.—John C. Branner, professor of 
geology; J. Perrin Smith, associate professor of mineralogy and paleontology.
-P-A-G-E-870
  822 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94, 
Professor Branner was State geologist of Arkansas at the time the university opened, 
October, 1891, and did not remove to the university until February, 1892, when the 
work in geology began. Professor Smith came in October, 1893. 
For the short time the university has been open the department is fairly well sup- 
plied with working material. The number of volumes in the geological library, 
including Professor Branner’s large private library, is 6,450. The value of the 
instruments, maps, etc., is $1,654. No estimate is made on the mineral and rock 
collections, part of which is a Ioan collection. 
The department of geology at present has part of one of the stone buildings sur- 
rounding the inner quadrangle. A large museum of natural history is under con- 
templation, as are also additions to the faculty. 
Three regular courses of work are offered to undergraduates by Professor Branner 
in (1) dynamic and structural geology, (2) economic geology, (3) topographic geol- 
ogy, and three by Professor Smith in (1) paleontology, (2) mineralogy, (3) petro- 
graphy. Advanced work by both graduates and undergraduates is pursued in the 
field and laboratory, under the direction or guidance of one of the professors. 
Professor Branner’s wide experience on different geological surveys enables him to 
make the work practical from the start, and his students gain not only a theoretical 
but a working knowledge of geology. 
In 1893-94 there were 12 students electing geology as their major subject, of which 
5 were graduate students, while a much larger number pursued geology as a minor. 
COLORADO. 
In Colorado geology is taught in 6 colleges, and graduate instruction is offered in 
1 of them—Colorado College. 
State School of Mines, at Golden, is one of the best equipped colleges in the State 
for instruction in geology. The subject was first taught in 1874 by Arthur Lakes, 
and is now {1893-94) taught by Horace B. Patton. The mineral and rock collections 
are valued at $8,000 and consist of 12,000 specimens, as follows: Rocks, 2,000; min- 
erals, 6,000; economic products, 2,000; fossils, 2,000. The instruments, maps, etc., 
are estimated at $1,200, and there are 175 volumes in the library. 
Geology is required in the regular course in mining and metallurgical engineering 
and is elective in the other courses, but is elected by all entitled to do so. One year, 
three terms, is given to geology, including dynamical, structural, historical, and 
economic geology. The work is conducted by text-book, supplemented by lectures 
and field excursions. The same length of time, one year, is given to mineralogy, 
including crystallography, blowpiping, and determinative mineralogy. The college 
is admirably situated for field work in geology, Golden being in the foothills of the 
Rocky Mountains, 15 miles west of Denver. 
Colorado College and Cutler Academy, at Colorado Springs, offers seven different 
courses in geology, mineralogy, and paleontology: (1) A course in general geology, 
including dynamical, structural, and historical geology, based on Le Conte’s Ele- 
ments of Geology; (2) mineralogy, both physical and chemical, one year, Dana’s 
Mineralogy and Petrography; (3) lithology, half a year, Rosenbusch’s Microscopical 
Physiography of Rock-Making Minerals, preparation of sections and determination 
of rocks; (4) seonomic geology, half a year, Tarr’s Economic Geology; (5) inverte- 
brate paleontology, one year; (6) vertebrate paleontology, one year; (7) geological 
surveying, one year. IF, W. Cragin 1s prefessor of geology, mineralogy, and paleon- 
tology, and Joseph K. Surls is instructor in mineralogy and geology. 
University of Denver, at Denver, offers three terms’ work in geology and one in 
mineralogy. The subject was first taught in 1880 by Sidney H. Short, and at present 
(1893-94) by William C. Strong, professor ef natural sciences, who also teaches 
chemistry. The mineral specimens in the collection number 2,000, and rocks 300. 
| University of Colorado, at Boulder, offers no course in geology at present. It has a 
collection of 1,300 specimens of native and foreign rocks, a microscope, and about 500 
thin sections of rocks, along with a small collection of fossils.
-P-A-G-E-871
GEOLOGY IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. 823 
State Agricultural College, at Fort Collins, offers two terms, twenty-six weeks, in 
geology, work based on Dana’s New Text-Book of Geology. Lectures in economic 
geology are also given. Instruction in geology was first given in 1879 by Charles I, 
Davis, and at present by William P. Headden, professor of chemistry and geology. 
Geology was taught for two terms at the College of the Sacred Heart, Denver, in 
1889-90, but has since been discontinued. 
CONNECTICUT. 
Yale University, New Haven.'—Faculty: H. S. Williams, George J. Brush, A. E. Ver- 
rill, E. 8. Dana, 8. L. Penfield, Charles E. Beecher, L. V. Pirsson, and O. P. Marsh. 
Geology appears to have been first taught in Yale in 1802. In that year Prof. Ben- 
jamin Silliman was appointed professor of chemistry, mineralogy, and geology. It 
is not possible to state whether geology was taught before that date or not, as the 
catalogues prior to 1822 do not contain the course of study. From 1822 to 1847 the 
catalogues simply state that a course of lectures was given to the seniors on chemis- 
try, mineralogy, and geology. In the catalogue for 1847-48 it is stated that one term _ 
is given to each of the three sciences, It appears that five lectures were given a 
week. Professor Silliman was made professor emeritus in 1853, but he continued to 
give the instruction in geology down to 1855. 
He was succeeded by Prof. James D. Dana, who graduated at Yale in 1833. From 
1836 to 1838 he was assistant in chemistry to Professor Silliman. In 1838 he sailed as 
geologist and mineralogist on the Wilkes Exploring Expedition. After an absence 
of nearly four years he returned home, and during the thirteen following years he 
was engaged chiefly in preparing a report on the material collected. In addition to 
the geological and mineralogical collections he was also given charge of the zoological 
material. In 1850 he was appointed Silliman professor of natural history in Yale, 
but did not begin the duties of the chair until 1855. In 1864 the name of his chair 
was changed to that of geology and mineralogy. In 1894 he was made professor 
emeritus.” 
Great credit must be given Professor Dana in the building up of the departments 
of geology and mineralogy at Yale. His works on mineralogy early gave the insti- 
tution a leading position in the development of that science. The work has since 
been continued with great success by his successors, Professors Brush, E. 8. Dana, 
and Penfield. Similarly his Manual of Geology, the first edition of which appeared 
in 1863, attracted to its author and the institution the attention of the entire 
scientific world. 
The collections in the Peabody Museum are among the very best in the country. 
This is especially true of the vertebrate fossils and minerals. The collection of ver- 
tebrates is by far the best in America, though, because of the lack of space, only a 
small portion of the collection is now in the museum. Because of the totally inade- 
quate capacity of the museum many of the fossils (vertebrate and invertebrate) and 
minerals are stored away in boxes. Under such conditions it is impossible to make 
even an approximation as to the number of specimens in the collections. Likewise 
in a museum possessing so many rare specimens, many of which are the only known 
ones in existence, it is impossible to assign a commercial value to the collections. 
As would be expected in an institution of Yale’s age and standing, the department 
of geology is well equipped with maps, models, and all instruments needed for 
research work. The library of the nniversity contains about 1,600 volumes given 
entirely to the subjects of geology, paleontology, and petrology. This number, 
however, does not include such serials as the American Journal of Science, etc., 
which are given only in part to the above-named sciences. Counting such serials, 
the number of volumes would probably be double that above given. In addition 
to these, several of the professors have large private libraries, to which graduate 
students have access.

original investigation, 
Courses 4, 5, 6, 7,and 8 are under-graduate courses, but are open to graduates. 
The others are open only to graduates. 
Outside of Yale University, the chief educational center for Connecticut, geology 
is taught at three other institutions. 
At Wesleyan University, Middletown, Conn., several different courses in geology are 
given by Rev. William North Rice, professor of geology. (1) A course in elementary 
geology with LeConte’s Compend of Geology, supplemented by lectures; (2) a course 
in advanced geology based on LeConte’s Elements of Geology; (3) @ course in 
physical geography (Geikie’s Elementary Lessons); (4) mineralogy. 
The department is well equipped with material, having collections in mineralogy, 
lithology, physical geology, and paleontology. The mincrals and rocks number 
11,500 specimens, which include 300 species of minerals and many more varieties. 
There are 4,000 Paleozoic fossils, 800 Mesozoic, and 2,000 Cenozoic. The depart- 
ment of zoology has 100,000 specimens of invertebrate forms and several thousand 
vertebrate forms. 
Geology has been taught in Trinity College, Hartford, since 1826, being first taught 
by Prof. Frederick Hall. W.H.C. Pynchon, instructor in natural science, gives a 
short course of lectures in geology and mineralogy at present (1894). 
At Storrs Agricultural College, Storrs, B. F. Koons, the president of the college, 
teaches geology for one term, using Shaler’s Text-Book of Geology. 
DELAWARE. 
The State College for Colored Students, Dover, founded in 1891, offers one term in 
geology and one term in minervlogy. 
Delaware College, Newark, offers two terms in geology, which is taught by T. R. 
Wolf, professor of geology, who also teaches chemistry and mineralogy. The subject 
was first taught there in 1871 by the present instructor. 
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. 
Geology is taught at 4 institutions in the District of Columbia, in one of which, 
Columbian University, graduate instruction is offered. 
No reply was received from Columbian University. In the catalogue for 1892-93, 
three courses are offered in mineralogy, one in petrography, and five in geology, 
taught by W.S. Yeates and G. V. Chandler. Mr. Yeates has since resigned. Graduate

instruction is offered by Prof.G.P. Merrill, one of the curators of the Smithsonian 
Institution. In the general geology, courses are offered in physical geography, 
structural, dynamical, and historical geology, paleontology, and paleobotany; 
LeConte’s Elements of Geology as a text-book and Dana’s Manual of Geology and 
Merrill’s Stones for Building and Decoration as reference books. In the graduate 
work, use is made of the large collections in the Smithsonian Institution, In 1893-94 
two graduate students took geology as a minor, while there were none pursuing it 
as @ major. 
Geology is taught in Howard University for one term in the senior year by Richard 
Foster, professor of natural history, who also teaches mineralogy, zoology, botany, 
* and physiology. The subject was first tanght in 1874 by J. R. Golding. The subject 
is clective for classical students, and in 1893-94 it was elected by all those eligible, 12 
students taking the course. The university also gives a course in geology in univer- 
sity extension work; 57 teachers in the Washington public schoo}s took the course 
in 1893-94. The number of specimens in the museum is estimated at about 5,000; 
the students have access to the large collections in the National Museum. 
Geology 1s taught for one term each in Georgetown College and Gallaudet College. 
FLORIDA. 
Geology is taught for two terms cach in Rollins College, Winter Park, and Florida 
Conference College, Leesburg. Both are small colleges, and in neither is the subject 
developed to any extent. The subject is taught for one term at the John B. Stetson 
University, Deland, Fla, : 
GEORGIA. 
Geology is taught in 8 institutions in Georgia at present, and one other, the 
Georgia School of Technology, contemplates a course in geology. In no college in 
the State does it form a separate department or form a prominent feature in the 
eurriculum. In only one, Methodist Episcopal College, at Birmingham, is it taught a 
full year. Bowdon College and Young Harris College each offer two terms; Emory 
College, Atlanta University, and Clark University, onc term cach. The University 
of Georgia in its catalogue offers somewhat extended courses in geology, mineralogy, 
and lithology, but the chair of geology is temporarily vacant, and the subject is 
taught for one term by the professor of chemistry.   
IDAHO. 
Geology is taught for one term in the University of Idaho, at Moscow, by Prof. 
C. P. Fox, professor of agriculture. The aim is to unite this subject with mining 
and metallurgy in the future. 
ILLINOIS. 
Illinois has 20 colleges in which geology is taught, in 3 of which it is a separate 
department, offering several courses and graduate instruction, but in 1893-94 there 
wero graduate students in geology at only 1 of these institutions—the University 
of Chicago.

  826 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
The department of geology is at present in Walker Museum, which, like the other 
college buildings, is of the famous Bedford liméstone, and is valued at $100,000, A 
separate building is contemplated for geological laboratories and lecture rooms. 
The first floor of Walker Museum is devoted strictly to museum purposes. There 
are three large cases of economic products, three of minerals, four of fossils, and 
two of archwological specimens. There are, besides, numerous plaster models, large 
fossils, and casts. The second floor consists of lecture room, library, laboratory, 
and offices of the faculty. The third floor is devoted to botany, anthropology, and 
vertebrate paleontology. The basement is used for storerooms and laboratory. Tho 
library contains 2,500 volumes and 2,500 pamphlets. The instruments, maps, etc., 
are valued at $3,000, and the mineral, fossil, and rock collections at $9,000, and esti- - 
mated to embrace between 200,000 and 300,000 specimens. Additions are constantly 
being made to the library and collections, $10,000 being spent for that purpose 
during the present year (1895). Among the special collections of note are (1) the 
Dr. Washburn collection, rich in Niagara fossils; (2) the Dr. James collection, rich 
in Cincinnati types; (3) the large series of ores and other economic products from 
the World’s Fair and the Field Museum, and (4) numerous series of igneous, sedimen- 
tary, and metamorphic rocks from western United States and Europe. 
Geology is one of the departments that began with the opening of the university 
in 1892, and, although so recently established, so liberal have been the appropria- 
tions that it stands among the foremost colleges in its facilities for giving instruc- 
tion in geology. Twenty-nine courses, varying in length from one term to one or 
more years, are offered in the catalogue, not all of which, however, are open during 
any one quarter. 
Professor Chamberlin offers one course in geologic life development and another 
in principles and working methods of geology. The first continues one quarter and 
constitutes historical geology studied on the biotic side. The second continues two 
quarters and varies from time to time; it includes the investigation of such prob- 
lems as mountain and plateau building, oceanic basins, the tides, the age of the 
earth, condition of the earth’s intorior, vuleanism, etc. 
Professor Salisbury gives courses in (1) physiography; (2) structural geology and 
continental evolution; (3) geographic geology, and (4) general geology. He also 
offers laboratory work in geographic and in dynamic geology. During the last 
term (six weeks) of the summer quarter he conducts a class in the field. The 
course in physiography given by Professor Salisbury in the autumn quarter is 
repeated by one of the fellows during the winter quarter. 
Professor Iddings offers courses in crystallography, mineralogy, petrography, and 
petrology. Mineralogy is studied with especial reference to the optical and physical 
properties as introductory to petrography. Courses of lectures are given on the 
classification, genesis, origin, etc., of rocks, accompanied by laboratory study of 
microscopic sections of classified series of rocks. The subject can be pursued as 
long as the student desires. 
Professor Penrose, during the winter quarter, gives a course of lectures on 
economic geology in which especial stress is laid on the ore deposits, but the non- 
metallic products, such as coal, natural gas, clays, soils, fertilizers, etc., are discussed. 
He offers another course on the chemistry of the ore deposits’ which has not yet 
been given. 
Professor Van Hise gives a course of lectures accompanied by laboratory work on 
pre-Cambrian geology during the first term (six weeks) of the winter quarter each 
alternate year. He discusses the nature, character, and distribution of the pre- 
Cambrian rocks and the special methods of field work. 
Dr. Quereau gives a course in invertebrate paleontology continuing through the 
year. He resigned the spring quarter of 1895. 
W. H. Holmes is announced for a short course, one hour per week for six weeks, 
in graphic geology, and 0. C. Farrington of The Field Columbian Museum is

  GEOLOGY IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. 827 
announced to give a short course in determinative mineralogy beginning in 1895 or 
1896. 
There were 13 graduate students in geology present during one or more quarters 
in 1893-94. 
The Journal of Geology is published semiquarterly by the department, volume 1 
beginning in 1893. 
Northwestern University, Evanston, Tll.—Geology was first taught at the North- 
western University in 1862 by Oliver Marcy, the present professor of geology. A.R. 
Crook, professor of mineralogy and petrology, began his work here in 1893. At 
present geology is taught only in the college of liberal arts, A school of technology 
-is contemplated in which economic geology will be taught. In 1893-94 30 per cent 
of the students elected geology. The estimated value of the instruments, maps, 
ete., is $2,000; of the mineral and rock collections, $6,000. There are 6,000 mineral 
and rock specimens, 3,000 fossils, and 300 volumes in the geological library. Besides 
the classified mineral and rock collections there is a large quantity of material from 
the World’s Fair not yet arranged. : 
General geology is tanght one year by Professor Marcy, including dynamical and 
structural geology, geography, and historical geology, with construction of maps 
and sections, and laboratory work in paleontology. This is followed by elective 
work in geology of special localities or special problems in geology. Professor 
Crook gives courses of lectures, accompanied by laboratory work, on systematic 
paleontology, mineralogy, petrology, and economic geology. There are five courses 
with three terms in each course, making fifteen terms in all. Instruction is largely 
given by lectures and laboratory work, Le Conte’s Elements of Geology being used in 
general geology and Dana’s Manual of Mineralogy and Petrography in mineralogy. 
In 1893-94 there were 7 students taking geology as a major study and 66 taking it 
asaminor. There were no graduate students in geology. 
University of IUinois, Urbana, Ill.—Charles W. Rolfe, professor of geology, J. G. 
Meiner, assistant in mineralogy and geology. .Geology was first taught in the Uni- 
versity of Illinois in 1870 by Prof. D. C. Taft. At present there are three courses 
offered in geology and two in mineralogy. (1) A major course in geology, including 
dynamical, petrographical, and historical geology, paleontology, and economic geol- 
ogy (580 hours). Instruction is largely by lectures, with the following reference 
books: Geikie’s text-book in general geology, Nicholson, Zittel, and Miller in paleon- 
tology, and a blue-print adaptation of Rosenbusch in petrography. Asupplementary 
course in individual investigation follows the major course. Two shorter courses 
are offered, one (110 hours) adapted to engineers and one (110 hours) in general 
geology to students not specializing in geology. About 6 per cent of the students 
elected geology in 1893-94. There are no graduate students. 
The department of geology occupies the same building with botany and zoology, 
the building and furniture being valued at $100,000. The instruments, maps, ete., 
are estimated at $1,500; the mineral and rock collections number 5,000 specimens, 
valued at 000; 50,000 fossils, valued at $25,000. There are 900 volumes in the 
geological library exclusive of periodicals. ‘The apparatus and collections are receiy- 
ing many additions. 
Austin College, Efingham, Ill., offers courses in geology extending over one, two, 
four, or eight terms. The subject was first taught in 1892 by W. J. Brinckley, pro- 
fessor of sciences, who is still there and teaches in addition zoology, botany, chem- 
istry, and physics. In 1893-94 95 per cent of the students eligible elected geology. 
The collections are valued at $1,250 and there are 100 volumes in the library. 
Illinois Wesleyan University, Bloomington, IUl., offers two terms in geclogy and 
mineralogy, taught by R. O. Graham, professor of chemistry. Geology is elective 
and 89 per cent of eligible students elected it in 1893-94. It will be interesting to 
many to know that geology was first taught in Illinois Wesleyan in 1865 by Maj. 
J. W. Powell, late director of the United States Geological Survey.

  828 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
At Greer College, Hoopeston, Ill., geology will be taught first in 1895 by the presi- 
dent, S. W. Dixon. 
At Lake Forest University, Lake Forest, 1Ul., geology is taught for one year by Robert 
A. Harper, professor of botany, who has been teaching it since 1891. A separate 
department is contemplated in the future. 
At Augustana College geology was first taught in 1879 by Dr. Joshua Lindahl, 
recently State geologist. It is now taught for two terms by J. A. Udden, professor 
of geology «nd natural history, who teaches in addition zoology, botany, physiology, 
and physical geography. 
Cen cee INDIANA. 
Geology is taught regularly in 13 colleges in Indiana, but forms a separate depart- 
ment in only 1—the State University—and in only 1 is graduate instruction offered. 
Indiana University, Bloomington, Ind.—V. ¥'. Marsters, professor; J. F. Newsom, 
assistant. Geology was first taught in Indiana University in 1854 by Robert Milli- 
gan, professor of natural sciences and chemistry. The work consisted of lectures 
and recitations for one term, Hitchcock’s Geology being the text-book used. Sub- 
sequent instructors were Profs. Theophilus A. Wylie, Richard Owen, David Starr 
Jordan, J.C. Branner, V. F. Marsters, and Instructors C. E. Siebenthal, E. M. Kindle, 
and J. F. Newsom. 
‘The department of geology was first separated from that of natural sciences in 
1886, with J. C. Branner as professor of geology. Professor Branner was absent 
on leave from 1888 to 1891, inclusive, and in 1892 Vernon F. Marsters was elected 
professor of geology. 
In 1864 Prof. Richard Owen brought to the university his fine collection of minerals 
and fossils, accumulated when he was State geologist, along with the instruments, 
charts, ete., of the survey. Later, in 1870, the large collection of David Dale Owen, 
comprising 85,000 specimens, was purchased. Ward’s collection of casts was added 
by purchase in 1874. A unique feature of instruction in 1864 was one room fitted up 
especially to facilitate an intimate acquaintance with the geology of Indiana, by 
exhibiting the various rocks of the State in their correct relative position on a large 
table, which allows about a foot and a half square to each county. In 1883 fire 
destroyed nearly all the geological collection. 
At present the department is supplied with about 225 varieties of minerals, 250 
erystal models, several thousand paleontological specimens, two petrographical 
microscopes, and sets of thin sections of minerals and rocks. 
The following courses are now offered: (1) Principles of geology—dynamical, struc- 
tural, and historical—lectures, and laboratory work; (2) mineralogy, lectures, and 
laboratory work; (3) lithology; (4) petrography; (5) economic geology; (6) paleon- 
tology; (7) field work in geology. 
Franklin College, Franklin, Ind., gives one term to geology, which is taught by 
D. A. Owen, professor of biology. The subject was first taught in 1845 by J. B. Lisdale. 
The cabinet has a collection of 35,000 specimens, valued at $9,157, which is largely 
the gift of 8. S. Gorby, State geologist. 
De Paww University, Greencastle, Ind., has no regular instruction in geology. Ocea- 
sionally some other department gives a course of one term in the subject. 
Hanover College, Hanover, Ind., is probably where geology was first taught in 
Indiana. It was taught by John H. Hamby in 1836. At present it is taught for one 
term by Glenn Culbertson, professor of physics and astronomy. ‘The cabinet is said 
to contain many thousand specimens, but no definite number or value is given. 
Purdue University, Lafayette, Ind., has one term (nineteen weeks) in geology, taught 
by Stanley Coulter, professor of biology. The collections, containing about 20,000 
specimens, are valued at $3,000. 
Rose Polytechnic Institute, Terre Haute, Ind., offers no regular course in geology, 
but every two years a course of twelve lectures is given to the junior and senior classes 
by some eminent geologist. Courses have been given by Professors Winchell, 
Branner, Orton, and Claypole.

GEOLOGY IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. 829 
Butler Cniversity, Irvington, Tad., offers one year in geology and mineralogy, begin- 
ning with crystallography followed by mincralogy, lithology, dynamical, structural, 
and historical geology, tanght by Henry L. Bruner, professor of biology and geology. 
Tho subject was first taught in 1859 by Ryland T. Brown. The present value of the 
equipment is estimated at $300 and the number of volumes in the geological library 
at 400. 
At Wabash College, Crawfordsville, Ind., geology was first taught in 1845 by E. O. 
Hovey, professor of chemistry and geology. Instruction in geology is combined 
with zoology, two years being given to geology. Tho chair is vacant at present. 
The college has a good illustrative collection of minerals, particularly rich in ores 
and rarer minerals. There are large collections of fossils especially rich in Devonian 
corals and Subcarboniferous crinoids. 
INDIAN TERRITORY. 
Geology and mineralogy are taught for one term at Indian University, Bacone, 
Ind. 7., by C. H. Maxson, professor of mathematical sciences and economics. 
JOWA. 
Geology is taught in 17 institutions in Iowa, in none of which it forms a separate 
department. However, it is practically a separate department at. the State uni- 
versity, although animal morphology and physiology is combined with it in name. 
A separate instructor takes charge of these branches, so that Prof. Samuel Calvin, 
who is also State geologist, gives his whole time to geology. The subject was first 
taught, in 1864, by T. S. Parvin, of the State University. 
The museums are well stocked; it is estimated that there are 30,000 specimens, 
valued at $10,000, collected chiefly by the State geological survey. The Calvin col- 
lection of American and European fossils includes more than 6,000 specimens. There 
is also an extensive collection of vertebrate forms, including the famous Hornaday 
collection. There are about 10,000 specimens of birds and a great many mammals. 
There are four courses in geology at present, extending over two years, which 
include a course in general geology, covering lithology, dynamical and historical 
geology, and. geology and paleontology of the Northwest, and selected courses in 
geology and paleontology for special students. It is expected to soon make geology 
a separate chair, with one or more additional instructors. Graduate instruction is 
given in geology leading to the master’s degree. 
At Cornell College, Mount Vernon, geology was first taught, in 1857, by 8. N. Fellows. 
It is now taught for two terms by William H. Norton, professor of geology. One course 
is given in physical geology, with special attention to rivers and Pleistocene geology. 
The second course contains physical geology, with a short course in determination of 
ores and rock-making minerals by blowpipe analysis and microscopical petrography; 
also an outline of historical geology. Geology is elective, and in 1893-94, 66 per cent 
of the seniors and 47 per cent of the juniors elected it. The college has good illus- 
trative collections, containing in all more than 11,000 specimens. 
In Wartburg Teachers’ Seminary, Waverly, geology and mineralogy are taught for 
three terms by Prof. Fred Lutz, president. Jartburg College, recently removed from 
Waverly to Clinton, had a courso of three terms in geology, taught by Professor Lutz 
from 1886 until the removal of the college in 1894. 
At Iowa College, Grinnell, Iowa, geology and biology are in one department, with 
H. W. Norris professor and A. J. Jones instructor. Mr. Jones has charge of the 
geology, which is taught for one semester. It is expected soon to enlarge the course 
to two years in length. The subject was first taught, in 1853, by D. S. Sheldon. 
In Drake University, Des Moines, Iowa, geology is taught for one year by L. 8. Ross, 
professor of biology and chemistry. Tho course includes (1) crystallography, min- 
eralogy, and lithology; (2) physiography and dynamical geology; (3) historical 
geology and paleontology.

KANSAS, 
In Kansas geology is taught in 16 colleges, but in only 1, the University of Kansas, 
Lawrence, has it been made a separate department or is it taught more than one year. 
No reply was received from several of the colleges, and only such data are given as 
could be obtained from the catalogues. No record is at hand concerning Lane Uni- 
versity, Lecompton, or Ottawa University. 
University of Kansas, Lawrence, is well equipped for giving instruction in geology. 
There are courses in (1) physical geology, (2) historical geology, (3) elements of 
mineralogy, (4) systematic mineralogy, (5) elementary petrography, (6) economic 
geology, (7) systematic paleontology, and graduate courses in (8) advanced miner- 
alogy, (9) advanced petrography, (10) dynamic geology, (11) special work in pale- 
ontology, (12) field work in geology, mineralogy, and petrography. 
The geological and mineralogical cabinets are said to contain about 100,000 speci- 
mens, chiefly from Kansas and the Rocky Mountains. Large collections are also 
available in zoology—50,000 or more specimens. Prof. Samuel W. Williston teaches 
historical geology and paleontology. Erasmus Haworth has charge of mineralogy, 
petrography, physical geology, and economic geology. 
In Baker University, Baldwin, Kans., geology is taught for two terms and mineralogy 
for one, Le Conte’s text-book being used. The museum is said to contain 25,000 
specimens, of which 10,000 are classed as geological and 3,600 as mineralogical. 
Washburn College, Topeka, Kans., offers two years in geology, a half year on 
Le Conte’s Elements, a half year on historical geology and economic geology. Pale- 
ontology may be taken for one-year or a half year. Such is the course under Prof. 
Charles S. Prosser, who resigned in 1894 to go to Union College, New York. The 
chair is vacant now (1894-95),1 
KENTUCKY. 
In Kentucky geology is taught in 9 institutions, but forms a separate department 
in none, and in very few is it taught more than one term, At Central University, 
Richmond, geology is taught by R. M. Parks, professor of chemistry and geology, for 
two terms, mineralogy for one term, and physical geography for one term. In Center 
College of Kentucky, Danville, it is taught for five months; at Ogden College, Bowling 
Green, it is taught for two terms, and one term each at (1) Georgetown College, 
Georgetown; (2) Kentucky University, Lexington; (3) Bethel College, Russellville; (4) St. 
Mary’s College, St. Marys. 
LOUISIANA, 
Geology is taught in 9 institutions in Louisiana, but in only 1, the Louisiana 
State University, is it given much prominence. The catalogue of Louisiana State 
University, Baton Rouge, offers 6 courses in geology and 2 in mineralogy. These 
are classed as (1) meteorology, (2) physical geography, (3) elementary geology, 
(4) economic geology, (5) general critical geology, (6) petrography, (7) general 
determinative mineralogy, (8) optical crystallography. Courses 5 and 6 may be 
taken as graduate work. The subject is taught (1893-94) by W. W. Clendenin, 
professor of geology, mineralogy, and botany, formerly at the University of the State 
of Missouri, and recently appointed State geologist. The mineral collections are 
said to contain more than 5,000 specimens, exclusive of the large collection of ores 
obtained from the New Orleans Exposition, and an almost equally large collection of 
fossils. 
The catalogue of Tulane University, New Orleans, offers a course in the principles 
of geology, one in mineralogy and crystallography, one in paleontology, and one in 
practical and economic geology. A communication from the president states that 
  
    
1$ince the above went to press, G. P. Grimsley, recently Ph. D, from Johns Hopkins University, 
has been appointed.

uo students were pursuing the study of geology in 1893-94, and that it has been 
excluded from many of the courses, but it is hoped soon to have the subject tanght 
more thoroughly in the graduate school. 
Geology is taught for two terms at New Orleans University, New Orleans, by the 
president, L. G. Adkinson. It is taught for one term each in Leland University, New 
Orleans, and Keatchie Male and Female College, Keatchie, 
MAINE. 
Geology is taught in 4 institutions in Maine, but in only 1, Colby University, is ita 
separate department, or is it tanght more than one term. 
The department of geology and mineralogy at Colby University has been. well devel- 
oped by William S. Bayley, professor of mineralogy and geology, who is widely known 
among students of mineralogy and petrography. The catalogue for 1892-93 offers two 
terms in mineralogy, one in physical geology, one in inorganic geology, and one in 
organic geology. 
Tho laboratory is well supplied with instruments and materials for the study of 
mineralogy and petrography. The mineral collection contains more than 3,000 speci- 
mens. The State geological collection is af the university.!. There are several hun- 
dred thin sections, photographs, lantern slides, ete. The department occupies the 
second floor in Coburn Hall (valued at $40,000), the ground floor of which is occupied 
by the chemical department. 
Geology is taught for one term each in Bowdoin College, Brunswick; Bates College, 
Lewiston; and Maine State College, Orono. In Bowdoin College mineralogy is taught 
by the professor of chemistry, and geology by the professor of biology. It is hoped 
soon to establish a chair of geology and mineralogy, ~ 
MARYLAND. 
Geology is taught in 8 colleges in Maryland, but in only 1, Johns Hopkins, does it 
form a separate department. 
Johns Hopkins University has since 1883 been one of the leading universities in 
this country for graduate instruction in geology, particularly in petrography. The 
subject was first tanght in 1883 by Dr. G. H. Williams, who from that time until his 
death, in 1894, attracted students in geology from all parts of the country, and sent 
them out enthusiastic teachers of the subject. Instruction in geology is at present 
(1895) under the guidance of William B. Clark, professor of organic geology, assisted 
ward B. Mathews, instructor in mineralogy and petrography. Courses of lec- 
re given by G. K. Gilbert and Bailey Willis, of the United States Geological 
Survey, and Archibald Geikie, Director-General of the Geological Survey of Great 
Britain. 
Courses are offered to both graduate and undergraduate students, but the work is 
almost entirely with graduates. During 1893-94 there were 12 graduate students 
taking geology as a major and 6 taking it as a minor. 
The following courses are announced for 1894-95: (1) general geology, by Profes- 
sor Clark and Dr. Mathews, lectures and field excursions; (2) paleontology, by 
Professor Clark; (3) historical geology, by Professor Clark; (4) mineralogy, by Dr. 
Mathews; (5) petrography, by Dr. Mathews—divided into two parts, (a) rock-form- 
ing minerals, (b) rock clas tion givenin alternate years; (6)physiographic geol- 
ogy, by Mr. Gilbert, a course of-ten lectures on the origin of the forms of the earth’s 
surface; (7) stratigraphic and structural geology, by Mr. Willis, a sequel to course 
6,a discussion of the processes which result in the formation and upheaval of 
sedimentary rocks. 
Laboratory work is arranged to accompany the lecture courses. Facilities for field 
work are ¢ tionally good, owing to the great variety of geolog formations 
              
1A catalogue of the Maino geological collection, with a brief outline history of the two surveys of 
the State, has been recently (1890) published by Professor Bayley and Mr. F, P. King.

represented in a small area. Several specified areas have been investigated by stu- 
dents and the results embodied in theses for the doctor’s degree. 
Another feature of the work is the biweekly conference in which recent investiga- 
tions are reviewed by the students under the guidance of the instructors. Each 
advanced student also delivers a class-room lecture upon some special assigned topic. 
The geological laboratory is situated in Hopkins Hall and comprises 19 rooms on 
the second and third floors. The main room on the third floor contains the collee- 
tions and library of the late Prof. G.H. Williams. A smaller room on the same floor 
contains the books and collections of the late Prof. H. Carvill Lewis. Besides these 
two special libraries there is the regular department library and the Peabody Library 
in the city, and the valuable libraries in Washington may be consulted. The collee- 
tiens are especially rich in crystalline rocks and in Cretaceous and Tertiary fossils. 
Some of the most important collections are (1) the private collection of Professor 
Williams, (2) Kranz collection of European fossils, (3) Hill collection of Texas rocks 
and fossils, (4) Allen collection of minerals, (5) Stiirtz collection of European rocks, 
(6) Lehman collection of Saxon rocks, (7) Lewis collection of rocks and their sec- 
tions, (8) private collection of Professor Clark. The laboratories are well equipped 
in apparatus. 
Many valuable maps and papers on the local geology have been published by the 
university, by the United States Geological Survey, and in the scientific journals, by 
and under the direction of the department. 
In a number of Maryland colleges geology is not taught at all, as (1) Washington 
College, Chestertown; (2) St. Johns College, Annapolis; (3) United States Naval Academy, 
Annapolis; and (4) St. Charles College, Ellicott City. 
MASSACHUSETTS. 
In Massachusetts geology is taught in 11 colleges and universities, in most of 
which (8) it forms a separate department and occupies a prominent place in the 
eurriculum. 
_ Geology in Harvard University, Cambridge.\—The study of geology was introduced 
at Harvard in 1848 by Louis Agassiz, the instruction being practically limited to 
historical geology and glacialogy. Teaching in the subject was considerably 
expanded during the time of the Hooper Mining School, 1865-1875, there being sev- 
eral teachers of the different branches of geology. With the decline of that school, 
the dean, Prof. J. D. Whitney, alone remained at Harvard, his professorship being 
established upon the funds of the school. N.S. Shaler became associated with the 
college in 1864 as assistant in zoology; later he became instructor in paleontology, 
and in 1869 professor of paleontology. The title has since been changed to professor 
of geology. W.M. Davis, assistant in geology in 1876, instructor in 1878, assistant 
professor of physical geography in 1885, and professor in 1890, has devoted particu- 
lar attention to physical geography. The division of petrography was instituted 
under J. E. Wolff as instructor in petrology in 1886, and assistant professor in 1892. 
Mineralogy, now taught by Assistant Professor Wolff, has always been a division of 
the chemical department at Harvard. 
Instruction.—The geological faculty in 1894, and the courses of instruction offered, 
are as follows: Josiah D.Whitney, Sturgis-Hooper professor of geology—economical 
geology,’ and half courses on mineral veins and metalliferous deposits, geographical 
methods and results. Nathaniel S. Shaler, professor of geology—lectures in ele- 
mentary geology, lectures in paleontology, lectures in historical geology; also 
director of research work in geology and paleontology. William Morris Davis, 
professor of physical geography—half courses physical geography, meteorology, 
physical geography of the United States, physical geography of Europe; courses in 
1 Contributed by Leon S. Griswold, instructor in geology at Harvard. 
2Courses, unless otherwise specified, are full courses; that is, they require about nine hours per 
week of a student’s time throughout the college year. Half courses require about half.as much time.

research in physical geography and meteorology. J. Eliot Wolff, assistant professor 
of petrography—mineralogy, petrography, crystallography, and the physics of crys- 
tals, petrographical research; half course on geology and mineralogy of building 
stones. Robert T. Jackson, instructor in paleontology—laboratory work and lec- 
tures, in conjunction with Professor Shaler, in two courses, paleontology and histori- 
cal geology. Henry L. Smyth, instructor in geological surveying—half courses in 
mining geology, geological surveying, and pre-Cambrian geology of North America. 
J. B. Woodworth, instructor in geology—general critical geology, half course in 
glacial geology. Robert De Courcey Ward, assistant in meteorology—elementary 
meteorology, with Professor Davis. Richard Elwood Dodge, instructor in geology— 
laboratory work and lectures in elementary geology. Leon S. Griswold, instructor 
in geology—advanced geological field work, in cooperation with Professors Shaler 
and Davis and Assistant Professor Wolff; elementary physical geography, with Pro- 
fessor Davis. Charles Livy Whittle, assistant in mineralogy and petrography— 
laboratory work in mineralogy and petrography, with Assistant Professor Wolff. 
R. A. Daly, assistant in geology—laboratory work in elementary geology. C. R. 
Eastman, assistant in paleontology—laboratory work in paleontology and historical 
geology. 
Besides the regular courses of the college year noted aboye, there are summer- 
school courses in geology, physical geography, and petrography also given by some 
of the above teachers with others not mentioned. In 1894 the additional instructors 
were G. E. Ladd, Prof. A. P. Brigham, of Colgate University, and Mr. H. B. Kiimmel, 
fellow at the University of Chicago. 
The geological courses are carefully correlated to form a broad systematic course of 
study. Thus the elementary courses—geology, physical geography, meteorology, 
and mineralogy—lead to general critical geology, physical geography of the United 
States and Europe, petrography, paleontology, mining geology, and geological sur- 
veying, and the second summer-school course in field geology. The student is then 
prepared to take courses in historical geology, glacial geology, economical geology, 
pre-Cambrian geology of North America, geology and mineralogy of building stones, 
mineral veins, and metalliferous deposits, geographical methods and results, or begin 
original investigation in geology, paleontology, physical geography, meteorology, or 
petrography. The research work in any line may be followed with profit for more 
than one year, as is commonly the custom with graduate students. The results of 
original work, reviews of books and articles, and items of geologic interest are pre- 
sented weekly by advanced students and instructors at an informal meeting called 
the geological conference. 
For 1894-95 eight students in the university, who are preeminently geological stu- 
dents, have been assigned scholarships, but besides these many scholarship students 
take more or less geology as part of their work. Eleven graduate students in 1893-94, 
and again in 1894-95, have taken geology. 
The special equipment of the geological department is as follows: 
(1) To the division of geology belong about 200 unmounted and 175 mounted maps, 
about 260 models, most of which are in duplicate sets of small size for class use, 
2,400 specimens, 500 lantern slides, and a special library of 125 volumes. 
(2) The paleontological division has about 12,000 specimens arranged in 3,092 lots. 
and catalogued in two collections, one arranged zoologically, the other stratigraph- 
ically, three microscopes with 404 slides, 70 wall diagrams including a set of Zittel’s: 
diagrams, and a special library of 45 volumes besides pamphlets. 
(3) Physical geography and meteorology have 100 wall maps, an unknown number 
of unmounted maps, probably several thousand, 43 models, 500 lantern slides, and a 
library of perhaps 500 volumes, which includes nearly all the journals in meteorology. 
The equipment in petrography consists of 7 microscopes, goniometers, and other 
petrographical apparatus, models, 11,000 specimens, 5,000 thin sections, 150 lantern 
slides, and library of 50 volumes.

ical geology and physical geography, the third term to fielil and laboratory work. 
The aim of the third term’s: work is. to: teach the use-of instruments and methods of 
field work, and students are required to prepare a map or thesis:on- the work. There 
is also. a popular course; in which the elements: of geology are taught in. one term. 
There is one term’s-work inmineralogy,, about half of which is devoted te.crystallog- 
raphy and half to:physical' and chemical properties of minerals. The college is well 
supplied with illustrative material, the collections being valued! at $75,000, and. the 
number ef specimens estimated at 40,060-to 50,000, A new geological building is pro- 
posed in the near future.

GEOLOGY IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. 835 
Geology is taught for two terms and mineralogy for one term at the French-Amer- 
ican College, Springfield. It has been taught since 1892 by Z. W. Kemp. 
In Boston University the geology is taught for one term by Prof. William H. Niles. 
The instruction is given in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with the use 
of the equipments found there. : 
The subject is taught in a desultory way in Boston College by a few lectures at 
irregular times. 
At Tufis College geology and mineralogy have been taught by Prof. John P. Mar- 
shall since 1855, a period of forty years. Mineralogy is taught the first half year, 
and geology, lithology, aud paleontology the second half year. The museum of 
natural history, erected in 1882-83, at a cost of $50,000, has recently had an addi- 
tional wing, costing $25,000. No estimate is given of the valuable geological 
material, which, besides the many thousand dollars’ worth purchased, contains the 
collection of Professor Marshall for the past forty years. 
In Williams College, Williamstown, geology was first taught in 1829 by Chester 
Dewey. It was taught by Ebenezer Emmons in 1833, and has been taught con- 
tinuously since 1829, except a short interval from 1890 to 1892. It was revived in 1893, 
with T. Nelson Dale as instructor. The subject is now taught for two terms, with 
much emphasis laid on the field work. The building for geology is valued at $25,000 
and the collections at $8,000. 
Geology has been taught at Worcester Polytechnic Institute since 1888 by the presi- 
dent, Homer T. Fuller’. Geology is tanght for a half year and mineralogy and 
metallurgy for a half year. 
At Wellesley College geology is taught during the first semester by Prof. William 
HL. Niles, and mineralogy and lithology during the second semester by Miss Sarah 
Y. de Normandie, The first course is divided into three parts. The first part con- 
siders such dynamic agents as streams, glaciers, voleanoes, ete. The second part 
considers stratification, folding, mineral veins, etc. The third part closes with a 
general survey of the physical history of the earth and its past inhabitants as 
revealed in the rocks, Instruction is by means of lectures, text-book, readings, and 
recitations. 
  MICHIGAN. 
Geology is taught in 11 colleges and universities in Michigan. It occupies a prom- 
inent place in the curriculum at the University of Michigan and at the Michigan 
Mining Sehoot. 
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich.—Israel ©. Russell, professor of geology; 
William H. Pettee, professor of mineralogy, economic geology, and mining engineer- 
ing. Geology was first taught in the University of Michigan in 1841 by Douglas 
Houghton, who was appointed professor of chemistry, mineralogy, and geology in 
1839, but there were no students at the university until 1841. The well-known Dr. 
Alex. Winchell was professor of geology for many years. His successor was I. C, 
Russell, the present incumbent. 
The department has accumulated a large quantity of illustrative material during 
its more than fifty years of existence. The number of specimens, estimated at 
100,000, are valued at $30,000, with $1,000 worth of instruments, maps, ete. The 
‘mineralogical collections include the Lederer collection of 2,500 European specimens, 
along with a rich collection of Michigan minerals. In geology there are extensive 
collections made by the State geological surveys, along with others obtained by 
purchase and donation. The White collection contains 6,000 specimens, the Romin- 
5,000 specimens. The well-equipped geological laboratory is located in the 
al history museum along with zoology. 
Professor Russell offers three courses in geology, each continuing through the 
year. One year is given to the elements of geology, one to paleontology, and one in

physical and historical geology. Professor Pettee gives instruction in (1) economic 
geology for one semester, in which particular attention is paid to the geology of 
mines and mineral districts, and to the modes of occurrence and distribution of 
minerals of commercial importance; (2) geology of the United States, one semester; 
(3) mineralogy and lithology, one year. 
Michigan Mining School.—M. E. Wadsworth, professor; A. E. Seaman, instructor. 
Geology was first taught in the Michigan Mining School in 1886 by Albert Williams, 
jr., who remained but one year, since which time it has been under the charge of 
M. E. Wadsworth, director of theschool. Botany and zoology are taught in the same 
department. The following courses of instruction are offered: (1) Paleontology, 32 
hours, elementary course; (2) crystallography, 60 hours, study and determination of 
erystal forms. The laboratory is supplied with 151 glass models, 2,153 wood and 
plaster models, and 1,800 natural crystals; (3) mineralogy, 108 hours; more than 
27,000 specimens are available in this work; (4) petrography, two terms, 6 hours per 
week, divided into microscopic mineralogy, lithology, and petrology; in this work 
there are 3,000 to 4,000 thin sections and more than 11,000 rock specimens; (5) strati- 
graphical geology, one term, 5 hours per week; (6) physical geology, one term of 2 
hours and one term of 3 hours per week; (7) economic geology, two terms, 5 hours 
per week; (8) field work in geology, 6 weeks, 45 hours per week. 
A new building is in process of erection at Alma College, part of which will be 
given to the geological collections. 
MINNESOTA. 
Geology is taught in 5 colleges in Minnesota, but in only 1 does it form a separate 
department. 
University of Minnesota.—C. W. Hall, professor of geology and mineralogy; F. W. 
Sardeson, instructorin geology; C. P. Berkey, instructor in mineralogy. The geolog- 
ical laboratories occupy rooms on the first floor and basement of Pillsbury Hall. The 
collections are being rapidly increased by the material brought in during the field 
work carried on by the department, and the system of exchanges is adding material 
from distant localities. There are the following study collections: (1) A series of 
erystals; (2) a collection of native elements and sulphides; (3) a. general collec- 
tion of the more common minerals; (4) arepresentative collection of the clastic and 
crystalline rocks; (5) a collection of Paleozoic fossils. The department is also well 
equipped in instruments for the study of physical mineralogy and lithology. 
There are three terms offered immineralogy and three in general geology, the latter 
including physiographic, structural, dynamic, stratigraphic, and historical geology 
and paleontology, two terms in petrology, and one in applied geology. There are 
also 4 graduate courses including: (1) The granite rocks of central Minnesota; (2) 
the pre-Cambrian eruptives of northern Minnesota; (3) basic intrusives and their 
contact phenomena; (4) the lower Paleozoic of southeastern Minnesota. In 1893-94 
there were 8 graduate students, 2 taking geology as a major, 6 as a minor, and 1 
mineralogy as a major study. 
At Carleton College, Northfield, geology is taught for one term by L. W. Chaney, 
professor of biology and geology. The museum is especially interesting as being the 
receptacle of the Hovey Cave Cabinet, which represents nearly twenty years collecting 
by the great cave explorer, Horace C. Hovey. There are also fine collections of min- 
erals, corals, shells, and other materials, including 1,500 illustrative rock specimens, 
numerous fossils, and miscellaneous materials. 
Geology was taught two terms at St. Paul College, St. Paul. Park, in 1891-92, by 
Prof. A. C. Bothe, now of the University of the Pacific. There is no teacher of geology 
at present. 
Geology is taught one term each in Hamline University, St. Paul, and Gustarus 
Adolphus College, St. Peter, and Macalester College, St. Paul.

MISSISSIPPI. 
Geology is taught in Mississippi in 4 institutions, but in none is it a separate 
~ department. 
In the University of Mississippi the subject receives much attention. It was first 
taught in 1854 by Lewis Harper. Eugene W. Hilgard, State geologist, gave instruc- 
tion in geology from 1859 to 1873, except during the four years of the war, and the 
course was one of the leading ones in the institution. The collections were made 
largely by him, and are representative of the geology of Mississippi and the adjoin- 
ing States, T.O. Mabry, the present instructor, teaches mineralogy one term and ~ 
geology one term. 
Millsops College, Jackson, recently established, offers two terms in geology, and 
Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College one and a half terms. Rust Univer- 
sity, Holly Springs, gives two terms to geology, using Le Conte’s Elements as a text, 
and one term to mineralogy. 
MISSOURI. 
In Missouri nearly all the colleges teach geology, 19 in all, but in only 1, the State 
University, does it form a special department. 
University of the State of Missouri, Columbia.—G. C. Broadhead, professor of geology 
and mineralogy. Geology was first taught here in 1843 by E. H. Leffingwell, which 
is the first mention of geology in the State, most of the other colleges being of more 
recent date. Previous to 1871 geology was combined with chemistry and physics. 
From 1871 to 1883, geology, mineralogy, zoology, and, botany were combined. The 
first field and laboratory work done by students was in 1884. The first mineralogical 
laboratory was in 1886. In 1892 G. C. Broadhead, the present professor, introduced 
paleontology. W. W. Clendenin, assistant professor of geology and mineralogy, 
resigned in 1893. 
A destructive fire in 1892 destroyed most of the valuable collections, about 1,000 
specimens only being saved from the fire. Others have since been purchased, Instru- 
ments are at hand for field work and laboratory study in mineralogy and petrography. 
They have a new building for geology and biology, valued at $50,000. 
The following required and elective courses are offered: (1) Mineralogy, descrip- 
tive and determinative, one year; (2) elementary geology, lectures, recitations, and 
field work, one semester; (3) historical geology and paleontology, one year; (4) erys- 
tallography, one semester; (5) American archwology, includes discussions of mounds 
and mound builders and prehistoric American races; (6) meteorology and physio- 
graphic geology; (7) geological seminary lectures, theses, reviews, discussidn, etc., 
once a week. 
In 1893-94 there were 5 graduate students taking geology as a major study and 
1as a minor. 
At the School of Mines of the University of Missouri, Rolla, instruction is given in 
mineralogy for two terms, in lithology for one term, and one term each in dynamical, 
historical, and economic geology. 
At Washington University, St. Louis, the, following courses are offered: (1) A half 
course in crystallography; (2) mineralogy; (3) a half course in mineralogy and geol- 
ogy; (4) elementary and systematic geology; (5) lithology; (6) economic geology; 
(7) paleontology; (8) petrography. Instruction is given by Gustav Hambach, adjunct 
professor of geology. The subject was first taught, in 1871, by William B. Potter.- 
The school of engineering of the University, including geology and mineralogy, will 
soon move to new grounds. 
Central College, Fayette, is just finishing a new science building, in which geology 
will have enlarged room and facilities. 
William Jewell College, Liberty, contemplates a new science building soon, with an 
additional instructor in science. é

838 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
At Drury College, Springfield, the chair of geology is specially endowed. Instrue- 
tion was first given in 1875 by Oliver Brown; at present by Edward M. Shepard. The 
_ museum is said to be one of the best west of the Mississippi. The mineralogical col- 
lection contains the fine Dr. Flanner cabinet of Lake Superior copper ores, and spe- 
cial sets illustrating the physical properties of minerals, with material for laboratory 
and class-roum use. The paleontology cabinet is especially rich in Missouri forms. 
The lithological cabinet contains most of the common rocks. Mineralogy is taught 
for one term and geology for two. 
MONTANA. 
Geology is taught in the only two colleges in Montana, but does not form a special 
department in either. The College of Montana, Decr Lodge, was established in 1884. 
The Montana College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, Bozeman, just established, has 
geology in the course, but it has not yet been taught. 
NEBRASKA. 
Geology is taught in 8 colleges and universities’ in Nebraska, but is a separate 
department in only 1. 
The University of Nebraska, Lincoln, is well equipped for instruction in geology. 
The subject was first taught in 1871 by Samuel Aughly; instruction is given at pres- 
ent by Erwin H. Barbour, professor of geology and State geologist. The following 
courses are offered: (1) Elementary geology, one year; (2) paleontology, one year; 
(3) advanced geology, one semester; (4) lithology and (5) mineralogy, each one 
semester. The building for geology is valued at $2,500 to $3,000, and the collection 
at $2,000. While there are no regular graduate students in geology, 4 students 
are doing graduate work at such times as they can, which is classed as irregular 
graduate work, 
Geology is offered for four terms at the University of Omaha, Bellevue, but no 
particulars are at hand. 
Geology was taught for one term at York College in 1893, but there is no class in 
the subject in 1894-95. 
NEVADA. 
The University of Nevada, Reno, offers two courses in geology—one in general 
geology, sixteen weeks, and one in economic geology, twelve weeks. W. MeN. Miller, 
the present instructor, began teaching the subject there in 1888. : 
NEW HAMPSHIRE. 
In New Hampshire geology is taught at Dartmouth College and the New Hampshire 
College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts. In the latter it is of minor importance 
and is taught for only one term. 
At Dartmouth College the following courses are offered by Charles H. Hitchcock, 
professor of geology and mineralogy: (1) Mineralogy, two terms, recitations, lectures, 
and laboratory work (Dana’s Manual of Mineralogy and Petrography, Williams’s 
Text-Book of Crystallography); (2) three terms in general geology, the first term 
physical geology, the second term historical geology, the third surface geology; 
there is a shorter course (3), which gives more briefly the substance of that given in 
the first two terms above; (4) one term in petrography, and (5) one term in mineral 
resources of the United States and. (6) one term in physical geology. The museum 
-of geology and biology is in Culver Hall, and is well equipped in illustrative 
material. It contains, among others, the Frederick Hall collection of minerals and 
rocks—a special collection of the rocks of New Hampshire and Vermont gathered 
under the auspices of the geological survey of New Hampshire, collection of economic 
geology, topographic models, ete. The college has recently received a bequest of 
$60,000 for the purpose of founding and maintaining a chair in paleontology, archx- 
ology, ethnology, and kindred subjects.

NEW JERSEY. 
Geology is taught in two colleges in New Jersey, in both of which it ocenpies a 
prominent place in the curriculum. 
In the College of New Jersey, Princeton, geology was first taught by the famous 
scientist, Joseph Henry, about 1845. The department is at present in charge of Wil- 
liam B. Scott, Blair professor of geology, who has several assistants. The college is 
well equipped with illustrative material. The museum occupies the central and 
eastern wings of Nassau Hall and is divided into three general departments: (1) 
Geology (including mineralogy); (2) paleontology, and (3) archeology. In the first 
department a special room contains a unique collection of more than 5,000 specimens 
of erratic bowlders and drift material from Switzerland. There is a special room 
devoted to the typical rocks and fossils of the State of New Jersey. There is also a 
collection of the typical rocks of the State of New York. There is a collection of 
2,600 specimens, chiefly crystals, bequeathed by the late A. McMartin, of New York. 
The paleontology department is especially rich in vertebrate forms from Europe 
and America. Many of these have been secured by the exploring expeditions, eleven 
in all, which have been sent by the college to the Tertiary regions of the Western 
States. The first of these went in 1877. The number of fossils, not counting dupli- 
eates, is 15,000. 
The following courses are offered: (1) Elementary geology, one term; (2) physical 
geology, two terms; (3) historical geology, two terms; (4) physical geography, two 
terms; (5) mineralogy, two terms. The first three are by Professor Scott, the fourth 
by Professor Libbey, the fifth by Professor Cornwall and Mr. Phillips. The special 
development at Princeton has been in the lines of stratigraphical geology and verte- 
brate paleontology. 
At Rutgers College, New Brunswick, geology was first taught by Lewis C. Beck 
about 1830, and at Rutgers Scientific School, established as part of the college in 
1865, it was first taught by Prof. George H. Cook, for many years State geologist of 
New Jersey. The subject is now taught in both institutions by Albert H. Chester, 
- professor of chemistry and mineralogy, who gives instruction im mineralogy and 
geology for one year. The lectures in mineralogy are illustrated both by the college 
collections and the private collections of the professor in charge, the latter number- 
ing 4,000 specimens and the college collections 11,500 specimens, which are valued at 
$20,000. These are stored in Geological Hall, erected in 1871 at a cost of $50,000.   
  NEW MEXICO. 
Geology is taught for two terms in the New Mexico College of Agriculture and 
Mechanic Arts, Mesilla Park, by E. O. Wooton, professor of botany. The equipment 
is meager, the subject being first taught in 1891-92. 
At the New Mexico School of Mines, Socorro, opened in September, 1893, geology 
and mineralogy are in the list of courses contemplated after the first year. 
NEW YORK. 
Geology oceupies a prominent place in the curriculum in many of the New York 
colleges. The subject is taught in 22 colleges and universities, and is a separate 
department in 9 of them; 2, Syracuse and St. Lawrence universities, forming 
separate departments this year (1895). 
Cornell University, Ithaea.—A. C. Gill, assistant professor of mineralogy and petrog- 
raphy; Gilbert D. Harris, assistant professor of paleontology; Ralph 8. Tarr, 
dynamical geology and physical geography. Geology was first taught at Cornell 
University in 1868 by C. Fred Hartt. After the departure of H. 8. Williams, who 
was for many years professor of geology, no full professor was appointed, but three 
assistant professors (as noted above), each independent in his own subdepartment.

The museum and laboratory collections are arranged in McGraw Hall. In miner- 
alogy and petrography the laboratory is well fitted up with microscopes, thin sec- 
tions, etc., and has in charge the Silliman series of minerals (cost, $6,000). In 
paleontology there is the Jewett collection of Paleozoic invertebrates, which is 
valued at $20,000; the Rust collection of Trenton trilobites (cost, $1,000), and the 
Newcomb collection of recent shells (cost, $10,000). The dynamical and physical 
laboratory is equipped with illustrative collections, maps, photographs, ete. 
There is one fellowship in geology worth $500 and one graduate scholarship worth 
$400. 
The following courses are offered :!

  Columbia College, New York.*—Science has always had a prominent place at 
Columbia. The college was founded in 1754, and for three years President Samuel 
Johnson comprised the entire faculty. The first professor to be appointed was 
Daniel Treadwell (1757), with the title professor of mathematics and natural history. 
The eleventh chair to be established received the ‘title of geography (1784), and it 
was held for one year by John D. Gross and then for five years by John Kemp, after 
which it lapsed. For the next seventy years such work as was at all related to 
geology was done under the comprehensive name of natural history. Geological 
interest was active in the Lyceum of Natural History, now the New York Academy 
of Sciences, which was founded in 1818, and the first president of the lyceum was 
Samuel L. Mitchill, who had held the chair of natural history in the college, and 
who has left not a few papers in paleontology and geology. 
Thesubject received its chief impetus when the present school of mines was founded 
in 1864. For the next two years Dr. Charles F. Chandler gave the geological instruc- 
tion, in addition to his chief duties in the chemical department. In 1866 a chair of 
geology and paleontology was established, and to it Dr. John S. Newberry was 
called from the Smithsonian Institution. With the advent of Dr. Newberry the 
department at once became a prominent feature of the university. His reputation 
was already established by reports on the geology of the Western Territories, and his 
appointment as State geologist of Ohio in 1869 gave him a rich field in which to 
work and in which to train others. Dr. Newberry began the collections which before 
his death reached nearly 100,000 specimens, and which are especially well adapted to 
11894-95. After the appointment of Professors Harris and Gill.

teaching. The following names of assistants to Dr. Newberry are found on the rolls: 
George S. Baxter, 1868-69; William B. Potter, 1869-1871; Henry Newton, 1870-1875; 
I. C. Russell, 1875-1877; William A. Hooker, 1877-78; Spencer B. Newberry, 1878-79; 
Nathaniel L. Britton, 1879-1886. Later than this the position of assistant was 
resolved into two so-called fellowships, which were held by F. J. H. Merrill, John I. 
Northrop, and Arthur Hollick for varying terms. In December, 1890, Dr. Newberry 
became incapacitated, and the remainder of the year the departmental work was done 
by Arthur. Hollick and by H. 8. Munroe, the professor of mining. 
In June, 1891, J. F. Kemp was made adjunct professor, and in June, 1892, received 
the appointment to the full chair. Dr. Newberry passed away in December, 1892. 
The present staff contains, in addition, Arthur Hollick, with the title of tutor, and 
Gilbert Van Ingen, curator. In 1893 G. K. Gilbert was lecturer in geology. Besides 
the usual work in general geology, Professor Kemp gives university courses in eco- 
nomic geology and petrography; Dr. Hollick offers extended work in paleobotany, 
and Mr. Van Ingen does the same in invertebrate paleontology. In the department 
of biology Prof. H F. Osborn offers university courses in vertebrate paleontology, 
and the work is done at the American Museum of Natural History, where, in addi- 
tion to the former rich material of the museum, there is now the Cope collection, 
recently acquired by purchase. Professor Osborn is also curator of this department 
at the museum. Dr. Bashford, dean of the department of biology, offers work on 
fossil fish, running through the year. Both these latter courses are in close associa- 
tion with the geological department. Mineralogy is a separate department at Colum- 
bia, and is manned at present by Prof. Thos. Egleston (mineralogy and metallurgy), 
Adjunct Prof. A J. Moses, Tutor L. McI. Luquer, and Assistant Heinrich Ries. 
Nine courses are offered in general geology, paleontology, and petrography, all 
but one extending through the year. Two courses in general geology are collegiate 
courses in Columbia College, the others are tniversity courses. 
The geological department possesses well-rounded equipment for general instruc- 
tion, but it is especially rich in fossil plants, in fossil fish, and in economic geology. 
It is also fortunate in having access to the collections at the American Museum, where 
Hall's types and many thousands of other invertebrates are under the care of Prof. 
R P. Whitfield. The approaching removal to a new and enlarged site (1897) offers 
encouraging opportunities for growth, and when the great drains upon the endow- 
ment, made by the unavoidably heavy expenses attendant on this, have been met it 
is expected that the geological force will be still further increased. 
At the University of Rochester, Rochester, geology was first taught at the organiza- 
tion of the university in 1850 by Chester Dewey, and is taught at present by Herman 
LeRoy Fairchild, professor of geology. The department occupies the whole upper 
floor of Sioley Hall, valued at $100,000, the library occupying the lower floor. The 
museum includes the Ward collections in mineralogy, petrography, paleontology, 
and phenomenal geology, consisting of the original collections of Professor Ward. 
The collection was purchased by the university in 1862 for $20,000. It was at that 
time the largest and choicest geological collection in Amer Students accompan- 
ied by an instructor also have access to the extensive collections of Ward’s Natural 
Science Establishment. 
One term’s work is offered in mineralogy and petrography, two terms in general 
geology. There is given in one term a more general course in elementary geology for 
those who do not take the preceding courses, The following special courses are offered 
to advanced students who are prepared to take them: (1) Advanced petrography ; (2) 
advanced geology; (3) paleontology; (4) economic geology; (5) physiography; (6) 
meteorology. There is also a list of honor studies in geology, which includes a crit- 
ical study of certain standard monographs. 
At Union College, Schenectady, geology was first taught in 1845 by Jonathan Pear- 
son. For a number of years instruction has been given in geology and biology by 
Prof. James H. Stoller, but in 1894 geology was made a separate department, with 
Charles 8. Prosser as acting professor. The following courses are offered: (1) Miner-     
   
-P-A-G-E-890
  842 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
' alogy and lithology; (2) general geology; (3) economic geology; (4) historical geol- 
ogy (advanced course); (5) field geology; (6) areal geology; (7) advanced field work 
and independent research; (8) paleontology, with particular attention to the Paleo- 
zoic faunas. 
Particular stress is laid on the stratigraphy and paleontology of the Paleozoic for- 
mations of New York, for which Union University is admirably situated, being within 
easy access of the large collections at Albany and in the very midst of this classic geo- 
logic area, so that in one or two days any type locality of the New York series may be 
visited. Professor Prosser is well equipped for this work, having been associated 
with Dr. H. S. Williams, at Cornell University, for seven years, and four years on the 
United States survey. Since the removal of Dr. Williams to Yale and the death of 
Dr. Newberry, Professor Prosser is the first to offer special courses on New York geol- 
ogy. Both graduate and undergraduate instruction will be given. 
The museum is well equipped with specimens given as follows: Paleozoic fossils, 
870; Mesozoic, 300; Cenezoic, 200; lithological specimens, 1,010; general mineral collee- 
tion, 4,000; total, 7,380. The zoolegical collections contain 15,000 specimens. 
At Hamilton College, Clinton, geology was first taught in 1849 by Oren Root. At 
present it is taught by Charles H. Smyth, professor of geology and mineralogy. The 
department is located in the Knox Hall of Natural History and has extensive illus- 
trative collections, including 2,500 fossils and rocks illustrating the geology of New 
York and 1,750 illustrating the geology of the United States, 600 Silurian fossils from 
Europe, and 10,000 specimens of ores and minerals. 
‘Three terms’ work are offered in general geology and additional courses are elect- 
ive in economic geology and petrography. A course of lectures is given also in 
physiography, and special research work on local geology may be taken. Mineral- 
ogy and crystallography are elective. 
The first instructor in geology at the University of the City of New York was John 
William Draper, who began some time prior to 1859. The subject is taught at 
present by John James Stevenson, professor of geology. Since the removal of the 
university to its new site at University Heights, in 1894, the department is located 
in two temporary buildings. A special building for geology and biology is in con- 
templation. 
The following courses are offered: (1) Physical geography, one term two hours per 
week; (2) general geology, one term two hours, one term one hour per week; (3) 
laboratory course, one term two hours; (4) economic geology, two terms three hours; 
(5) determinative mineralogy, two terms two hours; (6) Anthropology, two terms one 
hour. 
Geology was first taught at St. Lawrence University, Canton, in 1871 by Prof. James 
Henry Chapin. Professor Chapin died in 1892, and in July, 1894, his widow, Mrs. 
Chapin, announced her intention of founding the Chapin professorship of geology 
and mineralogy. The department will soon be created. 
At Hobart College, Geneva, geology was first taught by Horace Webster in 1825-26, 
who was afterwards president of the College of the City of New York. Instruction 
is given at present, provisionally, by Prof. H. L. Smith. The museum collections 
are reported to be extensive. 
In 1847 geology was added to the curriculum at Colgate University, but no instruetor 
was named. In 1860 William Mather was named as lecturer on chemistry and geol- 
ogy, but at the same time geology disappears from the curriculum. The existence 
of a real department dates from 1868, when Albert S. Bickmore was appointed pro- 
fessor of natural history. In 1874 Walter R. Brooks was appointed lecturer on natural 
history. Upon his death, in 1888, Aaron H. Cole was elected and continued until 1892, 
since which time Albert P. Brigham, professor of geology and natural history, has 
been in charge. 
’ Six courses are now offered in geology, three are devoted to general geology, the 
others to paleontology and research work in historical geology. There are two

courses in mineralogy. The university is admirably situated for study of the type 
series of Paleozoic formations. It is here that the Harvard University summer 
school does part of its field work. 
The collections are extensive and are divided into the historical, dynamical, litho- 
logical, and economic; the latter includes a great quantity of material from the 
World’s Fair. The laboratory is supplied with maps, models, photographs, and 
lithological lathe. 
A separate department of geology has just been created at Syracuse University, | 
with E. C. Quereau, from the Unrversity of Chicago, in charge; the courses have 
not been announced, The subject was first tanght at Syracuse in 1872 by Dr. Alex- 
ander Winchell, late of Ann Arbor. 
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, has had geology since 1825, when it was first 
taught by Amos Eaton. The last instructor was Henry B. Nason, professor of 
chemistry and natural science, who died January 18, 1895. 
At the United States Military Academy, West Point; geology was first taught in 1835, 
the first professor of geology, W. F. Hopkins, being appointed in 1838. The present 
professor is S. E, Tillman. Mineralogy has been taught since 1820, 
At Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, geology and mineralogy are taught by William B, 
Dwight. Mineralogy has two courses, one an abridged course. In geology there is 
first a brief course in physiographic geology, followed by a course in lithological 
geology; the principles of petrography are here introduced, use is made of the 
microscope, and microscopic sections are prepared. Dynamical geology is next taken 
up, followed by paleontology and historical geology. Advanced courses may be 
elected in petrology, paleontology, stratigraphical or dynamical geology. The 
mineralogical and geological laboratories are well equipped with instruments. The 
cabinets contain more than 10,000 specimens, besides models, sections, relief maps, 
ete. There is among others a valuable collection of the remarkable vertebrate fossils 
of Tertiary ago from the Bad Lands of Nebraska. 
The other colleges in the State in which geology is taught are enumerated in the 
accompanying tables. 
NORTH CAROLINA. 
In North Carolina geology is taught in 8 colleges and universities, but in only 1, 
the University of North Carolina, does it form a separate department or have any 
prominence in the curriculum. In the others it is taught for one term, with an 
additional term of mineralogy in some of them. 
At the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, geology was first taught in 1817 
by Denison Olmstead. It has been a separate department since July, 1892, with 
Collier Cobb professor of geology at present. Four years’ work are now offered in 
the subject, but no particulars are at hand concerning the courses. The depart- 
ment occupies a building with the State geological survey offices and biology. The 
department of geology occupies the first-floor with two laboratories, a lecture room, 
cabinet, and library. The subject is elective, and in 1893-94 about 45 per cent of 
the students elected it. There were 3 graduate students the same year, 1 taking 
the subject as a major and 2 as a minor. 
At Davidson College, Davidson, geology was first taught in 1857 by W. H. Kerr, 
afterwards State geologist. At present Prof. Henry Louis Smith teaches mineralogy 
four months and geology the remaining six months of the year. There is an exten- 
sive collection of 10,000 or 11,000 specimens. 
  NORTH DAKOTA. - 
In North Dakota geology is taught in 3 colleges, but forms a prominent feature 
in none of them.

OHIO. 
In Ohio geology is taught in 30 colleges and universities. While it forms a sepa- 
rate department in only 2, it forms a prominent feature in several others. In 9 dif- - 
ferent institutions the subject is taught for three terms or more. 
At Ohio State University, Columbus, Prof. Edward Orton, State geologist, has 
taught geology since 1875. He was the first instructor. Miss Florence Bascom is 
at present assistant.1| The department is well equipped for work. It is in a build_ 
ing valued at $105,000. The large collection in the museum has been arranged for 
instruction rather than display. It embraces the following series: (1) representa- 
tives of the different formations of the State and the leading phases of each forma- 
tion; (2) a collection of the Ohio fossils, which includes a large majority of the 
described fossils and many type specimens, particularly rich in Upper Silurian and 
Devonian forms and plants of the coal period; (3) the collection of economic min- 
erals of the State; (4) the petrographical collections, which include the Hawes 
collection, the Krantz collection, and the Rosenbusch complete series of typical rock 
specimens from abroad. These are supplemented by two series of thin sections, 
including Voigt and Hochgesang’s collections. There are also many other speci- 
mens on general geology and mineralogy, many geological models and maps. 
The following courses are offered by Professor Orton: (1) General geology, lectures, 
two terms; (2) economic geology, one term; (3) dynamical and structural geology, 
one term; (4) paleontology, no limit. The following by Miss Bascom: (1) Phys- 
ical geography, one term; (2) elementary geology, one term; (3) petrography, two 
years; mineralogy is taught for three terms by N. W. Lord, professor of mining and 
metallurgy. 
Of the students eligible to elect geology in 1893-94, 37 per cent elected it. There 
were two graduate students taking geology as a major the same year. 
At the Western Reserve University, Cleveland, geology was first taught in 1839, by 
Prof. Samuel St. John, who taught it for one term in the course. At present (1894) 
it is a separate department taught by Henry P. Cushing, associate professor of geol- 
ogy. Within two years a new building for biology and geology is to be erected. 
The specimens in the cabinets, numbering 12,000, are estimated to be worth $6,000, and 
the instruments, etc., estimated at $2,000. 
The following courses were given in 1893-94, each a half year in length: (1) A 
general course in geology; (2) crystallography and descriptive mineralogy; (3) 
determinative mineralogy and blowpipe analysis; (4) dynamical geology and lithol- 
ogy; (5) structuraland historical geology. Geology is an elective and of the students 
eligible to elect in 1893-94, 50 per cent did so. 
A new building for science is in course of erection at Buchtel College, Akron. While 
geology is not a separate department at Buchtel, it is a prominent subject in the 
curriculum. No particulars are at hand as to the number or scope of the courses 
offered. 
In the Case School of Applied Science, Cleceland, but two terms of geology were 
offered in 1893-94, but in the following year the course was extended somewhat. 
There are: (1) A course in mineralogy, (2) a course in general geology, (3) a course in 
advanced geology, (4) a course in physical geology. It is taught at present by Frank 
Mason Comstock, professor of natural history. 
In Ohio Wesleyan University, Delaware, geology is now taught for one year by Edward 
T. Nelson, professor of physiology and geology. Mineralogy is taught by the depart- 
ment of chemistry for one term. Especial attention is given to the Paleozoic fossils 
of the Mississippi Valley. <A portion of the last term is given to economic geology. 
More advanced courses are contemplated in the future. One building is now devoted. 
to biology, physiology, and geology. 
        
1ince the above went to press, Miss Bascom has accepted a position at Bryn Mawr, and J. A. 
Bownocker has been appointed assistant.

Lima College, Lima, is a new institution, and the first class in geology will be 
formed in 1895. 
At Oberlin College, Oberlin, a natural history building is planned for geology, 
zoology, and botany. Geology is now combined with zoology, but a separate depart- 
nent of geology is contemplated. 
At Miami University, Oxford, the department of biology and geology has been for 
many years in charge of zoologists, and geology has been subordinate to zoology and 
botany. 
At Antioch College, Yellow Springs, both Professor Orton, State geologist, and Pro- 
fessor Claypole, of Buchtel College, have taught geology at different times. It is 
not certain whether the subject was first taught by Professor Chandler or by Professor 
Claypole. The subject is now taught for three terms by Prof. G. A. Hubbell, and it 
is expected to add an additional elective term. One term is devoted to economic 
geology, and two to general and local geology. The museum collections are large. 
OKLAHOMA. 
Geology will be taught the coming year (1894-5) at the two new institutions in 
Oklahoma. Neither one is yet old enough to have a class sufficiently advanced to 
study the subject this year. The University of Oklahoma, Norman, contemplates a 
geological survey under the charge of the professor of geology at the university. 
OREGON. 
In Oregon geology is taught in 8 colleges and universities, but at present forms a 
separate department in none of them. 
At the University of Oregon, Eugene, geology has been taught since 1877 by 
Thomas Condon, the present instructor. There is this year one course extending 
through the three terms; next year (1894-95) another advanced course will be given 
extending through the year, making six terms in all. A separate department of 
geology is contemplated in the near future. There are large collections in the cab- 
inet, valued at $10,000. 
At the Oregon State Agricultural College, Corvallis, geology is at present combined 
with physics. Next year (1894-95) it is expected to make geology and mineralogy a 
separate department. 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
In Pennsylvania geology is taught in 24 different institutions, but in none of them 
does it form a separate department except the Boys’ Central High School at Phila- 
delphia. In several colleges and universities mentioned below it forms a prominent 
place in the curriculum. 
University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.—Geology was first taught in the Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania in 1835 by the well-known geologist, Henry D. Rogers. 
Mineralogy was made a separate course in 1816, with Thomas Cooper as professor. 
At present instruction is given by Amos P. Brown, instructor in mining and metal- 
lurgy. Edward D. Cope, professor of mineralogy and geology, gives a course of 
lectures on the anatomy of the vertebrates. Besides the courses in mining and metal- 
lurgy, Dr. Brown offers five courses in mineralogy and two in geology, one on lithol- 
ogy and one on stratigraphy. In 1893-94 there were 9 graduate students taking 
geology as a minor study, and 12 in 1894-95. There were none taking it as a major. 
There has been some talk of a separate building for geology and mineralogy 
including amuseum. The museum collections are quite large, estimated at 20,000 
specimens, including 6,000 minerals, all valued at $15,000. 
In the Boys’ Central High School, Philadelphia, geology and mineralogy has been 
taught by Oscar C. S. Carter, professor of geology and mineralogy, since 1889 (?). 
There is a large granite building now in course of erection (1894), in which there 
will be a separate mineralogical and geological laboratory. Dana’s Manual of

Mineralogy and Le Conte’s Compend of Geology are used. Special attention is paid 
to the local geology and frequent excursions made to the numerous mineral and rock 
quarries; photographic views are taken and the students are encouraged to make 
collections of their own. 
At Lehigh University, South Bethlehem, a course of leetures is given for one term in 
general geology in connection with Le Conte’s text-book. One term is given to 
lithology based on Williams’s Lithology. Mineralogy is taught for one year; the first 
term devoted to crystallography and determination of crystal forms; the second term 
to physical properties and descriptive mineralogy. The geological cabinet contains 
more than 10,000 specimens. In paleontology there are good specimens of nearly all 
the common genera. In mineralogy are the Keim and Roepper collections, the latter 
valuable from a crystallographic standpoint. The petrographic division contains a 
duplicate set from the collection of the second geological survey of the State besides 
many foreign specimens, There is a valuable economic collection. Instruction is 
given by Edward H. Williams, jr., professor of mining engineering and geology. 
At Lafayette College, Easton, instruction in geology is given by Thomas C. Porter, 
professor of botany and mining engineering. There are 30 exercises in general 
geology, 30 in economic geology, and 56 in mineralogy. There is a rock-cutting 
machine and a microscope for petrographic work. 
At Pennsylvania State College, State College, geology was taught for a number of 
years by William A. Buckhout, professor of botany and horticulture, instruction 
being given fortwo terms annually. Mineralogy was taught by the chemistry 
department. In 1893 a school of mining engineering was established, with Magnus 
C. Ihlseng professor of ‘mining engineering and geology. T. C. Hopkins was 
appointed instructor in geology for one term. He left in January, 1894, returning in 
January, 1896, as assistant professor of geology, Professor Ihlseng giving instruction 
in geology in the interval. General geology is taught for one term, economic geol- 
ogy one term, and mineralogy two terms. Additional courses in geology are con- 
templated. Field and laboratory work is carried on in connection with recitations 
and lectures. 
At present instruction is given in the new engineering building. A separate 
building for the mining engineering department, including geology and mineralogy, 
is contemplated. There is a fine collection of minerals and several valuable rock 
collections, including several European collections, duplicates. from the second 
geological survey of the State, many specimens from the first survey, and the fine 
collection from the State exhibit at the World’s Fair. The geological library was 
separated from the general library and combined with the mining-engineering 
library in 1893. It already contains upward of 400 volumes, and is rapidly growing 
in numbers and value. The private libraries of Professors Ihlseng, Stoek, and 
Hopkins are available to students in geology. 
At Franklin and Marshall College, Lancaster, instruction in geology was given in 
1853 by Rey. T. C. Porter. It was formerly combined with botany and zoology, but 
is at present taught for three terms by the president, Rey. John 8. Stahr. 
At Bucknell College, Lewisburg, geology is taught at present for one term 5 hours 
per week and one term 1 hour per week. A longer course will be made elective in 
1895. 
It will be interesting to many to know that geology was first taught about 1837 
in Allegheny College, Meadville, by Matthew Simpson, later so famous in the ministry. 
It is taught at present for two terms by James H. Montgomery, professor of physics 
and chemistry, one term being given to dynamical and one term to historical geol- 
ogy. The museum contains a number of distinct collections estimated to contam 
20,000 specimens in all. 
At Ursinus College, Collegeville, geology is not taught as a separate branch, ‘but 
there is one term of physiography; mimeralogy 1s elective with chemistry and 
paleontology with biology.

RHODE ISLAND. 
Geology is taught in two institutions in Rhode Island, — au separate aepart- 
ment in one and having a good course in the other. 
At Rhode Island College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, Huegatur, geology was 
first tanght in January, 1894, by H. J. Wheeler. The department being just started 
the equipment is small. 
At Brown University, Providence, geology is combined with zoology and taught by 
Alpheus S$. Packard, professor of zoology and geology, who teaches geology for 
two terms and part of a third. There are extensive collections, estimated as follows: 
Minerals, 10,066; fossils, 6,850; rocks, 2,808; total, 19,724. The fossil flora of Rhode 
Island is fully represented. The lectures are illustrated by diagrams, models, and 
lantern views. 
SOUTH CAROLINA. 
In South Carolina there are 8 institutions in which geology is taught, but in none 
of them is it aseparate department or does it form a preminent feature, nor do any 
of them possess very large illustrative collections. 
Clemson College contemplates adding a professor of geology and metallurgy to the 
faculty and giving advanced instruction in geology. 
SOUTH DAKOTA. 
Geology is taught in6. colleges in South Dakota, and in 2itisa separate department 
with mineralogy. In 3 colleges in the State the president. teaches geology. 
In Yankton College, Yankton, geology is. taught for two terms by the president, 
Albert. T. Free. Physiographie, lithological, historical, and dynamical geology are 
studied in the order named, using Le Conte as a text. In the second term special 
attention is paid tothe geology of Dakota andthe Northwest. Mineralogy is studied 
for one term... 
At the University of South Dakota, Vermillion, geology was first tanght about 1888 
by Prof. Gary E. Culver. At present it is taught by James E. Todd, professor of 
geology and mineralogy, and State geologist. Seven different courses are offered in 
geology, as follows: (1) Dynamical geology, (2) petrography, (3) structural and his- 
torical geology, (4) economic geology, (5) field geology, (6) special geology, (7) 
paleontology. Four terms are offered in mineralogy, including crystallography, 
determinative, descriptive, and microscopic mineralogy. 
A fire in 1893 destroyed part of the library and collections, but they are now being 
added to rapidly. The laboratory is supplied with a microscope, section-eutting 
machine, and many thin sections. There is a large quantity of economic material, 
obtained from the World’s Fair. Collections are accumulating under the direction 
of the State geologist, who is also the professor of geology. 
At the South Dakota Agricultural College and United States Experiment Station, Brook- 
ings, geology was taught about five years ago for three years and then dropped; 
recently a ternr in agricultural geology has been added which treats of soils, drain- 
age, ete. 
TENNESSEE. 
In Tennessee geology is: taught in 19 colleges:and universities. It forms.a separate. 
department im none of them and in most ef them is. of minor importance in the 
course. Yet in a few of them it forms a prominent feature. 
The geology of Tennessee is now a required study in the common schools of the 
State, taught. from a, text-book specially prepared, and in many of the colleges a 
cours6 is given on the geology of the State. 
In Vanderbilt University, Nashville, geology is taught by James M. Safford, professor 
of natural history and geology, formerly State geologist, and Paul M. Jones, fellow

  848 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94, 
and assistant. Mineralogy, including crystallography, is taught for one term, gen- 
eral geology one term, and applied geology two terms. 
Natural history and geology occupy one story in Science Hall, where the museum, 
laboratory, and lecture rooms are located. Instruction is given by lectures, recita- 
tions, and laboratory and field work. 
At Cumberland University, Lebanon, a new university building is in process of eree- 
tion in which the geological collections, laboratory and lecture room will be placed. 
At Maryville College, Maryville, » new science building is contemplated and an 
enlargement of the course in geology. The subject is taught at present for two 
terms, one in general geology and one in the geology of Tennessee. 
At the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, geology is temporarily attached to the 
school of agriculture. Instruction is given in mineralogy, general geology, and the 
geology of Tennessee. 
At Burritt College, Spencer, instruction is given now for one term, but it is expected 
soon to add another. 
They are planning to develop the subject of geology more extensively at MWashing- 
ton College in the near future. 
  TEXAS. 
Geology is taught in 9 institutions in Texas, but in only 1 does it form a separate 
department, 
At the University of Texas geology was first taught in 1888 by Robert T. Hill, now 
of the United States survey. At present instruction is given by Frederic W. Simonds, 
professor of geology, who offers the following courses: “() General geology, one year, 
including physical geography, dynamical and structural geology; (2) paleontology, 
two terms, for 1894-95, brachiopoda; (3) mineralogy and crystallography, one term; 
(4) economic geology (one third course); (5) petrography (one third course) [not 
given in 1894-95.] 
After 1894-95 a course in mining will be offered in the school of geology. 
‘The geological lecture room and laboratories are in the west wing of the main build- 
ing, and the display and reference collections, filling 18 cases, are in a central portion 
of the main building. 
At Austin College, Sherman, it is expected soon to make the subject of geology more 
prominent in the curriculum. 
UTAH, 
In April, 1894, the University of Utah received $60,000 from the Salt Lake Literary 
and Scientific Association for the endowment of the Deseret professorship of geology. 
The new building and museum of the association has also been placed at the disposal 
of the institution. The museum is a very valuable one, estimated at $75,000. It con- 
tains3,000 mineral and rock specimens, 500 vertebrates, 2,000 invertebrates, and nearly 
1,000 ethnological specimens. There are also about 7,500 specimens in the university 
museum, 
The year 1894-95 is the first under the endowment. Instruction is given by James 
E. Talmage, president and Deseret professor of geology and mineralogy. William D. 
Neal’s name also appears on the faculty list as instructor in geology and mineralogy. 
The following courses are offered: (1) Elementary mineralogy, one term; (2) advanced 
mineralogy, two terms; (3) elementary geology, one term; (4) advanced geology, one 
year. The elementary geology is required; the others are elective. The announce- 
ments for 1895-96 offer three courses in mineralogy and four in geology. 
VERMONT. 
While not a separate departmant in either of the two Vermont colleges, geology 
occupies a prominent place in each. 
In tho University of Vermont, Burlington, geology was first taught in 1839 by Prof. 
G. W. Benedect. At present general geology is taught a half year by George H.
-P-A-G-E-897
    GEOLOGY IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. 842 
Perkins, professor of natural history; mineralogy a half year by Horatio Loomis, 
professor of mineralogy and agriculture; geology, including soils, tillage, drainage, 
and fertilizers, by Joseph L. Hills, professor of agricultural chemistry. The museum 
is well equipped with illustrative material. Among the several thousand minerals 
and rocks of special note are the collection of sulphur and associated minerals from 
Sicily, lavas from Mount Vesuvius, and the native rocks and minerals. There is a 
large fossil collection which is not enumerated in the table at the end of this chapter. 
It is the intention to make geology and mineralogy a separate department. 
Geology is taught at Middlebury College by Henry M. Seely, professor of naturak 
history. There are no data at hand concerning the courses given. The college is 
making a complete collection of the rocks and fossils of the Champlain Valley. 
VIRGINIA. 
In Virginia geology is taught in 9 different institutions, and forms a separate 
department in 1, the University of Virginia. 
Geology was first taught in the University of Virginia in 1840 by the well-known 
geologist, William B. Rogers. The present professor is William M. Fontaine. No 
particulars are at hand concerning the courses of instruction, further than the state- 
ment that both graduate and undergraduate instruction is given in geology and 
mineralogy. The university is admirably equipped for teaching the subject. The 
cost of the building and specimen cases is $52,500; of the specimens, $30,884; of the 
instruments, maps, ete., $7,750. 
At the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College, Blacksburg, while geology is in 
the department of chemistry, yet the instructor in geology and mineralogy, Thomas 
L. Watson, teaches only these branches. 
WASHINGTON. 
It is interesting to note that in the 4 institutions in Washington in which geology 
is taught, all began the subject in 1894, which seems to be the earliest date that 
geology was taught in the State, unless it might be in the University of Washington, 
Seattle, which was not heard from either by letter or by catalogue. 
At the Agricultural College Experiment Station and School of Science geology is not 
taught, but there is a short course in mineralogy. 
WEST VIRGINIA. 
In West Virginia geology is taught in 3 institutions, in 1 of which it forms a sep- 
arate department; in the other 2 there is but one term in each. 
In the West Virginia University, Morgantown, geology is a separate department, 
under Prof.8. B. Brown. The subject was first taught in 1868 by Prof. J. J. Stevenson, 
now of the University of the City of New York. William M. Fontaine, now of the 
University of Virginia, and Israel C. White, of West Virginia, have given instruction 
in geology here. The following courses are now offered: (1) A course in general 
geology extending through the year, three hours a week; (2) mineralogy two hours 
a week through the year; (3) economic geology, three hours a week through the 
year, and (4) physical geology. In 1893-94 there were 25 students in geology; in 
1894-95 there were 34.. There were no graduate students. 
WISCONSIN. 
In Wisconsin geology is taught in 7 institutions, in 2 of which it is a separate 
department and in the others it is a prominent feature in the course. 
University of Wisconsin, Madison.—Charles R. Van Hise, professor of geology; Wil- 
liam H. Hobbs, assistant professor of mineralogy and petrology; J. M. Clements, assist- 
ant professor of geology. Geology was first taught at the University of Wisconsin in 
1869 by Roland D. Irving. Prof, T, C, Chamberlin, now of the University of Chicago,

formerly State geologist of Wisconsin and president of the University of Wisconsin, 
was for many years professor of geology. Prof. Rollin D. Salisbury, now at the 
University of Chicago, was formerly at the University of Wisconsin. The following 
courses are offered by the present faculty: (1) General geology, one term, Van Hise; 
(2) historical geology, one term, Clements; (3) systematic paleontology, Clements; 
(4) field geology, one term, Van Hise and Clements; (5) applied geology, one term, 
Van Hise; (6) general course in mineralogy, divided into three parts: (a) general 
mineralogy, (b) blowpipe analysis, (c) optical mineralogy, Hobbs; (7) short course 
in mineralogy, Hobbs; (8) blowpipe analysis and determinative mineralogy, Hobbs; 
(9) petrology, two: courses, Hobbs. 
Advanced and graduate work is offered, the character of the work adapted to the 
individual students. Special facilities are offered in physical and pre-Cambrian 
geology by Professor Van Hise; in paleontology by Professor Clements; in petrology 
by Professor Hobbs. There is also a course of synoptical lectures by the three 
professors, given in 1893-94 and alternate years thereafter. 
There were 4 graduate students taking geology as a major study in 1893-91, Of 
the undergraduates about 33 per cent of the class of ’94 elected geology. 
The college is well equipped in apparatus and illustrative materials, The 
geological and mineralogical museum occupies the second floor of the south wing of 
Science Hall. It contains many topographic relief models; a number of casts of 
gigantic fossil forms; the Powers collection of fossils, a systematic mineral collection 
of 2,500 to 3,000 specimens; the W. T. Henry collection of minerals, containing 
30,000 to 40,000 specimens, especially representative of the lead and zinc ore deposits 
of Wisconsin; the Stiirtz-Rosenbusch collection of typical European rocks, and the 
Julien collection of typical American rocks, ete. 
At Beloit College geology is taught for nine terms by George L. Collie, professor of 
geology. No particulars are at hand concerning the courses. The department 
occupies two floors of Pearson’s Science Hall, in which the collections are displayed. 
WYOMING. 
In Wyoming geology is taught for three terms in the University of Wyoming, Lara- 
mie, by Wilber C. Knight, professor of mining engineering and geology. Six courses 
are offered—five in geology and one in mineralogy: (1) General geology, five hours 
per weck, one year; (2) mineralogy; (3) paleontology, and (4) economic geology, 
each sixty hours; (5) dynamic and structural geology, sixty hours; (6) field work 
and thesis, sixty hours. The subject was first taught in 1887 by Prof. J. D. Conley. 
The Wyoming Collegiate Institute, Big ‘Horn, opened in September, 1894, and will 
have geology in its course when a class is far enough advanced. It will be taught 
by H. N. Robinson, jr., along with physics and chemistry.

   Previous to 1845 there were 31 colleges and universities teaching geology, 1 begin- 
ning in 1804, 1 in 1807, 1 in 1817, and ‘Lin each of the years between 1820 and 1845, 
except the years 1822, 4824, 1833, and 1834, when there were none, and the years 1825, 
1826, 1835, 1836, 1839, and 1843, when there were 2 each year, and in 1837 there were 3. 
It will bo noticed that there were more beginning the subject in the year 1894 (14) 
than in any previous year. In the same year two professorships in geology were 
endowed. The effect of the civil war will be noticed in the years 1861, 1862, and 
1863, and the financial panic of 1877 in the few years following that date.’

CHAPTER IV. 
RULES FOR THE SPELLING AND PRONUNCIATION OF 
CHEMICAL TERMS. 
[Adopted by the American Association for the Advancement of Science at its meeting 
in Washington, D. C., 1891, and readopted at the meeting in Madison, Wis., 1893. 
See Proceedings Amer. Assoc. Adv. Science, 42d meeting, Madison, 1893, p. 366.] 
In 1887 a committee was appointed by the American Association for the Advance- 
ment of Science to consider the question of attaining uniformity in the spelling and 
pronunciation of chemical terms. The work of this committee extended through 
the following four years. As a result of widespread correspondence and detailed 
discussion at the annual meetings of the Chemical Section of the American Associa- 
tion for the Advancement of Science, the accompanying rules have been formulated. 
and adopted by the Association. They are submitted to chemists generally, and 
especially to the large number of those engaged in teaching chemistry, with the 
request that a cordial and earnest effort be made to render their use general, and 
thus obviate the many difficulties arising from the present diversities of style. 
The following summary of the rules has also been arranged in the form of a chart 
for general distribution to high schools and colleges, so that they may be kept per- 
mauently and prominently before the eyes of teachers and pupils.

‘Primary accent; ‘’ secondary accent. 
WN. B.—The accent follows the vowel of the syllable upon which the stress falls, 
put does not indicate the division of the word into syllables. 
GE 
  RAL PRINCIPLES OF PRONUNCIATION. 
1. The pronunciation is as much in accord with the analogy of the English lan- 
guage as possible. 
2. Derivatives retain as far as possible the accent and pronunciation of the roov 
word. 
3. Distinctly chemical compound words retain the accent and pronunciation of 
each portion. 
4, Similarly sounding endings for diasimilar compounds are avoided (hence -id, -ite).

ACCENT. 
In polysyllabie chemical words the accent is generally on the antepenult; in words 
where the vowel of the penult is followed by two consonants, and in all words ending 
in -ie, the accent is on the penult. 
    All prefixes in strictly chemical words are regarded as parts of compound words, 
and retain their own pronunciation unchanged (as, i/ceto-, i’ mido-, i/zo-, 
hy’ dro-,i/so-, ni’tro-, nitré’so-). 
LEME 
  TS. 
In words ending in -ium, the vowel of the antepenult is short if i(asiri/dium), 
ory (as did ¥’mium), orif before two consonants (as cii/lcium), but long other- 
wise (as tita/nium, st1é@nium, chrod/mium).

TERMINATIONS IN -ic. 
  
The vowel of the penult in polysyllables is short (as cy&/nic, fimi/ric, 
ars®/nic, sili/cic, id’dic, bity’ ric), except (1) u when not used before two 
consonants es mercet’ric, prii’ssic), and (2) when the penult ends in a vowel 
(as benzd‘ic, oléic); in sassy ap IeS it is long execpt before two consonants 
(as bo’ric, ci’tric). Exception: acé’tic oracé' tic. 
The termination -ic is used for metals only where necessary to contrast with -ous 
(thus avoid aluminic, ammonic, etc.)

TERMINATIONS IN -id (FORMERLY -ide). 
The final e is dropped in every case and the syllable pronounced id (as ch16'rid, 
Yodtd, hydrid, d'xid, hydrd/xid, silfid, # mid, #nilid, maré’xid), 
TERMINATIONS IN -ane, -ene, ine, AND -one. 
The vowel 9¢ these syllables is invariably long (as m&/thane, & thane,

The termination -ine is used only in the case of doubly unsaturated hydrocarbons, 
according to Hofmann’s grouping (as propine). 
TERMINATIONS IN -in. 
In names of chemical elements and compounds of this class, which includes al] 
those formerly ending in -ine (except doubly unsaturated hydrocarbons) the final e is

This termination, in the ease of specific chemical compounds, is used exclusively 
for alcohols, and when so used is never followed by a finale, The last syllabie is 
pronounced 201 (as gl¥’co1, phé’nol, cré'sdl, thy’mGl (ti), glycerol,

CHAPTER V. 
THE RISE AND PROGRESS OF MANUAL TRAINING. 
By C. M. Woopwanb, Director of the Manual Training School of Washington Univer- 
sity, St. Louis, Mo. 
Manual training, as the term is now understodd, is the product of 
two growths which it is well to distinguish. The first is the growth of 
the trade school, an institution which has gradually been replacing the 
old form of apprenticeship, as machinery has been introduced forming 
the large factory, and the labor of crafts has been more and more 
subdivided. Trade schools are by no means universal, but they are 
gradually increasing in number. 
The second growth from which manual training has gained its chief 
vigor has been that of the conviction, now very wide spread, that at 
school much more than books should be studied, and that more should 
be made of the school period, say from 6 to 16 years. The function of 
the school has grown wide and deep. 
The conditions of society are such—very different from what they 
were one hundred, even fifty years ago—that the ordinary parent can 
do little directly toward teaching his child the arts and accomplish- 
ments of life. The average mother does not teach her daughter 
needlework or cooking to any great extent, and the average father 
does not and can not teach his son even the trade by which he earns 
his daily bread; the father works away from home and the son knows 
very little of his father’s working hours. 
The boy can learn from his father neither the fundamental principles 
of science nor their application in the arts of active life. The father is 
better situated to teach his boy reading and penmanship than to teach 
him drafting, tool work, and science, because for the former neither 
apparatus nor laboratory is necessary. If taught at all, therefore, to 
ordinary boys, those last matters must be taught at. school, where 
apparatus may be used by many in common and where pupils may be 
taught in classes. So long as it was held necessary to teach manual 
arts to pupils individually, they were taught at home if taught at all; 
but as soon as it was found that in tool work and in drawing pupils 
could be taught in classes as well as in history or arithmetic, the 
economy of manual training schools became evident. 
It thus appears that while the idea of manual training has been the 
natural product of our advancing civilization, the method has come 
877 
 
-P-A-G-E-926
  878 EDUCATION. REPORT, 1893-94. 
through the experience of trade schools, though finally differing widely 
from methods employed in actual trades. 
THE GROWTH OF BROAD EDUCATION. 
It is interesting to take a general review of the course of develop- 
ment of our latest ideal of a broad education. Two hundred years ~ 
ago the learned professions and the privileged classes were educated 
exactly to suit their supposed needs, and working people were not 
taught at all. ~ 
The former were educated for the church, the bar, medical service, 
statecraft, or for a life of ease and luxury in polite society; they needed 
literature, science (Such as there was), history, art, and all the graces 
of speech. The latter had no apparent need of knowing how to read; 
their mission was to work. Later, as more and more pupils were sent 
to school, the programme of the privileged classes was adopted for all. 
The more unfruitful the system was the harder teachers worked to raise 
the standard of literary study and to emancipate pupils from the sway 
of “utility,” with still more dismal results. Locke speaks of the 
“learned ignorance” of his day, and Buckle found that an education 
purely literary often did “‘more harm than good.” He said that— 
There is.always a tendency to prefer those parts of literature which favor ancient 
prejudices, rather than those which oppose them, and in cases where this tendency 
is very strong the only effect of great learning will be to supply materials which 
will corroborate old errors and confirm old superstitions. In our time such instances 
are uot uncommon, and we frequently meet with men whose erudition ministers to 
their ignorance, and who, the more they read the less they know. 
This statement of Buckle brings into clear relief the evil of a one- 
sided education. There is an evident absurdity in taking a large 
majority of the children of any community and educating them as 
though in life they were t. be chiefly concerned with literature and art 
and the luxuries of life, and not at all with labor and industry. 
But this rests the claims of the new education too much on an-eco- 
nomic basis. The demands for a broader and more complete education 
are no less strong on the grounds of intellectual and moral develop- 
ment. The average good citizen is called upon to exercise his judg- 
ment in regard to a hundred material problems where a knowledge of 
mechanics and industrial methods is as essential as that of reading 
and writing; and he is called upon to discriminate between right and 
wrong, between thrift and waste, between fitness and unfitness, in 
reference to countless matters of everyday concern, but which are 
wholly remote from the concern of the old-time schools. No man can 
be equipped to stand forth in the working world and to make the 
most of himself, as a leader if he is fitted for leadership, or as a follower 
if he is best adapted to following, without manual as well as mental 
training—without the development which comes from the simultaneous 
cultivation of all his powers.
-P-A-G-E-927
MANUAL TRAINING. 879 
Manual training, as an educational factor, owed its existence to a 
widespread conviction that the education of the schools had been deal- 
ing too exelustvely with the abstract and the remote and not enough 
with the concrete and the present. The thought product of the school 
was too dim and uncertain, and the knowledge gained had no sufficient 
bearing upon matters of daily life. Consequently the pupil lacked 
mental vigor and clearness, and his school experience was deficient in 
practical elements. Manual training embodies preeminently the mod- 
ern idea of substituting things for words, observation for printed 
description, and personal experience for the recorded experience of 
others. 
So long as education was a privilege of the few, the monks and the 
nonlaboring classes, it was like that of the slave-owning Greeks of 
Plato’s time—devoted to culture and the demands of good society. 
With the disappearance of human slavery and feudalism, with the 
decay of ecclesiasticism, with the substitution of the industrial spirit 
for the warlike spirit—suech being both the cause and the consequence 
of the growth of the idea of universal education—the ideals of educa- , 
tion have substantially changed. Weare at last emancipated from the 
idea that is still supreme in the Orient, that education consists in learn- 
ing what has been laid down by the fathers: that the canons of science, 
art, and religion are to be committed to memory, and that all thinking 
must conform; in short, that authority is supreme. 
We ean not be too thankful that that day is nearly past. It is no 
longer “authority for truth,” but “truth for authority.” We have 
learned that a dietum like that of Aristotle in regard to the consti- 
tution of matter may be accepted without serious question for a 
thousand years, and yet be utterly false. Neither age nor a large 
following establishes truth. 
Americans do not sufficiently appreciate their vantage ground, in that 
they are largely free from that “tyranny of the ancients” which has 
so oppressed Europe and Great Britain. Here it requires no special 
moral courage to assert that education must touch modern life more 
closely; that the utilities have changed; that while the need of intel- 
lectual development is ever the same, the curriculum by which such 
development is secured should always be adapted to social and indus- 
trial conditions. 
With this consciousness of freedom comes the almost universal wish 
to incorporate new elements into the school work. If schools are to be 
suited to the demands of all people; if they are going to educate arti- 
sans as well as artists, mechanics as well as scientists, craftsmen as 
well as merchants—without pretending to know which shall be which— 
the general plan must be exceedingly broad. All the fundamental 
elements must be included. It must never be true, a8 it was declared 
to be true twenty years years ago, that ‘‘ our system of education trains 
boys, not to become craftsmen, but to be unwilling to be put to any  
-P-A-G-E-928
  880 ; EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
kind of craft.” Our schools must equally lead to all developed and 
progressive occupations, and equally attract all classes. 
With notions like these on every hand, no one can with confidence 
point to the first advocate of manual training. 
Many recent writers and reviewers appear anxious to establish the 
antiquity of manual training, as though age were needed to make its 
claims valid. Others strive to show that it is an imported article. It 
is easy to quote what people have said in all ages in favor of the under- 
lying ideas of manual training, but when one asks what was done 
in the way of such training, one generally finds only trade work and 
ordinary manual labor sandwiched in with more or less attention to 
books. : 
The world is much indebted to Locke, Rousseau, Commenius, Bacon, 
Pestalozzi, and Spencer for correct ideas in regard to education, but 
the problem whose solution is presented in manual training was: How 
shall this “education to things,” as Emerson puts it, be given? Hence, 
without further consideration of the motive, let us proceed to show 
how the form of manual training developed. 
No sooner were trade schools established in France and Belgium and 
Germany than it was found that drawing, mathematics, and elemen- 
tary science must enter, too, to secure the best results. To be sure, 
these new features entered at a minimum and the trade work at a 
maximum, but they gained recognition. The product of trade schools 
was of course trade workers, such as lock makers, box makers, basket 
makers, weavers, dyers, instrument makers, cabinetmakers, etc., work- 
men of a high grade and great efficiency; but it was soon seen that 
such training had a universal value; that the mental fruit was as 
good as the manual, and that the broader and more fundamental 
the tool training was, the greater was its special as well as its general 
value. 
Otto Cygnaeus devised for the primary schools of Finland a simple 
species of manual training as early as 1858, and in 1866 it was by law 
“made obligatory in all the primary and normal schools.” Cygnaeus 
credits Pestalozzi and Froebel with the ideas underlying his introdue- 
tion of hand work. Froebel taught that the child, “as a productive 
being, must be educated from the beginning to self-activity and pro- 
ductive energy. He must thus be educated through work to work.” 
Cygnaeus supplemented the “ gifts” by giving to the older children 
such kinds of handiwork as have for their aim the training of the 
hand, the development of the sense of form, and an esthetic feeling, 
and which should be useful in every walk in life. ‘Such exercises are: 
Simple joinery, turning, basket making, etc. But all these kinds ot 
work must not be conducted like a trade, but always with strict ref: 
erence to the universal educational aim, and as a means of formal 
education.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-929
  
MANUAL TRAINING. 881 
Sweden claims to have had some form of sloyd for forty years, but it 
appears that Sweden is much indebted to Finland for the idea of lib- 
eralizing hand work as an element of general training; and that the 
practice of working from drawings (which were originally wanting in 
sloyd) was imported, possibly from France.' 
Whether the Russian Della Vos, director of the Imperial Technical 
School at St. Petersburg, got his idea of tool analysis from Finland 
(as some assert) or not, it is clear that the first suggestion of the cor- 
rect method of tool instruction which America received from abroad 
came in the report of Della Vos, as published by him in 1868. What~ 
is now known as the “Russian method” of tool instruction consists in 
a series of exercises based upon and accompanied by an analysis of 
three things—the tools, the materials, and the elements of construction. 
If we add to this basis of three things a fourth thing, viz, the boy 
himself, his physical and mental condition, we have the sufficient basis 
for both the method and the content of American manual training. 
It is assumed that the forms of tools are the product of evolution, 
being the result of the best thought and the highest skill. Each tool 
has its functions and its correct methods of use. Again, each material 
has its characteristics, its limitations, its weak and its strong sides. 
These must all be brought out, contrasted, and compared. Thirdly, 
construction consists chiefly in methods of combining pieces; hence 
joints, unions, and fittings constitute the chief elements. To a sub- 
ordinate extent individual parts are to be shaped or modeled in accord- 
ance with the laws of simplicity, strength, and beauty. Finally, the 
muscular strength of the boy’s hand and arm, and his ability to be 
accurate, to be logical, and to be provident, must be duly considered. 
This comprehensive analysis, which is strictly educational in char- 
acter, must of course be followed by a logical arrangement of steps in 
which each feature is emphasized, and in which progress is always 
from the simple to the complex. 
In this way for the first time tool work is brought within the realm 
of systematic education. Before this analysis was reached, one learned 
what he could of tool work while helping to build a house, construct a 
locomotive, shoe a horse, or make a piece of furniture. There was no 
theory, and no one eyer thought of mastering tools and materials 
except incidentally while engaged in some form of manual labor. 
The writer does not hesitate to characterize all tool teaching by the 
old method of putting the learner at once upon commercial work as 
unscientific and uneducational, whatever may have been the result in 
individual cases. Manual training has encountered no more serious 
difficulty than that of convincing “practical” men that the theory and 
  
1The eminent service of Dr. Solomon, of Naas, in modifying the sloyd exercises 
and in giving to them a universal character suited to elementary manual training, is 
widely recognized.

  - 
882 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
use of tools can be taught successfully otherwise than by the good old 
method of “going into a shop and going to work.”! 
It is obvious that tool work as thus analyzed and arranged admits of 
class teaching as readily as mathematics or Latin, provided the teacher 
has the proper appliances. 
It is thus seen that the ‘Russian method” should receive full credit 
for cutting the Gordian knot which bound all the tool crafts down to 
an unscientific method of training. At the same time Americans may 
claim the credit of having half worked out the same solution before 
hearing of Della Vos, and of quickly putting it to general educational 
use. The Imperial Technical School of St. Petersburg trained only 
government engineers. Students entered at the age of 18 years. The 
course of training covered six years, three years while mastering the 
elements and three while applying them in government shops. There 
was no thought, apparently, of offering such training to students in 
general or to younger boys. The credit of giving manual training to 
boys of 14, and even younger, as a feature of general education, dis- 
tinetly belongs to America. 
The Russian educational exhibit at the Centennial Exposition (1876) 
contained a full account of Della Vos’s work and sets of models to 
show how tools were analyzed and used. The great work of President 
Jobn D. Runkle, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in pub- 
lishing a full report of the Russian exhibit in the fall of 1876, and the 
establishment of tool instruction in the Institute at Boston in 1877, 
substantially on the Russian plan, is freely acknowledged by all. He 
epitomized the Russian system as “Instruction before construction.” 
He declared that “The trades are many, the arts are few.” Said he: 
“Making the art, and not the trade, fundamental, and then teaching 
the art by purely educational methods, is the Russian system.” Dr. 
Runkle gave an exposition of the Russian method of tool instruction 
at the meeting of the National Educational Association in Louisville, 
Ky., in 1877. 
While President Runkle in the shops of the Massachusetts Institute 
was successfully applying the new method of tool instruction, by his 
chipping and filing and forging classes, between the years 1877-1880, 
the Industrial School Association of Boston, under the presidency of 
Rev. George L. Chaney, was developing the art of using woodworking 
tools in a very significant way. Prof. Channing Whittaker, Mr. George 
H. Chapman, Mr. D. T. Kendrick, and others, all of Boston, joined in 
preparing, testing, illustrating, and elaborating a ‘“ Manual” contain- 
ing a series of 14 lessons for beginners in woodwork. This “Manual” 
was published by Ginn & Heath in 1881, and was doubtless the first 
1The writer recalls the cheerful prediction of a well-known St. Louis manufac- 
turer, that the manual training school, with its “fanciful way of teaching,” was 
destined to “do a great deal of harm;” that “you can’t make a workman without 
sending him into the shop, among workmen, and making him put in his ten hours a 
day.”

MANUAL TRAINING. 883 
manual training work published in America. Its value and influence 
have been abundantly tested in many places by teachers and writers.? 
But it would appear that the class of the Industrial Association 
and other classes in and near Boston, organized on the basis of those 
early lessons, failed to perpetuate themselves. The reason is not far to 
seek. The tool work was all or nearly all that was taught. No draw- 
ing worthy the name accompanied it, throwing light and receiving 
light in return. No science and no mathematics stimulated a taste 
for the elements of construction, while reciprocally profiting by the 
clear-cut mental pictures which were formed in the shop. Wherever 
manual training has taken permanent root and exhibited a healthy 
growth it has combined drawing and tool work, and carried on both 
simultaneously with theoretical work in the allied branches. The 
moral of this lesson is easily drawn.” 
1While thus speaking of early influences favorable to the idea of manual train- 
ing the writer desires to give credit to several prominent educational workers and 
- writers. Supt. J. P. Wickersham, of Pennsylvania, took advanced ground as to the 
duty of the public schools. He said: 
“It is high time that something should be done to enable our youth to learn 
trades, and to form industrious habits and a taste for work. 
“Tt is not enough to instruct a boy in the branches of learning usually taught in 
our common schools, and there leave him. It must be seen to by some authority 
that he is allowed a chance to prepare himself to earn’a livelihood. It takes more 
than a mere knowledge of books to make a useful member of society and a good 
citizen. The present product of our schoois seems to be, in too great a degree, 
clerks, bookkeepers, salesmen, agents, office seekers, and officeholders. We must so 
modify our system of instruction as to send out instead large classes of young 
people fitted for trades, for business, and willing and able to work.” 
At the same time he felt that we should not follow the trade schools of Europe. He 
would have the instruction scientific and thorough, but he did not believe the com- 
mercial shop was the thing for the school. 
Prof. Robert H. Thurston (now of Cornell University), in a report of a committee 
to the legislature of New Jersey in 1878, strongiy advocated the establishment of 
schools in which should be particularly and thoroughly taught the mechanical prin- 
ciples which underlie the industries. 
Mrs. Spencer (then Miss Anna C. Garlin) wrote: 
“Let the child be taken to school whole, instead of in parts; let him be considered 
to have a body as well as a mind; let him be trained physically toward use by a 
wise shaping of the eager animal activity; let him be protected from the cupidity of 
manufacturer and the pressure of home poverty by utilizing the active energy which 
in more primitive times was of so much account in the family economy; let him be 
gradually introduced into that hard world of work for which he is destined, by a 
training which shall be of the hands as well as of the brain..* *“ * If we are to 
protect the children of the very poor from the very worst consequences of their con- 
dition without making paupers of them or their parents, we must continue [after 
the training of the kindergarten] in some way to give them study and work together.” 
2The Worcester Free Institute, now the Worcester Polytechnic School, was opened 
for students in 1868 as a technical school, with a machine shop for students in me- 
chanical engineering. Its pupils were all over 16 years of age, and the methods of 
tool instruction were those of ordinary commercial shops. Skilled workmen were 
engaged on contract work and the boys acted as assistants and apprentices. Presi- 
dent Charles 0. Thompson of the Institute never claimed to have any faith in manual 
training.

ington University, St. Louis. As early as 1872 a shop for tool 
instruction and tool practice had been equipped in the polytechnic 
department under the direction of the writer. Woodworking, lathe, 
forge, and machine tools were bought, and a large basement shop was 
equipped. Engineering students (of college grade) had practice here 
till 1877, when three separate shops were organized in an old dwell- 
ing house, and class instruction was given to college students and to 
students of a preparatory school. All this tool work was purely edu- 
eational, having no commercial character. 
In: May, 1878, the writer of this paper gave an address on manual 
education before the St. Louis Social Science Association. The address 
gave a full account of the trade schools of Paris and the “Whitworth” 
scholarships in England. As indicating the nature and extent of the 
work which preceded the actual equipment of the manual training 
school, as well as foreshadowing its coming, the following quotations 
are made from that address: 
For the last five years we have had a fair workshop, in which the students of this 
polytechnic school have worked to a certain extent. But only during the present 
year have we been able to work with much system. With the aid of our stanch 
friend, Mr. Gottlieb Conzelman, we fitted up during last summer a woodworking 
shop with workbenches and vises for 18 students; a second shop, for vise work upon 
metals, and for machine work; and a third, with a single outfit of blacksmith’s 
tools. During the last few months systematic instruction has been given to different 
classes in all these shops. Special attention has been paid to the use of woodwork- 
ing hand tools, to wood turning, and to filing. I have here two or three specimens of 
each lesson given to the different classes. The age of the students has ranged from 
15 to about 22. None of the students have had much experience, and of course you 
can not expect nicely finished work. These specimens are not shown on account of 
the excellence of the workmanship, but because they illustrate our method. 
The amount of time given to shopwork has generally been only four hours per 
week—two lessons of two hours each. The junior class in mechanical engineering 
gave eight hours. Shopwork has been done in the afternoon, and there has been no 
less work required in the morning recitations than formerly. Though four hours 
per week—which is equivalent to two days per month—seems too small an allowance 
to be of much practical value, four years would, on the present plan, suffice to give 
an excellent idea of the uses of all our tools, the properties of materials, and con- 
siderable manual skill. I have yet to hear from the parent who does not approve of 
our plan of shopwork. Our running expenses in the shop are now about $100 per 
month; but we could, without perceptible increase of cost, double our present num- 
ber of students. No extra fee has been charged on account of shopwork; but with- 
out permanent endowment this arrangement can not long continue. The experience 
of this year has been invaluable to us, and we are now clear in our conviction that a 
series of commodious instruction shops, well furnished with machinery and tools, 
and so liberally endowed as to require only a nominal fee from students, would be 
of inestimable value to the youth of this city. 
The above address, published both in St. Louis and in New York City 
(Steiger & Co.), led to the establishment of the St. Louis Manual Train- 
ing School as a subdepartment of Washington University on June 
6, 1879. The funds were contributed, as they have beeu given ever

since, by private citizens of St. Louis. Over $200,000 has been given 
to found and endow the school, only $40,000 of which was by bequest. 
This history would fail to be adequate should it not contain the 
names of those who in the early days had faith in manual training and 
who “proved their faith by their works.” To Gottlieb Conzelman, 
Edwin Harrison, Samuel Cupples, William Greenlief Eliot, Ralph 
Sellew, and William Brown the establishment of the manual training 
school was due. 
Little need be added of the St. Louis school. It was opened in Sep- 
tember, 1880. In consequence of the demand for more room, the plant 
was greatly enlarged in 1882. It accommodates 300 boys and its rooms 
are generally full. It is now in its fifteenth year, and its graduating 
class numbers 82 students. Its graduates number 560, a band of high- 
minded young men whose influence for education and culture and 
progress is strong. Their records are given near the end of this paper. 
It is interesting to note how spontaneously and simultaneously 
manual training started at various points. In 1874 under the admin- 
istration of President John A. Anderson, the Kansas Agricultural 
College introduced tool work as a required exercise for all its male 
students. There was, however, no industrial drawing, and only one 
teacher of shopwork previous to 1877, when the age of admission was 
reduced to 14 years. Since that date it has been virtually a manual 
training school with a four-year course of study and practice, includ- 
ing both agriculture and the mechanic arts. The educational war 
which waged in and around that institution during the year 1877-78 
forms an interesting chapter.! 
During the year 1880-82 thousands of visitors inspected the St. Louis 
school, and its reports were sought from far and near. 
The subject of manual training was presented quite fully at the meet- 
ing of the National Educational Association in Saratoga in 1882. A 
committee on industrial education made an important report; the com- 
mittee consisted of Francis A. Walker, Boston, president Massachu- 
setts Institute of Technology, chairman; M. C. Fernald, Orono, N. H., 
president Maine College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts; J. W. Pat- 
terson, Concord, N. H., superintendent public instruction, New Hamp- 
shire; M. H. Buckham, Burlington, Vt., president University of Vermont; 
Prof. William H. Brewer, New Haven, Conn., Sheffield Scientific School, 
Yale College; William B. Weeden, Providence, R. 1.; John S. Clark, 
Boston, secretary. They recommended as follows: 
First. The introduction into public schools of proper appliances for the develop- 
ment of the sense-perception of pupils in regard to color, form, proportion, etc., by 
contact with models and with natural objects. 
Second. The introduction into grammar schools of simple physical and chemical 
experiments, for the purpose of acquainting pupils, through original observation,

with the elements of chemical and physical science and their common applications in 
the arts. ‘ 
Third. The teaching of drawing, not.as an accomplishment, but as a language for 
the graphic presentation of the facts of form and of matter; for the representation 
of the appearance of objects, and also as a means of developing taste in industrial 
design. 
Fourth. The introduction into grammar and high schools of instruction in the use 
of tools; not for their application in any particular trade or trades, but for develop- 
ing skill of hand in the fundamental manipulations connected with the industrial 
arts, and also as a means of mental development. 
In the discussion which followed this report there was little or no 
difference of opinion on the first, second, and third recommendations. 
The fourth was vigorously discussed, first by Mr. Clark, the secretary, 
who supported it by an able paper published in the proceedings of the 
American Institute of Instruction. The high ground taken by the com- 
mittee is shown by this sentence taken from Mr. Olark’s paper: 
The industrial training should have no issue with the literary training. We have 
seen that both are needed in a sound course of mental training. Both are equally 
demanded by the social conditions of any highly organized community. That the 
purely literary training is not broad enough to answer as.a higher educational train- 
ing for those who are to enter our ever-expanding industrial employments, which 
demand in a high degree the applications of natural science and also of skilled 
Jabor, is a fact which can not be denied. To remedy this state of things secondary 
schools must provide a way to give broader instruction in experimental and theo- 
retical science; and also in a generalized form, instruction in mannal training, 
including the use of hand and machine tools, not in its application in any special 
trade or trades, nor as a training divorced from general intellectual culture, but as 
an essential part of a sound general education. 
A brilliant discussion of the report was contributed by Supt. James 
MeAlister, then of Milwaukee.’ A single paragraph is quoted: 
It is an egregious mistake to suppose that those who favor manual training wish 
it to take the place of mental training, or are seeking to deprive any class of pupils 
of the portion of intellectual culture they now receive. But I would like to know 
why the hand should not be trained as well as the head? The perfectly educated 
man is he whose facile hand follows obediently the clear and ready promptings of a 
well-developed brain. The hand is the most marvelous instrument in the world; 
it is the necessary complement of the mind in dealing with matter in all its varied 
forms. It is the hand that “‘rounded Peter's dome; ” it isthe hand that carved those 
statues in marble and bronze, that painted those pictures in palace and church 
which we travel into distant lands to admire; it is the hand that builds the ships 
which sail the sea, laden with the commerce of the world; it is the hand that con- 
structs the machinery which moves the busy industries of this age of steam; it is 
the hand that enables the mind to realize in a thousand ways its highest imaginings, 
its profoundest reasonings, and its most practical inventions. 
Remarks in support of the report were made by Dr. Larkin Dunton 
and Charles ©. Coffin, esq., of Boston, and Professor Woodward, of St. 
Louis. Dr. E. E. White, of La Fayette, Ind., and A. P. Marble, of Wor- 
cester, opposed the report on the ground that it virtually contained 
1Later superintendent of schools at Philadelphia and now president of Drexel 
Institute.
-P-A-G-E-935
    
  
MANUAL TRAINING. 887 
“the doctrine that the public school should cover the whole domain of 
education.” 
Said Dr. White: 
This doetrine saps the very foundation of the public-school system, puts a maga- 
zine under it, and then lays a train out to fire it. The educator who does that can 
not blame the outsider if he fires that train, and the public-school system, in some 
of its important departments, is blown up before his eyes. He need not be startled 
at such a result, for he put the magazine under it. 
Mr. Marble indorsed the position of Dr. White. Here are specimens 
of his reasoning: 
He [Dr. Dunton] begs the question when he says that this boy must earn his liv- 
ing, and therefore he must have industrial traming of an educational form. I say 
the boy must have his living; therefore he must have industrial education in some 
other form. 
Now, the schools we have to conduct are to train boys and girls in those directions 
that are common to everybody, and one of the things that the boys and girls ought 
to learn in those schools is how to get information from books. There is no informa- 
tion stored up in the plow, hoe handle, steam engine; but there is information stored 
upin books. Ifa boy is prepared to get information from books, he can make indefi- 
nite progress. If you take out of his hand the books and put in there the handsaw 
and the hammer, and ask the teacher—who is most likely a young girl—to teach 
them, when she does not know anything about them, the whole matter will simply 
become “a bore” to all parties concerned. The saw is brought into the recitation 
room, and the teacher says, ‘Now, saw.” It is a thing that does not belong to the 
school at all. Jt belongs outside, and ought to be attended to outside. 
On the same day, by special invitation, it was the writer’s privilege 
to read a paper on the “Function of a manual training school,” setting 
forth the “Three methods of expression.” 
He claimed for these forms of expression, which he took pains to dis- 
tinguish, more nearly equal care and consideration in the elementary 
education of every child. (1) Teach language and literature and 
mathematics, with a view to make each child a master of the art of 
verbal expression; (2) teach mechanical and free drawings with the 
conventions of shade and color, and aim at a mastery of the art of 
pictorial expression; (3) and lastly, teach the cunning fingers the won- 
derful power and use of tools, and aim at nothing less than a mastery 
of the fundamental mechanical processes. 
To do all these things while the mind is gaining strength and clear- 
ness and material for thought is the function of a manual training 
school. 
He indorsed the position of President Stephen A. Walker, of the 
New York school board: 
Education of the hand and eye should go along with, pari passu, the education of 
the mind. We believe in making good workmen as well as in making educated in- 
\tellects. We think these are things that can be done at the same time, and our 
| proposition is that they can be done better together than separately. 
| He gave the daily programme of the St. Louis school, and referred at 
. length to the aims, methods, and evident results of his school. The  
-P-A-G-E-936
888 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
address was published in the Popular Science Monthly and was widely 
read. 
Dr. E. L. Youmans, in remarks upon the paper, emphasized the need 
of a form of education better suited to boys whose tastes and inclina- 
tions do not lead them to purely literary and abstract subjects. 
Mr. L. H. Marvel gave an account of a class in carpentry in a public 
school in Gloucester, Mass., and Mr. James A. Page’s report of an 
experiment in shopwork in the Dwight grammar school in Boston was 
read. Both experiments were regarded as successful. 
President George I’. Fairchild, of the Agricultural College of Kansas, 
took advanced ground as to the objects aimed at and as to the methods 
to be pursued. Referring particularly to industrial colleges, he said 
that they were “solving the problem of uniting intelligence with readi- 
ness in practical affairs.” He said that the friends of manual education 
all agree in seeking— 
to increase among students that respect for labor, that activity of hands, that sense 
of duty, that familiarity with details, that knowledge of ways and means and keen- 
ness of observation, so clearly perceived to be the proper end of such training. No 
one feels that the proper result is a human machine, wound up to its fourscore years 
with unvaried accuracy because its ways and motions have been regulated according 
to rule and routine. And yet the method sometimes proposed of driving a youth in 
haste to a trade and perfecting him in it by confinement does naturally result in 
just such machine workmen; and schools that adopt it do not utterly fail, only 
because they can not live up to their theory. Each pupil is looked upon as a whole 
human being, to be put in training that shalt give a broader, not a narrower, ability. 
The views expressed at Saratoga in 1882 have been given quite fully, 
because for the first time there was general interest in the subject, and 
because from that beginning waves of discussion swept back and forth 
across the land. It is not too much to say that the pioneers of manual 
training were in substantial agreement as to the complementary nature 
of manual training. It was to liberalize and enrich the curriculum of 
secondary schools, not to curtail and cripple it, as has been charged a 
thousand times. 
During the year 1882 an article by Dr. Felix Adler, of New. York, 
appeared in the Princeton Review, which greatly stimulated the gen- 
eral interest in manual training. The article called attention to a 
kindergarten and primary school! which had been in existence for five 
years, and which had applied the “creative method to the training of 
the intellect, to the development and refinement of the taste, to the 
formation of character.” The primary school was an advanced kinder- 
garten on a higher plane. The intimate relation between drawing and 
manual work with tools was constantly maintained, and there was an 
attempt to aid the children “to a clearer understanding of the elemen- 
tary facts of mechanics.”

  MANUAL TRAINING. 889 
Dr. Adler placed great value upon the production of beautiful forms 
by the pupil as tending “to heighten his appreciation of what is beau- 
tiful and to refine his taste.” 
The following eloquent passage shows a profound insight into the 
moral influence of well-chosen manual work upon the pupil’s char- 
acter. 
And now I would point out how the occupations of the workshop and the atelier 
combined tend to establish in the mind of the pupil an unselfish and impersonal 
standard of valuation which will prepare him admirably for the truer moral esti- 
mate of life. For days and perhaps weeks he labors to convert a formless material 
into a form illustrating mathematical truth or «esthetic harmony. He undergoes 
protracted toil and meets perhaps with many failures and disappointments in order 
to be rewarded at last by what? Simply by realizing in some degree that perfect- 
ness of the object which he aimed at from the beginning. His work is devoid of any 
pecuniary value. It isa mere typical form. Its worth consists in being true or in 
being beautiful. And a habit is thus formed of judging things in general according 
to their intrinsic rather than their superficial qualities. Gradually, and almost 
insensibly, the analogy of the work performed on outward objects will be applied to 
inward experience. A delicate sensibility to true and harmonious relations will be 
engendered, and the impressions thus obtained can later on be raised into convie- 
tions by direct moral instruction, The pupil, when of sufficient age, can be taught 
that in the world of thought and feeling, too, truth and harmony of relation are the 
sole ends to be sought. He can be exhorted to undergo similar toil, to be prepared 
for similar failures and disappointments, in order to realize at last something of the 
same inward perfection which is to be his only and all-sufficient reward. Thus 
while he is shaping the typical objects which the instructor proposes to him as a 
task, while he pores silently, persistently, and lovingly over these objects, reaching 
success by dint of gradual approximation, he is at the same time shaping -his own 
character, and a tendency of mind is created from which will eventually result the 
loftiest and purest morality. 
The success of the St. Louis school early attracted the attention of 
the Commercial Club of Chicago, and in 1883 the members of the club 
decided to establish a manual training school. They incorporated the 
school, and organized with E. W. Blatchford as president. The school 
opened on February 4, 1884, under the direction of Dr. H. H. Belfield. 
It is but proper to add that the manual training movement was started 
in Chicago by Col. Augustus Jaé¢obson,! and his efforts in bringing the 
subject to the notice of the Commercial Club and to the public through 
the press were ably seconded by Mr. Charles H. Ham. 
    1 The views of Colonel Jacobson on the subject of education were broad and origi- 
nal, as may be seen by this extract, written by him as early as 1874: ‘‘I should build 
schoolhouses, fill them with steam engines and machinery, and in them I would 
train young America, male and female, fully up to the present state of knowledgein 
everything there isto be known. The boy leaving school should carry with him 
mechanical, business, and scientific training, fitting him for whatever it may become 
necessary for him to do in the world. I would secure for society the advantage of 
all the brain capacity that is born and of all the training it can take. It is possible 
and@practicable to let every child of fair capacity start in life from his school a skilled 
worker with the principal tools of all the mechanical employments, an athlete 
with the maximum of health possible to him, and thoroughly at home in science and 
literature. The child so trained would when grown be to the ordinary man of to-day 
what a racer is to an ordinary plow horse.”

  890 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
In 1883 the authorities of Baltimore decided to have a manual train- 
ing high school, and on March 3, 1884, the Baltimore Manual Training 
School was opened, with Dr. Richard M. Grady as prineipal. Dr. Grady 
had already spent three days in an examination of the St. Louis school, 
and Professor Woodward had by request given an address before the 
city government of Baltimore on the work of his school. In his efforts 
to organize the school Dr. Grady was greatly encouraged by President 
Gilman, of Johns Hopkins University. Baltimore was thus the first to 
establish a manual training school.as a part of the public school.system. 
In June, 1883, the first class graduated from the St. Louis manual 
training school. The event was one of great interest and the reports 
of the proceedings were widely copied. The following extracts from 
the director’s report is significant as taking for granted a high intel- 
lectual and moral aim and the absence of low and sordid motives: 
Our exhibition to-day is not limited to a display of drawings, shopwork, and 
manual skill; we have had recitations in algebra, geometry, natural philosophy, chem- 
istry, Latin, history,and English composition. In thus arranging our programme, 
T have recognized the fact that nearly all persons admit the entire practicability 
and reasonable snecess of all the manual features of our school. The theory and 
the use of tools are as readily taught as arithmetic or Latin. But the question has 
remained in many minds, particularly among teachers: “Do the pupils of a manual 
training school prosecute ordinary school work with an interest and success equal 
to that observed in other schools?” They ask: “ Does not the interest which these 
boys manifestly take in their tool work, in fact and of necessity, diminish their 
interest in and love for their books?” This is a natural inquiry, and some of our 
shrewdest visitors of late spent considerable time in our recitation rooms searching 
for an answer to this question. Those of you who have listened to recitations in 
this schoo] may be prepared with an answer. The testimony of our teachers is very 
pertinent here. They all say that these boys do better work than do boys of the 
same grade without the stimulus of the manual training. 
My own conclusion, based upon the observation of the influence of manual educa- 
tion for at least eight years, is that not only does our workshop not detract from 
the interest boys take in books, but it stimulates and increases it, either directly or 
indirectly. In mathematics, physics, mechanics, and chemistry the help is direct 
and positive. Note, for instance, the mental arithmetic involved in the execution of 
a pattern from a working drawing. No one can learn from a book the true force of 
technical terms or definitions-nor the properties of materials. The obscurities 
of the text-books (often doubly obscure from the lack of proper training on the part 
of the author) vanish before the steady gaze of a boy whose hands and eyes have 
assisted in the building of mental images. No classes in physics or chemistry were 
ever so ready to illustrate their text-books. 
Then on the literary side the habit of clear-headedness and exactness in regard to 
the minor details of a subject, which is absolutely essential in a shop, stretches with 
its wholesome influence into their study of words and the structure of language. 
As Felix Adler says, the doing of one thing well is the beginning of doing all things 
well. I ama thorough disbeliever in the doctrine that it is educationally useful to 
commit to memory words which are not understood. The memory has its abundant 
uses, and should be cultivated; but when it usurps the place of the understanding, 
when it insidiously beguiles the mind into the habit of accepting the images of 
words for the images of things the words ought to recall, then the memory becomes 
a positive hindrance to intellectual development. The influence of manual training 
when associated, as it is here, with mental culture is intellectually and morally 
wholesome. 
 
-P-A-G-E-939
  MANUAL TRAINING. 891 
The subject of manual training was discussed in June, 1883, at the 
Missouri State Teachers’ Association, at Sweet Springs, by Dr. 8. 8. 
Laws and the writer. After the exposition of its needs, methods, and 
aims, Dr. Laws vigorously asserted that there could be no such thing 
as general training in the use of tools; there were, he declared, no fun- 
damental principles. And again he took the position that whatever 
energy or strength was absorbed in manual training exercises with 
tools was just so much energy withdrawn from mental culture. 
An analysis of mechanical processes furnished a ready answer to the 
first charge, and the success of the St. Louis school during three vears 
was generally accepted as an adequate reply to the second. 
Again, in July, 1883, at Saratoga, before the National Educational 
Association, the results of experience were presented by the writer 
under the title of “The fruits of manual training.” 
This address, somewhat abridged, was printed in the Popular Science 
Monthly, and later inserted in the writer’s book, The Manual Training 
School [D. C. Heath & Co., Boston]. 
At Saratoga, in 1883, for the first time, a full exposition of the draw- 
ing of a manual training school was made. 
The most notable event connected with the progress of manual 
training in 1884 was the exposition of school handiwork at Madison, 
in connection with the meeting of the National Educational Associa- 
tion. Besides illustrative exercises in drawing, wood, and metal work 
from four engineering schools (Purdue University, Wisconsin State 
University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Illinois State 
University), the St. Louis Manual Training School showed work done by 
allits classes. This was the first exhibit, side by side, of work done by 
engineering students on the one hand and on the other by students 
some three years younger from a preparatory school. Dr. W.T. Harris 
voiced the feeling of many in his report-on the exposition when he said: 
Tt is not necessary, as some think, to introduce manual training into the common 
school. What we want is the manual training school side by side with the high 
school as an independent institution for the preparation of youth for their vocation. 
Among the papers of the association for 1884 is a spirited defense 
and advocacy of manual training by Col. Augustus Jacobson. He 
said: 
The manual training school has come and it has come to stay. For purposes of 
industry men will abandon the manual training school method when they abandon 
the locomotive and go back to the stage coach. 
It is said that if a boy learns the use of tools he will necessarily follow the pur- 
suit of a mechanic and thereby be debarred from rising in the world. Many men 
are kept down in the world by ignorance and want of skill, but Ihave never yet 
seen any man, or heard of any man, who was kept down by knowledge and skill. 
To say that to teach a boy the use of tools will force him to become a mechanic 
is like eine that if I have my boy taught to:dance he must become a dancing mas- 
    
1An eae eS of the National Tiocencaal Association had been organized. 
the year before and Dr. Woodward had been selected as president. The address 
referred to in the text was regarded as his inaugural.

ter; if have him taught to fence, to box, to skate, he must earn his bread by these 
accomplishments; if I have him taught to ride he must become a cavalryman or a 
cowboy. The manual training school educates boys, not to become mechanics, but 
to become men of intelligence and skill. It educates them so that they may have 
open to them a wider field of employment than they could have in any other way. 
It educates them so that they may have open to them all employments. 
It is but proper to add that in the discussion following Colonel Jacob- 
son’s paper President C. O. Thompson, of Rose Polytechnic, Terre 
Haute, Ind., strongly opposed anything like shopwork outside the tech- 
nical schools. Any school attempting to put shopwork into general 
training was, or soon would be, in a “moribund condition.”! 
The year 1884 was marked by the opening of the manual training 
schools in Chicago, Baltimore, Toledo, New York City (College of the 
City of New York) and at Gramercy Park (the last under the direction 
of Mr. Courtlandt Palmer), at Eau Claire, Wis., and a certain amount 
of woodwork was organized in the schools of Boston as a sort of 
experiment for grammar-school pupils. 
The Toledo movement seems to have been inspired by Mr. E. A. 
Macomber, and to have been seconded by Messrs. William H. Scott 
and Frank Scott—the three forming the board of trustees of Toledo 
University. The funds of the University were in trust for educational 
purposes, and the trustees decided to cooperate with the school board 
of Toledo and erect an adequate building adjoining the city high 
school, to be known as the Scott Manual Training School. The trustees 
maintain the manual features (shops, drawing, cooking, and needle- 
work), so that the pupils of the city high school have free manual 
training. 
In connection with the movement in Toledo the lively interest of 
ex-President Hayes was remarkable. He presided at the conference 
signalizing the opening of the Scott Manual Training School, at which 
addresses were made by Dr. Felix Adler, Colonel Jacobson, Mr. C. H. 
Ham, Mrs. Ewing, of Iowa, and Professor Woodward, of St. Louis. 
After some experimenting in tool instruction, Girard College, in Phil- 
adelphia, started regular class metal work in 1884, and has maintained 
it and woodwork (started some two years later) until the present time. 
In September, 1884, the Pennsylvania Agricultural College organ- 
ized manual training on regular lines and maintains it still in a very 
complete manner. | 
The Miller Manual Training School, munificently endowed by Sam- 
uel Miller, was opened for young children in 1878, at Crozet, Albemarle 
County, Va., and systematic tool instruction for advanced pupils was 
developed about the year 1884. 
1A particular school at Komatan, in Bohemia, much like a manual training school, 
which Professor Thompson said was in a “moribund condition,” was found by the 
writer the next year (1885) ina very flourishing condition. In consequence of its 
success cight similar schools had just been established in Austria. It was Professor 
Thompson’s remark about the Komatau school that particularly led to the visit the 
following year.

The Hebrew Technical School for boys of twelve years and upward 
was opened in 1884 in the city of New York. Dr. J. M. Leipsiger was — 
the able and enthusiastic director. 
The progress during the year 1885 was steady. In Cleveland, Ohio, 
in February, 1885— 
a small carpenter shop was started in a barn situated on Kennard street, near 
Euclid avenue, for the benefit of some boys, then pupils in the Central High School. 
Through the diligence and enthusiasm of those boys the little school and the value 
of manual training were brought to the notice of some of the business men of the 
city. One or two meetings were held, at which the question of the establishment of 
amanual training school in Cleveland was thoroughly discussed. It was decided to 
form a stock company with a capital of $25,000, with which they were to erect and 
equip a building and then charge a tuition fee just sufficient to cover the running 
expenses. 
The Cleveland Manual Training School Company was incorporated 
June 2, 1885, for the purpose of “ promoting education, and especially 
the establishment and maintenance of a school of manual training, 
where pupils shall be taught the use of tools and materials and 
instruction shall be given in mechanics, physics, chemistry, and mechan- 
ical drawing.” 
The school was opened for pupils early in February, 1886. Soon 
after this, on petition of the board of education, the State legislature 
passed an act authorizing the city of Cleveland to levy a tax of one-fifth 
of 1 mill for manual and domestic training purposes. This tax amounts 
to about $16,000. The incorporated company owning the building gave 
the board of education the free use of this building, machinery, ete. 
Tuition is now free to public-school pupils. 
The organizer of the movement in Cleveland was Mr. Newton M. 
Anderson, who had already spent two or three days in St. Louis study- 
ing the methods of manual training.! 
In September, 1885, the Central Manual Training High School of 
Philadelphia was opened with 125 pupils. In three years the number 
had increased to 325. 
During the year 1885 it was the writer’s privilege to visit the schools 
of England and Europe. The special inducement to the trip was a 
formal invitation to present the subject of manual training schools at 
an educational conference in Manchester, England, on September 14, 
1885. Beginning at Manchester, he devoted nearly three months to the 
study of technical and industrial schools. In Manchester he gave three 
public addresses upon the theory and methods of his own school, with 
such statements of results as the records would warrant. The subject 
was thoroughly canvassed by the managers of the Manchester Technical 
School, the result being that a manual training department with a com- 
plete curriculum was opened in September of that year.” 
1Mr. Anderson is now at the head of the University School for boys in Cleve- 
Jand. 
2A visit to this school in 1892 shows continued progress and development.

894 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
Trade or industrial schools were common in all manufacturing towns, 
such as schools of weaving, dyeing, spinning, drawing, and metal work, 
put there were few schools for general culture which included tool work. 
A small school at Glasgow, under Dr. Dixon; another at Sheffield, 
under Professor Ripper, and Finsbury College in London, were the 
only ones he found. The last named had been started in 1883 on lines 
laid down by Philip Magnus (since made Sir Philip for distinguished 
service in the cause of technical education), and was in excellent con- 
dition. Its largest attendance, however, was in the evening, and it 
was much cramped for room; “class instruction” in tool work was 
quite impossible. 
In Paris there was great zeal for manual training in the lower grade 
schools. Much of the work was, however, premature and not suffi- 
ciently related to drawing. The instruction was largely individual, 
and the results achieved were not very satisfactory. The Rue Tourne- 
fort School, already famous for its excellent management and gen- 
eral character, was exceedingly interesting. The clay modeling was 
worthy of wide imitation. While the drawing of decorative forms is 
essential to a complete course in drawing, its influence in creating a 
love and appreciation of beauty is greatly inferior to that of modeling 
the forms themselves. The natural criticism of the Rue Tournefort 
School was that its curriculum was too exclusively manual—i. e., not 
sufficiently academic (literary and scientific). 
At other schools for older pupils, such as the Apprenticeship School 
for Arts and Trades, and the Trades School on the Boulevard de la 
Villette, tool work of several kinds was carefully taught, though rela- 
tively little attention was paid to drawing and academic work. The 
trades were strictly taught. After a few weeks of general experience 
in the round of shops, every boy was required to select his trade and 
devote himself exclusively to it. The schools turned out considerable 
commercial work. 
In the Netherlands, in Germany, and in Switzerland, he found trades 
taught with the very definite object of fitting young men, and some- 
times young women, to undertake trade work. 
The writer is free to say that while European industrial schools ‘had 
much of suggestion in regard to the capacity of pupils for manual 
work, and of their enduring interest in it, they suggested to him no 
improvement in his methods of instruction, and very little in regard to 
the scope of his work. On the contrary, they exhibited a narrowness 
of purpose and a crudeness of method which ought by all means to be 
avoided. With the exception of some of the primary schools of Paris, 
he saw no pupil in an industrial school who was not there to Jearn a 
trade. The general educational value of manual training for pupils 
who might not become craftsmen was not recognized in any school. 
Such was the state of things in 1885. Great changes have taken 
place in Europe during the past nine years, but it is a historical fact,
-P-A-G-E-943
  MANUAL TRAINING. 895 
which some appear reluctant to admit, that manual training, as we in 
America understand it, was not imported from any country.! 
During the year 1885 the discussion of manual training was general 
throughout the country. Friends and foes were found in every com- 
munity, and though much misconception prevailed, correct notions 
gained ground rapidly. 
On December 16, 1885, by invitation of Governor George D. Robin- 
son, of Massachusetts, the mayor and the superintendent of schools of 
1]¢ is very commonly assumed that manual training came from Germany, but the 
assumption is false. We have learned much from the Germans, and the obligation 
is gratefully acknowledged, but the manual training school did not come from there. 
This the Germans know themselves very well. They shall speak for themselves and 
this decision shall be final. 
Prof. Kuno Franke, of Harvard University, in 1886 wrote as follows in a letter to 
a German paper: 
“Since the days of Rousseau, the effort to educate the rising generation in a more 
harmonious way than is possible in a school which aims only at the acquisition of 
mere scholarship has never been abandoned. The emphasis which the followers of 
Basedow laid upon the gain of useful knowledge; the thought of Pestalozzi, that 
the first step in education consists in the schooling of the will, while mental disci- 
pline must be treated as something secondary; Father Jahn’s gymnastics; Froebel’s 
successful attempt to develop reason through the cultivation of the senses; and, 
finally, the measures which have led to the establishment and growth of the poly tech- 
nie school—all these manifestations are still only symptoms of the one fundamental 
idea, that education must be directed, not to know, but to be able to do; not to 
words, but to deeds. 
“Tt appears to me that nowhere yet has this idea reached such a methodical 
expression as in the Manual-Training School of St. Louis, which, unlike our German 
trade schools (in which only one craft or occupation is taught to artisans), appeals 
to the whole community, and aims at general pedagogical objects.” 
Prof. F, Anton Hubbuch, director of the clockmakers’ school at Furtwangen, 
Baden, Germany, who came to America to visit the World’s Fair in 1893, paid Louis- 
ville a visit for the express purpose of inspecting the means and methods of the 
manual training school in that city. He writes: 
“Tho classes were taking their regular course of study, and I thus had an oppor- 
tunity to gain an insight into the matter and method of instruction. I had already 
become acquainted at the World’s Fair with the existence and character of similar 
institutions, but it remained to a personal visit to the school here to gain for me a 
knowledge of the purpose of such schools. As I myself have for years been at the 
head of a large school for theoretical and practical education, I may be in a position 
to judge of the difficulties with which the founding and conduct of such schools are 
attended. Iam sincerely pleased that Iam able to add an account of this school 
from my own inspection to the account of my travels, and it is my wish to see such 
schools also built in Germany.” 
President Charles De Garmo, whose life in Germany entitles him to speak with 
authority, in the discussion before the National Educational Association in 1886 con- 
tributed a statement which bears upon the question of the origin of manual training. 
He said that for a hundred years German girls had been taught cooking and house- 
work, but that “Germany has no manual training for boys as an element of public 
school education. There are, indeed, a few private eleemosynary institutions (trade 
schools) established for the poor and vicious boys, but none in general.” 
This testimony ought to settle the fact that however much Germany may haye 
_ approved the idea, it has not even yet realized it to any great extent.

896 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
Boston, Gen. Francis A. Walker, Hon. John W. Dickenson, William 
T. Harris, John 8. Clark, and others, Dr. Woodward gaye a publi¢ 
exposition of manual training in Huntington Hall, Boston.! 
The lecture was published in full in the Boston Herald of December 
17.2. Its character and influence may be inferred from the following 
extract from the Herald editorial of December 18: 
MANUAL TRAINING. 
Dr. Woodward’s lecture on manual training, which we presented in a very full 
report yesterday morning, claims more than transient value. It is a notable contri- 
bution to the literature of practical education. The style of the address is excellent,. 
and the matter is entirely worthy of the form. The lecture merits careful study, 
and should receive it from all who take an interest in the training of our youth and 
the joint development of the powers of the mind and hand. 
On the platform Dr. Woodward showed himself the master alike of his subject 
and his audience. By his lucid and eloquent presentation of the method and advan- 
tages of the new system of education he held the attention of the hearers to the 
end. He gave a succinct description of the course of instruction followed under his 
direction at the St. Louis manual training school, and pointed out that intellectual 
education far from being eclipsed, or even overshadowed, is accorded a preponderant 
share in tho system. 
Dr. Woodward meets the objections urged against manual training point by point. 
in doing so he brings out very clearly as the fundamental distinction of the new sys- 
tem, that it aims, not at the production of a high degree of manual skill in a narrow 
field, but at continuous mental discipline. The range of its manual instruction is 
so wide that the stage of mechanical habit is never reached in any of the branches. 
The student never becomes an automaton. ‘‘No blow is struck by him, no line 
drawn, no motion regulated by mechanical habit. This stage is never reached. The 
only habit acquired is that of thinking. The quality of his every act springs from 
the conscious will, accompanied by a definite act of judgment.” It is the object of 
the St. Louis school to turn out, not boys who have been specially trained in one 
mechanical line to the exclusion or, at least, to the neglect of the other lines, but 
evenly trained boys, with a broad foundation of serviceable knowledge, upon which 
they can readily build whatever superstructure of expertness may be required by 
their future career. 
Following the above address there was a banquet given by John 8. 
Clark, esq., of Boston, which was attended by some seventy educators 
from the Eastern and Middle States. In his remarks Dr. Woodward 
gave utterance to the epigram about educating the whole boy. Said 
1The circular announcing Dr. Woodward's lecture said: 
“The subject of manual training is not new in Boston. The idea may be said to 
have originated here; but while we have been discussing it and making experiments 
in a few directions, other communities have gone forward and built large schools, 
and established its practicability and educational value beyond question. The 
citizens of St. Louis took the lead in this matter, and in 1880 a manual training school 
was established under the auspices of Washington University. This school has been 
a great success from its outset. So satisfactory have been its results that manual 
training schools have since been established at Chicago, Baltimore, Toledo, and 
Philadelphia. Much of the success of the St. Louis school is owing to the fact that 
its course of study harmoniously combines intellectual training with the use of tools. 
‘The lecture was published in pamphlet form early in 1886 by the Social Science 
Association of Philadelphia,

he: ‘My educational creed I put into six words: Put the Whole Boy 
to School.” 
The after-dinner speeches of ex-Governor Alexander H. Rice, of 
Boston, and Supt. James McAlister, of Philadelphia, were features of 
the occasion. : 
During 1886 favorable reports were received from all manual training 
schools, including several new ones. Cleveland, Omaha, New Orleans, 
Cincinnati, New Haven, Denver, and many smaller places reported 
cheering progress, and in all quarters there were discussions of the 
educational and the economic value of manual training. The Tulane 
High School of New Orleans was organized by Prof. J. M. Ordway; 
in Omaha manual training was put into the high school by Supt. H. M. 
James; in Cincinnati the movement was started and directed by Mr. 
F. W. Robinson; Supt. 8S. T. Dutton (now of Brookline, Mass.) inaug- 
urated the work in New Haven. 
The council of the National Educational Association, at its meeting 
in Topeka, in July, 1886, discussed the “‘ Pedagogic value of the school 
workshop.” The general attitude was one of inquiry, while two mem- 
bers who had reached the stage of conviction were clearly of the 
opinion that the educational value of the shop was small, and that its 
use should be limited to schools for the training of mechanics. Dr. 
E. E. White doubted the general value of tool instruction. He sug- 
gested that military drill might give better physical results, and stated: 
Three per cent of the working people of the country can produce all the wood- 
work needed. The school workshop can not touch the life work of over 10 per eent 
of the pupils. The manual training school must take its place as complementary to 
the public school—as a special school, like the law school. 
Dr. 8S. H. Peabody did not “ discern such valuable results from hand 
culture as his friends seem to find.” Said he: 
“Tdo not find that the exact construction of a box leads to the exact construc- 
tion of an English sentence, but that mechanical students need as much drill in 
writing as any others. I have not found that the students in mechanical courses. 
were especially good in their mathematical work, etc.” Dr, Peabody argued that, 
“Skill in one tool does not beget skill in the use of another.” (Council proceedings, 
1886, pp. 55-58.) 
The year 1886-87 was characterized by great activity in educational 
centers in behalf of manual training. The industrial associations of 
New York and Philadelphia fostered investigation and discussion and 
published papers and reports. The college for the training of teachers, 
organized in New York, included manual training as a prominent fea- 
ture in its course of instruction. In an address in New Yorkin the 
winter of 1886-87, President Gilman, of Johns Hopkins University, well 
stated the object of the association: 
I think it most advantageous that, just at this epoch, when all over the land there 
are efforts making to introduce manual training, a society has been formed in New 
York to collect the experience of this and other lands, to furnish actual examples of 
classes organized for discipline in handicraft, to build up a library, to provide lec- 
tures, to print reports and papers, and to diffuse in many ways sound ideas.

      898 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
In February, 1886, Dr. John W. Dickenson read a paper in Wash- 
ington, before the superintendents’ section of the National Educational 
Association, on ‘The province of the public school,” -in which he 
weighed the subject of manual training and found it wanting. He 
allowed it very small educational value, being as he thought largely 
imitative and unnecessary in view of the development of laboratory 
methods in science. He considered its economic bearing as beyond the 
proper province of the public school. The schools “must not be con- 
fused and burdened with work of the home, or of society, or of the 
church.” 
Supt. W. B. Powell, of. Washington, and Supt. H. W. Compton, of 
Toledo, showed no sympathy with such views. They announced the 
success of manual training at their homes; they regarded its demand 
by the people as legitimate, and they asserted its eminent educational 
value. 
In the spring of 1887, Dr. Woodward issued a book on the “Aims, 
Methods, and Results of Manual Training” under the title, “The Man- 
ual Training School” (D. C. Heath & Co., Boston.) Mr. Charles H. Ham, 
of Chicago, had already brought out his book on “Manual Training” 
(Harper & Co.), in which, with great force and dramatic power, he had 
set forth the character and mission of manual training as illustrated 
by the Chicago school. 
At the Chicago meeting of the National Educational Association in 
1887, manual training was fully discussed. For the first time, it was 
felt that the vast membership of the association was friendly to the 
movement. Papers were read before the general association by Presi- 
dent Walker, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Miss L. A. 
Fay, of Springfield, Mass., and Dr. Woodward, of St.Louis. General 
Walker pleaded earnestly'and powerfully for manual training for all 
boys and girls above 12 years of age in all urban communities. He 
pointed out the fruitlessness of much that pupils are required to do, and 
the essential one-sidedness of standard methods of training. Said he: 
It is little less than a shame that we should graduate from these (high) schools 
pupils who are highly accomplished in language, composition, and declamation, but 
are less keen in perception, with less of visual accuracy, less of manual dexterity, 
less of the executive faculty than the children of the ordinary ungraded district 
school.* 
1 This paper was not published till March, 1887. 
*Six weeks after the above words were uttered, Wm. Mather, esq., M. P., read a 
paper on manual training before the British Association in Manchester, England, in 
which he said: “It is of secondary importance, after reading and writing have 
been acquired to serve as useful instruments, to pursue systematically the study of 
grammar, language, and literature, analysis of sentences, refinement of composition, 
elegance of expression, and remote historical events. Knowledge of these subjects 
inereases with the pursuit of all other knowledge, and especially in the study of art 
andscience; for exact expression and definition and even grace of language are incul- 
cated by familiarity with the forms of beauty, and the laws of nature and their 
operations.” He emphasized the importance of giving the girls training in needle- 
work and cooking.
-P-A-G-E-947
  
MANUAL TRAINING. 899 
Miss Fay outlined and illustrated a course in drawing and tool work 
for pupils from 9 to 18 years of age. Her references to her own expe- 
rience as a teacher and investigator in tool work were enthusiastically 
received by the audience. 
Dr. Woodward claimed that the proper function of the public school 
was much broader than was shown in the ordinary high school. 
The welfare of the community (which means the welfare of the 
individual members) demands that boys be so trained that they may 
all become intellectual and efficient workers. The training of the 
many, not the culture of the few, should be sought. The manual 
training school is better than the home, far better than the commercial] 
house or shop, far better than a trade school or the street, for the all- 
round education of a boy. He closed thus: 
Let us not fear to build our own house. The age demands a new school. Neither 
Babylon, nor Athens, nor Rome, with their pinnacles of culture resting on the 
barbarous foundation of human slavery, nor the aristocracies of modern times— 
none of these can teach us how to educate, construct, and adorn an American citizen. 
No narrow, selfish aim, no prejudice of caste, no false claim of high culture must 
mislead us. Give all our boys a generous symmetrical training; open wide the 
avenues to success, to usefulness, to happiness, to power, and this age of scientific 
progress and material wealth shall also be an age of high intellectual and moral 
attainment. 
A. long discussion followed, which, with one exception, showed faith 
and a growing appreciation of manual training as a feature of general 
‘education. General Walker closed the discussion by expressing “ his 
profound gratification at the manner in which the teachers of the United 
States had met and treated the subject.” 
The foundation of Pratt Institute in Brooklyn in October, 1887,' was 
an educational event of the first importance. Although this is chiefly 
an art and trade school (as the manual training school is the smallest 
of its departments), yet its pure, broad, educational spirit is admirable 
in every way. This splendid institution is a worthy monument to a 
noble man. 
The years of 1888 and 1889 witnessed the culmination of the contro- 
versy for and against manual training. : 
At the superintendents’ meeting in Washington, February 14 to 16, 
1888, Mr. Charles H. Ham presented a paper advocating the general 
introduction of manual training fnto the public schools. Being a lay- 
man, he did not discuss the practical working of manual traiming in 
the school programme, but devoted himself to showing the shortcom- 
ings of the existing school, and the need of the new element. 
Supt. A. P. Marble, of Worcester, followed by a long essay, defending 
the school from the charge of failure, claiming that the popular demand 
for manual training rested upon a false estimate of what pupils know, 
and of what schools are doing. He said that the demand for manual 
training was “based on a fourfold claim of gymnastics, handieraft, 
  
1 By Charles Pratt, 2 wealthy merchant of New York City. 
 
-P-A-G-E-948
  900 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
educational necessity, and general welfare, this claim having a fatal 
Jack of unity. ‘It is also my opinion,” said he, “that this demand 
does not proceed from those who are most concerned, i. e., the parents 
of. the children.”’! 
He argued that manual training would produce materialism; that its 
introduction would “cost an enormous sum;” and finally, that when 
introduced into existing schools it had failed? 
Superintendent Marble’s conclusion was that ‘manual training 
should not be engrafted at all. It ought to be provided in special 
schools as they are needed and can be afforded.” Dr. Nicholas Murray 
Butler replied that he had seen manual training engrafted with entire 
success. It no longer asked admission as a favor; it demanded it asa 
right. Referring evidently to Mr. Marble’s paper, he declared that 
“the subject is both too pressing and too important to permit us to 
spend time in wandering off to fight duels with windmills or with the 
creatures of anyone’s imagination.” 
Dr. Belfield, of the Chicago manual training school, maintained the 
‘road general value of manual training, and insisted that it was the 
parents and not the teachers who, as a rule, demanded manual train- 
ing. State Supt. M.A. Newell, of Maryland, answered Mr. Mavble’s 
arguments by arguments in kind and equally sharp. 
In Mr. Ham’s closing remarks he said: 
We do not live by literature, but by labor. I bow to no one in my love of the 
beautiful in literature, but I detect greater beauty in greater use. There is to me 
more sentiment in a locomotive or a steamship than there is in the works of Shake- 
speare. George Stephenson is a grander figure in the progress of man than a score 
of the first statesmen of that time. 
These words of an enthusiastic layman, who declared that it was the 
chief purpose of his life to see manual training adopted as the corner 
stone of our educational system, are quoted because, when taken in con- 
nection with his strictures upon the public schools, they were quickly 
caught up as expressive of the whole argument for manual training. 
President Thomas J. Gray, of the Minnesota normal school, quotes 
the above remark of Mr. Ham, and, saying that “no man can carry out 
the absurd claims of the manual training apostles to their legitimate 
conclusions without seeing their utter nonsense,” he proceeds as fol- 
lows, by the aid of ‘‘cold logic,” to draw “legitimate conclusions :” 
The apotheosis of matter is complete. But one thing further is to be said, and 
that is potentially said in the statement given above, viz: Morse or Fulton is a 
grander figure in the progress of man than is Plato or Jesus Christ. The latter 
made neither steamboats nor telegraphs.? He wrought in the world of thought, as     
1Circular of Information, No. 6, 1888, p. 28, Bureau of Education. 
*This particular argument was answered by the writer in Nashville in July, 1889. 
3 There may have been more than one reason why he made ‘neither steamboats 
nor telegraphs,” but it is fair to assume that a carpenter’s son at the age of 30 was 
not altogether a stranger to the axe, the saw, and the hammer. (Supt. Thomas M. 
Balliet, of Springfield, Mass.)

did Plato, but the man who invents a sewing machine is greater than both! For 
shame, intelligent, Christian, American teachers! (School Journal, June 23, 1888.) 
At the meeting of the National Educational Association in San Fran- 
cisco in July, 1888, three papers, all opposed to manual training, were 
read before the general association. The first maintained that manual 
training was unnecessary and of small value, and what little value it 
had was special, not general. The second, that it was immoral, materi- 
alistic, sordid, and in the interest of caste. The third, that it was ridic- 
ulous and absurd. All these papers are published in the proceedings. 
At the same time a splendid exposition of manual work of all grades 
from the kindergarten through the manual training school to the tech- 
nical and art schools was made in San Franciseo. This exposition did 
much to create interest, clear up ideas, and to blunt the edge of criti- 
cism. A prize of $200 was offered for the best exhibit of work by a 
manual training school. The St. Louis school made a very full exhibi- 
tion of its work and, as was evidently expected (for very few Eastern 
schools made exhibits), received the prize. 
At the superintendents’ meeting in Washington, March 6-8, 1889, 
manual training was the chief topic. Its relation to body and mind 
was broadly canvassed. Papers were read in the order named, by 
Prof. C. M. Woodward, Dr. W. T. Harris, Prof. Jerome Allen, of New 
York; Editor George P. Brown, of Illinois; Supt. Edwin P. Seaver, of 
Boston; Lieut. John D. Ford, of Baltimore, and Supt. H. W. Compton, 
of Cleveland. All the addresses were published in full in the proceed- 
ings. Mr. Brown’s paper was in answer to a paper written by Professor 
Woodward and published in The Teacher (Simpson & Co., New York) 
in reply to an article by Dr. Edward Brooks of Philadelphia on the 
“Tntellectual value of manual training.”' Many of these papers were 
widely read, and the public mind was well prepared for the final dis- 
cussion which began at Nashville. 
At the Nashville meeting, in 1889, Supt. A. P. Marble, of Worcester, 
Mass., was president of the national association. It appeared to be 
his wish that the merits of manual training should be fully discussed. 
The council of the committee on pedagogies presented a report on “The 
educational value of manual training,”? which led to a long discussion. 
Professor Woodward spoke to the general association on “The results 
of the St. Louis manual training school.” Dr. Harris followed this by 
a paper on “The intellectual value of tool work,” and another paper on 
“Art education the true industrial education.” Dr. 8, H. Peabody pre- 
sented a paper on the “Value of tool instruction as related to the active 
pursuits in which pupils may subsequently engage.” Dr. E. E. White 
was announced to present a paper on manual training, but for lack of

time he failed to read it, and it was not printed. Supt. Henry A. Wise, of 
Baltimore, read a paper on “Manual training in the primary and gram- 
mar schools;” and before the department for industrial training Prof. J. 
D. Walters, of Kansas, read a paper on “ Ways, means, and maxims in 
manual training.” All the papers read were published in the proceed- 
ings, and the council report was distributed by the Bureau of Education. 
It was evident to all that the management expected to settle the ques- 
tion of the status of manual training at the Nashville meeting. Ina 
certain sense this expectation was realized, for except as regards 
methods, grades, and limits it has not been under discussion in the 
national association since. But the Nashville discussion did not cease 
with adjournment. Its echoes were heard in every community. Every 
report and reference to manual training gave evidence of more or less 
familiarity with the Nashville discussion. 
That discussion is too long to be quoted here. Undoubtedly false 
issues were presented, wild assumptions were made, and much that was 
irrelevant was introduced, but the outcome, “after the smoke and con- 
fusion of battle had cleared away,” was a clear conviction and a united 
purpose. The last word was an elaborate review of the council report, 
written by Professor Woodward for The Teacher and republished in 
pamphlet form by Heath & Co. in May, 1890.1. This review is in sub- 
stance published as Chapter XV of Professor Woodward’s English 
book on manual training, already referred to. 
Meanwhile, reports of experiments and investigations contributed in 
a powerful manner to vindicate the claims made for manual training. 
‘A commission appointed by Governor James A. Beaver, of Pennsyl- 
vania, in May, 1887, made its report in 1889. President George W. 
Atherton, of the State college, was chairman. This report is exceed- 
ingly full and valuable. Every available source of information was 
consulted and results were analyzed and compared. The commis- 
sion recommended the introduction of manual training as a required 
study in every State normal school; State appropriations for such dis- 
triets as may establish manual training in connection with the public 
schools; a law requiring provision for manual training in new school 
buildings; the appointment of a deputy superintendent on manual 
training; and the immediate introduction of manual training into all 
reformatory institutions for youth of both sexes. This report was fol- 
lowed by a recommendation from the State superintendent that manual 
training be put into all high schools in the State. 
Reports from experiments like the following were calculated to allay 
opposition. The school report of the city of Albany, N. Y., for the year 
1889, said: 
Your committee on manual training, in making this their first annual report, con- 
gratulate the board upon the success which has attended shop instruction. This 
department was first opened in February, 1888, making it a required course with the

first and second year pupils, and an optional course with the seniors and juniors. 
But so-great was the interest manifested on the part of the pupils, that all signified 
their desire to attend, and the interest has becn sustained to the present time. 
It was feared at first that the opening of this department might cause a falling off 
in the standing of the pupils in their other studies, but your committee are happy 
to say, after careful inquiry, that the standard of scholarship has been maintained, 
and at the present time our school stands higher than it ever did in the past. 
Manual training is no longer an experiment with us. We have become satisfied 
of its high educational value, and we believe it will remain a fixed element in our 
system. Thus far, we have confined shop work to the high-school boys; next fall 
we shall introduce woodworking, in the sloyd form, among the girls in the high 
school. It has the united support of the entire faculty. 
Finally, came the reports of committees sent out to investigate and 
report on the methods employed in different well-established schools 
and the success attending them. Many such reports were printed, but 
none have met the eyes of the writer more searching in its analysis or 
more discriminating in its discussion of details than that of Supt. 
Edwin P, Seaver, of Boston. As his report! states, he was sent by the 
school committee to visit and inspect the manual training schools of 
St. Louis, Chicago, Toledo, Cleveland, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. 
Mr. Seaver began with St. Louis. He shall tell his own method 
of inspection and his own conclusions in regard to the educational 
value of manual training, just then a matter of interest to every 
educator: $ 
At the time of my visit the school was in full operation. The director bade me 
make myself perfectly at home, question the teachers, question the boys, and make 
my investigation as thorough as was in my power, with all the help they could give. 
I devoted four days to the investigation. The results were a large book, full of 
notes, and a clear impression in my mind of a well-organized and vigorously working 
school. I can not here go into details. Suftice it to say, I used my privilege of 
questioning freely and thoroughly. I followed classes from the schoolrooms into 
the drawing-rooms, and into the shops. I found the boys equally alert and intelli- 
gent in all branches of their work. They were as ready to describe and give the 
reasons for every step in the process of forging a pair of blacksmith’s tongs as they 
were to state and give the reasons for every step in the demonstration of a geomet- 
rical theorem. 
There are those who doubt the educative value of manual training. Let any such 
persons spend a few hours in a good manual training school like this, observing the 
boys at their work and questioning them about it, and if his doubts about the 
educative value of manual training do not vanish it will be because he measures 
educative value by standards not in common use. I should desire him particularly 
to converse with those boys in the machine shop, now drawing near the close of 
their course, and busily at work on their “ projects” for graduation day. Let him 
ask for explanations, question them closely for reasons, observe the quality of their 
work, note their own criticisms and estimates of it, and he must be an unreasonable 
man if he does not admit that somehow their school training has developed in them 
a high degree of intelligence. The result is too striking to be overlooked, analyze 
and account for it as we may. 
Since June, 1890, there has been no opposition to manual training, 
except such as has arisen from differences of opinion as to methods of 
1 Boston School Document No. 15, 1889.

904 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
organization and instruction. Manual training is recognized as an 
essential feature in the education of both boys and girls. While the 
nature and essence of manual training were under discussion, manual 
training schools were multiplying and prospering. Their existence was 
accepted by the public before their right to exist had been established 
in the judgment of those educational critics “‘ who were most competent 
to decide.” 
The people of Philadelphia have been conspicuous in their cordial 
reception and nurture of manual training. In May, 1888, an exhibition 
of industrial work was made, lasting three days. It embraced “all 
kinds of school work that can be represented graphically or objectively, 
viz, manual training, industrial art work, sewing, kindergarten work, 
clay modeling, and manual work of every kind produced in the schools.” 
The expense was met by the Public Education Association. School 
boards throughout the country were invited to send representatives, 
and many did so, presenting reports on their return. President James 
MacAlister (then superintendent) in March, 1890, in a valuable paper 
on manual training in the public schools of Philadelphia, says, in ref- 
erence to that exhibition: 
The committee can not too warmly express its approval of the spirit displayed by 
Philadelphia in this great educational movemént. The exhibition is to be regarded 
as one of the mostimportant events in our school history—important inits immediate 
influence, but vastly more so in its bearing upon the future. The feasibility of a 
general system of co-education of head and hand has been established beyond per- 
adventure, and in presenting with more than usual detail the permanent features of 
the exhibition, the committee have been actuated solely by the desire to place on 
permanent record the part taken by Philadelphia in the inauguration of what must 
be regarded as the most important educational reform of the present time. 
This paper of Superintendent MacAlister is valuable as showing the 
result of four years of experience and observation. He says: 
  In the manual training school the work done by the boys in mathematics, litera- 
ture, and history is, to say the least, in no respect inferior to that of schools of a 
similar grade in which the whole time is occupied with class-room work. 
The processes of manual training afford a better means of cultivating the faculties 
of reason and judgment than many things which now find place in the courses of 
instruction. Measurement, comparisons, the adjustment of means to ends, the coop- 
eration of mind, hand, and eye, all conduce to a broader mental culture than can be 
gotten from many of the studies which at present usurp so large a portion of the 
pupil’s time. * * * What is needed is to bring thought and labor together; to 
make every thinker a worker and every worker a thinker, and there is no place 
where this can be done so well as in the school. 
The success which has attended the manual training school from the first is the 
best guaranty of the soundness of the principles upon which it is organized and 
conducted. Beginning alittle more than four years ago, in a very humble way, it 
has steadily grown in public confidence and approval. It has more than justified 
every claim that was made in its behalf. Every available foot of space is now 
occupied, and it has become impossible to admit all the pupils who apply for 
admission. 
This statement of things led to the establishment of the Eastern 
Manual Training School, so that there are now two large public manual
-P-A-G-E-953
  
MANUAL TRAINING. 905 
training schools in Philadelphia. Both these schools, enlarged during 
the past summer (1894), are full to the maximum. The credit for the 
initiative of the movement in Philadelphia would seem to belong to 
Edward T. Steel, esq., the president of the school board which called 
Mr. MacAlister. President Steel had already seen the workings of 
manual training in St. Louis and Chicago, and he wanted a man in sym- 
pathy with it. He found just what he wanted in James MacAlister. 
In Philadelphia manual training is a very comprehensive term. It 
embraces all the hand work from the kindergartens to the high schools. 
It is exceedingly full in its provisions for the girls in its grammar 
grades. Sewing and cooking are as systematically and as successfully 
taught as arithmetic.' 
Among the more recent developments of manual training—and no 
attempt is here made to mention all that has been done—is the organi- 
zation of the following: The manual training high schools of Louisville, 
Ky.; Providence, R. I.; Chicago, Ill.; Denver, Colo.; Brooklyn, N. Y.; 
Cleveland, Ohio; Menomonie, Wis., and Boston, Mass., the last named 
bearing the name of the Mechanic Art High School. Instances of the 
incorporation of manual training in old high schools are too numerous 
for mention. At the World’s Fair there were exhibits of tool work 
from seventy American manual training schools of grammar or high 
school grade. 
The growth of the Louisville manual training high school is interest- 
ing,-and as that school serves the purpose of a model in many respects, 
a sketch of its history is here given. 
As already stated, President Runkle gave an account of tool instrue- 
tion before EASE Renal rid ventional ecocincite winch met in Louisville 
in1877. In1881 Professor Goss gave a lecture on the course in mechanic 
arts in Purdue University before the school board. Soon after an effort 
was made to organize a manual training course in the male high school, 
but it was defeated by the trades and labor unions of the city under 
the mistaken notion that the aim was to teach trades. 
Tn May, 1886, Professor Woodward, of St. Louis, invited by the Con- 
versation Olub, gave a public lecture on the aims, methods, and results 
of the St. Louis school. His lecture was illustrated by shopwork and 
drawings, the work of the pupils. 
In 1890 the school board took up the matter in earnest and a begin- 
ning was made in the male high school in September of that year. A 
single division of 20 boys was formed and equipped with woodworking 
tools. The boys devoted one hour before the regular session of the 
  
1 Recent Peed from Philadelphia i is i nie ac that in June last 500 boys, 
who had finished the grammar schools, applied for admission to the manual training 
schools. In the examination over 300 made a standing of 70 per cent or above and 
were admitted. The other 200 were rejected. Superintendent Brooks says of these 
200 rejected boys: ‘Some of them returned to the grammar schools, but the majority 
of them probably ceased to go to school.”  
-P-A-G-E-954
906 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
high school to a lesson in drawing and two hours after the regular ses- 
sion to shop practice. 
In spite of the above very unfavorable conditions the experiment 
was declared a success, and in September, 1891, the equipment was 
increased to accommodate 48 boys; 96 boys, however, applied and were 
admitted to the work. The practice time was cut to forty-five minutes 
daily and the shop hour was incorporated into the school programme. 
Efforts were then made to raise by subscription money to build and 
equip an independent manual training school, but all attempts were 
inadequate till Mr. A. V. Du Pont took the matter in hand and proposed 
to give the land, erect the buildings, and equip the school himself. In 
May, 1892, his proposal was accepted by the school board, which bound 
itself to ‘‘maintain in said building a manual training school of the first 
order as a part of the public school system, free to all white boys in the 
city qualified to enter the male high school and not under 13 years 
of age.” It was also agreed that “the teachers and professors in the 
manual department shall in every case be graduates of some reputable 
manual training school.” 
By October, 1892, the unfinished buildings permitted partial use, and 
the school started with 122 students. In May, 1893, the completed 
buildings were dedicated and turned over to the school board. Pro- 
fessor Woodward, of St. Louis, who had been deeply interested in 
the enterprise, delivered the dedicatory address. The teacher of all the 
experimental classes and the principal of the school was Mr. Henry 
F. A. Kleinschmidt, a graduate of the St. Louis school. 
The school is admirably equipped, well managed, and deservedly pop- 
ular. The present enrollment is (October, 1894):

  The floor plans of the school buildings are given later in this report, 
with items of cost. The reader is referred to them as exceedingly 
valuable. 
It is with profound regret and personal sorrow that the writer adds 
to the above brief sketch the fact that just two weeks after the dedica- 
tion, in the midst of an intense feeling of satisfaction at the completion 
of the work and at the spirit shown by the school board and people of 
Louisville, Mr. Du Pont very suddenly died. 
The city of Louisville is to be congratulated on having had such a 
citizen, and he was to be congratulated on having such an opportunity. 
He could have builded no more splendid monument, and he could have 
set no more glorious example. 
_The State of New Jersey has been distinguished for generosity and 
zeal in the cause of manual training. In 1878 Prof. Robert H. Thurs-
-P-A-G-E-955
MANUAL TRAINING. 907 
ton—then of Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken—compiled a 
report on the relation of education to the higher manufactures, reeom- 
mending the establishment of what we now call manual training schools. 
The interest aroused by this report was fostered by the labors of such 
persons as Rev. George C. Houghton, Mrs. Martha B. Stevens, Dr. 
Nicholas Murray Butler, and others. In 1885 the State, through its 
legislature, offered to duplicate any amount between $500 and $5,000 
that a city or town would raise for the establishment and support of 
manual training. Under the stimulus of this action a great many 
beginnings have been made, though as yet no fully equipped manual 
training high school has been organized. Though all reports of progress 
and results appear to be quite satisfactory, it is evident that in many 
instances the amount of legitimate manual training incorporated with 
high school studies is small, and that its position as an integral Daa of 
the school programme is by no means well assured.! 
The latest and most important step in the interest of higher manuai 
training is the action of Massachusetts, under the State board of edu- 
cation, and the, lead of Hon. Frank A. Hill, secretary, in making it 
obligatory upon every city of 25,000 or more inhabitants to establish 
and maintain manual training in a (or in the) public high school. This 
act is already in force, and as a consequence some twenty cities are 
diseussing plans for such schools. In harmony with this step forward 
is the establishment of a new State normal school at Fitchburg, which 
will include a manual training plant. This will serve not only to train 
teachers in the new elements, but will stand as a model equipment for 
all high schools. 
Nowhere has manual training for the grammar grades been more 
thoughtfully and thoroughly studied than in Boston. The school com- 
mittee, under the lead of Hon. Samuel B. Capen and Supt. Edwin P. 
Seaver, have conducted the most searching investigations of existing 
theories and practices, as applied to elementary work in wood, with a 
view to its introduction into the upper grades. A sketch of the work 
done previous to 1893 is given by Chairman Capen in his report for 
1892. “As this is the first year in which cooking and manual training 
can properly be said to have become universal in our grammar schools, 
it seems proper to give a brief outline of their early history.” 
After reciting the unavailing efforts of private individuals in 1881 
and 1882 to get classes of pupils into the North Bennet Industrial 
School, permission was granted by Mr. C. C. Perkins, a member of 
the school committee, to the boys from one school to enter the ‘indus- 
trial school for the instruction of carpentry, printing, and shoemaking,” 
in September, 1883. In March, 1885, permission was given to pupils ib 
attend the industrial school Senet by Mrs. ener A. eo two

hours a week, the girls to have “lessons in cooking, housekeeping, and 
laundry work, and the boys in printing, carpentry, and shoemaking.” 
Two cooking schools were started in 1885, one supported by Mrs. 
Mary Hemenway, the other by Mrs. Shaw and Miss Sarah B. Fay. 
The first school was assumed by the city in 1888 and the second in 
1892. ‘These two kitchens were the first public school kitchens in 
America.” (School Doc. No. 21, 1892, p. 15.) Other cooking schools 
‘were established in 1886 and subsequently, till every grammar school 
was provided for by 1893. 
An apology for a woodworking shop for grammar boys attending 
once a week was started in 1884, and experiments in sloyd were 
started in 1888. Modifications were at once found necessary in the 
adaptation of sloyd methods to American needs and standards, promi- 
nent among which was a satisfactory system of drawing. It thus 
appears that as late as 1888 the Swedish sloyd had “no satisfactory 
system of drawing” in connection with their whittling. 
While experimenting with a modification of the sloyd system arranged 
by Mr. Gustaf Larsson, three other schemes (they can not be called sys- 
tems, for they all aim at the same thing and include almost identical 
methods of instruction, the differences being confined to number, 
sequence, and character of the exercise, very much as different arith- 
,metics employ different examples, different illustrations, and different 
orders of contents) were tested under the most favorable conditions; 
one designed and supervised by Mr. I. M. Leavitt, one by Mr. F. W. 
Kendall, and one by Mr. B. F’. Eddy. 
The comparative value of these schemes is still a matter of investi- 
gation, but there is no question that excellent work is being done in all 
cases, and that the plan ultimately adopted will contain elements 
from all. 
Too much can not be said of the enlightened policy and judicial fair- 
ness of the Boston managers. Teachers of drawing and tool work have 
been stimulated to study their subjects and to test their theories, with 
a view not so much to favor external interests as to arrive at the best. 
Other cities (notably New York and Chicago) have experimented 
with tool work inthe grammar grades, but it seems to the writer that 
no experiments have been so instructive, and on the whole so generally 
successful, as those in the Boston grammar schools. The following testi- 
mony is worthy of permanent preservation. It was written about 
January, 1893, by President Capen, of the Boston school committee: 
In concluding this part of our report we wish to emphasize again the importance 
of this new education which is educating the hand and the eye and the mind together. 
We are beginning to see more and more that thinking begins with things. There are 
some who may still believe that the outlay for shops and for these special teachers 
is unnecessary, and that the whole thing is a caprice of the hour. But the number 
of such is very few, and they show that they have given the matter but superficial 
thought. The little time that it has been tested in our schools has already shown 
its value. Nothing else has such power to soften, refine, and humanize rude girls
-P-A-G-E-957
MANUAL TRAINING. 909 
and boys, to lead them to respect others, and to bring out those qualities which will 
Jead them in turn to be respected. In the early spring of this year a class of boys 
was brought for the first time into one of our shops. They were from homes in one 
of the worst sections of our city, and for a lesson or two seemed almost ungovern- 
able. But in less than three months these rude boys became so fascinated with their 
work that, compelled to be left largely to themselves one day on account of the illness 
of a teacher, they excited the admiration and comment of some educators who unex- 
pectedly called because of their ceaseless attention to the work in hand. These few 
weeks had changed the wild boys of the street into those that were courteous and 
respectful and eager for advancement. Its value as a disciplinary as well as an edu- 
cational force has not been overestimated. 
The question may naturally be asked, “‘ What has the city of St. Louis, 
the home of the pioneer manual training school, done in the matter of 
manual training.” The answer is, unfortunately, “Nothing.”! But 
this “nothing” is not in consequence of public indifference, but because 
of lack of money. The money for the support of St. Louis public 
schools comes partly from the State, but chiefly from a 4-mill tax on 
the assessed value of property in the city. At present value the 
income is barely sufficient for the needs of the schools as now organized. 
All manual training is more or less expensive, requiring additional 
equipments, rooms, and teachers, and the school board may neither 
runin debt nor increase the rate of taxation, except by securing the 
authority from a “majority of the taxpayers” of the city, an appeal 
which no school board has recently made. This explanation is due 
both to the school board and to the people of the city, than whom no 
community could be more generally in favor of manual training. 
Undoubtedly the managers of the public schools will ere long find a 
satisfactory way out of the difficulty. 
In view of the general acceptance of manual training as a necessary 
feature of education, and the general need of exact information in 
regard to methods of organization and forms of equipment, it is thought 
best to insert an extract from an essay upon organization, read by the 
present writer at Bethlehem before the American Institution of Instrue- 
tion, in July, 1891. 
THE ORGANIZATION OF MANUAL TRAINING SCHOOLS. 
Should manual training be introduced into existing high schools in a distinet 
course of study, or should separate schools be organized to be known as manual 
training high schools? 
The answer to this question should be based on a full consideration of the con- 
stituency to be counted on, or the probable demand for manual training, and, sec- 
ondly, on the chances for successful management. 
I, THE CONSTITUENCY. 
While claiming that manual training should to a certain extent enter into the 
education of every boy and girl, and claiming also that no assumption should be 
made as to the future careers of pupils in manual training schools, it is evident that 
' The St. Louis manual training school is one of the subordinate departments of 
Washington University, and is not a free school, though it distributes annually a 
large number of free, or partly free, ‘‘ scholarships.” 
   
-P-A-G-E-958
  910 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
a manual training school is sharply distinguished from a classical high school and 
from a commercial high school, by its clear recognition of the demands of industrial 
occupations. There is of course much common ground in the three kinds of school, 
but only their distinguishing traits are now referred to. I am willing to admit that 
the popular demand for manual training arises from a conscious desire on the part 
of parents and children for an education which shall in a direct and evident manner 
prepare for the duties and responsibilities of life. The existence of this desire 
proves nothing as to the destined career of particular people. A large majority of 
our active workers are engaged in manual occupations, such as agriculture, manu- 
facture, construction, and transportation; and it is only reasonable to suppose that 
a school which fairly represents the people will contribute workers to carry on such 
work, even though they greatly improve its quality and widen its scope. 
The belief that there is a school education which, while very general in character, 
bears in the industrial direction as no former education bore, and that it is capable 
of giving higher intellectual standing to industrial workers, as well as tending to 
their social and financial suecess, is what gives strength to the manual training 
movement in every community. 
There is no question but as a rule those who for any reason look forward to indus- 
trial life, and who see no manual training school open for them, withdraw from 
school before the high school is reached. This is emphatically true of boys. Hence 
the great majority of boys of high school age are not at school. The census tables 
show that between 7 and 8 per cent of the population of a city consists of boys and 
girls in their fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth years. 
Suppose a city has 100,000 people; there are then about 7,500 young people of 
high school age. Not one-tenth of them are in the high school, and from two-thirds 
to four-fifths of them are not at school anywhere. These unschooled youth are not 
all stupid, nor vicious, nor poverty-stricken. Fully one-third, if not one-half, of 
them are so constituted and so situated that they would attend a manual training 
high school if one were open to them. When, last January (1891), I urged the mayor 
and school committee of Boston to establish an independent school for manual train- 
ing, I told them that they would have 1,000 boys applying within three years, with- 
out sensibly interfering with the attendance at the Latin school or at the English 
high. . 
The experience of Philadelphia is suggestive. Its first manual training high school 
was crowded for some years and applicants were turned away. A second school of 
the same kind was established over a year ago. 
You will find the same conditions in every city. It is a new idea that there is an 
education which precedes industrial life as appropriately as there is one which pre- 
cedes mercantile life or the professional school. Until recently it was taken for 
granted that it took no great amount of brains to be a skilled mechanic, and that an 
education was largely wasted on one so long as he remained a mechanic. It was 
formerly assumed that a skilled worker in the materials of construction need not be 
a draftsman, nor a mathematician, nor a chemist, nor a physicist, nor a master of 
English. It is now known that every one of these things helps, not only to make 
one more respected and more influential as a eitizen and a man, but to be a better 
and more successful mechanic. E 
This idea is having immense influence among the people in favor of more education 
and what they consider more appropriate education. A second idea is that intel- 
lectual vigor and practical power over men and things are the fruit of more than one 
course of study. Already it is seen that the graduate of a manual training school 
has many advantages, when compared with those whose edueation has neglected 
either hand culture or brain culture. 
Hence, without further excursion in this fruitful field, I conclude that there is in 
every city an abundance of good material, backed by a wide demand, for a high 
school in which the manual elements shall be essential features entering into the 
course of study of every pupil.
-P-A-G-E-959
MANUAL TRAINING. orf 
Il, AN INDEPENDENT SCHOOL WITH A FULL CURRICULUM. 
I wish now to show that it is better to establish independent schools, in the place 
of enlarging and extending those already existing. 
This is a question of policy worthy of serious consideration. Usage has not been 
uniform, In Baltimore, Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston, and Providence they have 
complete and independent manual training schools.! If to these we add schools 
really organized for general education but not under public management, I should 
mention those of Chicago, Cincinnati, San Francisco, New Orleans, and St. Louis; 
the high school of Pratt Institute; the Miller School of Crozet, Va.; Drexel Institute; 
Girard College, and the Lick Mechanical School of San Francisco. 
The great majority like those of Toledo, Cambridge, Springfield (Mass.), Minne- 
apolis, St. Paul, Omaha, New York, Davenport, Fall River (Mass.), Menominee (Wis.), 
Indianapolis, Albany, and the cities of New Jersey, have incorporated manual train- 
ing courses of greater or less extent into existing schools. This latter course was the 
natural one, so long as the value and popularity of manual training was uncertain. 
Assuming then that a city has decided to furnish to its youth of high school age 
opportunity for manual training, what are the specific reasons against an incorpora- 
tion with the existing high school and in favor of an independent organization? 
Some of the following arguments will have far less force ten years hence than they 
have to-day. 
(1) All the traditions of the existing high school are opposed to manual training. 
The manual elements did not enter into the education of the teachers, and it is per- 
fectly natural that they should lightly valuea training they have never had them- 
selves, which they have never felt the need of, and which as they think has no place 
in a liberal education. All high school teachers do not feel thus, but many of them, 
perhaps a majority of them, do. 
We have no right to complain of these teachers. If they have the courage of their 
convictions, they will speak out and they will belittle the manual features. We 
must give them time; wisdom and judgment are matters of growth, and none of us 
stand now where we stood ten years ago. But meanwhile if we would give the new 
ideas a fair chance for healthy,‘vigorous growth, we must plant them in a new field 
aloof from the blighting winds of a contemptuous scorn and the clouds of a haughty 
indifference. 
(2) The old programmesare all against manual training, One principal says: ‘Iam 
in favor of manual training, but every pupil must have his five recitations first. 
The boys who wish to have manual training can take it after school.” Another 
principal insists upon four recitations, or perhaps only three, but they must follow 
the old order and the manual features are always to be secondary; they are the first 
to be cut off and omitted on special occasions. In some schools a failure in mathe- 
matics or history debars one from the day’s exercise in shop, and so on. In some 
cases principals refuse to admit one’s standing in shop and drawing as elements 
of scholarship in awarding class honors. The standards which ordinary high school 
pupils must reach if they are to go into higher education fail to recognize manual 
training beyond a possible requirement of a feeble amount of geometrical drawing. 
This neglect has a tendency to depreciate manual training in the minds of students. 
These evils do not exist in all schools, nor do all of them exist in any school, but 
they are far too common and they affect manual training pupils unfavorably. 
(3) Even when the disposition of teachers and the arrangement of the programmes 
is all that one could ask, the manual training sections of a general high school are 
exposed inevitably to unfavorable influences. The full manual training school pro- 
gramme covers more hours per day than the ordinary academic programme—at least 
it ought, even ifit doesnot. The result is that every day manual training students 
are exposed to peculiar trials and temptations. When other students take their

traps and march out of school for a hot dinner at home or an hour's recreation, the 
manual student must keep on an hour longer at his mathematics, science, literature, 
drawing, or shop. Of course, if he is zealous and high minded, he can stand the 
daily trial (or, rather, it is no trial to him), but the contrast is, in general, unfavor- 
able, and it works against the success of the manual course. In the independent 
school all the pupils have the same extent of programme and all are dismissed at the 
same time, It matters not if a different hour of dismissal obtains at another school; 
in this school there is uniformity and the pupils think nothing about it. 
(4) There is a concentration of interest in a school where there is a single course 
of study. Boston is wise in differentiating its high schools. The classical school 
is by itself. The interests of all its pupils are centered upon Latin, Greek, and 
» mathematics. The pupils have a common interest, and their conversation out of 
hours is on subjects common to all. There is no tendency to reopen questions of 
choice. The enthusiasm of one fires the enthusiasm of all his associates, for their 
studies are the same. 
In a school with a variety of courses the case is very different. The zeal of one is 
very apt to quench the ardor of another, for it is in a different field. Boys are prone 
to think other studies more interesting, or more profitable, or easier than they find 
theirs. This daily association of students in different courses of study is demoral- 
izing. Hence, I say, if your community is large enough to admit of it, let your 
high-school work be differentiated into different schools, not on a geographical 
basis, but according to their curricula. 
(5) There is another reason for the independent organization of the manual train- 
ing school, which I base, not on observation, but on my knowledge of human nature. 
When manual training is made a sort of annex to the high school, and not 
incorporated as a coordinate and integral part of it, there is a divided responsibility 
in the care and education of a certain number of pupils. 
Many of our most valnable high school principals feel unable to assume charge of 
the manual features, and would prefer to leave the care of such entirely to a super- 
intendent. Hence, during certain hours pupils are under the direction of one 
person; during other hours, under another. Any ynusual demand (and there are 
always a good many such demands) trenches on somebody’s time and the off hours 
are a common battle ground. 
All the advanced drawing, geometry, mechanics, physics, and chemistry should be 
clearly correlated with the shop work to secure the best results, and hence I think 
the pupils should be as homogeneous as possible, and they should all be under the 
direction of one head. 
Ihave thus given five good reasons for a separate organization. A reason for the 
opposite course would exist in the matter of cost, provided the manual work was 
relatively small and the students were gathered from different grades. I am not 
thinking of such scattered divisions, nor of classes made up almost entirely of vol- 
unteers from classes already in high schools. Neither am I planning for those 
students who are engaged in fitting for classical colleges, and who can spare time 
for a single shop exercise per week. If possible, let such students have a shop in 
their own high school. I have in mind a school of several hundred pupils of both 
sexes, who are to have an exercise in tool work or drawing, or in both, every school 
day. When these attend in fair proportion, there will be found to be no essential 
difference in cost between the two methods of organization. I therefore advise that 
the city manual training school be an independent institution, standing on its own 
ample lot of ground and under its own principal and corps of teachers, 
    THE CURRICULUM. 
The curriculum of the manual training school has undergon2 very 
few changes since the first one was published in St. Louis in 1880. In 
all independent manual training schools the length of courses is three 
 
-P-A-G-E-961
  MANUAL TRAINING. 913 
years. The daily programme contains six periods, each period being 
either fifty or sixty minutes. Each pupil has mathematics one period, 
science one period, language or literature one period, drawing one 
period, and shop two periods. Working sections contain from 20 to 25 
pupils, who are taught as a unit, each section having its own order for 
the day. Most schools offer French and German, as may be elected, 
and some offer Latin. All prepare pupils for admission into colleges and 
technical schools not requiring a preliminary knowledge of Latin and 
Greek. All aim to give a thorough laboratory training in chemistry 
and physics, and require constant study of literature and practice in 
English composition. Some have good facilities for the study of biol- 
ogy. In all, the tool work embraces:— 
Woodwork.—Joinery, turning, wood carving or parquetry, and pat- 
tern making. 
Plastics.—Molding, casting or modeling. 
Hot-metal work.— Forging, tempering, soldering, and brazing. 
Oold-metal work.—Bench and machine cutting, fitting and finishing 
of iron, steel, and brass; the thorough study of elementary forms, and 
project work. 
The method of instruction employed in the shops varies doubtless 
in different schools, but it probably varies less than do the methods of 
teaching Latin or physics. The following excellent statement of the 
equipment for woodwork, and the method of instruction, is taken from 
the prospectus of the Manual Training High School of Povidence, R. I. 
DEPARTMENT OF WOODWORK. 
CARPENTRY. 
Equipment.—The arrangement of benches in this shop admits of class work for 
twenty-four students at each period. The benches are constructed so as to give to 
the student his individual cutting tools, while the general locker is supplied with 
such tools as fall to the use of the mechanic and which require no grinding or care- 
ful preparation. These are used in common by all the divisions receiving instruc- 
tion. In the former complement are the plane; smoothing, jack, and fore; the firmer 
chisels, 4, 4,%,linch. The bits, ;, 4, 2 inch, occupy a drawer above the student’s 
locker, in which is kept apron and unfinished work. The latter complement includes 
a 12-inch steel square, try-square, bevel hammer, mallet, block plane, rule, crosseut, 
slitting, and back saws, gauge, winding sticks, dividers, bit brace, knife, nail set, - 
and pencil. All edge tools are sharpened for use when the student enters upon the 
course, and he receives early instruction in the proper care and use of them. 
Course.—As projected, there are twenty-four graded exercises, calculated to bring 
about the use of all the tools and the methods in vogue in general carpentry, and 
requiring five one-hour-and-a-half periods a week for the half year of the junior 
year. Commencing with the use of the gauge, bevel, try square, and knife on one-half- 
inch stock, the exercises pass in orderly sequence and value through planing, sawing, 
boring, squaring, chamfering, gauging, tenoning, mortising (single and double), 
halving, mitering, dovetailing, plowing, jointing, and gluing to the final pieces, 
which combine nearly all of the processes of the term’s work. Completing these, 
the class begins some project in joinery, from original drawings made outside the 
department. As some students show a marked aptitude and facility over their fel-

914 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
lows, and, as it is imperative that the class be kept as a unit in its progress from 
piece to piece, numerous supplementary exercises have been devised, embodying dif-- 
ferent forms of the simple principles previously worked out, so that all can be kept 
at work and practically together. The methods of instruction and practice are 
essentially those of the Russian-American system. 
Similar careful analysis runs through all the other work with differ- 
ent tools and on different materials. The matter to be especially noted 
is the educational air of it all and the utter absence of the commercial 
spirit. 
Shop exercises should always be made from drawings. During the 
first half year these drawings should be made by the students them- 
selves, during their drawing hours, under the direction of their drawing 
teacher. The cooperation of shop and drawing teachers is necessary. 
Later the pupils may use blue prints. 
A MODEL PROSPECTUS. 
Having now brought our history down to the year 1894, the writer 
takes pleasure in presenting the greater portion of a prospectus issued 
by the school authorities of Brooklyn, N. Y., on January 31, 1894. 
This document, which is one of the latest, is also one of the best 
announcements of a high-grade manual training school. Its strong, 
clear statements show better than anything else can the substantial 
realization of the hopes and plans which underlay the establishment of 
the St. Louis manual training school fifteen years ago. 
PROSPECTUS. 
We are pleased to announce that a manual training school is about to be opened 
under the direction of the board of education in the building on the vorner of 
Court and Livingston streets, formerly occupied by the boys’ high school. The 
building has been thoroughly repaired and refitted, and is being furnished with 
apparatus, machinery, laboratories, etc., second to that of no other manual training 
school in the country. A corps of competent instructors has been obtained, all of 
whom are men of experience and specialists in their respective departments. 
The school will be opened for registration February 99 and will receive as students 
male graduates of the city grammar schools or others of like scholastic attainments 
from other schools. Class work will begin February 12. A copy of the course of 
studies is appended to this communication. It is in most respects similar to the 
courses pursued in the famous manual training schools of St. Louis, Philadelphia, 
Boston, and other cities. 
It will be noticed that one period each day will be devoted to drawing, the 
design being that each student shall work in clay, woods, and metals, only from 
working drawings prepared by himself. He will thus have the opportunity of 
becoming an accomplished draftsman as well as an expert in the use of all the 
leading tools. Although two periods a day will be devoted to shopwork, the design 
is not to teach a trade or trades, but to teach the elementary principles that under- 
lie all trades, and to teach the use of all the more important tools. The course in 
the mathematical and physical sciences will be closely correlated with the shop- 
work, so that the scientific basis of all mechanical construction will be clearly 
apprehended. Physics and chemistry, as well as the wood and metal work, will be 
taught by the laboratory method—that is, by experimental work performed by the
-P-A-G-E-963
  MANUAL TRAINING. 915 
student himself. In order that the student may be properly prepared for citizen- 
ship, he will devote one period per day to composition, literature, history, and 
civics. The result of these combined courses will be that at the end of three years 
any boy of average intelligence will not only understand the use of tools, and the 
practically important parts of physics and chemistry, and be an accomplished 
draftsman, but he will be able to manufacture what he has designed on paper, 
to understand a steam engine or an electric-light plant, and to operate or to build 
either with his own hands.' In short, the school will be a thoroughly equipped 
scientific school of high school grade, the object of which will be to train every 
power of the mind and body; to educate the mind to high ideals, as well as to 
make the hand quick and skillful. 
Experience has proved that a manual training school gives mental and moral train- 
ing not given by the purely literary high school, because it gives an opportunity of 
illustrating principles by practice and of supplementing abstract thought by con- 
crete expression; that it trains the student to investigate, measure, compare, and 
invent; that it cultivates habits of accurate observation and close attention, together 
with neatness, order, perseverance, and patience; that it enforces logical thinking 
and concentration of thought, and trains the executive powers; that it educates the 
senses as to form and color, and cultivates good taste; and that it develops the 
physique, increases respect for manual work and manual workers, and produces 
manual dexterity, so that a person is better fitted for any trade or occupation he may 
choose. 
Manual training opens up a wide field of occupation in after life. The choice of 
boys now leaving our public schools is practically limited either to commercial avo- 
cations—those of clerks, salesmen, and the like—or to a college course in preparation 
for one of the learned professions. The manual training school is the open door not 
only to those occupations, but also to every art or trade where the cultured mind, 
the trained eye, the deft hand, and an educated taste are required. 
While the school will give the student the best possible training outside a uni- 
versity for the work of practical, everyday life, it will at tho same time give the 
best possible preparation for the great technical schools. 
The course of study, on following page, is furnished by Principal Bradley: 
' Of course this does not mean that the boy is a mechanical or an electrical engi- 
neer, but that under proper conditions he can at once intelligently participate in 
constructive work.—(Editor. ) e

BUILDINGS AND FLOOR PLANS FOR MANUAL TRAINING SCHOOLS. 
The plans given below are those of the Boston Mechanic Arts High 
School, the Denver Manual Training School, and the Louisville Manual 
Training High School. There may be plans superior to all these, but 
it has not been the privilege of the writer to examine them. 
Great progress has been made in the arrangement of rooms and equip- 
ment since the first manual! training school was erected in St. Louis in 
1879. This was to have been expected. No one could tell, without 
experience, the best way to teach, the best outfit for a shop, the best 
method of distributing power, the proper number and location of lava- 
tories, the necessary amount of light, or the disturbing effect of shop 
noises and vibrations. Doubtless there is still much to be learned in 
regard to these matters, but it will be profitable to report the progress 
already made. 
Accordingly, the floor plans of three recently constructed manual 
training schools are given in connection with perspectives of the 
buildings. Each has been planned after careful examinations and 
mature deliberation. In some cases the shape and size of the lots have 
had marked influence in determining the plan. In one case—that of 
the Louisville school—no such limitation was imposed, and in its gen- 
eral features it appears to the writer to be superior to all others. 
THE MECHANIC ARTS HIGH SCHOOL OF BOSTON. 
This building is shown by three plates. It is thus described in the 
official report: 
The building is three stories in height, 224 feet long by 90 feet wide. The base- 
ment, besides containing the boiler rooms, etc., will be provided with several hun- 
dred lockers to contain the regular clothing of the boys when they are in their 
working costume. There will be on the first and second floors several class rooms, 
each to accommodate 72 pupils, in three sections of 24 each; a machine shop, with 
engine, lathes, planers, etc.; a blacksmith shop, with 25 forges and anvils; a mold- 
ing shop; a carpenter shop; a finishing room; a wood-turning room; a chemical 
laboratory, and a reading room and library. In the third story there will be a large 
room to be used both as a gymnasium and assembly hall. The building will be able 
to accommodate from 300 to 350 pupils, and it is believed that it will be the most 
complete building of its kind in the country. 
The school was opened in September, 1893. The lavatories are not 
shown on the drawings, but they have been so provided in the different 
shops that “the boys are not compelled to leave the rooms to wash.” 
Mr. Charles W. Parmenter, the principal, writes: 
It must be remembered that the present structure is Sniy the main portion of the 
original project. The wing which is to contain the physical and chemical labora- 
tories, the library, and the principal’s office, is not yet built. The building ‘n its 
present form is in no senseamodel. The separation of the rooms in which machinery 
will run from the rest of the building by heavy, double, brick partitions on either 
side of a stairway, we think to be an admirable feature. The mill construction 
adopted throughout is objectionable, on account of the ease with which sound is 
transmitted from story to story.

THE MANUAL TRAINING HIGH SCHOOL OF DENVER. 
This building, which is shown in five cuts, is for both sexes. At 
present writing (November, 1894) that portion containing the library, 
offices, and auditorium is not built; the rest of the building has been 
in use since September, 1893. The following descriptions and data are 
from the architect, Mr. Robert 8. Rauchlaub, of Denver. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE MANUAL TRAINING HIGH SCHOOL OF DENVER. 
This building is constructed of stone, pressed brick, and iron. 
The dimensions of the school building proper (including the unfinished wing) are 
139 by 125 feet, three stories in height, with basement; and the shops are 117 by 86 
feet, two stories high, except the forge room, which is but one story in height. 
Although the school and shops are one continuous building, they have independent 
walls, joining, with a 2-inch space between to prevent the jar of machinery from 
being transmitted to the school building, and the passageway from one building to 
the other is protected against fire; communication is by iron sliding doors. 
The shop buildings are constructed of glass and iron mainly to give ample light. 
The building is heated and ventilated by steam and fansystem. Two 72-inch fans, 
taking fresh air through a tempering chamber, drive it through a steam coil contain- 
ing 5,500 square feet of heating surface; thence through ducts beneath the basement 
floors to the rooms. A subduct conveys cool air to the rooms, the two currents 
being mixed to proper temperature at the base of the rising ducts or flues by means 
of the Johnson automatic heat regulating device, while the vitiated air is driven 
out through flues leading to the top of the building 
The basement.—In the basement of the school building are arranged the boys’ and 
girls’ lavatories and closets; the janitor’s quarters, comprising 5 rooms; the pupils’ 
Junch room, 55 by 62 feet; bicycle rooms; janitor’s closets, etc. Under the shops 
are the boiler room, 42 by 32 feet; coal bin, shaving chute, waste and scrap chute, 
fan room, engine room, 44 by 32 feet, and cold-air entrance duct. 
The dining room is 55 by 62 feet, well lighted, fitted up with kitchen conveniences, 
and is furnished with neat tables and chairs. 
The upper floors.—On the upper floors, opening from the main halls, are 8 class 
rooms, each about 36 by 29 feet, fitted up with slate tablets on two sides of the room 
and giving place for 54 desks. 
Over the assembly hall are [to be] two drawing-rooms, one 36 by 62 feet and the 
other 33 by 62 feet, having both side and sky lights. The free-hand drawing-room 
is fitted up with screens and easels, and the mechanical drawing-room with 25 oak 
drawing tables. Each table accommodates two pupils at a time; each pupil has a 
separate compartment for two drawing boards and paper, and a drawer for inks and 
instruments. As each table is provided with 12 such compartments and drawers, 
the 25 tables accommodate 6 classes of 50 pupils each, or 300 students, each one

The chemical laboratory is [to be] 37 by 52 feet, furnished with cupboard tables con - 
taining 60sinks and 60 lecture chairs. Adjoining are the professor’s private laboratory 
and hooded sinks. The sewing room is [to be] 48 by 44 feet, furnished with cutting 
tables, supply closets, drawers, lockers for 25 pupils, fitting screens, and sewing tables. 
The shops and their furnishings.—The machine shop is 60 by 32 feet, and will 
contain the usual iron-working machinery. The tool room is fitted up with bench, 
lathe, special tool racks, supply rack, ete. The molding room is 37 by 32 feet, 
fitted up with 25 molding bins, a small cupola and core oven. The forge room is 
54 by 35 fect, fitted up with 25 Buffalo forges and one brick instructor’s forge, with 
hand bellows. Adjoining are the coal and cinder bins. The arrangement of the 
forges is such as to bring each pupil under the instructor’s eye. 
The pattern shop is 60 by 32 feet, fitted up with 24 carpenter benches, 25 lathes, 2 
grindstones, 1 hand saw, and separate bench and lathe for the instructor, Cup- 
boards are provided for supplies and the work turned out by the pupils. The power 
in this shop is derived from a dynamo. 
‘The carpenter shop is 52 by 32 feet, fitted up with 26 benches, besides the instructor’s 
bench. Each bench is provided with an adjustable and removable carving table. 
Each of these shops is provided with special tool cupboards, and storage cupboards 
having sliding doors or sereens. At the instructor’s benches are forms for the 
accommodation of the class of 25 pupils. 
The workbench is of oak, and accommodates two pupils. It contains six drawers 
for small tools and work and racks for larger tools. 
Over a portion of the forge room is the lumber room, with drying kiln. It contains 
a buzz saw and universal woodworker. 
The cooking class is not yet organized and the cooking room is being used tempo- 
rarily as a mechanical drawing-room, the furniture of which cost $1,219. The phys- 
ical laboratory furniture, exclusive of chairs, cost $448. The chemical laboratory 
class is not yet formed, and this room is temporarily used by the sewing class, for 
which the furniture cost $121. 
As may be seen by the plans, basement, shops, and in fact every part of the house 
is thoroughly lighted. 
The forge room has about 1,650 square feet of glass in the windows, the room 
being 19 feet high. The machine and pattern shops are 16 feet high, and contain 
about 1,150 square feet of glass. 
Two interior views of pupils at work are given. One shows a class 
watching a teacher showing the proper use of a tool at a wood lathe, and 
the benches provided for the class. The absorbing interest exhibited by 
the boys is characteristic of every day’s experience, no matter how old 
the school may be. The second shows a shop remarkably well lighted. 
The cost of this splendid building, entire, when finished, exclusive of furniture 
and including sidewalks, copings, etc., is estimated at $143,442. The actual cost 
of the parts completed was $85,442. 
The cost of certain shop furniture was as follows:

926 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
THE MANUAL TRAINING HIGH SCHOOL OF LOUISVILLE, KY. 
The buildings of this school are shown in the cuts. The general 
arrangement is in accord with an outline suggested by the writer. The 
details, however, were worked out by Mr. Kleinschmidt, the principal. 
The characteristics of the plan are four in number, viz: 
(1) The shops are put in a separate building, sufficiently removed to 
avoid disturbing the class rooms by noise or vibration. 
(2) The shops are still very accessible by means of a covered walk 
at the ground floor, and an inclosed bridge from the second floor, which 
leads to a landing between the second and third floors of the shops. 
The inclosed bridge is finished like the schoolrooms and is kept com- 
| fortably warm in cold weather; in fact, it forms part of the wardrobe 
of the school. 
| (3) Every shop has in immediate connection with it a lavatory, so 
that boys have no occasion during shop hours to pass beyond the 
immediate care of the shop teacher. 
(4) All the machinery of the shops is driven by electric motors, so 
that every shop is independent of every other shop; its machinery can 
be at rest or in motion without in any way affecting the others. The 
practical convenience of this independence is very great. If the elec- 
tric motors were supported by overhead hangers, so as to be beyond 
ordinary reach and to occupy no floor space, the arrangement would 
be perfect. 
Each of the shops is 45 feet square with an offset 14 by 25 feet, in 
which the instructor gathers his class on movable benches when he 
gives the class general instruction. All the shops are admirably 
lighted and furnished. Each can receive three divisions of 24 pupils 
every day. Each of the woodworking shops has both benches and 
lathes. A 10-horsepower motor drives the 25 lathes (1 being exclu- 
sively the teacher’s lathe) and the grindstones. 
The forging shop is well lighted and conveniently arranged. 'Cem- 
porary benches half surround the instructor’s forge and anvil, so that 
the class can sit comfortably in a position to see and hear all that the 
teacher does and says, as he illustrates a new process or expounds 
anew principle. The arrangement of forges is such that the smoke 
ducts are readily united at the exhaust fan near the chimney. Twenty- 
five open coal fires in one room suggest an atmosphere laden with gas 
and soot to an intolerable degree, and yet a fan easily creates such a 
= draft that with proper air inlets from the hall (or windows in mild 
weather) the air in the shop is reasonably pure. One improvement is, 
however, necessary in this Louisville shop—viz, the fan should be 
inclosed behind brick walls in a sort of closet, so that its noise may not 
be heard to any great extent in the shop.! 
! The evil may be remedied easily, and possibly before this account is in print thi 
fan may be inclosed.

The provision for housing the janitor and family is important, as the 
large amount of valuable hand tools in the building renders it necessary 
to have some person always there at night and during the vacation 
period. 
Speaking of his building plans, after two years of use, Mr. Klein- 
schmidt says he would make a single change in the shop, viz: He 
would omit the door leading from the forging shop to the engine house, 
making it a window instead. In the front building, however, he would 
: make several changes; in particular, he would use less space for halls 
on the first floor and enlarge the rooms for mathematics. 
The following items of cost will be highly appreciated :

The value of the land is not included. The buildings are planned to 
accommodate 300 boys. The equipment of the machine shop alone 
cost $8,500. 
COST PER PUPIL PER YEAR. 
No practical question is more important than that of cost. Accord- 
ingly, below are given the figures from 5 schools. The reader must 
bear in mind that in this connection cost includes the running expenses 
of the entire school—literature, science, mathematics, drawing, and shop 
work; the maintenance of tools, supplies of materials, chemicals, appa- 
ratus, fuel, repairs, salaries, wages, water, gas, ete.—everything but 
insurance and large additions to the plant or equipment. To find the 
cost per pupil per year the total expense has been divided by the total 
        enrollment.

THE FRUITS OF MANUAL TRAINING. 
Nothing better illustrates a course of training than high-minded men, 
efficient workers, good citizens, good leaders, and good followers, who 
as pupils enjoyed its advantages. The Honorable Comuissioner of 
Education requests that this sketch be followed by as complete a record 
as can be given of the career of the graduates of the St. Louis Manual 
Training School. Those graduates already number some 550, and the 
oldest class, that of 1883, has been in active life eleven years. Such 
persons have had time to show the peculiar influence of their training, 
if such influence exists. 
Accordingly, the classes are given below in full. In all cases the | 
latest authentic information is given. A brief summary will be given 
at the end of the lists. Most of the young men can be reached by let- 
ter, if one wishes either to confirm the record or to get the mature 
opinions of graduates. : 
The writer well knows the danger of overestimating the value of these 
records. He knows that the causes of success and failure in the careers 
of young men are very complex, and the effects of heredity and envi- 
ronment are easily confused with the influence of schooling. At the 
same time, it is evident to all that we must and do judge schools and 
systems by the men they turn out. 
The writer leaves conclusions to the reader; he adds only a caution, 
that if these records are to be compared with the records of other 
schools, some allowance should be made for those who attended the 
schools in either case but failed to graduate, For example, take 1,000 
boys who entered the Philadelphia Manual Training Schools and another 
1,000 boys who entered the literary high school of that city and see 
what has become of them. The fact that they did or did not complete 
the course of the school is an important element in the general result 
and should by no means be neglected. If five out of ten boys gradu- 
ate in one case and only one out of ten in the other, a comparison of 
the graduates alone is evidently inadequate. With this caution, the 
lists are submitted.

CHAPTER VI. 
UNIVERSITY EXTENSION.! 
The university extension movement has spread very rapidly. It was first intro- 
duced into this country in its present form in 1890 by the Philadelphia Society for 
the Extension of University Teaching. Now the movement extends from Maine to 
California and from Minnesota to Texas. It has met with varying success in differ- 
ent communities. Tho Northwestern University, at Evanstown, Ill, reports that 
after trying the work for three years it has finally beenabandoned. In Wyoming the 
State University has offered courses of lectures, but during the year 1893-94 there 
was no call for them. Tho same is true in other parts of the country. The institu- 
tions seem to be more ready to provide courses of lectures than the people are to 
take advantage of them. In some parts of the country the large towns are not 
plentiful, and the expenses of a lecturer on a circuit where the centers are so far 
apart are too great. 
In other parts of the country the extension movement is growing very rapidly. 
Some of the agencies that are doing the most work in this line are the American 
Society for the Extension of University Teaching, University of Chicago, University 
of Wisconsin, University of the State of New York, Rutgers College, and University 
of Kansas. The courses offered and delivered, togattier with reports of the work in 
various sections so far as reported to this Bureau, are given in the following pages: 
University of California, Berkeley, Cal.—With a view to the extension of the advan- 
tages of the university to teachers and other persons whose engagements will not 
permit residence at the university, courses of instruction are offered from time to 
time in San Francisco and in other places. Persons who offer to do systematic work 
in the extension courses, and to take examinations in them, are enrolled as attend- 
ants upon extension courses. Attendants who pass satisfactory examinations are 
entitled to receive, from the university, certificates of record of the work done, which 
may be accredited to them, upon their scholarship records, if they subsequently 
become students of the university. Visitors may be admitted to extension courses 
at the discretion of the professors in charge. During the year 1893-94 the following 
courses were given: In San Francisco: The logic of mathematics: Geometry, 9 lec- 
tures; algebra, 9 lectures; introduction to political economy, 9 lectures; poets and 
dramatists of the eighteenth century, 9 lectures; the Epistles of Horace: Trans- 
lation and exegesis, 9 exercises; poets of the nineteenth century, 9 lectures. In Los 
Angeles: The development of English comedy, 6 lectures. In Sacramento: Economics 
of industry, 9 lectures; the development of English comedy, 6 lectures. In San 
José: Napoleon and his epoch, 6 lectures. In Ventura: Causes of the present social 
unrest, 3 lectures. 
Leland Stanford Junior University, Stanford University, Cal.—The organization of 
university extension societies is not undertaken by the university, but its professors 
are, in general, prepared to respond to any demand for courses of lectures not con- 
flicting with university duties. They are also willing, whenever occasion arises, to 
undertake work in teachers’ institutes, and to take part in lecture courses in neigh- 
boring towns. In addition to a large number of single lectures delivered in the

One course of 5 lectures on money was delivered at St. Joseph, Mo., with an 
attendance of 135. 
Rutgers College, New Brunswick, N. J.—The following account of university exten- 
sion work in New Jersey was furnished by Dr. Austin Scott, president of Rutgers 
College: 
“Tn the autumn of 1891 the trustees of Rutgers College established a special 
department for the prosecution of university extension teaching. It was thought 
appropriate that the New Jersey State College for the Benefit of Agriculture and 
the Mechanic Arts should carry forward the purposes of its foundation by means 
promising a peculiar opportunity for usefulness. 
“(As a field for such work New Jersey seemed to promise the best results. The 
State is compact, and it is covered with a railroad network whose meshes are so fine 
that no point in the State is 10 miles from a railroad. 
“There has been no attempt to make a definite coordination of the extension work 
with the college curriculum. It may be said, however, that our extension course of 
12 lectures with the accompanying class work, the preparation of papers, and the 
final examination is a full average equivalent of the work done in college during a 
thirteen weeks’ term of the junior year, in the same subject with recitations three 
hours a week. e 
“During the winter of 1891-92 courses were given in four different counties at 
the following centers: New Brunswick, Freehold, Somerville, East Millstone, and 
Paterson. The subjects chosen were all of them such as are within the particular 
sphere of the State agricultural colleges, namely: Agriculture, astronomy, botany, 
chemistry, and electricity. It was especially gratifying that during this first experi- 
mental year the subject of agriculture should have been chosen for scientific study 
in Freehold, the center of a prosperous farming region. And the fact that over 100 
farmers attended this course proved that it was quite desirable to make the attempt 
to apply the methods of university extension particularly to agricultural teaching. 
“These courses consisted each of 12 lecture-studies, and all the recognized features 
of the extension courses were insisted upon, including class-hour, written exer- 
cises, etc. 
“ The attendance at the lectures varied from 30 at the course that was least attended 
to 215, the largest audience of that year. The total maximum attendance at these
-P-A-G-E-1015
    
UNIVERSITY EXTENSION: 957 
7 courses was 686. For the class hour more than 50 per cent on the average 
remained. And of these about 20 per cent submitted to the final examinations, to 
whom 62 certificates were granted (19 ‘honor’ certificates, 43 ordinary certificates). 
“The experience of this year showed that it would be wise to offer not only 
courses of 12 lectures each, but shorter courses as well. And in order to be able to 
do this without impairing the quality of the work it was determined to give courses 
of 6 lectures, but to designate these as half-courses, and to grant upon their com- 
pletion not a certificate, but only a pass card, which could be exchanged for « cer- 
tificate upon the completion of a second half-course in the same or an allied subject. 
This was particularly necessary among farmers, who could with difficulty be held 
together for so long a course as one extending over twelve weeks. The distances 
from which they had to come made attendance in the winter a matter of some diffi- 
culty, and the regularity became far greater when for them the shorter course was 
adopted. S 
“During the year 1892-93 nine courses were given, following the same lines as 
those laid down the first year, excepting that a course in architecture was given in 
the city of Newark. These courses were given in six different counties, at the fol- 
lowing places: Jersey City, Moorestown, Keyport, South Orange, Paterson, Kearney, 
Newark, and New Brunswick; and in the following subjects: Agriculture, archi- 
tecture, astronomy, botany, chemistry, and electricity. 
“The attendance showed a marked increase; the largest attendance in any course 
reaching 256, and the lowest being 36. The total maximum attendance at all the 
courses was 1,311. More than 50 per cent remained for class hours, but the numbers 
taking the examination showed a slight decrease. Fifty-one certificates were 
issued. 
“‘During this year two courses were given in agriculture and the promise in this 
field seems so great that it was determined to make it a separate division of the uni- 
versity extension work, and in its interest to set a lower price than for the other 
courses. For the courses in agriculture, therefore, it was determined to charge a 
fixed rate of $10 a lecture. 
“The work of the third year was accordingly separated into two parts: First, the 
general work, which included courses in electricity, English literature, art, astron- 
omy, chemistry, history, and one course on the use of iron and steel in civil engineer- 
ing. The courses were given in New Brunswick, Newark, and South Orange, and 
the attendance ranged from 293 to 18. In recognition of successful examination 
passed upon this work 27 certificates and 14 pass cards were granted. 
“The second division of the work of 1893-94 was the instruction in branches of 
agricultural science. The uudiences at these courses consisted almost exclusively of 
farmers, and ranged from 114 to 27. Centers of work were established in five differ- 
ent counties, in the following widely separated places: Moorestown, Mullica Hill, 
Red Bank, Freehold, Newton, and Haddonfield. 
“Our work has been undertaken on a little different plan from that of the other 
early attempts to introduce university extension in this country. First, it has been 
taken up as a part of the duty owing to the State by the State agricultural college. 
“Secondly, the especial applicability of the method of university extension to 
agricultural instruction constitutes a very valuable feature, as we think, of our 
work. 
“Thirdly, we do not recognize in work for a certificate a lower unit than the long 
course of twelve lectures; and our six-lecture half-courses are constructed with the 
idea of a subsequent course of six lectures completing the same subject. 
“Asa matter that may be of interest, there is appended a tabular statement of 
the various courses thus far given, with attendance, etc.”

  960 “EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
University Hxtension in Ohio, by Prof. Willis Boughton, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio.— 
In the past fifty years Ohio has furnished the nation with more than her quota of 
distinguished public men. Were anyone to ask the secret of this fruitfulness he 
would not go far astray who would simply point to her 34 colleges and universities. 
She has not one too many; not an ambitious young person need go a great distance 
in order to reach the doors of a good collegiate institution. With her many colleges, 
however, not a State can point to a harder-working corps of college men than Ohio 
has. Her institutions are full and their professors are worked to the utmost of 
human endurance. Little time can be found for the organization of university exten- 
sion courses. 
In order to keep abreast of the times in this work, the Ohio colleges have organized 
what is known as the Ohio Society for the Extension of University Teaching. Fif- 
teen colleges are members of this league, as follows: Ohio University (Athens), 
Kenyon College (Gambier), Wittenberg College (Springfield), Denison University 
(Granville), Marietta College (Marietta), Oberlin College (Oberlin), Ohio Wesleyan 
University (Delaware), Otterbein University (Westerville), Buchtel College (Akron), 
Antioch College (Yellow Springs), Ohio State University (Columbus), Hiram Col- 
lege (Hiram), Baldwin University (Berea), Miami University (Oxford), and Heidel- 
berg University (Tiffin). The official board of this society is at present (May 10, 
1894), as follows: President, Dr. Charles W. Super, president Ohio University; vice- 
president, Prof. C. B. Austin, Ohio Wesleyan University; secretary, Prof. James 
Chalmers, Ohio State University; and treasurer, Dr. J. E. Stubbs, president Baldwin 
University. The Ohiosociety is an incorporated body, under the control of a board of 
eight trustees, consisting of Governor William McKinley, G. C. F. Southworth, John L. 
Zimmerman, Rey. Washington Gladden, Senator C. S. Brice, Commissioner O. T. 
Corson, William Bowler, D. 8. Gray,and E. M. Thresher. The society has for its 
objects the organizations of centers and the concentration of energy. 
While every college represented in the above league stands ready with two or 
more extension lecturers to serve any community that may call them to the work, the 
regular professors are too burdened with college affairs to spend any time in organ- 
izing local centers. The work that the Ohio society, then, recognizes as its special 
field is that of the organization of local centers in every part of the State. To do 
this requires money as well as State recognition. In the past two years the energy of 
the society has been spent in vain efforts to secure such assistance from the legisla- | 
ture as will enable it to place an organizing secretary in the field. Not long ago a 
bill was introduced creating the office of State director of university extension, and 
asking for an annual appropriation of $2,500. In spite of the efforts of the friends of 
the movement, however, the bill failed to become alaw. Yet ground was gained. All 
that is necessary is persistent, continuous effort; the end will be achieved as soon as 
our legislators become educated up to the proper degree of appreciation of the work. 
Some of the individual colleges, however, have been active in advancing university 
extension in the State. The Ohio University has a few good workers. President 
Super has been president of the Ohio Society since its organization. He is an earnest 
friend of the movement. Prof. J. P. Gordy early in the year delivered a double course 
of lectures at Lima; six lectures being on the ‘‘History of Political Parties in the 
United States,” and six on ‘Psychology as Applied to Teaching.” He has given 
shorter courses at various other points in the State. Prof. William Hoover, who is 
director of the mathematical work at Chautauqua, has been busily engaged all the 
winter in correspondence work. He is employed by both Chicago University and 
Chautauqua. He is in correspondence with over forty students of mathematics, the 
most of his letters coming from Massachusetts, New York, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, 
Wisconsin, and Iowa. Having the work systematized so that it can be done with 
the least waste of time, he can attend to a host of pupils. He reports that the results 
are very satisfactory, some of his students being thus led to take college courses.

UNIVERSITY EXTENSION. 961 
Antioch College is an active university extension center, because it has in its 
faculty Prof. G. A. Hubbell. While several of the members of the faculty are ready 
to do this work, he has organized one or more centers and has delivered several 
courses of lectures on ‘“‘American Literature.” After a course of lectures has been 
completed, if there are any who choose to carry the work further, special classes 
are organized and regular recitations are held. Antioch College is also doing some 
correspondence work. 
The Ohio State University is centrally located, and can easily reach the most flour- 
ishing portions of the State. Her faculty has attended all the calls that have come 
for extension lectures. Prof. James Chalmers, the secretary of the Ohio Society, 
has been active as a lecturer and as an organizer. One of the most successful courses 
was that of thirteen lectures at Circleville. One of these was by ex-President Scott 
on ‘Mind and Body,” two by Professor Thomas on ‘‘Electricity,” four by Prof. G. 
F, Wright (Oberlin) on ‘Man and the Glacial Period,” and four. by Professor 
Chalmers on “English Literature.” Prof. G. W. Knight gave a course on “ History 
at Washington,” and several other courses were planned. 
The University of Cincinnati, though not a member of the Ohio Society, has been 
more active in university extension than any other institution in the State. System 
and thoroughness are characteristics of the work there. It is the belief of the dean, 
Dr. W. O. Sproull, that the primary object of the movement is education, pure and 
simple. He seems to have little sympathy with the cries for popularizing the lectures 
and class work until the educational feature is endangered. It was assumed that 
many who were anxious for university extension were not prepared for work of a 
college grade. To meet the necessities of students, courses of ‘‘ Introductory Work” 
were offered. Classes in Latin, Greek, and mathematics were formed at the Hughes 
High School. Every course was made to consist of thirty exercises. In order to 
accommodate teachers these classes were held on Saturdays. An idea of the success 
may be gained by noting that 51 persons almost immediately enrolled in one or more 
of these classes. Such was the preparatory work. At the university, classes of a 
collegiate grade were held. This, too, was day work. Every Saturday at 8.30 the 
classes began to assemble, and every hour of the day wasoccupied. The laboratories 
and the library were opened, and the extension students were given the use of all the 
college apparatus. ‘To make the classes successful, it was announced that no course 
would be conducted unless at least 15 persons should register for it. Every course 
was to consist of 30 weekly exercises, a fee of $10 dollars being charged for a full 
course. According to this method, classes were organized in ancient and modern 
languages, in science, in history, and in mathematics. The success of the system is 
attested by the fact that a total of 258 students were enrolled. 
One feature of the work in Cincinnati ought to be outlined in full because of its 
novelty. This was a course of weekly lectures on the ‘ Bible and Biblical Sub- 
jects,” delivered on Saturday mornings at 10.30. The intention seems to have been 
to make the course a comparative study of the Bible. Lecturers were therefore 
chosen from every sect and denomination, as follows: ‘The Ethics of Moses,” by 
Rey. I. M. Wise, D. D., president of Hebrew Union College; ‘Old Testament and 
New Testament Canons,” by Prof. M. 8. Terry, Ph. D.; ‘‘The Transmission of the 
Bible,” by Rev. C. W. Rishell, Ph. D.; ‘The Revised Version,” by Prof. W. W. 
Davies, Ph. D., professor of Hebrew, Ohio Wesleyan University; ‘“‘ Discovery and 
Decipherment of the Monuments,” by Prof. I. M. Price, associate professor of 
Semitic languages and literature, University of Chicago; “‘Egypt in the Days of 
Abraham, Joseph, and Moses,” by Prof. J. R. Lampey, D. D., professor of Old Testa- 
ment literature, Baptist Theological Seminary, Louisville, Ky.; ‘Monumental Tradi- 
tions and Genesis I to XI,” by Prof. I. M. Price; ‘‘The Bible as Literature,” by 
Rev. George A. Thayer, D. D.; ‘“‘Some Traits of the Hebrew Prophets,” by Prof. 
Edwin Cone Bissell, D. D., professor of Old Testament literature and exegesis, 
McCormick Seminary, Chicago; ‘‘The Messianic Idea in Prophecy,” by Rey. T. W.

While statistics of the work in other parts of the State are not at hand, it is 
probable that some courses not mentioned above have been delivered. The spirit 
of the movement is abroad in our State. The newness and glamour have worn off, 
yet the past year’s work has exceeded that of any previous season. When we have 
a State organizer we hope to do much more than we can at present. 
Glancing over the work of the past year, it is evident that the institutions for 
higher education in Ohio might be doing much more than they are. The University 
of Cincinnati has done nobly, Its work has been of an educational character, and 
has.been graded; but it has mistaken ove of the most vital functions of university 
extension. It has overlooked the fact that the object of the movement is to carry 
university learning out to the people and out to all people. Its students are stil 
compelled to come to the university buildings for instruction, and to come on Satur- 
day. Only those who will in some way find an opportunity for self-improvement 
can take advantage of this work. Except teachers, few mature persons can spend 
even Saturday in this way. The clerk, the mechanic, the business man, the seam- 
stress, can attend to self-improvement only when business hours are over. Mechan- 
ics’ Institute of Cincinnati would not flourish were not its instruction given in 
the evening. The University of Cincinnati might reach many deserving people if 
it could organize local centers in various parts of the city and in the suburbs and 
there hold evening sessions. 
What the University of Cincinnati is doing, Western Reserve and the Ohio State 
universities might be doing for their cities. Both are located in large cities. The 
same amount of energy expended in organization would produce like results. There 
might at both places be held Saturday classes; but both could with little labor 
organize several flourishing local centers, that might be instrumental in molding 
society and in awakening the youth to the advantages of an education. 
Most of the other institutions of the State are located in the rural portions. Satur- 
day classes would be impracticable. The work must be done in well-organized 
local centers. Every town of 1,000 population is able to support at least one 
course. every season. Such a course would awaken a rural community to new life. 
Ohio is full of thrifty towns. All university extension needs is organization. If 
every college had an organizer, each instructor would be forced to do all the exten. 
sion work that he could do. But organizers are scarce, and all colleges can not afford 
to employ a man for that work. Thus arises the call for the Ohio Society. 
The immediate work of the State Society would seem to be to place an organizer 
in the field. Two years have been spent in vain attempts to secure State aid. Just 
as the American Society raised a guaranty fund to insure its life for five years, so 
the Ohio Society ought to act. The State of Ohio is wealthy enough. There are 
wealthy citizens who are loyal. A guaranty fund ought to be raised that would 
permit the society to place one or two men in the field to organize, and thus to call 
out the college men. The society can not afford to remain inactive until another 
legislature convenes. Two years of valuable time will thus be lost. A guaranty 
fund should be raised and an organizer placed in the field at once. Then from her 
score and a half of colleges Ohio shall be transmitting the greatest blessings to the 
greatest number of her citizens, 
University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio.—During the year 1893-94 instruction 
was given in six subjects, with a total attendance of 257. 
For the year 1894-95 the courses announced below will be offered. They are open 
to all persons competent to engage in the work, but are intended especially for those 
of some maturity. As arule, they include the most essential features of the corre- 
sponding university courses. They are given on Saturdays, at the university build- 
ing, when the libraries, collections, and other facilities of the institution will be 
placed at the service of the classes. The fee for each course of 10 or 12 exercises is 
$4; of 20 exercises, $7; of 30 exercises, $10.

The second session of the university extension summer meeting! of the American 
Society, which took place last month (July, 1894) was a gratify: ing success in ney

every particular, The registration of students in the meeting reached 330, of which 
number 195 attended the courses in the five departments of literature, scienco and 
art, mathematics, pedagogy, history and civics, and economics and sociology; and 
135 took the courses in the department of music, in which we include the students 
in the summer music¢ school held in connection with the summer meeting. With the 
exception of music, the attendance was somewhat equally divided among the various 
departments, the number following the lectures in economics being greatest. The 
total number of lectures given during the four weeks of the meeting amounted to 
504. The corps of lecturers numbered 64. The courses offered in the second session 
were much greater in number and variety than those of tho first summer meeting in 
1893, as one may learn from the fact that there were enough lectures in each of the 
six departments of tho meeting just closed to take up the entire time of the students 
during the four weeks. The department which attracted most attention was the one 
given up to economics and sociology. The lecturers represented the most advanced 
scientific thought in the United States, and the success of their courses was very 
marked. Among the students following them a large proportion was made up of 
college professors and instructors and graduate students in these branches. The 
lectures were intended mostly for teachers, and the well-filled notebooks which the 
students carried away with them testify to the substantial and instructive nature of 
the lectures. Another feature of the meeting deserves special mention, namely, the 
lectures and conferences upon the best methods of teaching and study. Great atten- 
tion was given this subject, in every department lectures being given by teachers of 
long and varied experience, greatly to the profit of the great number of teachers 
present. 
Brown University, Providence, R.I., offers courses of 10 lectures, each on the fol- 
lowing subjects: Botany; the Shakespearian drama; the novel—Shakespeare, Words-

On aecount of the World’s Fair Congress, in which many of those connected with 
the school took part, it was decided not to hold a session in the summer of 1893. 
Third Session (1894, Prof, Felix Adler, Dean).—This last summer the school had a 
faculty of 25 lecturers, besides the 5 who spoke on Sunday afternoons, and altogether 
101 lectures were given. 
The apprehension felt by some that the attendance might be smaller than usual, 
on account of the general business depression, was immediately dispelled upon the 
opening of the school, 
The inaugural exercises on the evening of July 12 drew a full house. The enroll- 
ment of students from different parts of the country, consisting chiefly of clergy- 
men of various denominations, college instructors, teachers, and post-graduates was 
much larger than at any previous session. 
The lectures began Thursday, July 12, in the new high-school building, recently 
erected at a great cost to the town, which is well lighted and ventilated, and admira- 
bly fitted for the summer meetings of the school. With the exception of the Educa- 
tional Week, all the lectures were held in the morning, the attendance at the 
different courses varying from about fifty to one hundred and fifty. The Sunday 
afternoon lectures invariably drew an audience of several hundred. 
Not only in attendance, but in the unity of the programme, and in the sustained 
interest with which the various courses in the different departments were followed, 
this session was a marked. advance over those of previous years. The general sub- 
ject in each department was the labor question, which was treated from various 
points of view by a large corps of able lecturers, including some of the foremost 
political economists of our leading colleges-and universities, and other distinguished 
scholars. Two important lectures were given which were not on the regular pro- 
gramme. One was by. the secretary of the late royal commission on labor, Mr. 
Geoffrey Drage, who visited the school, and by special invitation gave a valuable and 
interesting impromptu account of the aims, methods, and results of the Royal Labor 
Commission. The other unexpected feature was an able address by Prof. J. Estlin 
Carpenter, of New Manchester College, Cambridge, England, on ‘‘The Ethies of 
Buddhism,” and its bearings upon some of our present problems. 
Special mention should be made of the conference of educators on the relation of 
education to ethics and sociology, which drew together many prominent educators. 
On account of the interest awakened it has been decided to give educational sub-

jects a permanent place in the programme of the School of Applied Ethies. An 
editorial in the Educational Review of October, upon the educational conference of 
last summer, says: 
“Nothing could have afforded a better illustration of the great interest thinking 
people now so universally take in the study of educational questions than the sue- 
cess of these mectings. . . . . The audience increased in size from session to 
session, and the evening discussions which followed the lectures were animated. 
The importance ot a careful consideration of the relations of the school 
to ethical, social, and industrial questions by such audiences as assemble at the 
Summer School of Ethics, and the practical value of bringing these considerations 
home to professional and nonprofessional minds alike, are not likely to be over- 
estimated.” 
The lectures of the recent session were more widely and fully reported than in 
previous years. The Associated Press gave regular reports, for the first time, and 
the Boston Evening Transcript had a special correspondent, who gave excellent 
daily reports of two, three, and four columns. The Springfield Republican also 
published comprehensive weekly reports by a special correspondent. Valuable 
accounts of the work of the school have appeared in the Congregationalist, Journal 
of Education, and other papers. In an editorial on ‘Summer Schools” the Congre- 
gationalist says: 
“Especially significant is the interest taken in the great social and economic ques- 
tions so vitally connected with the life of the people. The Plymouth School of 
Ethics is a conspicuous illustration, where able men have discussed with profound 
study of historical and of present conditions, apart from all political or sectarian 
bias, the historical relations between church and state, the growth of labor organ- 
izations and their relation to the Government, socialism and its practical working, 
and kindred topics, which concern the happiness and usefulness of every citizen. 
Schools like this must tend to attract large numbers, while reports of their doings 
will be widely read. Work of this sort gives added confidence in the ultimate 
success of democratic government.” 
Rev. Wm. H. Johnson, of Cambridgeport, Mass., wrote to the Conservator as 
follows: ‘It would be difficult, I think, to overestimate the influence which this 
school is exerting on the development of thought among us. Inspiring teachers, 
lecturers, and preachers, it is making itself felt most widely and helpfully.”

The interest of those in attendance at the last session was shown by the formation 
of an “Auxiliary Society of the School of Applied Ethics,” with the special object 
of making the school and its work more widely known and to further its interests 
in other ways. The membership fee was fixed at $5 a year. Permanent officers 
were elected and over fifty members were at once enrolled. Anyone may join the 
Auxiliary Society, and it is suggested that all persons interested in the work of the 
school should enroll themselves as members. Members of the Auxiliary Society will 
be credited with the amount of the membership fee on the tuition of the next regu- 
lar session, either for themselves or others whom they may designate. 
The secretary and treasurer of the Auxiliary Society is Rey. Paul R. Frothingham, 
New Bedford, Mass.

THEOLOGICAL SEMINARIES. 
An examination of the tables shows that the Presbyterians have a larger number 
of theological seminaries and of theological students than any other denomination— 
1,375 students out of the whole number, 7,658, or 17.9 per cent. But they are divided 
among several independent bodies. The Roman Catholics have 1,250 students, or 
16.3 per cent of the whole number; the Baptists, 1,101, or 14.4 per cent; the Luther- 
ans, 938, or 12.2 per cent; the Methodists, 924, or 12.1 per cent; Congregational, 626, 
or 8.2 per cent; Protestant Episcopal, 444, or 5.8 per cent; Disciples of Christ and 
Christians, 366, or 4.8 per cent, and other denominations 634, or 8.3 per cent. 
As regards endowments, the Presbyterian seminaries are especially prosperous. 
Omitting Omaha Seminary (of comparatively recent establishment) and one or two 
missionary institutions, all of the others have good endowments. With 167 profes- 
sors, they have endowment funds aggregating $6,372,618, nearly $40,000 to each pro- 
fessor. Union Seminary, at New York, and Princeton Seminary, have endowments 
of nearly $100,000 to each professor. The Protestant Episcopal and Congregational 
schools are also heavily endowed, about $35,000 to each professor. 
It is noticeable that notwithstanding the large number of members in the Southern 
Baptist churches (1,280,066), they have only one theological seminary, that at Louis- 
ville, Ky. The Methodist Episcopal Church, South, with 1,209,976 members, has 
only one theological seminary, that at Vanderbilt University, Tennessee. 
A scarcity of seminaries, however, has not prevented these denominations from 
enjoying a vigorous and active growth. It should be mentioned here, however, that 
many theological students from the Southern States attend Northern seminaries, just 
as do medical and collegiate students. It is worthy of note, too, that the Southern 
Baptist Theological Seminary at Louisville has a larger number of students than 
any other seminary in the United States, 268. Only five other seminaries had over 
200 students, namely, Chicago Theological Seminary, McCormick Theological Semi- 
nary, Princeton Seminary, Seminary of St. Francis of Sales, Wisconsin, and Semi- 
nary of St. Sulpice, Baltimore, Md.

    976 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94, 
AN EDUCATED MINISTRY. 
To determine relatively the education of the ministry of the different denomina- 
tions, it would be very erroneous to compare the whole number of theological 
students in one denomination with the whole number of some other. If one denomi- 
nation has only half as many members as another, the number of its theological 
students should also be only half as large, if the ministerial education and minis- 
terial supply be proportionately equal in the two denominations. The Baptists 
have 1,101 theological students, while the Congregationalists have only 626, but it 
should not be concluded that the Baptist ministry is therefore better educated than 
the Congregational, for there are about seven times as many Baptists in the United 
States as there are Congregationalists. 
If we consider the number of members in the Congregational Church, we find that 
they have a larger number of theological students relatively than any other denomi- 
nation, and consequently we would expect them to have the best-educated ministry. 
For every 10,000 members in the Congregational Church there are over 12 theological 
students. The Presbyterians rank second, with 11 students for every 10,000 members; 
the Episcopalians third, with 8 students, followed closely by the Lutherans. In the 
Catholic Church there are not quite 2 theological students to 10,000 members; in the 
Methodist Church a fraction over 2, and in the Baptist not quite 3. The above 
figures show more conclusively than anything else that some modifying circum- 
stances must be taken into consideration. For instance, it is well known that the 
Catholic priesthood are usually well educated, although the diagram would indicate 
differently. Again, the ministerial supply may be much greater proportionally in 
one denomination than in another. 
COLLEGIATE TRAINING OF THEOLOGICAL STUDENTS. 
There is little doubt that taken as a whole a larger number of theological students 
have received a collegiate training than any other class of professional students. In 
the forms sent out to professional schools the question was asked, how many students 
had received the degree A. B. or B.S. The replies from theological schools were far 
more satisfactory than from any of the others. Of the 147 theological schools all 
answered the question except 43. Quite a number of the larger seminaries publish 
this information in their annual catalogues, giving name and residence of each stu- 
dent, the college he attended, and year of graduation, if a graduate. 
In the theological schools which answered this question there were 4,699 students, 
and of these 2,185 had received the degree A. B. or B.S. It is probable that this is 
a fair and correct representation of the number in theological schools. Nearly one- 
half of the theological students are, therefore, graduates of colleges (46.5 per gent). 
On account of the defective returns in regard to this item from the other classes 
of schools, it has been found impossible to compare the percentage of college grad- 
uates among theological students with those in law, medicine, etc. Of the 67 law 
‘ schools no information was received from 25 schools having 3,129 students, and in 
some cases where tke question was answered it was evidently incorrect. Judging 
from the returns received, only about 20 per cent of law students are college gradu- 
ates. The information from medical schools was evidently so imperfect that no 
attempt was made to tabulate the answers. 
WOMEN IN THEOLOGICAL SEMINARIES. 
There are in the United States 147 distinct theological schools and departments of 
universities giving theological training, the students until recent years being young _ 
men in almost if not entirely all of them. But while woman has been making her 
way into so many new spheres of activity, and has been looking around for still other 
fields to conquer, her eyes have rested on the umbrageous walks in the theological 
   
-P-A-G-E-1035
  PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION. : 977 
domain, where the vocation of enlisting men and women on the side of sobriety and 
godliness, and of pointing out to them the duty and advantages thereof, is held to 
be of such worth to mankind as to compensate for free education and a maintenance 
while receiving it. While she has been granted admission to many colleges and 
universities, she was not to be appeased by any annex to a theological school. As 
so many women are going out as missionaries to China, Japan, Egypt, and other 
countries, they desire some training in theological studies in order to accomplish a 
full measure of success. Where can they receive this training so well as in a theo- 
logical school? For such reasons we find the names of women occurring quite fre- 
quently in some theological catalogues. Tufts College Divinity School had 4 women 
enrolled in 1893-94, Hartford Theological Seminary had 10, and at Newton Theo- 
logical Institution there were 6 preparing for foreign missions. 
BENEFACTIONS. 
The Chicago Theological Seminary of the Congregational Church was the recipi- 
-ent of the largest benefaction during the year, $470,642. Of this amount, $180,000 
was contributed by Dr. D. K. Pearsons. 
The Lutheran Seminary, at Gettysburg, Pa., received $38,710. ‘The real estate of 
the institution, consisting of a seminary building and three professors’ houses, with 
some 20 acres of ground, is valued at $75,000. The general endowment fund amounts 
to $110,820, and the scholarship endowment to $15,146. The library numbers over 
11,000 volumes. The board of directors have taken steps for the enlargement and 
strengthening of the institution. As the beginning of this, a new building is in 
process of erection, mainly for lecture and recitation rooms, chapel, and library, the 
cost of which is in part provided for by a bequest of $22,000 from the late Matthew 
Eichelberger, of Gettysburg. The old building is to be remodeled and renovated.” 
The Episcopal Theological Seminary, at Sewanee, Tenn., received $48,000. ‘The 
generous bequest of Mrs. M. D. Tustin as a memorial to her husband, Dr. J. P. Tustin, 
amounts to the endowment of a professorship, In addition, the gift by a prominent 
Northern churchman of $20,000, the interest of which is to be expended primarily 
upon the material fabric of the department, provides the means for adding many 
much-needed improvements, as steam heating, water supply, etc.” 
Mr. J. A. Alexander, of Woodford County, Ky., deeded to the Louisville Presby- 
terian Theological Seminary property in Chicago valued at not less than $100,000.

DEGREE 
  FROM THEOLOGICAL SCHOOLS. 
In 1893 the Bureau of Education received an inquiry from a professor ina theolog- 
ical school as to what seminaries conferred a degree upon students completing the 
theological course and whether it was given by diploma. These questions were 
placed in the forms sent out to theological seminaries and the answers tabulated. 
(See tables of theological schools in another part of this volume.) 
Of the 147 theological schools, a little more than one-third (51) replied that they 
gave a degree to students completing the course and 71 replied that they did not. 
Of the latter a few gave a simple certificate of completion of the course. Twenty- 
five did not answer the inquiry at all. All of those answering affirmatively gave 
the degree B. D. (bachelor of divinity) except 5 which gave S. T. B. (bachelor of 
sacred theology). 
Of the 51 schools giving a degree upon completion of the course, 42 gave it by 
diploma, 3 did not, and 6 did not answer. 
The Chicago Theological Seminary confers “the degree of bachelor of divinity 
upon college graduates who take in full the prescribed course in Hebrew and Greek, 
present a thesis on a prescribed theological topic, and pass the final examinations.” 
In answer to the inquiry what degree is bestowed upon a student completing the 
course, the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary says: ‘Full graduate Th. M., 
master in theology; eclectic graduate, Th. B., bachelor in theology; English grad- 
uate, Th.G., graduate in theology. Also, Th. D., doctor in theology, after an exten- 
sive graduate course.” 
In several schools the degree is granted only to those students who have taken 
A.B. or B.S. before entering the theological school. 
BETTER PREACHERS 
Bishop W. X. Ninde, of Detroit, Mich., says:! 
“Tn schools of theology emphasis is placed on scholarship, The student is stim- 
ulated to enter deeply into the scientific aspect of the subject—to give himself to 
the severely critical study of the Scriptures until he shall become a finished exegete, 
employing his enthusiasm and strength on these lines, and deferring a studious 
application to the more practical features of his life work till he shall become fully 
and solely absorbed with it. The result is that graduates from our theological 
schools are often well equipped as scholars, and sound and forceful as thinkers, 
without being essentially improved as preachers. Perhaps it is painfully evident, 
especially in the case of men who have interrupted their ministry to take a school 
course, that while their preaching has gained in literary finish, it has lost somewhat 
in fervor and pathos, and is really not as acceptable to the people as it formerly was. 
The urgent call to-day is for live and magnetic preachers—for pulpits that can draw 
and move the people. While poor preaching is not wholly responsible for the non- 
church-going habits of multitudes among us, it is page eas soin part. Noman

will reach high success in the ministry who has not an enthusiastic love for preach- 
ing, not for the praise it will bring to himself, but as an instrument of blessing to 
others. No amount of learning will compensate for the lack of this. The student 
should be impressed from the beginning of his course to the end that the chief and 
dominating aim is to improve him as a preacher; that all the studies he is required 
to pursue are to serve this end directly or indirectly, and that if this end is not met 
his course for practical purposes will have proved little less than a dead failure. If 
theological schools have a great mission in our church it is along thisline. The 
great need of our young ministers throughout the land is sympathetic but searching 
and faithful criticism, and, I should add, intelligent criticism. This they will seldom 
receive after they have entered upon their work. People will express their opinion 
by absenting themselves from church or by inattention while there, but the preacher 
will be tempted to attribute this to anything else rather than to his own faults. In 
the seminary these faults can be pointed out and corrected.”

MEDICAL SCHOOLS. 
INCREASED NUMBER OF 8TUDENTS. 
The variation in the number of students of any particular class from one year to a 
succeeding year can not be regarded of special significance in determining the general 
growth, for many causes may be in operation to produce a result directly the reverse of 
the true one. Not only so, but the number of students from year to year will vary 
more or less without any special cause. To arrive at any definite conclusion, one 
must take the number of students for a series of years, or else take the numbers of 
two years sufficiently remote from each other to eliminate all minor variations. . If 
we compare the number of students, for instance, of 1883-84 with the number in 
1893-94, we can form very correct ideas of the growth. In 1883-84 the number of 
regular schools of medicine was 88, in 1893-94 it was 109; homeopathic schools in 
1883-84, 13; in 1893-94, 19; eclectic, 9 in 1883-84, and 9 in 1893-94. Although there 
was a net increase during the decade of 42 in the number of medical schools, it should 
not be inferred that the permanent establishment of medical schools is easily accom- 
plished, for we find that 12 schools which were in the list of 1883-84 are now defunct, 
while 3 others that launched their barks since that time were not able to stem the 
tide. It should be remembered, too, that the names of medical schools are not gen- 
erally included in the list of this office until their second or third year; so that other 
schools that only survived a year or two may not have been included. The number 
of schools, however, is not of particular importance, for a struggling institution 
with a dozen students and with instructors whose only stipend is the name “ Pro- 
fessor” counts for as much in making a total as an institution with a thousand 
students. The number of students is a far better index. 
The students in regular medical schools in 1883-84 numbered 10,600; in 1893-94 
they numbered 17,601, an increase of 66 per cent. Students in homeopathic schools 
in 1883-84 were 1,267; in 1893-94, 1,666, an increase of 31.5 per cent. The eclectic 
students numbered about the same at the two periods—767 in 1883-84, and 803 in 
1893-94, an increase of only 4.7 per cent. The number of regular medical students 
increased more than twice as fast as homeopathic students, and more than fourteen 
times as fast as the eclectics. : 
If this increase in medical students continues, the question will soon be raised, 
What are they all todo? Where can so many find places to practice their profession? 
“Tt is no wonder that medical men complain of hard times when competition must 
necessarily be so keen. We presume that a rather large percentage of American 
medical students fall by the wayside, or, if they graduate, fail to pursue their pro- 
fession. It is at best hard to understand how 8,000 new doctors every year can earn 
aliving. It is, in fact, becoming constantly harder for a young medical man to get 
afoothold. What he lacks in training at college he makes up by long waiting after 
he gets his degree.””! 
The ratio of medical students to population in the United States is about twice 
what it is in European countries. The following statistics from the Journal of the 
American Medical Association, January 12, 1895, give an exhibit of different countries: 
“United Kingdom (Great Britain and Ireland), 8,696 total registered medical stu- 
dents between 1889 and 1893; for the year 1893, based on yearly accretions, 7,000; 
population, 37,000,000. 
“France, total number medical students inscribed on the books of the Paris Faculty 
of Medicine for 1894, 5,144; population, 40,000,000. 
“Germany, total number medical students registered for 1894, 8,684; population, 
50,000,000. 
“United States and Canada, total number medical students in attendance in 1894, 
20,800;? population, 70,000,000.

“Proportions: In the United Kingdom, 1 medical student to 5,286 of population; 
in France, 1 to 7,776 of population; in Germany, 1 to 5,757 of population; in the 
United States and Canada, 1 to 3,365 of population.” 
If these figures were even only approximately correct, the medical profession is 
sure to be even more crowded than it is at present, and it has been found that rais- 
ing the standard both for entrance and graduation has not diminished the actual 
number in attendance, however many it may have kept out. But the question may 
be asked, Is it, after all, surprising that the medical profession is crowded? What 
profession or trade is there which is not crowded? And is it not but natural that 
the professions here have larger numbers in proportion to population than in Euro- 
pean countries? The common schools and public high schools are educating large 
numbers of young men who have aspirations for the higher callings, and a larger 
number of parents in this country can gratify such desires than would be possible 
in densely populated Europe. Nor would it be a credit to American youths if, after 
enjoying a high-school education or even a full common-school education, they should 
be content to engage in work calling for no thought. While digging out coal or iron 
is honorable work, and the industrious and honest miner deserves every respect, it 
is nevertheless true that if a young man contents himself with this work, who has 
received good home training and has enjoyed the privilege of completing a full course 
in a common school and a public high school, and who is able to discharge suecess- 
fully the duties of positions of trust and responsibility requiring good educational 
qualifications, he falls far short of filling the place for which he was prepared; he 
makes a poor recompense for the care, attention, and expense which were bestowed. 
uponhim; while his work is honorable, he deserves dishonor. Young men who have 
enjoyed good educational advantages know that they must make proper use of them, 
and as so many in this country receive such training it is not surprising that candi- 
dates for professional life are numerous. 
But it need not be expected that all young men who can pass the final examina- 
tion in medical colleges and the State examinations will have those other qualifica- 
tions—perseverance, fortitude, ete.—which must be exercised so largely in attaining 
practical success in medicine. Some competitors must fall by the way. The law 
of the survival of the fittest must hold in medicine as in other pursuits. Large 
numbers of young men, after graduation in medicine, find openings in other lines 
which yield an immediate income, and others find that while the study of medicine 
is pleasant, to them the practice of it is very different. 
SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE. 
In the statistical tables of 1893-94 there are in all 152 medical schools; 109 regular, 
19 homeopathic, 9 eclectic, 3 physiomedical, 2 preparatory, and 10 graduate. 
Omitting the preparatory and graduate schools, which are nonscholastic, there are 
in the regular schools 17,601 students—about 87 per cent of the whole number. Inthe 
eclectic, homeopathic, and physiomedical schools there are 2,561—about 13 per cent. 
What are the distinguishing features of these schools? How does an eclectic or 
homeopathic school differ from others? Whatis physiomedicalism? Perhaps the 
briefest and best way to get a correct idea of these schools is to refer to the new 
Century Dictionary: 
“Eclectic medicine is a medical theory and practice based upon selection of what 
is esteemed best in all systems;” they ‘‘make use of what they regard as specific 
remedies, largely or chiefly botanical.” 
“Homeopathy—the medical treatment of diseased conditions of the body by the 
administration of drugs which are capable of exciting in healthy persons symptoms 
closely similar to those of the morbid condition treated. In practice, homeopathy 
is associated with the system of administering drugs in very small, often infinitesimal, 
doses.” 2

Physiomedicalist.—“‘An adherent or practitioner of that school of medicine which, 
in its treatment of disease, uses only botanic remedies, discarding those which are 
poisonous.” 
The above descriptions give a clear and concise idea of the three schools of medi- 
cine mentioned. What, then, is the distinctive theory or practice of the regular 
physicians? Their distinctive feature is that they hold to no distinctive doctrine or 
practice. In fact, they disclaim being a school of medicine. While they are some- 
times designated as allopathic by followers of other schools of medicine, they dis- 
claim the appellation entirely. In the cure of disease they make use of any remedy, 
botanical or other, similar or dissimilar, which they consider best for the purpose, 
and whether the dose is to be large or small, is determined in the same way, while the 
three special schools administer drugs in small doses and use medicines not disagree- 
able to taste or smell. 
However much the schools of medicine may differ in their systems of therapeutics, 
there will probably not be as much difference as between the treatment in vogue in 
one decade and that of a quarter of a century succeeding in the same school. What 
to-day is to be believed is to-morrow cast aside. Works on medical practice pub- 
lished forty years ago, however well preserved, are useful now only as indexes of 
former treatment. Medical libraries can not be handed down from father to son as 
valuable inheritances. A cheap cloth binding is sufficient for almost any work on 
medical practice in a private library, fer when the covering wears out the contents

will be antiquated. Phlebotomy was once so extensively practiced that medical 
journals took the name ‘‘The Lancet.” Now the treatment is directly opposite; 
instead of venesection and denying the patient food and water, we must strengthen 
the vital powers, give all nourishment that can be properly digested, help the patient 
overcome disease. 
Mercury was early recognized as such a valuable remedy that it became the physi- 
cian’s vade mecum, but its strongest friends were its worst enemies. They found it 
useful in every disease, and heroic doses were most efficacious; its dangers were over- 
looked or minimized in the mind of the administrator. But someone is always ready 
to take the other side of the question. They published abroad the danger in its use 
(and of course there is danger in its indiscriminate use), and pointed so effectively 
to the evils wrought by it in some cases that public opinion rebelled against it 
entirely, and physicians were often compelled to desist from its use when really 
needed. The pendulum swings backward and forward, and when reaching one 
extreme its own weight makes it to rebound. New remedies are constantly being 
introduced and hailed as deliverers from disease, but are soon forgotten like their 
predecessors. 
The elixir of life has inspired hope and buoyancy in the old and enfeebled, but 
laurels are still in waiting for him who shall find it. The fountain of youth, like the 
rainbow in the sky, is ever just beyond our reach. No complaint need be made that 
human beings are subjected to false systems of therapeutics in any school, when in 
less than twenty years all of the present methods may be discarded. 
SPECIAL MEDICAL COURSES. 
Ina few universities there is a course designed to be preparatory to regular medical 
work and taking the place of the first year medical course. In some other insti- 
tutions a course is provided for post-graduate medical work. The course prepar- 
atory to medicine includes subjects usually taught during the first year in medical 
colleges having graded courses of three or four years—chemistry, anatomy, physi- 
ology, botany, and materia medica. . 
In the University of Kansas there is a preparatory medical course to which any 
student can be admitted who is prepared for entrance to the freshman class of the 
school of arts in all English studies. There are two terms of twenty weeks cach. 
Students completing the work are admitted to the second year’s course in any of the

    PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION. 985 
larger medical colleges. During the year 1894 property to the value of $100,000 was 
given for the development of the medical department. 
In Brown University, Rhode Island, a course of studies has been selected as suit- 
able for students preparing for the medical profession. 
Randolph Macon College, Virginia, and Nebraska State University also have 
courses preparatory to medicine. 
Clark University, Worcester, Mass., has a department where graduates in medi- 
cine and college graduates can pursue the study of the purely scientific branches of 
medicine, as chemistry, biology, psychology, and anthropology. The department 
affords no opportunities for dissection or hospital work, and does not confer the 
degree of M. D. 
‘‘The most important part of our work is research, and we wish soon to be ready 
to be chiefly judged by the value of our contributions to the sum of human 
knowledge.” 
In the University of Pennsylvania the “auxiliary faculty of medicine supplements 
the customary course of medical instruction by lectures on branches of science 
essential to the thorough education of the physician. The course is essentially post- 
graduate. There can be no matriculation by medical students until the student has 
entered upon his second year of medical study.” 
“A student in the auxiliary department of medicine who is a baccalaureate grad- 
uate in arts or science of this university or of an American college whose degrees 
are accepted by this university as equivalent to its own may become a candidate 
for the degree of doctor of philosophy on fulfilling certain requirements prescribed 
by the faculty of philosophy of the university. He may choose his three required 
subjects from the following studies: Botany, zoology, geology, mineralogy, and 
bacteriological hygiene.” 
It is not claimed that the above enumeration of universities with preparatory 
courses ‘is an exhaustive one by any means, for at present rate of progress it will 
soon be impossible to find any university without a course of studies leading to med- 
icine, for it is generally conceded that while medical courses should occupy about 
four years, young men should be able to enter the practice of medicine at an earlier 
age than 28 or 30. 
NO HOMEOPATHY IN THE SOUTH. 
It is noticeable that if we omit.one or two border States, there are no homeopathic 
students in the South. In the North Atlantic States there are 595 homeopathic 
students; in the North Central there are 958; but in the South Atlantic and South 
Central combined there are only 61, and these are in the border cities, Baltimore, 
Washington, and Louisville, Ky. 
It will be seen, too, by reference to the diagram giving the growth of the homeo- 
pathic, eclectic, and regular schools, that the homeopathic schools are not keeping 
up even relatively withthe general growth in the United States at large, so far as 
numbers are concerned, and that the eclectics are still further behind. Unless it be 
that a larger number of graduates from regular schools than from homeopathic or 
eclectic fail to enter upon the practice of their profession or else abandon it after- 
wards, it would seem that homeopathy and eclecticism will gradually become less 
noticeable, unless further strengthened and developed by their freedom from the 
“shotgun prescriptions” and horrible mixtures suitable only for a person without a 
sense of taste or smell, but which were so frequently prescribed a few decades ago. 
WOMEN IN MEDICAL SCHOOLS. 
There are always quite a number of women engaged in the study of medicine, 
Most of these probably enter upon a general practice, while others seek a practice 
specially among women and children. Judging from the enrollment of women stu- 
dents, homeopathy and eclecticism seem to be more popular with them than with men. 
While there are nearly three times as many women students in the regular schools 
 
-P-A-G-E-1044
986 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
as there are in the homeopathic, the ratio to male students is much smaller. In the 
regular schools the number of women is 902, which is only 5.1 per cent of the whole 
number; but in the homeopathic schools there are 351, or 21.1 per cent of the whole 
number; while in the eclectic schools there are 86, or 10.7 per cent. In al the medical 
schools there-are 1,419 women, or 6.5 per cent of the whole number. 
In dentistry, pharmacy, and law the number of women is much smaller; dentistry, 
88, or 2.1 per cent; pharmacy, 88, or 214 per cent; and law, 54, or seven-tenths of 1 per 
cent.

   TAGE OF STUDENTS GRADUATING. 
A diagram has been made to show what proportion of the whole number of stu- 
dents in law, medicine, theology, dentistry, and pharmacy were allowed to gradu- 
ate at the end of the year; in other words, to show approximately what amount of 
preparation is required of students in each of these pursuits before they are consid- 
ered qualified to enter upon their work. 
Judging from the results there given and from the usages followed in these voca- 
tions, it is concluded that, on the whole, medical students at the present time are 
required to have a better preliminary training, are required to spend a longer time 
in the study of their profession, and must undergo severer final examinations than 
students in the other professions, law, theology, dentistry, and pharmacy. If we 
take these elements of preparation singly, the result might be different; for instance, 
it might be claimed that law students begin the study of law with better education 
than medical students; but when we consider all three of the items mentioned, it will 
be found that the result is probably as stated, namely, that medical students are 
required to make better preparation for their work than any other class of students. 
This was not the case only a few years ago.

The proportion of law students graduating at the end of the year was 34 per cent, 
a larger percentage than in any of the other classes. ‘This was probably the result 
of the short course in law schools, 7 law schools requiring but one year of study 
before graduation, 47 requiring two years, and only 13 requiring three years, while 
of the 152 medical schools only 3 have courses of two years, the others having three 
years, except 19 schools, which have courses of four years. Large numbers of law 
students serve as clerks for a few months in the office of some attorney, are admitted 
to the practice of law, and then devote their leisure time to real preparation for 
their profession. 
Of students in pharmacy, 27 per cent completed the course at the end of the year, 
and of dental students 21 per cent. While these percentages show that students 
must devote considerable time to preparation in these callings, it is well known that 
many Jicensed druggists never attend a school of pharmacy at all, and the require- 
ments of dental practitioners are also lax. 
In theology, of the 7,658 students only 19 per cent completed the course during 
the year, while of the 21,802 students in medicine 24 per cent graduated at the end 
of the year. The course in theological schools, too, is usually three years, while 
several schools have courses of four years. It is evident, therefore, that students in 
theological seminaries receive full preparation for their work. 
But why is it that with about one-fourth more physicians than clergymen in the 
United States there are about three times as many students of medicine as there are 
theological? And why is it that while one denomination may have four times as 
many members as another, the number of theological students in the two denomina- 
tions is about the same? It is evidently because a large number of ministers never 
attend a regular seminary course at all, but receive only private instruction from 
some clerical brother, or else jump full-fledged from some other calling into the 
ministerial ranks. ‘This is well known to be true, especially in some important 
denominations. 
If we consider the interests involved, it would seem to be only proper that the 
education of physicians should rank especially high. While the legal profession 
frequently consider questions involving large estates or large funds, these can not
-P-A-G-E-1046
  988 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
be considered so important as those cases where health and life are at stake, and to 
secure which surrender of every possession would willingly be made. 
It seems also that the physician needs a better preparation for his work than the 
theological student, although the latter will aim to direct the spiritual welfare of 
his fellow-men, a calling which of course ranks in importance above all others. But 
in order that one may succeed in turning men from ways of vice and wickedness to 
godliness and holiness, it is not so necessary that he shall have unraveled all the 
nice distinctions of doctrine which set up one denomination against another, and 
which cause much waste of effort, but it is very important that the teacher of 
righteousness shall himself be righteous, and that he be able to illustrate his pre- 
cepts by his example. The history of early Methodism is convincing proof of what 
can be accomplished by earnest, consecrated workers, with but little previous train- 
ing for the work. Many of those who have received full theological instruction are 
themselves opposed to a strict requirement of a long theological course under all cir- 
cumstances, 
In the study of medicine the previous instruction of even a well-educated person 
gives him but little knowledge of those things which he must learn before beginning 
a practice of medicine. His previous training will simply enable him to grasp more 
quickly and fully the new ideas presented, and accelerate his progress along paths 
untrodden by him before. It is therefore absolutely necessary not only that he be 
capable of properly receiving instruction, but that he also devote much time to 
receiving it, and that he give clear evidence of his medical knowedge before receiy- 
ing a license. 
Nurse TRAINING. 
The nurse-training table mentions the names of 66 schools, with 2,710 nurses 
receiving instruction. The number of instructors was not given in the table for 
several reasons. In the first place, in answer to the question as to the number of 
instructors, quite a number of schools invariably reply, “ Instruction is given by the 
hospital staff of physicians and surgeons.” Some schools mention only four or five 
instructors who deliver special lectures regularly to the nurses as to their duties, 
omitting entirely the regular hospital staff. Another school will probably give the 
number of the entire staff in two or three hospitals where the nurses serve. As a@ 
result one school will be reported as having 5 instructors and another as having 
150, while in reality they may have about the same number. It is doubtful which 
can be said to have reported correctly, the school giving only the number of actual 
lecturers on nursing, or the school which included every member of the hospital 
staff, In reality the nurse receives the larger and more important part of her train- 
ing in the hospital ward, where she constantly gets many gentle hints as to what 
she should do, and where she learns to know by doing. In the operating room she 
sees an amputation made by a skillful surgeon assisted by the resident physicians 
and nurses. In the fever ward she sees the physician examining the typhoid patient, 
note the pulse, take the temperature, and give a cold bath. In the afternoon she 
hears a lecture to the nurses on the condition of the skin. How many instructors 
were there? Fifteen, three, or one, or nineteen? Evidently none of these answers 
would be correct. Her instruction could no more be determined in that way than 
by the number of windows to the ward. 
The first regular and systematic instruction in nurse training in this country is 
said to have been given in 1873, although some efforts to establish such schools were 
made previous to that time. In the annual report of the Bureau of Education for 
1874 only two nurse-training schools were mentioned, the Bellevue Hospital Nurse- 
Training School and the one at New Haven, Conn. These schools found much dif- 
ficulty in securing candidates for instruction who possessed good health and sufficient 
education. The secretary of the New York Association, in his report for 1874, said: 
“We were at first disappointed at the few desirable applicants who presented 
themselves to be trained, but as the knowledge of our school gradually spread over 
 
-P-A-G-E-1047

the country we received, either through personal interview with the superintendent 
or by letter, many applications from women offering themselves as probationists. 
Some were entirely unfitted by incapacity, physical weakness, or because, belonging 
to the ignorant and uneducated class, they fell below our standard of admission.

But the majority were unwilling to devote two years to gaining a career, seeming to 
care little for really perfecting themselves in their profession. 
“The scarcity of such professionally trained nurses throughout the country was per- 
ceived in the effort to find women capable of acting as head nurses. Advertisements,
-P-A-G-E-1048
990 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
applications to doctors, and in fact all available means only brought us four, one of 
whom we were soon forced to discharge for inefficiency.” 
At the present time, however, there is no scarcity of applicants wherever schools 
have been established long enough to make known the value of such service. 
Whenever a number of nurses, possessing a full English education, so that they are 
entirely competent to receive instruction and to adopt it in practice, have once 
found employment in any city, the great value of their service is at once recognized, 
and thereafter they are always in demand in caso of sickness. It is soon found that 
their value does not consist at all in the amount of menial service which they per- 
form, this being incidental and expletive, but that they render valuable professional 
service of the same kind that the medical attendant bestows, differing only in 
degree. The value of the trained nurse increases just in proportion to her ability to 
acquire this professional knowledge, and decreases just as her measure of usefulness 
depends only on the amount of menial work she discharges. 
Her work, however, does not conflict with that of the physician, but supplements 
it. As arule, the more competent and better educated the nurse, the more friendly 
and congenial will’ be her relations with the physician, for even if their ideas of 
proper treatment should differ, the well-educated nurse will always remember that 
she is merely to assist the physician and carry out his directions, and not to conduct 
the case, and if she should consider it advisable to make any suggestion to the 
physician, it would be done at a time and in a manner not objectionable. An igno- 
rant woman as nurse, and with only the little training such an one can receive, 
might easily imagine she understood the whole case, and would be liable to discharge 
for impertinent interference. 
y As the successful physician usuaily has a number of patients to visit and as he 
must have time to study up current medical literature, without doing which he 
would soon lose both professional knowledge and interest and consequently profes- 
sional standing, he must necessarily confine his visits to each patient to a short 
length of time, simply ascertaining the condition of the patient and making the 
necessary prescriptions. He then intrusts the patient to the nurse until his next 
visit. The skillful nurse administers the medicine or performs any other duty which 
the physician may have directed, notes the progress of the case, the pulse, respira- 
tion, condition of the skin, and nervous symptoms, and if she discovers any special 
change for the worse, and it is particularly important that she be able to recognize 
any change, sends immediately for the physician again, to whom she is able to give 
a minute and accurate account of the course during the interval. He is then able 
to diagnose the condition at once and without doubt, directs the proper treatment, 
and the patient is soon convalescent, and the physician’s reputation is again strength- 
ened instead of being clouded by a death; the patient and her friends bear many 
feelings of gratitude and kindness to the nurse, upon whose careful attention and 
good judgment they have depended in the intervals of the physician’s visits, and to 
the physician who has given wise and skillful treatment and who recognizes the yal- 
uable assistance he has received. 
“Schools for training nurses have done much to make clear the evils of untrained 
nursing. Intelligent people see that the best results are to be expected only when 
the directions of the trusted physician are implicitly followed, and that the modern 
treatment of disease demands the continuous, thoughtful attention of a trained ex- 
pert. The intelligent family is no longer content to trust a fight, whose loss means 
saddest bereavement and years of hidden pain, to the sole direction of a commander 
who is on the field of battle only half an hour in the twenty-four. He must have 
a lieutenant, an executive officer who will see his orders carried out, who will call 
him to the spot if an emergency arises, and who can be trusted to act wisely in those 
erises where the right thing must be done at once. 
“There are now, happily, many who know by experience the relief given and the 
confidence inspired by the presence of a trained nurse at the bedside. But it is the 
doctor who can best bear witness to her usefulness. No one but a physician can 
     
-P-A-G-E-1049

appreciate the odds against recovery when the severely ill are left to the tender but 
awkward mercies of their own flesh and blood. It is not too much to say that the 
treatment of typhoid fever, of a severe pneumonia, of a dozen other maladies, in a 
private house without a trained nurse is a calamity, At the best it is giving the 
enemy a long start.” (An. Rep. St. Louis Training School for Nurses, 1894.) 
EDUCATION AND GOOD HOME TRAINING NECESSARY, 
Although it is well for the nurse to be in good health, it is not absolutely necessary 
that sho be of a strong and robust constitution. It is far more important that she 
have received at least a full English education, and that she have some knowledge 
of the proprieties and amenities of social life. Without a good English education 
it would be impossible to appreciate the necessary instruction, and it can easily be 
conceived how injurious to the sick, in some instances, would be the abrupt and 
blunt expressions of a nurse with no delicacy of fecling, and how unwelcome would 
be such a person in a home of comfort and refinement, where the service of a trained 
nurse is most frequently demanded, and where she must necessarily come in contact 
with members of the family. 
In communities where trained nurses have not been generally employed, the esteem 
in which their service is held when introduced, aud the demand for such service, 
depend to a large extent upon whether the nurses first employed are well qualified 
fortheir work. If they have had good preliminary training and have been thoroughly 
instructed in the strictly professional details of their work, and especially if their 
usefulness is observed by the medical profession, the value of their service soon 
becomes known and the demand for trained nurses at once arises. But if nurses of 
inferior education and knowledge are introduced, they will rightly be considered of 
no more worth than industrious and careful servants. It is very important that 
officers having charge of the selection of candidates for positions in nurse training, 
especially in communities where they are just being introduced, exerciso great care 
to accept only those who have good educational qualifications and have received 
good home training, and nurses should not be sent out into private families until 
they have received a full course of complete and systematic instruction. 
THE MODEL TRAINING SCHOOL. 
A majority of nurse-training schools are found in the large cities, in connection 
with the hospitals. In fact, proper instruction and practical experience can not be 
obtained elsewhere, except under many disadvantages. There are a few training 
schools where the students attend lectures and clinies just as medical students do, 
and pay a regular tuition fee, and receive some training in nursing private patients 
and in attendance upon free obstetrical cases. Such students are relieved from some 
of the disagreeable work of large hospitals, but if involves the loss of much valuable 
practical information, and it is doubtful whether they can ever become as skillful 
and efficient nurses as those who have served an apprenticeship in a hospital ward. 
The model training school seems to be one where the pupils serve as nurses in a 
large hospital where medical, surgical, and obstetrical cases are treated; where they 
receive regular instruction in anatomy, physiology, and obstetrics by lectures and 
recitations, with occasional examination on the instruction given; where the pupils 
reside in a nurses’ home near to their place of work, but at the same time separate 
and distinct from the hospital, so that they have some change of scene and are not 
constantly in contact with the sick and afflicted,in whose presence mirth and gaiety 
would be both unseemly and difficult. Many of the larger schools haye the arrange- 
ment here mentioned, except that but few hospitals can give the threefold instruc- 
tion—medical, surgical, and obstetrical. 
The New York City Training School for Nurses has a Nurses’ Home on the south 
point of Blackwell’s Island, from which the nurses go out daily or nightly to one of 
four different hospitals, the City, Maternity, Gouverneur, or Harlem hospitals. Each 
 
-P-A-G-E-1050
992. EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
of these hospitals has its own medical board, its own methods of nurse training, and 
a distinctive class of patients, so that pupils receive instruction in the nursing of 
patients with all kinds of diseases and injuries. The school has about 75 pupils, 4 
supervising nurses, a superintendent, and an assistant superintendent. It received 
during the year 1893-94 400 applications for places as nurse pupils, accepted 40 as 
probationers, dropped 7 nurses from its roll for various reasons, and graduated 22, 
During the first six months the nurses are placed in the City Hospital, where there 
are large wards and many chronic cases, and where there are supervising and assist- 
ant supervising nurses to instructthem. Here they become acquainted with hospital 
life and learn the first principles of nursing. The nurse “may now be called upoa 
to enter upon the duties of the maternity service, where, under the immediate charge 
of the supervising nurse of Maternity Hospital, she will gain experience peculiar to 
that service. Here, 100, she will have charge of a small ward and learn something 
of hospital management. 
“‘The Gouverneur and Harlem hospitals, situated in the northern and southern 
portions of the city, are emergency and reception hospitals. Twoambulances at each 
of these hospitals are constantly bringing in sick and wounded from the surrounding 
neighborhood, and here the nurses come in contact with a new order of things. To 
these hospitals the nurses are sent in their second year, and when they are well on 
in their senior course, Here again the system of graded responsibility in the man- 
agement of the nursing is carried out, the supervising nurse responsible for all, the 
head nurse under her having charge of the operating room and the practical training 
of the nurses, the senior nurse and staff filling in their respective places. The six 
months a nurse spends in these hospitals give her experience in nursing all kinds of 
acute medical and surgical cases and in dealing with the emergencies which these 
hospitals continuously supply. 
“The last six months of a nurse’s time in the school are spent acting as head nurse 
in the large wards in City Hospital, in filling the position of head nurse in the 
Maternity, Gouverneur, or Harlem hospitals, or in taking care of operation cases 
where experienced nursing is specially required. 
“The course of training thus pursued insures a thorough training in method, 
order, accuracy, and attention to detail principally gained during the first year in 
City Hospital; while during the second year the service in the outlying hospitals 
develops self-reliance, self-control, adaptability, quickness of observation, and gives 
a knowledge of the higher responsibilities of nursing. 
“The Nurses’ Home, which may be considered the heart of this system, is situated 
pleasantly on the south point of the island. Here the nurses reside, and go daily or 
nightly, as the case may be, to the hospitals where they are stationed on duty, and 
here they rest during the evening and when they have their weekly half day or sec- 
ond Sunday. The social ties here formed are one of the pleasant features of the 
school. Since its enlargement last year, the ‘Home’ has a capacity of forty-five 
bedrooms, four bathrooms, two dining rooms, two storerooms, cloakroom, linen 
room, trunk room, kitchen, and two pantries. It also hasa large library or parlor, a 
class room, a study, and a private sitting room. We find the Home a very pleasant 
place to live in, situated as it is in its own grounds and removed from all immediate 
hospital surroundings.” 
WAGES OF NURSES. 
As will be seen by an examination of the table of nurse-training schools,! the 
wages of nurses during their years of service are, during the first year, about $8 
or $10 per month; during the second year, $12 to $14 per month—board and lodging 
always being furnished free. After graduation, when in attendance upon cases of 
sickness in private families, they usually receive $2.50 to $3.00 per day, or $15 to $25 
! The table giving statistics of nurse schools can be found in latter part of this 
volume.

per week, in addition to board and lodging. They are usually employed in homes 
of people of refinement and some means, and as might be expected in such cases, 
especially under circumstances of serious illness, they are treated with much kind- 
ness and courtesy. As to whether they can obtain work regularly depends to a 
large extent upon energy and efficiency, especially as recognized by members of the 
medical profession. The best nurses usually find all the work they desire. 
The great usefulness of well-trained nurses can not be doubted for a moment when 
an examination is made of the course of training which they receive, involving in 
almost every school two years of careful and attentive work. The course is practi- 
eally the same in all the schools, but some schools have much better facilities than 
others for giving instruction, and are more rigid in their requirements, and some now 
require courses of three years. 
COURSE OF TRAINING. 
The instruction includes: 
1. The dressing of blisters, burns, sores, and wounds, the application of fomenta- 
tions, poultices, cups, and leeches. 
2. The administration of enemas and the use of the female catheter. 
3. The management of appliances for uterine complaints. 
4, The best method of friction to the body and extremities. 
5. The management of helpless patients; making béds, moving, changing, giving 
baths in bed, preventing and dressing bedsores, and managing positions. 
6. Bandaging, making bandages and rollers, lining of splints. 
7. The preparing, cooking, and serving of delicacies for the sick. 
The nurses will also be given instruction in the best practical methods of supply- 
ing fresh air, and of warming and ventilating sick rooms in a proper manner. They 
will be taught to take care of rooms and wards; to keep all utensils perfectly clean 
and disinfected; to make accurate observations and reports to the physician of the 
state of the secretions, expectorations, pulse, skin, appetite, temperature of the 
body, intelligence, as to delirium or stupor, breathing, sleep, condition of wounds, 
eruptions, formation of matter, effect of diet, or of stimulants, or of medicines; 
and to learn the management of convalescents. 
The teaching will be given by physicians and surgeons, when practicable, at the 
bedside of the patients, and by the superintendent and head nurses. Lectures, reci- 
tations, and demonstrations will take place from time to time, and examinations at 
stated periods. 
When the full term of two years is ended, the nurses thus trained will be at lib- 
erty to choose their own field of labor, whether in hospitals, in private families, or 
in district nursing among the poor. On leaving the school they will each, having 
passed an examination, receive a diploma under the seal of the hospital. 
In addition to the practical experience obtained in the wards, there is a regular 
course of study, embracing the following subjects: 
Anatomy, physiology, obstetrics, the nature and course of various diseases, the 
action and doses of those medicines in general use. 
Monthly written examinations will be held by the superintendent, and the general 
standing of each pupil nurse recorded. 
Diplomas will be granted to those nurses only who obtain a final rating of 75 per 
cent or over, this rating being fixed by the final examination and by the superin- 
tendent’s record kept during the two years’ course. 
LIST OF LECTURES AND SUBJECTS.

Tenn. (opened January 22, 1894), and the law school of Indiana Central Normal 
College. 
According to President Henry Wade Rogers, of Evanston, IIl., ‘Harvard is the 
oldest of existing law schools in this country. It has made its way slowly. Founded 
in 1817, the largest number of students it had before 1829 was 18, and its average 
attendance at that time had been 8. The Yale Law School was established in 1824, 
and that of the University of Virginia in 1825. The Cincinnati Law School was 
established in 1833 by lawyers who had been educated at the Litchfield school. It 
was the first law school established west of the Alleghany Mountains.” 
The number of students enrolled in 1893-94 in the 67 law schools tabulated was 
7,311, an increase of 533 over the enrollment in 1892-93. The number graduating was 
2,454, an increase of 54, In the city of New York there were 1,186 students of law; 
in Washington, D. C., there were 739. 
Although we hear much now and then of the right of women to practice law in 
different States, they do not seem to be fast availing themselves of their opportunities. 
Of the 7,311 students of law registered in 1893-94, only 54 were women. And it 
seems that many of those who study law do not practice it afterwards, for by the 
census of 1890 there were only 208 women classed among lawyers. 
Although law schools are helping greatly in raising the standard of legal educa- 
tion in the United States, especially among the younger members of the profession, 
there still remains much to be done. Hundreds of young men are being admitted 
to the bar in the various States, many of whom can never become properly qualified 
on account of lack of elementary education, to say nothing of the large number who 
expect to qualify themselves in law after admission to the bar. The legal profession 
must learn a lesson from what the medical associations did a few years ago, when the 
standard of medical education was elevated so materially. 
While some States have regulations sufficiently restrictive to shut out the incom- 
petent and unprepared, in other States there are practically no restrictions. The 
constitution of Indiana expressly states that any man can practice law who is a 
voter and of good moral character. In some other States, where the inferior courts 
are allowed to admit candidates, the requirements are exceedingly lax. 
Prof. John D. Lawson, of the University of Missouri, has related an instance which 
shows not only how little is required for admission under present laws, but also what 
results sometimes follow. ‘‘ There was an old negro preacher in St. Louis who con- 
ceived the idea that if he were only able to hold himself out as a lawyer as well as a 
preacher he would do a flourishing trade among his flock. He applied for admission 
in St. Louis and was examined in open court. He had spelled his way through a few 
hundred pages of Blackstone, of some obsolete law dictionary, and the statutes of 
the State. Without an idea of any single sentence he had read, his examination was 
of course a comedy of errors, but though rejected, he was not dismayed. In a few 
weeks he turned up again, the happy possessor of a certificate of admission to the 
circuit court in one of the interior counties, and thus entitled to be enrolled in any 
and every other court in the State. The first client he obtained was a poor negro 
charged with murder. Though the prisoner was afterwards found to have acted 
under circumstances of justifiable self-defense, the management of the case re- 
sulted in a verdict of murder in the first degree and sentence of death. Then the 
poor prisoner became frightened and retained a lawyer. It was a rather difficult 
case to appeal; there were no points reserved; there were no errors which could be 
taken advantage of, and the only possible chance was to ask for a new trial on the 
ground of the ignorance, imbecility, and incompetency of the attorney.” 
Many practical business men would prefer to fall into the hands of the Phillistines 
and be robbed outright rather than get into the meshes of the law, where they must 
spend weeks of care and anxiety, vexatious postponements, and fruitless efforts, and 
at last come out probably with heavy loss, whether for the gain of Peter or Paul they 
care not.

COURTS LIGHTLY ESTEEMED. 
Frank C, Smith, esq., of New York, has spoken earnestly in favor of an elevation 
of the legal profession,! that it may rid itself of those characteristics which cause 
men to shun it whenever possible. 
“‘Those of us who are earnest and honest in our wish to see the practice of law 
resume its exalted position as one of the learned professions, can well afford to admit, 
without evasion, the unpleasant truths in connection with the present deplorable 
state of legal attainment among the members of the bar in general. In no other way 
can we accurately discern the evil and be equipped to relentlessly apply the apt 
remedy. We know that our courts are clogged with a mass of cases, a considerable 
proportion of which, as shown by the results, are without legal merit, but a still 
larger share of which are so involved in the intricacies of legal procedure that not 
only are they detained and ruinously retarded in their progress through the courts, 
but very often the question at issue, involving as it does the actual merits of the con- 
troversy, is wholly lost to sight, and for long periods of time, if, indeed, not ulti- 
mately, is beyond the reach of judicial action, This condition of affairs exists 
eithor because the practitioners of law are inefficient, because they are of such base 
caliber that they willingly degrade the profession by a willful obstruction or perver- 
sion of justice, or because of a combination of these two causes. In this judgment 
Iam not overlooking the fruitful cause of delay in judicial tribunals furnished by 
our cumbersome and inadequate systems of procedure. Certain facts which I shall 
presently present will demonstrate that within the lines of the question under dis- 
cussion the just objections to such systems have no measurable influence. What- 
ever is the cause of the condition against which this section is a living protest, all 
intelligent lawyers, yea, and an intelligent public, know what is the result thereof. 
Litigation is now popularly considered an evil. Men with rights to maintain or with 
wrongs to redress hesitate and often refuse to submit to the uncertainties, the tedious 
delays, and the wasting expense inevitable in the ordinary court processes of the 
day. The people are losing faith in the ability of their courts to arbitrate the differ- 
ences of litigants accurately, speedily, and inexpensively. And the worst feature of 
this condition of affairs is that this waning faith is justified by the facts. 
“The considerations wuich I have thus hastily presented and the ominous data 
which I hold in my hand, make imperative the necessity for a swift return to the 
professional ideal. What is needed to-day is a bar that is soundly grounded in a 
thorough knowledge of the law and its practice, and which will scorn, except to 
bring into clearer view, the true merits of the controversy, to invoke the purely 
technical rules of procedure. We need a bar that recognizes its duty to principle as 
paramount to its duty to its clients, and which will never, in behalf of client or of 
self, abandon principle. In addition, it is essential that the bar shall know how to 
employ the rules of legal procedure so as to most completely and surely serve prin- 
ciple. Butso far has the profession fallen from: this ideal, that, judged by the results 
of its service in actual litigation, it is to-day a monstrous charlatan. What would 
be said of a trade or craft against which it could be proven that in an average of 
nearly 50 per cent of the attempts it made to serve its patrons it failed to secure 
just results because its craftsmen did not understand how to use its machinery, or, 
understanding this, failed to employ it so as to attain the end promised when it was 
intrusted to do the service? Such a trade could not retain public respect and con- 
fidence an hour after its inefficiency was known. No more can one of the learned 
professions. Yet this is the exact condition of the practice of law in this country 
to-day. 
“Tam aware of the surprising nature of this statement; but no ono can be more 
startled at the facts too amply sustaining it than I was when I discovered them. 
Anxious to learn what the decisions of our appellate tribunals would show as to the

character of the questions submitted to and passed upon by them, I have examined 
the cases reported by the West systems of reporters for the period covered by the 
last general digest. * * * Of the 29,942 cases decided, I ascertained that 14,447, 
or 48 per cent, were upon points of procedure or other matters not involving the 
merits of the controversy.” 
On this same subject, Austin Abbott, of the University Law School, New York, says: 
“What a boon to our community it would be if the practice of the law could be 
lifted above the entanglements of half-understood procedure, and#f a bar trained in 
the logic of pleading and the practice of adducing evidence, and a bench, freed from * 
the incessant duty of correcting errors in practice, could devote themselves fully to 
the free and useful reasoning of the modern American law upon the usages of busi- 
ness and the interests of commerce and society.” 
LITTLE TRAINING REQUIRED OF LAW STUDENTS. 
Since medical colleges made the recent regulations concerning the number of 
years to be spent in the study of medicine and the number of months constituting 
one annual session, medical students are required to make fuller preparation and to 
spend a longer time in the study of their profession than any other class of men, for 
it must be remembered that many ministers of the gospel do not pursue any prepar- 
atory course in theology at all. 
On the contrary, law students can obtain admission to the practice of their profes- 
sion in a shorter time than can students in any other calling—theology, medicine, 
dentistry, or pharmacy. The course of study too in law schools is much shorter than 
in any of the other classes. In eight law schools only one year of study is required 
before graduation. The great majority require only two years, and one or two require 
three years. Whilestudents can graduate in eight law schools after only ene year of 
study, there is not asingle school of theology, medicine, dentistry, or pharmacy where 
astudent can receive the full degree in one year, and in most of these schools a course 
of three years is required. Not only is a longer course of study required in the 
other classes than in law schools, but the percentage of students graduating is less 
than in law schools. 
Moreover, while the course in law schools is shorter than in any of the others, a 
large number of law students do not take even that, but depend entirely upon private 
study and information acquired in a lawyer’s office. While there are only about 
one-third more physicians than lawyers in the United States, there are about three 
times as many medical students as law students. The number of medical students 
in 1893-94 was 21,802, but of law students only 7,311. 
“Tt is a maxim sanctioned by long and wide experience, that ‘he who is not a good 
lawyer when he comes to the bar will seldom be a good one afterwards.’ And in 
order to acquire such thorough acquaintance with the elements of the law, thought is 
requisite as well as reading; and for the purpose of thought, there must be time to 
digest as well as industry to acquire. Onecan not expect to gorge himself with law 
as a boa constrictor does with masses of food, and then digest it afterwards. The 
process of assimilation must go on, if it is to proceed healthfully and beneficially, at 
the same time with the reception of knowledge.” ! 
But possibly it is expected that the law student will acquire a large amount of 
legal information after his admission to practice; that the months spent in waiting 
for clients shall be utilized in increasing his legal attainments and therefore rigid 
requirement of educational qualifications should not be demanded before admission 
to the bar. But as objection was made to medical students engaging in practice 
while preparing for their profession, it might also be made to law students claiming 
to give legal advice while admittedly unprepared to do so. 
Although a large number of poorly qualified lawyers may obtain little practice, 
and hence may be continually dropping out into other lines of business, it would

998 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
seem to be more prudent, both for their own sakes and for thatof the profession, that 
they be required to take a full and regular course of instruction. It is also probable 
that the elimination from the profession of all those who had not received full train- 
ing would diminish considerably the number of suits resulting from papers improperly 
drawn and advice badly given. 
LAW SCHOOLS ELEVATING THE PROFESSION. 
Notwithstanding what has been said as to short terms in law schools and the low 
standard required for entrance and graduation, the law schools are doing more to 
improve the standing of the legal profession than any other agency, and if it were 
not for the difficulties in the way they would at once raise the standard far higher. 
They have rightly concluded that it is better that students pursue the short course 
of systematic and regular instruction in a law school rather than depend upon the 
desultory instruction given in the office of an attorney. But so longasstudents can 
secure admission to the bar through the inferior courts after only a few months of 
study, and with little regard to the legal knowledge obtained, it will be impossible 
for law schools to require full courses of study. It is a common occurrence that 
students who have failed to pass the law-school examination apply at once to the 
courts for admission to the bar and the application is granted. 
If law students were required to show a diploma from a law school before being 
allowed to apply for admission, just as medical students must usually show a diploma, 
the courses of study in law schools could easily be lengthened. Itis possible that this 
requirement may be very generally made in a few years. The great superiority of 
the instruction given to large classes of young men, at regular hours, by men se- 
lected on account of their qualifications for this purpose, is now generally recog- 
nized. It has ceased to be a question for discussion, especially among the younger 
members of the bar. So long as the large body of older lawyers remained who had 
received their first lessons in law offices, mainly because.there was no other place for 
them, and who principally enjoyed the emoluments and honors of office, it was but 
natural that there would be many advocates of practical training in an office. But 
at the present time there are law schools in all portions of the country, and, judging 
from the rapid increase in the number of students, their advantages are well known 
to all. 
Prof. Jerome C. Knowlton has said: ‘It is the lawyers that are'to blame. The 
law schools are anxious to have a three years’ course and have a high standard for 
admission to the junior class. In my judgment, no student should be admitted who 
is not qualified for admission to the academical department. Some have gone so far 
as to say that a student ought to have a bachelor of arts degree or a bachelor of let- 
ters degree. Of course, we are not prepared to admit that, but a higher standard 
of education and a three years’ course are what is desired. Still we never can have 
it until the bar do something toward closing the doors of admission to practice to 
all, irrespective of education, either professional or academic.” 
Unless the legal profession make some united effort to elevate their standard, it 
will probably remain unchanged. The requirements for higher medical education 
would never have been accomplished without the earnest and continued efforts of 
the medical associations of the different States, led on by the national associations. 
The American Bar Association has already started a movement in favor of advance- 
ment, both intellectually and ethically, and if its efforts should be supported and 
strengthened by the profession in the different States it would soon be impossible 
for anyone to register as an attorney who had not received full preliminary training. 
One difficulty, however, will stand in the way of enlisting all of the profession in 
behalf of higher legal education, unless they possess a greater degree of altruism 
than is sometimes accredited them, namely, that so much of the work falling to them 
results from the mistakes and ignorance of their compeers, and if deprived of this 
work they would lose something thereby, although gaining in the end.

LAW DEGREES. 
There are eight law schools which grant the degree of bachelor of laws after only one 
year of study. Most of the schools require two years, and a few require three years. 
Several schools grant the bachelor’s degree after completion of the regular course 
and then offer an additional year of study which entitles to the degree of master of 
laws. This is done by Cornell, Yale, the four schools at Washington, D. C., the Uni- 
versity Law School of New York City, the Michigan and Missouri Universities, and at 
Dickinson College, Pennsylvania. The New York Law School requires an attend- 
ance of four years in order to obtain the degree of master of laws. 
The Yale Law Schoo: grants the degree of bachelor of laws after two years of 
study, master of laws after three years, and doctor of civil law after four years of 
study. The catalogue says: ‘“ It is believed that the studies of the undergraduate 
course and those of the first year of the graduate course cover all the topics which 
it is desirable for the ordinary law student to examine before admission to the bar; 
and the fourth year, in which the degree of doctor of civil law is awarded, is recom- 
mended only to those who desire to fit themselves to be something more than prac- 
ticing attorneys.” 
In the District of Columbia admission to the bar can only be secured after three 
years’ study of law; hence large numbers of students take the course of two years 
for the degree of bachelor of laws,'and thena third year, which both gives the degree 
of master of laws and allows them to apply for examination for admission to the 
bar. If it were not for the requirement of three years of study, it is doubtful whether 
half as many students would take the third year’s course. 
President Henry Wade Rogers says: ‘In States wherea three years’ course of study 
is prescribed by statute or by rule of court as an essential qualification for admission 
to the bar, the law schools can readily establish and insist on the same period as 
a qualification of the bachelor’s degree. But when this is not the case the problem 
becomes more difficult, and the difficulty is enhanced when, in addition to the em- 
barrassment already alluded to, there happen to be in close proximity other schools 
conducted according to commercial rather than scholastic standards, and seeking for 
patronage by shorter terms and lower fees.” 
There are some law schools which have a course of three years prescribed, and in 
some cases mainly accepted by the students, but at the same time the privilege is 
allowed of completing the course in two years. The student can therefore receive 
the degree of bachelor of laws in two years. These schools are the University of 
Notre Dame, Indiana (see catalogue of 1893-94, p. 68), University of Maryland 
(catalogue of 1894, p. 15), Boston University (1893-94, p. 18), Harvard University 
(1893-94, p. 6), Metropolis Law School (1893-94, p. 12), and Western Reserve Univer- 
sity (1893-94, p. 11). 
Judging from the wording of the course of instruction in Columbia College Law 
School (catalogue of 1893-94, p. 152), it seems that students in some cases, with the 
consent of the faculty, can graduate in two years. 
The University of Pennsylvania and Hastings College of the Law (University of 
California) seem to be, therefore, the only two schools of law requiring under all 
circumstances three full years of study of law from students with full preliminary 
training. The catalogue of the University of Pennsylvania says: ‘Under the 
statutes of the university, the degree of bachelor of laws is granted to candidates 
who have attended upon the full course of instruction in the law department, and 
who have passed satisfactory examinations upon the subjects of instruction.” ‘‘The 
full course requires attendance for three years, and is graded. Students of the first- 
year class are not permitted to attend the lectures of the second and third year, and 
students of the second-year class are not permitted to attend the lectures of the third 
year.” 
The University of Pennsylvania also has a post-graduate course in law of two 
years, completion of which secures the title master of laws.   
 
-P-A-G-E-1058
  1000 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
The University of Michigan has announced that it will require a three years’ 
course of law, beginning with 1895-96. The University of Wisconsin has announced 
a similar intention. 
METHODS OF INSTRUCTION IN LAW. 
A question of considerable interest at the present time to the law schools is as to 
the best method of instructing the student inlaw There are three systems in use. 
In some law schools instruction is given mainly by lectures; in others it is given 
mainly by recitations upon lessons previously assigned, together with the usual 
explanations and comments; and in three schools it is given mainly by the presenta- 
tion and discussion of leading cases. 
The method most generally employed is that of lectures on the different subjects, 
followed the succeeding day by questions on the previous lecture. The students are 
also expected to read up the same subjects in their text-books, and there may be 
occasional examinations. 
The method coming next in general use is that of recitations upon lessons assigned 
in text-books, supplemented by occasional lectures. 
In nearly all of the schools there are moot courts, or, perhaps, regular practice 
courts, in which the students get experience in the actual discharge of the lawyer’s 
work. 
An examination of the catalogues of the majority of the schools has been made to 
ascertain the method of instruction mainly employed, but it should be stated that 
in nearly all the schools there are supplementary methods adopted, such as reviews, 
examinations, exercises in drafting contracts, conveyances, pleadings, indictments, 
and other legal papers, the criticism of briefs, arguments in moot courts, courses of 
reading, etc. 
In 33 schools the instruction is given mainly by lectures; in 24 schools it is given 
mainly by recitations from text-books. In three schools the discussion and expla- 
nation of leading cases is relied upon mainly. These three schools are Harvard 
University, the Metropolis Law School, and Western Reserve University. 
The New York Law School, the Iowa College of Law, and Kent Law School of 
Chicago are strongly in favor of what they call the Dwight method, in which the 
use of text-books enters largely; Yale University and the University of Nebraska 
also favor much the use of text-books. 
University of Alabama.—Lectures and text-books. 
University of California.—‘ All three systems of legal instruction are used, namely, 
a study of text-books, an examination of illustrative cases, and lectures.”

Buffalo Law School.—Lectures, leading cases, text-books. 
Cornell.—Lectures, text-books, cases. 
New York Law School.—Text-books, supplemented by explanatory lectures and the

described as follows: 
(1) “ Elementary and preparatory topics are studied before those which are more 
difficult and abstruse. 
(2) “The study of substantive law, embodying the principles of law in respect to 
rights, interests, estates, and obligations, and the reasons on which such principles 
rest, precedes the study of the law of procedure, i. e., of evidence, pleading, and 
practice. 
(3) “Any particular topic as, e. g., the law of contracts, the law of real property, 
etc., having been begun, is pursued continuously, day by day, until it is completed. 
In this way the topic is kept fresh and vivid in the student’s mind, the acquirements 
of each day’s study become the sure stepping stone to those of the next day, and the 
principles of classification and arrangement pursued in the development of the sub- 
ject are more likely to be clearly comprehended. 
(4) ‘‘The student is instructed in the principles of law and the reasons upon which 
they are based, and is taught to view the law as a system of principles and not as a 
mere aggregation or collection of cases decided by the courts. Though it be true 
that legal principles are to be deduced from the study of judicial decisions and of 
statutes, yet it is evident that the well-trained jurist, with his rich stores of legal 
learning, his ample experience, and his acquaintance with the rules of legal con- 
struction, is much better qualified for this work than the inexperienced student, hay- 
ing little or no knowledge of legal doctrines. Hence the student is not set at work 
primarily upon the reported cases or decisions in order that he may himself deduce 
therefrom the principles of law, but some valuable treatise written by a competent 
legal author, and presenting in orderly form and arrangement the body of legal 
principles relating to particular topic or branch of law, is studied carefully by the 
student from day to day and daily recitations are held in the class room. A certain 
portion of the text-book is assigned each day for the next day’s exercise, and the 
student is expected to master the rules and principles therein set forth so as to be 
able to state them clearly and accurately in his own language when called upon for 
recitation. Then, in the class-room, the professor endeavors, by exposition, by illus- 
tration, by simpler forms of statement than the author of the book may have used 
to resolve whatever difficulties may have been found by the students in their study 
of the treatise. He seeks to make especially prominent those principles of law which 
are of the most broad and comprehensive scope, and to classify subordinate rules and 
principles in their due relative order. 
“This study of legal principles finds in the reading of reported cases its appro- 
priate supplement. The student may properly begin such a practice of accessory 
reading early in his course of legal study, and gradually broaden the scope and 
extent of such reading as his legal knowledge becomes more full aiid comprehensive. 
Leading cases which are most valuable for collateral readiag will be cited to the

classes by the professors, who will also aim to embody in their daily exposition the 
conclusions to be derived from the most important decisions which have appeared 
since the text-book was published. In some topics volumes of selected cases, pre- 
pared by the professors, will be read in connection with the text-books for the pur- 
pose of illustration.” 
(5) ‘‘Reviews are held at proper intervals to impress the subjects taught more 
vividly and permanently upon the memory.” 
University of the City of New York.—The system of instruction is not framed upon 
the theory that there is one “best method” for instruction of all minds upon all

books; some subjects are taught mainly by selécted cases.

METHODS OF INSTRUCTION IN LAW. 
[From Proceedings of the American Bar Association, Saratoga, N. Y., 1894. 
President Henry Wade Rogers, of Evanston, Ill., on methods of instruction: 
“The great question which interests legal educators to-day is as to methods of 
instruction. The first method used was that of lectures. Mr. Justice Wilson lectured 
in the University of Pennsylvania, as did Chancellor Kent at Columbia, Story and 
Greenleaf and Parsons lectured at Harvard. The lecture system was ia the early 
days a matter of necessity, as there were no books suitable for the student to use. 
The text-book system of instruction came next, and last of all the case system.  
-P-A-G-E-1062
Se eR ae mr re ae ne oe ee Re ee eT EN eT See ee 
1004 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
The lecture system is to-day the prevailing method of instruction at the University 
of Michigan and at the University of Pennsylvania, and is used in a limited degree 
in almost all of the schools. Of the three systems it is, perhaps, the least in favor, 
and in the large majority of the schools is only resorted to in special subjects [?]. 
The text-book system seems to be the one most generally employed. It was used by 
Theodore W. Dwight at Columbia from the opening of that school until the termi- 
nation of his work as a law instructor. It has been the method favored at Yale, 
Boston, St. Louis, and the New York Law School. The case system was introduced 
at Harvard by Professor Langdell in 1870. Until recently it has not been favored 
by other schools. The schools attaching the most importance to the system and 
making the most use of it at present are Harvard, Columbia, the Metropolis Law 
School in New York, Cornell University, Northwestern University, and the law 
school of the Western Reserve University at Cleveland. No one of these three 
methods can be pronounced the best for all subjects and under all circumstances. 
The answer to the question which is best must depend on the character of the 
teacher and the taught, as well as on the branch taught. Very many of the schools 
adopt no one method, but make use of all three.” 
James H. Raymond, of Illinois: “It is the result of my observation that one or 
the other of these systems predominates in law schools, according to the aptitude of 
the professors to teach one or the other system. Then there is another comment 
which fits right in here. I think I see a very clear distinction between the students 
of one Eastern law school and another, and the complexion of their minds, and the 
law school at the Northwestern University. The method of instruction, and the 
management of the school in one place will not fit in the other place. We have not 
any students in the Northwestern University who are there simply because their 
fathers do not know what else to do with them. Each one is getting something out 
of the lectures and out of the case system, although I admit that in our school to-day 
the latter is being pushed because of the special ability of our professors in that 
direction. But I do not believe in it as a basis for legal education. The power of 
every man’s mind is the power of original thought, induction, and deduction. I was 
very glad to hear so frank a confession in the paper about it. You can not educate 
alawyer without educating him to think for himself, and, by so much as you put 
into him the power of original thought, which must be by inductive methods, in my 
opinion, by just so much do you make of him a lawyer instead of a machine.” 
Simeon E. Baldwin, of Connecticut: ‘I think there can be no question that the 
‘ease’ system must always be an important part of legal education. But what case 
system? Is there any system which can lay special claim to that denomination? Is 
there any law school which to-day does not make large and systematic use of cases 
in instruction? I venture to say there is none, and I think we almost might say 
that from the beginning of legal education in this country, one hundred and ten 
years ago, in the Litchfield Law School, cases were used, though sparingly, for the 
purpose of instruction as well as of illustration. There seems to be a certain sort 
of evolution which has gone on during the last few years in regard to the systematic 
use of cases in law-schoo! teaching. When I studied law—for atime at Yale and for 
atime at Harvard—cases were freely referred to by the instructor, by no means 
simply by way of illustration, but as a basis of exploration on the part of the stu- 
dent—as monuments in judicial history. Marbury v. Madison. What man who was 
at the Harvard Law School thirty years ago who does not remember the insistence 
with which that case was commended to the attention of the student? 
“We should regard it as wiser to make the lecture the main thing and the cases 
the additional thing, rather than to make the cases the main thing and the lecture 
the additional thing. If we are examining a certain subject in the line of question 
and answer between professor and student, we should think it better to give them a 
chapter of the author and cases and examine them upon both rather than to give 
them either alone. I mean particularly the advanced student, for I confess I can

PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION. 1005 
not bring myself to believe that the best way to teach a young man just beginning 
law is to plunge him at once into even Ames’s cases. When I began the study of 
Euclid they made me learn some axioms and propositions, and I am very thankful 
they did. When I began to go to school they made me learn a certain thing they 
called the multiplication table. It was not explained to me in a very philosophical 
way, but they made me learn it. There are certain things that we must make these 
young men learn and remember, and then go on to build, to induce and to deduce. 
But there must be a foundation, it seems to me, and the best place to go for that 
foundation is where the rules and doctrines and principles are most clearly laid 
down. Ishould be very sorry to see text-books disappear from a legitimate place 
in law-school instruction.” 
Amasa M. Eaton, of Rhode Island: ‘It seems to me that perhaps the term ‘case 
system’ is in itself rather unfortunate. Would it not be better to distinguish it as 
a Socratic method? for that seems to be the distinguishing mark—I had almost said 
the distinguishing excellence—of that system of teaching law. I have studied under 
both systems. Let me explain what I understand by the Socratic system. Certain 
eases are given out the day beforehand and the students have time to look them over. 
They come in witha certain amount of study upon those cases. Mr. A is called upon: 
‘Will you state the case of Brown v. Jones?’ He states it. That teaches him how 
to group and state accurately facts, which in itself is a very important element in 
alawyer’s career. He is then asked, perhaps, ‘Mr. A, do you agree with the case? 
Ifso, state why.’ Mr. A then states that he either does or does not agree with it, 
and states the ground for his belief. The professor then calls upon someone who is 
of the opposite mind, and some other student states his reasons for his dissent. In 
that way the class room is immediately divided, and it is like the trial of a case in 
court. When both sides have finished, the teacher sums up, and then, perhaps, 
announces his opinion. The result is, as it seems to me, that the principles which 
have been illustated, which have been brought out of the minds of the students, will 
forever remain fixed in their memories. It is not because they have read them in 
some books, but it is because they have been brought out of themselves. That seems 
to me to be the highest form of education. I would not advocate the exclusive use 
of this system. There are certain principles of law which can not be so well studied 
in this way. There are certain cases which must be studied. Take, for instance, 
the rule in Shelley’s case. There is an absolute principle of law, and we must all 
learn it. Combined with this some teachers give definitions, so that the terms 
which are to be used a few days afterwards in the study of certain cases are under- 
stood before reaching the cases. It certainly seems to me, looking at itin this point 
of view, that this method has advantages over all others. I agree that a great deal 
depends upon the personality of the teacher, and a method which will work well in 
the hands of one man will not work well in the hands of another; but, all things 
considered, it seems to me that this method possesses peculiar excellence and is in 
itself scientific.” 
Austin Abbott, of New York: ‘“We should endeavor to promote the improvement 
of legal education by pointing out to those who have never used the case system 
how they can wisely and judiciously, if they wish, begin to try it, and see how it 
works with their own method of instruction and with their students, and to gain from 
those who are using the case system also some suggestions of how text-book and 
lecture instruction may supplement, enlarge, and fill out the gaps and hiatus of case 
instruction. 
“T can not doubt that if I wanted myself to learn the best statement of the law 
it would be incomplete for me to read Chancellor Kent’s Judgments in Court without 
looking into his Commentaries to see how he coordinated that case with all the 
other cases on the subject. A case runs one line and another case runs another line 
of decisions, and a third case another principle. I apprehend we shall find that the 
true solution of this question will be in giving some case instruction and in filling  
-P-A-G-E-1064
  1006 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
in the broad hiatus between the cases with that coordination of principles which is 
to be aided best by the recent discussion of jurists, considering the law in the light 
of the broad interests of society, and not confined to the narrow compass of one state- 
ment of facts; and therein I think we shall find (there are text-books and text-books) 
the indispensable value of text-books with cases, as giving not merely a single line 
of thought with an instructor’s opinion on the subject, but giving them that same 
great jurist’s view of the coordination of that with all its fellow-cases.” 
John F. Dillon, of New York: ‘Now, it ismy judgment that Harvard has taught 
the law schools of the country a great lesson in emphasizing the extreme importance 
of cases as an element of teaching. It makes a vast difference, certainly, whether 
the teacher states a principle of law in the form of a lecture and propounds it to the 
student whose mind is new, or whether he refers the student to some case which has 
actually arisen, selected with judgment, in order to illustrate the point, and which is 
thus made, as it were, an object lesson, so that he sees the principle in connection 
with its application. Ifastudent is given forty pages of some text-book as his lesson, 
and that isnot unusual, I believe, and he is required to come into the lecture room the 
next morning prepared to recite them, although the teacher has given out that they 
will find this principle illustrated in such and such a case, if it is optional with the 
student to read that case and you have a class of one hundred or two hundred stu- 
dents, I ask you how many will actually read the case? 
“T should say that the first want of these law schools would be a compilation of 
cases so multiplied that the students can have access to them, or each one can be 
supplied with them. Having given this much testimony in favor of the case system— 
and I think it has been underrated—when it is sought to erect that as the only 
method of instruction, and I have learned that it is not, then that would be equiva- 
lent to saying that there is no such thing as elementary conceptions of law. When 
there runs throughout the jurisprudence of Europe and America the broad distinetion 
between the law of realty and the law of personalty, do you have to refer a student 
to some case or line of cases to teach him that there is in English and American law 
this wide distinction, and require him to arrive at it by some process of induction? 
I think not. That would be wasting his time. There are elementary truths and 
conceptions and definitions in law that are adapted to be taught as such; therefore 
to make it obligatory to the student to try to get at them by a process of original 
thought is time wasted. If the law is not a science, and if it does not consist of a 
comparatively few principles capable of expression, then we ought to abolish the law_ 
schools. 
“Doubtless the method of teaching law, or how it can best be taught, is an impor- 
tant subject, but it is not all-important. It is wise to discuss and consider it, but it 
would not be wise to let it engross our whole or even our chief attention. What 
Pope said of forms of government may, I think, be said with much more justness of 
methods of teaching—‘that which is best administered is best.’ The man whom 
nature designed to be a teacher of law will, despite all theories, teach it after his 
own manner. He will impress his own personality upon his work. It is the man, 
not the method, that tells. The crucial test is whether the teacher can inspire a 
living interest in the student and get from him the best work that in him lies, for, 
after all, the student must himself do all the work and the thinking which shall 
accomplish him in the learning and mystery of his profession.” 
Woodrow Wilson, of Princeton, N. J.: ‘‘The question is, whether the law, when 
taught as a profession, should be taught by the inductive use of cases. or by the 
deductive use of principles already extracted from the cases and furnished in texts. 
The teaching of law as a profession should no more be irrational than the teaching 
of it as part of a liberal education or as a preparation for law studies. The caso 
method, therefore, falls short and is slavish if it stops in each instance with the first 
case in a series. Where did the court get their principle from in the first case, if 
there was, indeed, neither statute nor precedent; and, if there was a statute, what 
   
-P-A-G-E-1065
    PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION. 1007 
guided them to its interior meaning? Such are the questions which reveal to the 
student, when successfully answered, the real genesis and significance of law. In 
like manner, the text-book method is neither philosophical nor really instructive 
unless the principles made use of are challenged, cross-questioned, and made to give 
arational account of themselves. It is only when principle is thus realized as a 
living and necessary thing, with as clear a pedigree and explanation as a horse or a 
king, that it can become really a part of the lawyer’s thought and judgment and 
professional equipment. The first case, of course, came to the judges out of a special 
set of circumstances in the community around them, and they were able to decide it 
because they understood the conditions out of which it had arisen and knew what 
those conditions demanded. They pluck out the heart of a statute in the same way 
by understanding what gave rise to its enactment and what it is that it is intended 
to accomplish. The judge, after all, if he be of the sort we quote and make a veri- 
table authority of, is a seer and a man who might have been a statesman or a professor 
of political science. The ‘common’ law we believe to have arisen out of custom— 
out of the life of the people; and have not all our writers upon the common law, 
from astute Sir Matthew Hale down to formal Mr. Broom, assumed that statutes are 
made but in supplement to it or amendment of it, as if it were complete and they 
exceptional? This is plainly the assumption of the celebrated maxims with regard 
to the interpretation of statutes: ‘What was the common law before the making of 
the act?’ ‘What was the mischief and defect against which the common law did 
not provide?’ ‘What remedy has the legislature devised and applied?’ ‘The true 
reason of the remedy?’ And have you not noted the result of this process of inter- 
pretation—the new law held up to the standard of the old and treated as if it were 
meant, of course, to be fitted into it? Old statutes disappear, as it were, by diges- 
tion into the general body of principles; or, rather, for the process is deliberate, 
they are kneaded into the mass by much pressing and handling in the courts, until 
writers are sorely puzzled to distinguish common from statute law. New statutes, 
too, immediately begin to feel and yield to the same process. In time they, too, will 
be so knitted into the body of the law by the careful stitches of successive genera- 
tions of judges as to have become fairly indistinguishable from the material with 
which they have been combined. Through the courts they are being played upon 
and weather-beaten by the practical conditions of the economic and moral life of 
the community, and so are being steadily molded by forces which the student must 
afterwards reexamine if he would comprehend and veritably master the law which 
is their product. 
“To take a definite example, in order to make my meaning clearer, it is a favorite 
idea of mine that commercial law should be taught along with the history of com- 
merce, which will make it plain what gave rise to the relations of business with 
which the law deals, how the forms of commercial negotiation and of commercial 
paper came into existence, and how statutes and all the imperative regulations of 
the law have come after the fact, fixing obligations already habitually recognized, 
or at any rate ready to be put into form, and so, simply serving merchants, not invent- 
ing transactions for them. One portion of our law we already study in this way— 
the law of real property. It has retained forms and phrases which we can not 
understand without turning back to examine the feudal system and the social con- 
ditions of the Middle Ages; and so we are happily obliged to give heed to its genesis, 
We ought to do the same for every portion of the law.” 
M. J. Wade, of Iowa: ‘‘I think it is immaterial what system a professor teaches 
by, whether by the lecture, or the case, or the text-book system, or all three com- 
bined. I dare say that no man of experience in teaching law will undertake to 
teach law so dependent upon cases, whether he follows the text-book system for his 
basis or not, and nob only depend upon them, but insist that students shall read 
them. There is no question, in my mind, that the point is where the student 
embraces a knowledge of what the general principle is; that then, in the application  
-P-A-G-E-1066
  1008 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
of those principles to the various states of facts that are presented, the case is the 
best medium to impart that knowledge.” 
Edmund Wetmore, of New York: ‘‘A controversy conducted with great earnest- 
ness has been carried on of late years between the advocates of the so-called ‘text- 
book’ and ‘case’ systems as methods of legal education. In such a controversy it 
becomes any lawyer who lacks experience in actual teaching to speak with diffidence, 
but some things relating to the matter are within the range of ordinary observation 
and reasoning. 
“The difference between the two methods of legal instruction consists, as I under- 
stand it, essentially in this: By the text-book system the study of a standard text- 
book, enforced by recitation and accompanied by lectures and comment, is made the 
foundation for the introduction of the student to the study of the law. The chief 
aim is the direct study of principles and definitions—their meaning, their reason, 
their history. Cases are used at first mainly forillustration. As the student advances, 
the practice of examining the authorities becomes more frequent, and he acquires 
experience in ascertaining the precise point decided in any given case, and in deduc- 
ing the rules to be devised by the collation and comparison of the cases relating to 
particular topics. 
“Tn the case system, as it is explained by those who teach it, the reported cases 
are the basis of instruction, and the classification and exposition of the principles to 
be derived from the cases is given wholly by oral discussion or exposition incidental 
to the examination of the cases, or by occasional reference to the text-books. Of 
course, there is no hard and fast line of demarcation between these two methods, 
and the extent to which relative resort may be profitably had to the text-book or 
the cases as the basis of instruction will largely depend upon the experience and 
particular methods of each individual instructor; but there is, nevertheless, a plain 
distinction between the two systems. The difference in this respect, in the course of 
instruction pursued in different law schools, all of high standing, is marked, and 
both systems, in the hands of competent instructors, prove highly successful in their 
results. 
“Notwithstanding this last fact, however, if I understand what for convenience 
may be called the case system, it seems to me that it is not strictly philosophical, 
and is, consequently, liable to defects in practice. 
“This may appear, at first sight, just the reverse of the truth, for as principles are 
derived from cases and the cases are the record of the application of those princi- 
ples, and to learn how to apply principles to facts is the business of the practicing 
lawyer, one would say that the study of cases was the direct path to learning the 
theory and practice of the law at the same time. But this view overlooks the 
natural operation of the mind in apprehending and mastering, for the first time, an 
applied science. The best way to teach a student to draw principles from cases may 
not be to set him at once to drawing conclusions as best he can, leaving it to the 
teacher to point out his mistakes. In teaching any science there is a certain amount 
of preliminary work to be done before the student begins to learn the art of: apply- 
ing its principles. I believe the most efficient method of giving this necessary pre- 
liminary instruction is to give it directly in a systematic form, rather than to confine 
the instruction to commentary upon instances of its application. A cadet may learn 
navigation wholly on shipboard by taking his turn at the wheel, and gradually 
picking up the principles of the science by daily familiarity with their application 
and by oral instructions from older officers; but he not only would have learned the 
art more easily, but his practical knowledge would always retain a more scientific 
basis, if he had had a preliminary course in the theory of navigation derived from 
the best text-books under a competent instructor, even if he went through such a 
course before he ever set foot on the deck of a vessel. It was noticeable that, almost 
without exception, the men who rose to the highest commands and accomplished the 
greatest results, on both sides, during our civil war, were not those who rose from

the ranks, or those whose sole training had been from actual experience in the field, 
but those who had been grounded in the theory of the art of war on land and sea by 
the systematic course of study pursued in the class rooms at Annapolis and West. 
Point. The same rule holds true in natural sciences, in medicine, in chemistry, in 
botany. Some knowledge—some elementary, carefully inculcated and methodically 
arranged knowledge of principles and laws—should precede, and, where those 
sciences are taught, almost invariably does precede, the study of those principles 
and laws in their application, except so far as their application is studied by way 
of illustration of the text. 
“This will not, perhaps, be disputed as a general proposition, but as applied to 
the study of law the advocates of the case system hold, as I understand it, that the 
student at the very beginning of his course should be given a number of selected 
cascs to read in order to find out as well as he can what they decide, and the neces- 
sary elementary knowledge as to principles intended to be applied in those cases is 
furnished by oral instruction and colloquy in the class room. 
“Ttseems to me that this mode of inculeating fundamental principles lacks the 
method and precision of statement which belong to a carefully prepared treatise or 
written lecture, and yet a methodical arrangement and division of the topics and 
subtopics is surely the most efficient means of apprehending those topics in the 
first instance and implanting them in the mind of the student without confusion, 
while precision of statement as to fundamental definitions and rules of law is not 
only necessary for accuracy, but one who has thoroughly learned the rules thus 
exactly expressed has a foundation of the greatest value throughout his practice, 
just as the fundamental rules of grammar or the fundamental rules and definitions 
of mathematics which were learned at school serve the professional linguist or the 
civil engineer in the subsequent practical application of the sciences to which they 
respectively relate. I find it hard to believe, for example, that a student of average 
ability and industry, knowing nothing of the law, and who in the year 1765 had set 
himself the task of acquiring a knowledge of the laws of England, could by two or 
even three years’ study of the reports as they then stood, under competent instruc- 
tion, have acquired as thorough an understanding or as comprehensive and philo- 
sophical a view of those laws as he would have done if, under equally competent 
instruction, the basis of his studies had been the masterly commentaries of Sir Wil- 
liam Blackstone. Further, as it seems to me, the process of drawing principles from 
cases is necessarily too slow to coverasufficiently extensive field to meet the require- 
ments of a proper course of study, especially if that course be limited to two years. 
The primary object of legal instruction is to teach the student what the law is upon 
a sufficiently large number of topics to give him a general knowledge of all its most 
important branches. Secondarily, he should be taught the art of finding out what 
the law is by searching the authorities, but the first is the most important for his 
student days, because his practice will constantly teach him the latter, and the 
more that practice grows the less time it will leave him for any professional studies 
outside his own cases. 
“Tf it be said that knowledge thus acquired is superficial, and that this applies to 
‘the knowledge which attempts to cover a wide field of law, and is based on text- 
book reading and case illustration, the answer, as it seems to me, is that knowledge 
thus acquired is not, or at least ought not to be, superficial, but merely elementary. 
And elementary law and elementary principles are all that a law course can profita- 
bly undertake to cover. The most it can accomplish is not to turn out a completed 
lawyer, but one who is fitted to become a lawyer. If it supplies him with the requi- 
site elementary knowledge and starts him right, it is all that the law school can do. 
“‘And in starting him right too great pains can not be taken to impress upon his 
mind the true character of the fundamental principles which underlie our law, and 
to teach him to regard it in its proper light as a science resting fundamentally, not 
upon the exposition of the judge, as the Roman law depended upon the reseripts of

an absolut, emperor, but upon the enlightened conscience of the people by whom the 
law is ultij.ately formed. The reports are not the only source from which these 
_ principles aye to be learned. The court, in giving its decision and the reasons 
therefor, always proceeds upon the theory of the existence of a higher authority than 
itself, and in tracing the prineiples which the courts are called upon to apply to 
their deepest ascertainable source by collating and classifying them, by asking, 
‘How did they arise?” ‘Upon what reasons do they rest ? the student is making that 
higher authority the direct object of his researches, and learning to appreciate that, 
rightly understood, the law is indeed the perfection of human reason. Whatever 
the method by which this end is sought, no one will question that it is the end to 
which all methods should be directed. He best argues his cases who considers not 
how he can match his facts with precedents as he might match from his hand in a 
game of dominoes, but how he ean best rest the judgment that he seeks upon the 
right and reason of the law.” 
William A. Keener, of New York: “It is a curious contradiction that at a time 
when it is universally recognized that the teaching of law is one of the functions to 
be discharged by a university, opposition should be raised to the adoption of a 
method of teaching law that is applied in nearly all departments of university work. 
“Tn view of the well-known conservatism of lawyers, I can not help feeling that 
this opposition is explained in part by ignorance of tho faet that the teaching of law 
by the study of cases is but the application to the study of law of a method that 
has been almost universally accepted in other departments of education. I must 
confess to surprise on ascertaining the extent to which it has been applied in all 
departments of education, not only in colleges and universities, but even in the 
secondary schools. Because of this ignorance on my part I was somewhat surprised 
when I was informed recently by a distinguished educatur whom I told of the prepa- 
ration of this paper that the theory of the inductive method was accepted so univer- 
sally to-day in educational circles that an assumption that argument was necessary 
to support it would create merriment in a large gathering of teachers which was 
then about to convene. 
“An examination of the report of the committee of ten on secondary school studies 
appointed by the National Educational Association at a meeting held at this place 
last year, and published by the United States Bureau of Education, shows how 
strongly the method is recommended for the use of secondary schools. Of its recog- 
nition to-day by colleges and universities of which we are accustomed to expect the 
best methods there can be no question. Indeed, ten years ago (and the strides in 
educational methods during the last ten years have been great) we find the principle 
fully recognized in the teaching of natural science, and even prior to that time the 
method had been applied in the teaching of history, and is now regarded by the best 
educators as the proper method of historical study. It is of this method that Prof. 
Herbert B. Adams, of Johns Hopkins University, says: ‘The main principle of his- 
torical training at the Johns Hopkins University is to encourage independent 
thought and research. Little heed is given to text-books or the mere phraseology 
of history, but all stress is laid upon clear and original statements of fact and opin- 
ion, whether the student’s own or the opinion of a consulted author. The compara- 
tive method of reading and study is followed by means of assigning to individual 
members of the class separate topics, with references to various standard works. 
These topics are duly reported upon by the appointees, either ex tempore, with the 
aid of a few notes, or in formal papers, which are discussed at length by the class. 
The oral method has been found to afford a better opportunity than essays for ques- 
tion and discussion, and it is in itself a good means of individual training, for the 
student thereby learns to think more of substance than of form.’ 
“A higher authority than Professor Adams can not be quoted, and a nearer 
approach to the case method of instruction can not be found than the method 
described by him. Itseems to be no longer true that the student of history is given
-P-A-G-E-1069
  PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION. 1011 
a text-book from which to recite, as one would recite from the pages of a Latin 
grammar, but is referred to the accessible authorities, which he is required to exam- 
ine with a view to forming conclusions and expressing opinion. Indeed, not only is 
the student of history to-day required to study in this way, but he is often, when 
the material is available, especially if he is studying as a professional student in 
history, required to go to the original sources and make investigations. 
“Tf Inw is a seience—and if it is not ascience it has no place in the curriculum 
of a university—all will agree that the most scientifie method should be adopted in 
teaching law. Why, then, has not the inductive method, which has been so univer- 
sally accepted, been more generally applied to the teaching of law? It can not be 
for the reason that the object of a legal education differs from that of education in 
general. The object of education generally is stated as follows in the report of the 
committee of ten, to which I have befere referred: ‘The principal end of all educa- 
tion is training. * * * The mind is chiefly developed in three ways: by culti- 
vating the powers of discriminating observation, by strengthening the logical fac- 
ulty of following an argument from point to point, and by improving the process of 
comparison—that is, the judgment.’ Can anyone question that the power of dis- 
criminating observation, that the possession of the logical faculty of following an 
argument from point to point, and the ability to judge accurately are among the 
most indispensable qualities of alawyer? If they are, why is not the method which 
will enable the student to acquire these faculties, while at the same time possessing 
himself of a fund of information, the one best adapted to the study of law? Itis 
for this reason that it does best enable one to think vividly, analyze accurately, to 
reason and express himself clearly, and in the case of applied sciences to apply 
effectually the knowledge that he has gained that the induetive method has obtained 
such a hold to-day. I shall endeavor to show hereafter that this method is well 
adapted to the imparting of information. 
“ Assuming the method to have been properly adopted in other departments of edu- 
cation, why should it net be adopted in the study of law? Must it be rejected for 
the want of material? When one remembers that sufficient material has been found 
accessible for the teaching of history by the inductive method this question answers 
itself, for in no other department of education is there found material so rich, so 
abundant, and so accessible asin that of law. Since the advocates of the inductive 
system believe that in law as in other sciences the student, where it is possible, 
should be referred to the original sources as the basis of instruction, and not allowed. 
to consult simply the deductions that may have been drawn by writers from sources 
equally accessible to the student, the material to which I refer is, of course, the 
adjudicated cases found in the reports of the decisions of the courts in this country, 
in England, and in other countries where our system of law prevails. 
“Por the purposes of the inductive method it is quite immaterial, as has been 
pointed out by the committee of the American Bar Association on legal education, 
whether the cases are to be regarded as the original sources, in the sense that they 
make the law as a statute makes law, or simply as evidence of the law, and but an 
application of principles to particular facts. ‘That the decided cases,’ says the 
committee, ‘are the sources from which all must learn what the law is, no intelli- 
gent common-law lawyer will dispute. Our very treatises and text-books derive 
from the cases they quote all the authority they have.’ If the authority of treatises 
and text-books is derived from the cases, then the treatises and text-books must be 
derivative, while the cases are the original sources; and he who consults the text- 
book as a substitute for the cases gets his information at secondhand. It was to 
emphasize this fact, I take it, and not to belittle the value of treatises or to speak 
disparagingly of the authors thereof, that the leader of the New York bar, Mr. 
James C. Carter, in his advocacy of the case system, spoke of students studying 
thereunder obtaining their knowledge from the original sources, while he, as a stu- 
dent, studying under the text-book system, was compelled to get his knowledge at

secondhand. It has been suggested, in opposition to the case system, that a student 
in natural science would not be expected to study simply by examining a specimen, 
without any further explanation, the inference being that a case is no more signifi- 
cant to a student of law than a specimen would be to a beginner in science. It is 
submitted that the illustration is not in point. To make the illustration apposite, 
one must suppose that the student in natural science has a choice of studying in 
one of two ways—either by taking the specimen, which is regarded as establishing 
some great truth in natural science, and taking with it the memoir of the discoverer 
of the fact or principle and studying the specimen in the light of the memoir or, 
on the other hand, discarding the memoir and specimen and taking instead the 
deduction that some writer has drawn from an examination of the specimen and the 
study of the memoir. Under the approved methods of to-day the student would 
be referred to the specimen and to the memoir, if accessible, and not to the opinion 
that some writer has expressed about them. In other words, he uses both a labora- 
tory and a library. Now the case is, to the student of law, both a laboratory and a 
library. The facts of the case correspond to the specimen, and the opinion of the 
court announcing the principles of law to be applied to the facts correspond to the 
memoir of the discoverer of a great scientific truth, and constitute the library. If 
I may borrow a simile and change its application, the facts of the case correspond 
to the apple which suggested to Sir Isaac Newton the law of gravitation; the 
opinion is his organon. For the suggested analogy of putting a specimen into the 
hands of the student of natural science, to be applicable to the case system, one 
must suppose the student to be given the bare facts of the case, without the opinion 
of the court. The bare facts of cases are given to the student at the end of acourse 
to test his knowledge of the subject. The facts of a case, together with the 
opinion of the court, are given to the student during his course to enable him to 
prepare himself in advance for the exercise of the lecture room and to acquire by 
the study and discussion thereof, together with the aids hereinafter suggested, a 
scientific and practical working knowledge of the fundamental principles of law. 
“Tt has been suggested that the study of cases as the basis of instruction in law 
is founded on the idea that we have no jurists. Such, however, is not the case, the 
system of teaching law by cases being based solely on the idea that in law, as in 
other sciences, when the sources from which writers have drawn their conclusions 
are equally accessible to the student as to the writer, it is better to have the student 
study in the original sources, under proper direction and assistance, than to study 
in the first instance conclusions which are merely derivative. Furthermore, it must 
be remembered that in a system of law where a judge renders not simply a judg- 
ment for the plaintiff or the defendant, but delivers an opinion stating the reasons 
for the conclusions reached, judges are not simply magistrates, but jurists. But it 
may be asked, If each case contains such an elaborate explanation of the principles 
of law applicable to the facts of the case, what advantage has the study of cases 
over the study of a treatise dealing with the same subject? 
“The objection to the use of the treatise is that the student who takes up a text- 
book immediately finds the results of another’s labor, and receives that other's 
conclusions without participating with him in the process which has enabled him to 
produce the result. The book may be a book consisting of general principles simply, 
or a statement of principles illustrated by the author’s own statement of the cases 
on which he bases his conclusions. If it is a book containing a statement of prin- 
ciples simply, a student labors under the disadvantage of having put before him a 
body of rules pertaining to an applied science, and he not only labors under the 
d'sadvantage of being simply a recipient of results without going through the proc- 
esses by which they were reached, but the rules are almost meaningless to him, for 
the reason that they are nothing more than abstractions. If the book contains not 
only a statement of the principles, but also a statement of cases by way of illustra- 
tion, it is still open to the objection that he is merely receiving results, and the
-P-A-G-E-1071
    
PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION. 1013 
illustration serves simply to corroborate the statements and explain the meaning of 
the writer, and does not enable the student to apply the principle to cases involving 
the same principle of law but differing in their facts, for the reason that the author, 
having summed up the law and stated in advance the conclusion reached as a 
matter of law, no opportunity is given the student to exercise his judgment as to 
the result that should be reached on the facts placed before him. The mind of the 
student who studies under the text-book system has been compared to a sponge. 
My own opinion, formed after much observation of students who have studied under 
the text-book method, is, if one is to judge of their knowledge from their ability or 
inability to apply the rules to the cases that may be suggested to them, that the 
mind of such a student is much more sieve-like than sponge-like. And does not this 
statement appeal to the experience of men in all the affairs of life? How is it possi- 
ble for a man to work out a difficult problem of any kind whose only preparation 
for the work consists in having had certain results stated to him and certain illus- 
trations of the meaning thereof given him? Is it not our experience, all through 
life, beginning with childhood, that we understand most thoroughly and remember 
longest that which we have acquired as a result of labor. on our own part? How 
many students will do independent thinking and critical reading while preparing 
twenty pages of Parsons on Contracts for a lecture? But suppose you take the same 
subject-matter, and instead of giving him Parsons’s treatment thereof you put into 
the student’s hands a few cases involving the principles, but contradicting each 
other in many particulars, and perhaps reaching opposite results. Can a student 
capable of thought fail to think, and, having thought, whatever his conclusions 
may be, willnot the lecture that he attends, where he will have his conclusions either 
confirmed or questioned, mean more to him and produce a more lasting impression? 
Can anyone imagine any subject dependent upon and involving human reason 
where the consideration and discussion of a question, in advance of the announce- 
ment of certain results, would not lead to a better understanding and more lasting 
impression of the subject under consideration? To quote from an address of Mr, 
Justice Holmes, of the Massachusetts supreme court, an earnest advocate of the 
system, though not trained under it as a student: ‘Does not a man remember a con- 
crete instance more vividly than a general principle? And is not a principle more 
exactly and intimately grasped as the unexpressed major premise of the half-dozen 
examples which mark its extent and its limits than it can be in any abstract form 
of words? Expressed or unexpressed, is it not better known when you have studied 
its embryology and the lines of its growth than when you merely see it lying dead 
before you on the printed page?’ 
“The advocates of the case system believe, to quote from the same authority, that 
‘to make a general principle worth anything you must give it a body; you must 
show in what way and how far it would be applied actually in an actual system; 
you must show how it has emerged as the felt reconciliation of concrete instances 
no one of which established it in terms. Finally, you must show its historic rela- 
tions to other principles, often of very different date and origin, and then set it in 
tho perspective, without which its proportions will never be truly judged;’ and that 
students should not be sent forth ‘with nothing but a rag bag full of general prin- 
ciples, a throng of glittering generalities like a swarm of little bodiless cherubs 
fluttering at the top of one of Correggio’s pictures.’ 
“How does the practicing lawyer of to-day, investigating a question with a view 
to preparing an opinion or writing a brief, inform himself? Is it by reading a text- 
book and seeking to understand the author’s point of view in the light of the illus- 
tration which an author may use, or does he use the treatise much as he does a 
digest, for the purpose of finding the original sources, the examination of which, 
when found, constitutes his real work and enables him to deal with the subject under 
consideration? No one will question that the latter is the method by which the 
successful lawyer of to-day accomplishes results. And if this is the way in which 
 
-P-A-G-E-1072
  1014 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
the lawyer needs to inform himself, why should not the same method he used by the 
student? No one would condemn more severely than the believers in the case system 
the indiscriminate reading by students of a mass of unclassified decisions. Under 
the case system, however, the student is not referred to a mass of cases nor to an 
unclassified list of cases. He is, in fact, referred to a few classified cases, selected 
with a view to developing the cardinal principles of the topics under consideration, 
In other words, under the case system the student is given the material to which 
both lawyers and judges resort, but his investigations are made under the direction 
and with the assistance of his instructor. 
“Tf the student were given only cases which, from the instructor’s point of view, 
were correctly decided, the study of cases would be more like the use of a text-book 
containing illustrations of principles; but even then the case system would offer 
this distinct advantage, that the student would be required to express in his own 
language the material facts in the case and the exact principle which the egurt con- 
sidered necessary to the decision thereof, whereas in the text-book system, if the 
author has been successful in his work, the student finds it done for him. In truth, 
however, the attempt is made, in selecting cases for the use of the student, to pre- 
sent the same principle from many points of view, as involved in the same or differ- 
ent facts and as considered by different minds, and the decision may be good or bad 
in principle, and may or may not be recognized as law. The student is thereby 
forced, not only to analyze cases, but to compare them, to discriminate and choose 
between them. The incentive for sound thinking, in advance of the exercise of the 
lecture room, is the fact that his opinions are subject to review in the class room, 
and will be made the subject of criticism by both the students and the instructor. 
The exercise in the class room consists in astatement and discussion by the students 
of the cases studied by them in advance. This discussion is under the direction of 
the instructor, who makes such suggestions and expresses such opinions as seem 
necessary. The student is required to analyze each case, to discriminate between 
the relevant and the irrelevant, between the actual and possible grounds of decision, 
and, having thus considered the case, he is prepared and required to deal with it in 
its relation to other cases. In other words, the student is practically doing, under 
the guidance of the instructor, what he will be required to do without guidance as 
alawyer. While the student’s reasoning powers are being thus constantly devyel- 
oped, and while he is gaining the power of analysis and synthesis, he is also gaining 
the other object of legal education, namely, a knowledge of what the law actually is. 
“T spoke at the beginning of this paper of the conservatism of the bar, explaining 
in part the opposition that has been raised to the teaching of law by the study of 
eases. I think, however, an examination of the objections that have been raised to 
this method will establish that the opposition is almost entirely due to a misunder- 
standing as to the use made of the cases, and the object sought to be attained by 
their use. We are told, for example, by the opponents of the system, that the 
teaching of law by cases may make men academically learned in the lawasa science, 
but will not make lawyers. Again we are told that the case system is vicious, for 
the reason that it makes simply case lawyers. Now, it is an impossibility for a man 
to be academically learned in the law as a science, and at the same time to be 
nothing but a case lawyer. The truth is, that one of the great arguments in favor 
of the case system is that it deals with both the scientific and the practical side of 
law. In so far as it deals with the scientific side of law, compelling the student to 
search for and apply the great and fundamental principles of law to the actual 
affairs of life, it prevents his becoming a mere case lawyer—a case lawyer being one 
who has a great memory for cases and their facts, but little apprehension of the 
principles governing the decisions. While the study of principles, which is the 
essential feature of the case system, is inconsistent with the production of a case 
lawyer, the fact that the student in studying a principle is required to study it in its 
growth and development as found in its application to the actual affairs of life fur-

; PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION. 1015 
nishes a complete check upon any tendency to become speculative and visionary, 
or academically learned, as distinguished from a scientific lawyer capable of apply- 
ing the principles of law as they exist, and suggesting improvements therein. 
“Tn the opinion of those who believe in the case system itis the study of prin- 
ciples in the abstract, and not in the concrete, that produces the man simply 
academically learned, and it is the use of eases by the students not as sources of the 
Jaw, but as illustrative merely that produces the case lawyer. When the cases are 
studied, not by way of illustration, but as the sources of law, the danger to guard 
against is not that the student may become a case lawyer, but that he may not have 
a sufficient regard for cases which, in his opinion, are not well founded in principle. 
“Tho statement that the system tends to make a case lawyer is founded on the 
radically erroneous idea that the object of putting cases in the hands of the students 
is to have them memorize the cases, as distinguished from analyzing them. A stu- 
dent is only required to charge his memory so far as is necessary to enable him to 
deal intelligently with the case in the discussion and consideration thereof in 
the class room, and he is advised, certainly, by many teachers under the system, to 
reduce the strain on his memory to a minimum by making his own headnotes with 
which to refresh his memory for the exercises of the class room. In other words, 
the case is simply material from which a principle is to be extracted. 
“Tt is not to produce a man academically learned that the study of law by cases 
is urged, but because it is believed, to use the language of Mr. Dicey, ‘that to master 
the rules of English law you must study these rules as applied to the affairs of life;’ 
that ‘the lawyer or student who really enters into the results of a line of leading 
cases learns more than a few verbal maxims which may be committed to memory ;’ 
that ‘he sees what is the true meaning of legal doctrines when applied to facts;’ 
that he ‘becomes’, as Mr. Finch well expresses it, ‘familiar with the tone of thought, 
the attitude of mind which prevails in our courts;? * * * that ‘he learns, in 
short, by the only method by which it can be learned, the notion of justice which 
the lawyers and judges of England have developed by labors extending over cen- 
turies, and have impressed upon the minds of the English people.’ What Mr. Dicey 
says of English lawyers and judges is, of course, equally true of American lawyers 
and judges. 
“The objection that the student, under this system, is taught to regard law as a 
mere aggregation of cases, is simply another way of stating that the system pro- 
duces case lawyers, and is disposed of by what I have just said. 
“As the cases are selected to develop a particular branch of law, nothing is more 
erroneous than to suppose that the system consists of the study of isolated proposi- 
tions. To say that the study of cases is only the study of isolated propositions, is 
to deny that the law has been developed through the cases. 
“No sane man would hesitate to denounce a teacher who should refer a student to 
a law library and expect him to find for himself cases developing the law of a given 
subject and to deduce the principles therefrom unaided. Yet the objection so often 
raised, that it is absurd to plunge a beginner into a chaos of undigested and unclas- 
sified matter, and to expect him to arrange and classify the cases and to deduce the 
principles therefrom by himself, would lead one to believe that the case system 
involved this absurdity. The objection, however, is born of ignorance. The most 
casual examination of the collection of cases used in teaching law by this method 
will show that the winnowing process is done for the student, his material being 
selected for him and classified with reference to topics by chapter and by section 
and subsection when necessary. 
“The objection to the case system, that it requires of a ee work which can be 
done only by a qualified critic or writer, would have some force if the material were 
not made the subject-matter of discussion and conference with the teacher in charge 
of the subject. The objection proceeds on the false assumption that the student, 
instead of having the benefit of an interchange of opinion and the advice and sugges-
-P-A-G-E-1074
  1016 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. ° 
tion of the instructor, is required to deduce, unaided, the principles and conclusions 
which he is to use as a practicing lawyer. As to the actual ability of the student to 
deal with the material in the manner in which he is required to deal with it, the 
testimony of a man who has administered the system and has had, therefore, an 
opportunity of observing the working thereof in this particular, should have great 
weight. Fortunately, are we able to produce as a witness on this point a man who, 
though at the time he gave his testimony was on the bench of the Massachusetts 
supreme court, had, prior.to that time, qualified himself to speak of this system in 
its working operation by administering the same asa teacher. In the address, to whick 
I have before referred, Mr. Justice Holmes says: ‘With some misgivings I plunged a 
class of beginners straight into Mr. Ames’s collection of cases. * * * The result 
was better than I even hoped it would be. After a week or two, when the first con- 
fusing novelty was over, I found that my class examined the questions proposed with 
an accuracy of view which they never could have learned from text-books and which 
often exceeded that to be found in the text-books. * * * My experience as a 
judge has confirmed the belief I formed as a professor.’ The testimony of this 
disinterested witness, so well known both to the American and English bar as a dis- 
tinguished writer and judge, should certainly outweigh merely theoretical objections. 
“Tt seems hardly necessary to notice at the present day, when discipline is 
regarded as a part of legal education, and when, therefore, a student is supposed to 
be better prepared to grapple with problems because of previous study, the objection 
that, as a student is a beginner as to every new topic, the case system should not be 
used by him at any time during his course, but that the work involved therein 
should be done by him after he has become a lawyer. 
“Tt has been objected to the case system that it proceeds on the theory that the 
law is an exact science, and those urging this objection assert strenuously that such 
is not the case. With the assertion that law is not an exact science I think all will 
agree, but that there is any dependence in teaching law by cases and its being an 
exact science I fail to see. That law is a science is claimed by the advocates of the 
case system, and, I trust, not denied by its opponents. But it is an applied science, 
depending for its exactness upon human reasoning, and is not, therefore, one of the 
exact sciences; yet, I trust, for all that, not the less worthy of scientific study. 
“The objection that the case system proceeds upon the study of old cases to the 
exclusion of modern cases is based on a delusion which can be cleared up by a 
casual examination of the various selections of cases used by the student. That the 
student is required to consult old as well as modern authorities is true. He is 
required to do so in order that he may know something of the growth and develop- 
ment of the law, and thereby the more thoroughly prepare himself to deal with the 
problems arising from our present complex civilization. 
“The objection has been raised to the case system that only the unsettled points 
of law are treated thereunder. This, of course, is simply a statement of fact, and, as 
in the case of the delusion I have just referred to, can be readily removed by an 
examination of the material which is placed in the hands of the student. Another 
objection which has been raised to the system is that it requires more time than the 
text-book system in which to cover the field of law. If this statement is to be taken 
as meaning that more topics can be touched upon in a given length of time under 
the text-book system than are considered in the same time under the case system, the 
statement is true. But if the statement is to be taken as meaning that in the same 
length of time more law can be mastered under the text-book system than under the 
case system, the assumption begs the entire question, and is most emphatically denied. 
The advocates of the case system believe that the system produces a lawyer more 
quickly than the text-book system, for the reason that, in their opinion, the powers 
of analysis, discrimination, and judgment which have been acquired by the study of 
cases by the student before graduation must be acquired by the student of the text- 
book system arter he has ceased to be a student and has become a practicing lawyer. 
“The objection to the case system that it logically demands the examination and 
 
-P-A-G-E-1075
    
PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION. 1017 
discussion of every case of record, case by case, loses sight of the fact that, according 
to the best thought of the day, while the adjudged cases are numerous, the control- 
ling principles are comparatively few. 
“Tt is unnecessary to consider whether law can be taught exclusively by cases, for 
the reason that I know of no teacher who has made the attempt. Speaking for the 
Columbia College Law School, with which I have the honor to be connected, I may 
say that in all of the courses where the case system of instruction is followed—and 
it is practically the system by which all the instruction in private or municipal law is 
given—text-books are used and oral instruction is given. The distinctive feature of 
the case system is not the exclusive use of cases, but that the reported cases are made 
the basis of instruction, where in other schools they are referred to, if at all, by way 
of illustration only, and that text-books, which in most schools are made the basis 
of instruction, are used for purposes of reference and collateral reading, and to enable 
students to compare their own generalizations with those of the authors of standard 
works. 
“One occasionally, but seldom iu this day of advanced thought and education, 
hears the objection raised to the case system that it does not make the study of law 
easy for the student, and partaking of this objection is the suggestion that the prov- 
ince of the teacher is to teach. Of course, these objections raise squarely the ques- 
tion as to the burden that should be put upon a pupil and of the work that should 
be done by a teacher. We admit that the system does not proceed on the idea of 
‘the law made easy.’ We believe the law to be a difficult science, which can be made 
easy only at the expense of thoroughness and, therefore, at the expense of the stu- 
dent. We believe that the information which the student receives should be the 
result of thought and effort on his part. As Mr. Gray has well expressed it, ‘The 
greatest teacher the world has ever known was fond of comparing himself to a mid- 
wife. His task, he said, was to aid the scholar to bring forth his own ideas. He, 
to-day, will be the most successful teacher who can best exercise this obstetrical 
function, And in law no better way has yet been devised to make the student work 
for himself than to give him a series of cases on a topic and to compel him to dis- 
cover the principles which they have settled and the process by which they have 
been evolved.’ Of course, this represents a difference of ideas, and each person 
will choose that one of the two which more strongly appeals to his experience and 
common sense. 
“To summarize: The reasons that I would urge for the adoption of the case system 
of instruction are, first, that law, like other applied sciences, should be studied in its 
application if one is to acquire a working knowledge thereof; second, that this is 
entirely feasible, for the reason that while the adjudged cases are numerous the prin- 
ciples controlling them are comparatively few; third, that it is by the study of cases 
that one is to acquire the power of legal reasoning, discrimination, and judgment, 
qualities indispensable to the practicing lawyer; fourth, that the study of cases best 
develops the power to analyze and to state clearly and concisely a complicated state 
of facts, a power which, in no small degree, distinguishes the good from the poor or 
indifferent lawyer; fifth, that the system, because of the study of fundamental prin- 
ciples, avoids the danger of producing a mere case lawyer, while it furnishes, because 
the principles are studied in their application to facts, an effectual preventive of any 
tendency to mere academic learning; sixth, that the student, by the study of cases, 
not only follows the law in its growth and development, but thereby acquires the 
habit of legal thought which can be acquired only by the study of cases, and which 
must be acquired by him either as a student or after he has become a practitioner, if 
he is to attain any success as a lawyer; seventh, that it is best adapted to exciting 
and holding the interest of the student, and is therefore hest adapted to making a 
lasting impression upon his mind; eighth, that it is a method distinctly productive 
of individuality in teaching and of a scientific spirit of investigation, independence, 
and self-reliance on the part of the student. 
“So far I have considered methods only in the abstract, entirely eliminating 
   
-P-A-G-E-1076
  
1018 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
what, in practice, can not be eliminated, namely, the personal equation. I am free 
to say that, in my opinion, the case system requires a higher order of inteiligence on 
the part of the pupil than is required under the text-book system, but: it does not 
require a higher order of intelligence than should be possessed by anyone aspiring 
to become a lawyer. Not only must the personal equation be considered with refer- 
ence to the pupil, but the personality of the teacher is of the greatest importance 
in any system of education. I fully appreciate that what is meat for one may be 
poison for another. Any given teacher, because of his peculiarities, might suceecd 
with a method inferior to another under which he would fail, and for this reason, 
every instructor in law in Columbia College has, and I hope always will have, abso- 
lute freedom of choice in his methods of teaching. But, from this point of view, an 
argument which can be fairly urged im favor of the case system is that the method 
of teaching involved therein is se flexible that two men may use it as a basis of 
instruction, and the teaching of the one hardly suggest the teaching of the other. 
“T agree entirely, however, with the statement made by Professor McClain before 
this body last year, that ‘Each successful teacher has his own peculiarities growing 
out of his personal relation with his surroundings, and any attempt on the one hand 
to copy the particular method of another, or, on the other hand, to put a trade-mark 
upon peculiar ways of teaching, will necessarily prove abortive.’ 
“Garfield’s definition of a university was a pine table, with Mark Hopkins at one 
end and the student at the other; but it was Mark Hopkins and the personality of 
Mark Hopkins, which could not be transmitted to another, and not the table, that 
attracted Garfield. Rugby had its Arneld, but Arnold died, and with him his per- 
sonality.

  CHAPTER VIII. 
EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE IN INDUSTRY.* 
The financial history of the larger institutions for the education of the colored race 
is epitomized in the case of the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute of Alabama. 
That institution, on the 4th of July, 1881, started in the world without a dollar except 
an annual appropriation of $2,000 from the State for tuition of State students. Dur- 
ing the thirteen years that have elapsed since that date the institution has received 
$421,956in cash, derived from the following sources: 
  
     
      The State of Alabama, about 9 per cent, or .. -- $37, 000 
The Peabody fund, about 1 per cent, or 5, 163 
The John F. Slater fund, about 4 per cent, or - - 15,500 
The students, about 12 per cent, or. . ea 51, 451 
Gifts, about 74 per cent, or -- 312, 842 
‘Total for the thivteon years <_< -4—- 1-2. 2-5-2. 23 no aes waren ee 421, 956 
Of the above amount about 44 per cent, or $187,613, was paid for student labor 
between 1881 and 1894. 
Reduced to its essential element, the whole matter is “student labor,” paid for by 
benevolent people and done in buildings and fields, provided by these same kind- 
hearted persons for the purpose of enabling the negro youth to acquire an education 
without loss of self-respect.! Indeed it may be said that the necessitous condition 
of the negro and the idea of self-helpfalness are the magic notes that have drawn so 
many millions from, more especially, the North, to effect his education. But this, so 
tospeak, meidentalideaof manual labor in exchange for an education rapidly became 
the general principle, that the education of the negro is to be best effected through 
systematically teaching him to labor. Thus “student labor” is no longer at this 
epoch of the education of the colored race a means to an end, but isan end, if not the 
end. The same phenomenon may be observed in older and more stratified societies 
than our own, and it is the wish of the Commissioner to have presented the character 
of the technical equipment and course of instruction of the institutions interested in 
the effort to teach the negro the dignity of labor.? 
In applying to the negro in America a course of trade instruction such as has 
neyer been in general systematically or successfully operated in schools for the 
whites in this country,* it is a question how far methods that in the past have failed, 
or the newer so-called “ manual-training” methods are applicable to the colored 
race. Unmistakably there is abroad at the present time an idea that in regard to 
1 Students must pay in advance $5 a month for board. * * * The school endeavors to give each 
pupil $5 worth of work monthly, which in most cases able-bodied persons can earn.—Catalogue Hamp- 
ton Institute, p. 58. 
2The object of this institution is, ‘First, to teach the dignity of labor.””—Many catalogues. 
8The New York trade schools are not an exception, for their work 1s completely divorced from 
mental training. 
*By Mr. Wellford Addis, specialist in the Bureau. 1019  
-P-A-G-E-1078
  1020 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
the mental training of the negro there must be ‘‘ appreciated one important and far- 
reaching fact—a fact that has been too generally overlooked by those charged with 
the education of the negro—namely, that the curriculum and methods employed in 
the instruction of the white race need essential modification and adaptation in their 
application to negro schools,” for in the education of the negro, it is necessary to 
have a ‘ practical knowledge of his peculiar intellectual difficulties and a sympa- 
thetic appreciation of his moral weaknesses.”' Now, if we substitute for the ‘‘intel- 
lectual difficulties” and ‘“ moral weaknesses” to be considered in the mental training 
of the negro the hereditary aptitudes for certain kinds of labor possessed by him, 
the conclusions of an official of the last census will bear upon the line of least resist- 
ance for imparting the idea of the dignity of labor or self-helpfulness. These con- 
clusions are— 
“The proportion of the negroes in the cities [of 8,000 population or more] has in 
every case been less than that of whites, though their proportionate increase has 
been greater than that of the whites. This gain is, however, very slight, and is 
probably not significant. While the negro is extremely gregarious, and is by that 
instinct drawn toward the great centers of population, on the other hand he is not 
fitted either by nature or education for those vocations for the pursuit of which men 
collect in cities; that is, for manufactures and commerce. The inclinations of this 
race, drawn from its inheritance, tend to keep it wedded to the soil, and the proba- 
bilities are that as cities increase in the United States in number and size and with 
them manufactures and commerce develop, the great body of the negroes will con- 
tinue to remain aloof from them and cultivate the soil, as heretofore.” ? 
Whether hereditary inclination, early association, or social antagonism will keep 
the negro wedded to industrial isolation as a small farmer, it is undoubtedly a fact 
that his longings are away from the farm, as are those of the youth of the white race, 
and probably for the same reasons; both having seen so much of its worst side before 
experience had taught them to recognize the better. This tendency away from the 
farm has been ascribed to the quickening of the intellectual operations and the birth 
of high aspirations due to an elementary education, but instead of counteracting it 
by agricultural instruction, in the case of the negro the greatest weight is being put 
upon industrial instruction, as will appear in the sequel, for which vocation the 
negro ‘‘is not fitted either by nature or education,” according to the authority 
quoted above. 
Taking the negro in his present industrial condition as more at home on the soil 
than in the alleys and back streets of cities and towns, it will be best to examine into 
the character of the instruction which is intended to fit him for his ancestral vocation, 
then into that which fits him for village or cross-roads industries and those of the 
shop or foundry. 
Before presenting these topics, however, the recent establishment of the Shorter 
University at Arkadelphia, Ark., requires mention. This institution, as yet a uni- 
versity only in plan, owes its existence to the policy. of the African Methodist Epis- 
copal Church to establish schools in every State where its membership is very large. 
The progress of the school under its original name of Bethel Institute is due to the 
active service of the ministers and members of the African Methodist Episcopal 
Church in Arkansas, who have given labor and money to promote-‘‘liberal learning” 
within its territory among the colored race. The prospectus is quite guarded in its 
reference to industrial education, the new university “‘aiming to give ample prepa- 
ration to young men and young women for personal success and usefulness, and 
endeavoring to correct the effects of too great specialization on the one hand and 
extreme diffusion on the other.”

  EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 1021 
TRAINING IN AGRICULTURE. 
In the teaching of agriculture in the colleges for the colored race science—chem- 
ical, physical, or botanical—and nonremunerative practice have been in the position of 
vowels and consonants in the science of philology of the eighteenth century, in which, 
according to Voltaire, consonants went for very little and vowels for nothing at all. 
The fact of the matter is, that schools having large farms must, under the stress of 
the necessity of supporting the simple-minded, confiding proletarians who crowd to 
their halls, use their fields to support their charges as well as to educate them within 
the walls, though the latter purpose is the essence of their being. The value of the 
strength of the would-be educated field hand in tilling the scholastic acres is obvious, 
and it is probable that those acres have been increased in order that the clents of 
the institution to which they belong might be more numerous and thus more colored 
people educated. 
Let itnot be supposed, however, that the management of the several schools are pur- 
posely ignoring that agricultural phenomena and operations have an interesting and 
intelligible explanation systematically digested into a body of doctrine called science, 
which is well calculated to enlarge the understanding and develop reflection. At 
several institutions, especially at those endowed with the national land-grant act of 
1862, or the additional endowment act of 1890, an effort is being made to teach the 
scientific principles of agriculture. At the Hampton Institute, for instance, which 
is in reality a village of over a thousand people, the purpose of the department of 
agriculture is to give every boy in the day-school instruction in the elementary 
principles of farming, and to carry those who may so elect through a higher course, 
which will fit them to be teachers of agriculture and superintendents of farms, The 
equipment consists of the home and Hemenway farms. In order to produce milk 
and vegetables for the boarding department and hay and ensilage for the stock, 110 
acres of the home farm are kept under cultivation. The Hemenway farm is devoted 
to grass, grain, stock, and dairy purposes. The farms have the necessary buildings 
for 75 cows, 50 horses, 500 swine, and a flock of sheep; the home farm having also 
two greenhouses, hot beds, ete., where boys and girls are taught the forcing of flowers 
and of vegetables. There are two courses: one elective and the other required. 
The required course covers a period of three years, one lesson a week being given 
to each boy of the normal school. This instruction deals with— 
1. The origin, formation, composition, and me. 8, Cultivation of the crop. 
chanical condition of soils. 9. Manures and fertilizers. 
2. Composition of the plant. 10. Rotation of crops. 
3. Plant food in the soil. 11. Diversified farming. 
4. Effect of water on soil and crop. 12. Culture of the leading farm crops. 
5. Drainage. 18. Fruit culture. 
6. Preparing the land for the crop. 14. Truck and kitchen garden. 
7. How plants grow. 15, Farm live stock. 
The boys taking the elective course receive five lessons instead of one during the 
week, and the above course is ‘‘ greatly enlarged.” For the elective students in 
the spring of 1894 a small experimental garden was carried on. This experimental 
work is to be enlarged and every theoretical principle of the class room is to be 
demonstrated as far as possible in the field. 
Another well-considered course, though perhaps less theoretic, is given in the cata- 
logue of the State Colored Normal and Industrial School at Normal, Ala. The cur- 
riculum is as follows: 
First year: Soils, plants, animals, management and diseases of live stock, gardening. 
Second year: Soils, darymg, manures. 
Third year: Gardening, drainage, grain and grass growing, poultry, sheep and cattle raising, 
dairying, pruning, grafting, budding, bees, political economy. 
The course of another institution, however, more accurately shows the character 
of the agricultural instruction given in the schools for colored people. The depart- 
ment of agriculture of this institution consists of a school of agriculture, which is   
  
-P-A-G-E-1080
eT ee a ee aE ee ee eee, See nr ee ae 
1022 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
a farm of 150 acres, producing 1,000 bushels of corn, 1,200 bushels of potatoes, etc., 
and aschool of horticulture (anew department) of 12 acres, planted in potatoes, sweet 
corn, turnips, ete. These schools furnish employment and experience to students 
and supply, at the market price, fresh provisions for the boarding department. 
TRAINING IN INDUSTRIES. 
The industrial work of the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute may he 
divided into three classes. The first of these is instruction in work from doing 
which no pecuniary profits arise to the student while in the school; the second is 
instruction in trades which may profit the student in money value, and the third 
is work in which the chief object is the self-support of the student while at the 
institution, such as the girls of the normal department do in the steam laundry and 
the boys of the mght school do on the home and Hemenway farms, as mentioned 
under instruction in agriculture above. But as the organization of industrial 
training at the Hampton Institute is unusually complete, the aim of a large insti- 
tution farther South is a better expression of the general character of industria] 
edueation as given in the schools for the colored. ‘This aim is “to turn all labor 
and all articles produced by labor to advantage and utility. Therefore the indus- 
trial departments contribute in some way to the equipment of the institution, and 
they are in most cases a source of income to the student as well as 2 means of 
instruction.” 
Thus acquainted with the underlying principle of the industrial instruction, we 
may pass to its kinds and methods, noting as we proceed, the change in the character 
of the work being effected by the requirements of the trustees of the Slater Fund; 
to wit, that the underlying principle shall be instruction instead of remuneration. 
PRINTING. 
The institutions for the education of the colored race take kindly to the printing 
press; perhaps printing is a vocation strongly congenial to the coloredman. Among 
the first industries introduced into a school for the negro is the trade of printing. 
Nothing could be more useful to institutions situated financially as these institu- 
tions were and are now, nothing certainly could be more alluring to the aspiring 
student than to become familiar with the processes for disseminating the necro- 
mancy of words; besides all this, as a trade it offers more opportunities of arousing 
the intelligence than all the other trades put together. ‘ 
With a very few exceptions there is no large institution for the education of the 
negro that does not teach printing. At the Schofield School, established at Aiken, 
S. C., in 1868, the printing office is the oldest and most important department and 
for several years has been self-snpporting, a fact very encouraging to the manage- 
ment, when consideration is made that there are three other printing offices in Aiken 
with which their press has to compete. Most of the trade of this school comes from 
the hotels and business houses of Aiken, but at the St. Paul Normal and Industrial 
School “jobs come to the Normal School press from all parts of the United States, 
the aim being to satisfy both in style and price of work, making the work of the 
printing office one of the best paying features of industry in the school at present.” 
Stiil another instance of the diversity of the commercial value of the school printing 
office is afforded by that of Wilberforce University. From this department are 
issued the university circulars, letter heads, programmes, forms, rules, and general 
job work, the value of which for 1893-94 was estimated to be $148.70. At the Norfolk 
Mission College the boys of the high school receive training in composition, type- 
setting, and presswork, thereby practically illustrating the rules of grammar and 
rhetoric while doing the college job work. 
The course in printing is well attended. At Biddle University, out of 131 students 
in carpentry, printing, shoemaking, and bricklaying, 27 per cent were studying 
printing At Wilberforce as many were in the printing office as in the earpenter 
   
-P-A-G-E-1081
    
t EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 1023 
shop. At Central Tennessee College, out of 77 in 5 mechanical departments, 19 per 
cent were in the printing office. At Livingstone College 8 of the 15 students receiv- 
ing a course in trades were in the printing office. At the Alcorn College 14 students 
entered the printing department the year of its introduction (1893), with 82 in the 
older carpenter and blacksmith courses. It should be remarked, however, that at 
Wilberforce and other institutions young women engage in this vocation. 
The course in printing is probably the most thorough, and certainly the longest, at 
the Hampton Institute and its follower, the Tuskegee Institute. The course is four 
years in duration, ten hours a day once or twice a week being devoted to the trade. 
Special instruction is given in the class room, but outside of working hours, regard - 
ing stock, making estimates, and various other matters. In the first year general 
duty work is required, followed by instruction on job presses. During the see- 
ond year instruction is given at the case on newspaper and book composition. 
During the third year there is general job work and book imposing. During the 
fourth year the teaching includes miscellaneous job work, proof reading, cylinder 
press work, tablet making, and the binding of check and order books. Applicants 
to learn this trade must pass an examination in reading, spelling, writing, and gram- 
mar. At Tuskegee Institute the course of training is three years, though the cur- 
riculum is of four. There the theoretical instruction is given from 4.45 to 5.30 p. m. 
The usual course, however, is of two or three years, and is very well shown by the 
curriculum of Wilberforce University : 
First year. Second year. 
First term: Printers’ terms. Practice in fixed | Firstterm: Bookworkbegun. Castingoff, mak- 
rules for punctuation. Use of appliances. Prac- | ing up, and locking forms.

of type. Newspaper and job work begun. Third term: Book and job work continued. 
Third term: Plain composition and jeb work | Proof reading,

At Fisk University the class, which consists of 15 young men and 7 young women, 
gives one hour a day to the work, and students may remain in the class two years, 
At the State Colored Normal School of Alabama 11 per cent of the 134 students in 
7 trades are in the printing department, three hours for three days each week for 
three years being devoted to acquiring the trade. 
CARPENTRY. 
The beginnings of the great schools for the colored race being hampered by the 
impecuniosity of the founders, as in the ultra case of the Tuskegee Institute, which 
was originally housed in an old negro church and a shanty, a corps of carpenters 
became necessary for the development of the school. The light character of tim- 
ber construction employed in this country and the great facihty with which all the 
more intricate portions of a building can be obtained, from a factory fitted up 
with appliances for the manufacture of sash, doors, and the other suborindate 
parts that give finish to a house, have enabled the schools for the colored race to 
reduce their expenses for building to a very great extent by using the muscle of 
the pupils. The benevolent gave money to be paid for student labor, the students 
at carpentry paid the institution thé money they received, and the institution gave 
them tuition, board, and lodging, and in addition taught them carpentry and the 
dignity of labor very much in the same way that the apprentice boy is tanght his 
profession and its dignity. Under the directive influence of the management of 
the John F. Slater Fund and the equally conelusive provisions of the act of Con- 
gress of August 30, 1890, granting the proceeds from the sale of public lands for the 
better endowment of colleges for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanie arts, 
another conception of teaching carpentry has been inculeated, in which there is, so to
-P-A-G-E-1082
  1024 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. ; 
speak, much less field work but much more preparation. Thus the most extensively 
followed trade taught in the class of institutions under review is being placed ona 
purely instructional basis, the State and the two funds above mentioned doing, or 
allowing other money to be used in doing, the institutional building. 
‘The Hampton Institute is the only institution that makes a sharp distinction 
between the manual training (or Russian system of preparatory instruction) and 
trade teaching, other institutions more or less mixing the two ideas. Its course 
in manual training is put down as a branch of technical work, and is a course in 
the manipulation of wood, covering three years, while its course in carpentry, also 
of three years of ten hours a day, is a trade department, in which the primary 
object is the imparting of skill to the apprentice, and the secondary object his per- 
sonal pecuniary gain. For purposes of comparison by those interested in distinctions 
which are based on a difference, the two courses are given in a footnote.! This 
remunerated work is, in the St. Paul Normal and Industrial School, paid for by a 
salary scheme. The carpentry department of that school is under a foreman of great 
practical experience as a housebuilder and joiner, and apt and industrious young 
men are salaried as follows: First year (probationary), board and washing; second 
year, $50 and board and washing; third year, $75 and board and washing; fourth 
year, $100 and board and washing. These salaried persons work through the day 
and attend the night school. They have erected all the school buildings and a num- 
ber of valuable buildings for the public. 
The ‘“‘manual training” course as put in operation in the Hampton Institute is due 
to the Slater Fund trustees. The institutions having instruction of the kind are 
Tougaloo University, Straight University, Orange Park Normal and Manual Training 
School, Atlanta University (first year), Howard University, and probably Fisk Uni- 
versity. But with these exceptions the majority of the institutions have only the 
“trade course” of the Hampton Institute, though the splendid shops of that school 
may give its students advantages of familiarizing themselves with machinery not 
possessed by less favored institutions.

Course.—Every young man above the age of 16 and below the college classes is 
required to devote two hours per diem to manual training, consisting of theoretical 
and practical work. Pupils are required not only to construct miniature models, but 
products for the market as well, and are thus prepared for the struggle of life should 
no professional position open to them. 
The Clafflin University makes a division of its carpentry department into a “school 
of woodworking” and another of ‘‘woodworking by machinery.” In the first a 
variety of actual work is performed, such as building cottages, shops, repairing build- 
ings, furniture, fences, and agricultural implements, and in the second the work of 
a sash and furniture factory has been carried on. 
The industrial organization of the Hampton and the Tuskegee institutes is so com- 
plete as to embrace a sawmill. At Hampton this feature is considered as an 
“industry ” (primarily remunerative to the student) and though the employee may 
learn the handling, drying, grading, and measuring of rough lumber, the industry 
does not seem to be considered a trade as at Tuskegee, where there is a ‘‘course of 
ED 94-65  
-P-A-G-E-1084
1026 EDUCATION REPORT, 1893-94. 
study in sawmilling” which seems to be very much the same as what may be learned 
at the Hampton Institute except the felling of timber which is cut for Hampton Insti- 
tute in North Carolina and floated up in rafts. At Clafilin University there is a grist- 
mill. Both of these departments, however, may be looked upon as having been 
introduced more for their utility to the institution than to add to its industrial 
equipment. 
WHEELWRIGHTING. 
This is a special form of carpentry, and is with two exceptions treated as belong- 
ing to that department. It is by no means so numerously followed as carpentry nor 
have nearly as many institutions introduced it as have introduced woodworking. 
At Tuskegee the course is coupled with carriage trimming, and at Hampton with the 
making of farm implements, or the wooden portion thereof; at Clark University the 
course in wood and iron working, and painting, seems to be a special course in car- 
riage and wagon building. 
BLACKSMITHING OR METAL WORKING. 
This trade follows carpentry in point of numbers in the nine institutions which 
have introduced it as an isolated course. The subject is tanght in thirteen institu- 
tions, seven of which receive an annual apportionment from the endowment fund of 
1890, called the Morrillfund. The cost of erecting a forge and of the accessories neces- 
sary to equip it and the cost of maintenance have prevented the general introduc- 
tion of metal working to any great extent until a very recent date. 
Among the institutions having a course in metal working that of the Central Ten- 
nessee College is eminent for its completeness and duration. At Hampton the course 
is carried on in the Pierce machine shops and follows three lines: Blacksmithing 
and horseshocing; blacksmithing without horseshoeing, but with use of power 
machinery; and machine work. Each course is of three years, ten hours a day for at 
least one day in the week. As may be readily inferred from their titles, the first 
course is adapted for a village blacksmith, the second for a hand in an iron foundry, 
and the third for a machinist. The first course with horseshoeing very well repre- 
sents the course in the majority of the schools, though much “ forge” and machinist 
work is frequently included. 
There are three institutions—Tougaloo, Atlanta, and Arkansas industrial univer- 
sities—in which ironwork follows in natural sequence after instruction in the more 
easily manipulated wood. At Tougaloo the instruction in woodworking is given to 
the 4-8 grades and in forging to the 7-9 grades for one and one-half hours each day 
with the object of general culture of the mind and hand. With the same object and 
allotment of time Atlanta University introduces ironworking in the second year of 
its mechanical course, following it in the third year with exclusive attention to 
mechanical drawing, and in the fourth year with pattern making and machine-shop 
work, To enable a young man to choose his trade intelligently and to acquire a 
sound basis for it the Arkansas Industrial University (in its colored department) 
has a course in general shop work extending over three years. 
SHOE AND HARNESS MAKING. 
We have, says the Wiley University, more applicants than we can accommodate in 
the shoe shop; it is a practical work and should be provided with better facilities. 
By doing all the work for the students and professors, says another institution, ample 
opportunity is given for making this branch of the work thoroughly practical. The 
course is usually of three years, and is very succinctly given by Benedict College as 
follows: 
First year, making and mending coarse shoes. 
Second year, making and mending fine shoes. 
Third year, cutting and finishing. 
Harness making is carried on in several institutions, and is reported by one school 
to be quite remunerative to the shop and useful to the farms of the institution.

EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 1027 
Such are the principal features of the industrial organization of schools for the 
education of the colored race. The equipment of those schools has been greatly 
improved during the last few years, receiving an impulse from the attempt during 
the last half of the 80’s to add industrial training to the public schools and the con- 
sequent elaboration of plans for trade instruction of the Caucasian. In the case of 
the negro a more humble subject was found, and to him the system is being more. 
and more thoroughly applied. The effort of those who direct this application is to 
change the old system, which in some measure sacrificed the future welfare of the 
pupil to the present necessities of the institution, to one of less economic value to 
the school, but also less selfish as concerns the pupil. Such a change, however, 
involves financial questions regarding the source of support of these institutions 
and adaptation of aims to means that are well worthy the deepest consideration of 
the innovators. 
A few pages back we have seen that a very able statistician has thought the 
negro to be unadapted to commercial pursuits. In the large sense of marine trade or 
great wholesale transactions this judgment is possibly correct, but for shopkeeping 
the negro who has received a good common-school education is eminently fitted, 
being bold, confident, and not less “sharp” than the business ethics of his locality 
imperatively demands. It is therefore preferable to note the progress which “ busi- 
ness education,” so called, is making in schools for the colored than to describe the 
courses of bricklaying and making, tinning, tailoring, etc., which this or that insti- 
tution has introduced for the purpose of building its structures and teaching the 
dignity of labor. In passing to this topic, however, we note the absence of a course 
of instruction in weaving—a trade especially adapted to the great cotton- growing 
region of the world—among the industries taught at the class of institutions of 
which we are speaking. Such a school is in successful operation in Philadelphia, 
and that of Chemnitz in Saxony is a model that can not be surpassed here until 
after years of organization. 
A highly organized business course was established at Wilberforce University in 
the fall of 1893. It had its origin in a desire to meet the growing demand for a 
more direct and practical education for business and everyday life. The course is 
as follows: 
“Commercial arithmetic, practical grammar, bookkeeping, commercial correspond- 
ence, commercial law, rapid calculations, business methods and practice, public 
speaking, and, incidentally, rhetoric, parliamentary proceedings, civil government, 
political economy, business habits, ete. Shorthand and typewriting courses are 
also offered.” 
Typewriting and phonography, one, or both, are also taught in four other institu- 
tions, two situated in large cities, the others being the St. Paul Normal and Indus- 
trial School and the Orange Park School. The Colored Normal School of Kentucky 
has a business course of two years, which unites the studies of a secondary school to 
those of the business course of Wilberforce University. 
In conclusion, it may be of interest to the reader to know how all this industrial 
work advances hand in hand with the imparting of the elements of a thorough com- 
mon-school education, and to gratify any curiosity as to the correlation of the two 
processes the following facts are given: 
At Shaw University, in addition to the four hours required to be spent at one of 
the trades daily for three years, these studies must be pursued: 
First year. Reading, spelling, writing, and mental arithmetic. 
Second year. Writing, arithmetic, geography, and drawing. 
‘Third year. Arithmetic, grammar, and mechanical drawing. 
At Clark University students in trades are given a two-hour lesson each day from 
2to4p.m. At the Alcorn College students are divided into squads and classes; each 
class receives instruction forty-five minutes each day during the forenoon, and the 
squads do “practical” work in the afternoon, for which each student receives from

5 to 8 cents per hour, according to his proficiency. At the Alabama State Normal 
and Industrial School the organization as to time is as follows: 
MECHANIC ARTS. 
Sec. 1. Carpentry—3 classes, 8 hours daily, 3 days a week. 
Sec. 2. Printing—2 classes, 3 hours daily, 3 days a week. 
Sec. 3. Mattress making—I class, 2 hours daily, 6 days a week. 
Sec. 4. Shoemaking—2 classes, 2 hours daily, 3 days a week. 
Sec. 5. Blacksmithing—3 classes, 2 hours daily, 3days a week. 
AGRICULTURE. 
Sec. 1. Farming and horticulture—2 classes, 2-8 hours daily 6 days a week. 
Sec. 2. Dairy and live stock—1 class, 2-8 hours daily, 6 days a week. 
The Hampton and Tuskegee institutes have inaugurated the night school. These 
night schools are in session from 7 to 9 p.m. and are attended by a few persons who 
work during the day at some remunerated labor. At Hampton labor is required of 
all for the sake of discipline and instruction. Students in the day schools usually 
work during one school day each week and the whole or half of Monday, thus secur- 
ing 4 whole days for study each week and from one and a half to two days of work. 
Work students remain on the place the entire year. 
The mechanics arts course of the branch normal college of Arkansas Industrial 
University is a very complete expression of the bipartite arrangement of the mental 
and manual training in the curriculum of schools having such arrangements or 
advanced lines, and as such is given:

    There are, as shown in the foregoing table (A), over 33,000 pupils in the elemen- 
tary, secondary, and collegiate departments of institutions which are very largely 
private corporations in character. At equally spaced intervals in the past these 
figures have been as follows:

1893-94. It is very hazardous to compare institutions of “secondary grade” for 
whites with anything, even itself; but it appears probable that the increase in 
attendance of private schools for secondary institution from 1880-81 to 1888-89, was 
13 per cent, and in the public high schools of cities 37 per cent. The question then 
is, are we to attribute this extraordinary increase in attendance, on the part of 
the negro, to dissatisfaction with the facilities afforded in the rural districts for 
obtaining an education? Great sums are given to these secondary institutions to 
instruct, lodge, and board the negro pupil, but with the announcement of the

be allowed, as though the authorities had found themselves hampered by the pres- 
ence of persons attracted to their institution by the desire for novelty and a childish 
fancy which allows itself to expect results without personal exertion. It is a very 
difficult task the institutions for the higher education of the colored race have set 
for themselves, but it is to their distinguished merit that the being in them is prob- 
ably the best education that the negro receives, and it is probable that for many 
years they will be, outside of large towns of 10,000 or more inhabitants, the only 
place where his home and school surroundings are not repugnant to a sense of 
delicacy, not to say of decency.

The ultimate absurdity in examinations of 
the old type was reached in China, where 
young men seeking degrees in the classical 
learning of their country were locked in 
cells for weeks, while they toiled to exhaus- 
tion and sometimes to death over their 
endless assignments. Temperament, physi- 
cal endurance, and memory were tested, it 
seems, rather than intellectual attainment. 
In Europe and in our own country, too, exam- 
inations have been a nightmare to students 
and to teachers from time immemorial. 
It is one thing to do the work prescribed for 
a given course, and it is another thing to pass 
the examination marking the completion of 
that course. It is one thing to teach, and 
it is another thing to devise examinations 
that will operate accurately and justly. 
Every teacher and every student is aware of 
the difficulties in the old system of giving 
examinations, yet examinations have seemed 
indispensable for groups of any size. Some 
measure of relief from outworn methods has 
been effected through the use, in our schools, 
of standardized intelligence tests prepared 
by psychologists specializing in the science 
of mental measurement; and the use of these 
tests has pointed the way to a wider applica- 
tion of the principles underlying them. The 
purpose of the present manual is to make the 
technique of preparing new-type examina- 
tions sufficiently clear to teachers to enable 
them to construct such examinations for 
ordinary classroom use, where standardized 
intelligence tests are not feasible

THE writer, three years resented to the faculty of 
the School of Business ana to other faculties in the 
University of Minnesota a bric. paper on the improvement 
of the examination function in teaching. In these talks, 
an effort was made to present the claims of the new-type 
examinations, the writer offering his services as consultant 
to those desiring to experiment with these newer methods. 
He soon realized that a manual of directions for the prepara- 
tion and use of such examining methods would be a decided 
aid to those contemplating their trial. Accordingly, such 
a manual as is here presented was planned, but it was delayed 
until circumstances permitted its final completion. 
It is hoped that this manual will not only be welcomed by 
an increasing number of college and university instructors 
but will also be welcomed by high school and elementary 
school teachers as meeting the need for examining devices 
intermediate between the traditional examination and the 
more carefully devised and standardized educational achieve- 
ment scales. The increasing use of short-answer examina- 
tions in elementary schools, high schools, and colleges war- 
rants belief in the need for just such a manual as is here 
presented. 
The adaptation of these objective examining methods 
by the United States Civil Service Commission, the Board 
of Examiners of the New York City Board of Education, 
and similar examining and licensing agencies forecasts a 
growing demand from various examining boards for help in 
incorporating these newer-type questions in their traditional 
examining procedures. It is hoped that this manual will 
meet also, in part, this demand. 
The writer is indebted to Dr. J. B. Johnston, Dean of the 
College of Science, Literature, and the Arts, University of

PREPARATION AND USE OF 
NEW-—TYPE EXAMINATIONS 
I 
INTRODUCTION 
Mocs has been published recently concerning the desir- 
ability of new-type examinations. This material, appearing 
both in book form and in various educational journals, deals 
for the most part with logical arguments and statistical 
evidence in favor of these objective examination methods. 
Considerable space is devoted also to the printing of sample 
copies of new-type examinations in various subjects, with a 
suggestion, here and there, concerning questions of procedure. 
But there is no one article, book, or manual containing in 
convenient form a summary of the best rules to be followed 
in preparing and using these examination methods. Believ- 
ing that such a summary will render real service to the many 
teachers contemplating experiments with these methods in 
their own classes, the writer presents this manual. It 
describes the various forms of new-type examinations, lists 
the advantages and disadvantages of each, and makes sug- 
gestions for their preparation and use, in the form of twenty- 
two rules of procedure. 
This manual does not aim to convince teachers that such 
examination methods should be used, nor does it present 
detailed evidence of their value. Its sole purpose is to aid 
those who, for one reason or another, desire to experiment 
with those methods. Arguments and evidence in favor of 
such methods or against them are contained in the various 
articles listed in the Bibliography (pages 79-87). 
Without attempting to evaluate the success or failure of 
new-type examinations, it may be suggestive to list at this

time some of the subjects in which the new-type examination 
method has been used. The following list has been compiled 
from a survey of the literature dealing with this topic, and, 
while not complete, it is indicative of the range of subjects 
in which the method is applicable: Algebra, Animal Biology, 
Arithmetic, Chemistry, Civics, Civil Engineering, Civil 
Service Examinations, Contemporary Civilization, Dental 
Courses, Economics, Educational Psychology, English Lit- 
erature, Examinations for Teacher’s Licenses, French, 
General Science, Geography, Geometry, Government, Greek 
Art, History, Home Economics, Latin, Law, Medical 
Courses, ‘‘Orientation” Courses, Philosophy, Physics, 
Physiology, Political Science, Psychology, Rhetoric, and 
various vocational subjects such as Woodwork, Electricity, 
Sheet Metal Work, Auto Mechanics, and Bricklaying.

DEFINITION OF NEW-TyPE EXAMINATION 
It is difficult to formulate a concise definition of what 
constitutes a new-type examination, since many of its 
features have been incorporated in traditional examinations. 
Perhaps-an attempt to contrast the new type and the old 
type e with respect to a few — features will best serve 
our need for definition. — 
FORM OF QUESTION 
In the first place, probably the outstanding characteristic 
of the old-type examination is to be found in the form of the 
question and the required response. The questions, very 
frequently, are of the “‘how”’ type, requiring a description of 
some process or the statement of the detailed logical steps 
of an involved explanation. For example, one of the ques- 
tions in a recent physiology examination is, ‘‘Describe the 
secretion of gastric juice.” This is‘a “how” type of question 
and could be stated without any alteration of meaning as, 
“How is gastric juice secreted?” The required answer, 
if as complete and adequate as that given by the textbook 
used in the course, demands the arrangement of forty-three 
items or ideas under twelve different headings. The new- 
type_examination questions, on_the other hand, are more 
frequently of the “what” type, requiring only a single- word 
answer. / In testing a person’s knowledge of a total process 
or his knowledge of the detailed logical steps of an involved 
explanation, the important critical steps are isolated and 
short-answer key questions are asked which, at least in many 
cases, presumably could not be answered by the student 
unless he possessed an adequate knowledge) of the whole 
process.   3 
eee  
-P-A-G-E-10
  4 Preparation and Use .of New-Type Examinations 
The old-type question tests knowledge of a complicated 
process directly by requiring its production or application 
in relative detail, whereas the new-type question endeavors 
to test precisely the same thing indirectly by requiring short 
answers to critical key questions. Knowledge of the total 
process is thus inferred (hence measured indirectly) from the 
answers to a few critical key questions. 
NUMBER OF QUESTIONS 
In the second place, the old or traditional type of examina- 
tion is generally composed of a relatively small number of 
questions. Sometimes the number is as low as five for an 
hour examination, and sometimes the number is as large 
as twenty or thirty (counting smaller subdivisions). The 
average number of questions is probably in the neighborhood 
of ten or twelve. The new type of examination, on the other 
hand, seldom contains fewer than fifty questions, the usual 
number varying from eighty to one hundred questions, and 
may even reach one hundred and fifty questions for a one- 
hour examination. It is possible to include as many as 
three hundred questions in a two-hour examination and still 
give adequate opportunity to practically every person for 
answering each question. 
FORM OF ANSWERS 
Thirdly, the pupil is required to write his answers to the 
old-type examination in one or more bluebooks or on sheets 
of theme paper, the questions being mimeographed on a 
sheet of paper or else written on a blackboard, whereas the 
pupil in taking the new-type examination is given the ques- 
tions on mimeographed sheets and is required to record his 
answers either by writing a single word or two per question
-P-A-G-E-11
   Definition of New-Type Examination 5 
or by making check marks to indicate correct answers. 
This contrast may be expressed fairly by saying that the old- 
type examination requires a maximum of writing, as opposed 
to a minimum in the new-type examination. 
SUMMARIZED DEFINITION 
By way of summary, we may characterize the old-type 
examination as requiring relatively long explanatory written 
answers to a small number of “how” type questions, whereas 
the new-type examination requires exceedingly short answers 
to a relatively large number of “‘key” questions, correct 
answers being symptomatic of total organized knowledge.

PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING ADEQUATE EXAMINATIONS 
BEFORE proceeding to describe in detail the forms of new- 
type examination questions, it is well to consider rather care- 
fully a few elementary principles underlying adequate 
examinations. 
I. DEFINITION OF FUNCTION TO BE MEASURED 
_-The first principle to be considered involves the need for a 
definition of the capacities or abilities to be measured by the 
examination. | Theoretically this’ means that an analysis of 
the objectives of each course be made and the examination 
be designed to measure the extent to which the objectives 
have been realized for each student examined. In the 
absence of scientific analyses of objectives in most courses, 
we may define the function to be measured in school 
examinations as knowledge of, and ability to think in, the 
subject matter of the various courses.’ |\In the light of this 
definition the old-type examination does not suffer by 
comparison with the new-type examination perhaps as far 
as testing ability to think in the subject matter of the 
course is concerned, but it does seem to be deficient in 
testing subject-matter knowledge because its small number 
of questions sample only a small fraction of the knowledge 
which a thorough mastery of a course involves. There- 
fore the new-type examination can claim the honors with 
respect to the thoroughness with which it tests knowledge 
of a course. 
1 This definition is a modification of Ben D. Wood’s definition of the function 
of college examinations as being “knowledge of, and ability to think in, the materials 
of the course,” as given in his book, Measurement in Higher Education (World Book 
Company), page 153.

2. OBJECTIVITY IN MEASURING ACHIEVEMENT 
The second principle involved in the production of ade- 
quate examinations has to do with objectivity/ Objectivity 
in measurement implies the ,existence of measuring scales 
which when used by two or more competent examiners give 
precisely the same results. /In other words, a measuring 
instrument is said to be objective when the factor of personal 
opinion or when the factor of the so-called personal equation 
is ruled out as completely as possible. | It is evident that the 
use of clinical thermometers for the measurement of tempera- 
ture has almost completely ruled out the personal equation 
which was formerly present when doctors merely estimated 
the degree of fever by feeling the hands and face of a patient. 
This is a concrete illustration of the replacement of sub- 
jective judgment by an objective measuring instrument, 
with a resultant greater uniformity and certainty for deter- 
mining whether a person has a fever or not. A somewhat 
analogous situation prevails with respect to school exami- 
nations. The traditional essay examination tends to be 
subjectively evaluated, the personal opinion of the teacher 
playing an important réle. In the new-type examination 
the scoring is much more objective. 
[This principle of objectivity requires a large number of 
small units, each scorable in definite units easily agreed to 
by all competent examiners. Furthermore, this principle 
requires that the examination involve relevant responses 
only, all irrelevant factors being eliminated. |In both these 
respects the traditional examination is defective. Instead 
of a large number of small units it is composed of a small 
number of large units, and, what is more serious, these large 
units exhibit tremendous variability when one examination 
paper is compared with another. In addition, we must 
admit that the traditional examination does involve a host  
-P-A-G-E-14
8 Preparation and Use of New-Type Examinations 
of factors that are quite irrelevant as far as knowledge of, 
and ability to think in, the subject matter under considera- 
tion is concerned. What teacher will assert that his own 
judgment of what constitutes an adequate answer remains 
constant from paper to paper and from day to day? What 
teacher will affirm that he is really uninfluenced by a candi- 
date’s neatness and arrangement of the parts of the answers 
on the page, spelling ability, legibility of handwriting, com- 
position ability, use of pet phrases of the lecturer or the text, 
etc.? To put the matter bluntly, the traditional examina- 
tion may be likened to a battle in which the teacher is 
bombarded by, and sprayed with, innumerable words, 
phrases, sentences, and paragraphs by each student. The 
point at issue lies in the fact that much of this verbiage is 
irrelevant and inevitably results in a grading process which 
is highly subjective. The new-type examination corresponds 
more nearly with the requirements of the principle of objec- 
tivity. It is composed of small units requiring definite 
precise answers which are either right or wrong; hence any 
two teachers will agree in grading the same papers. _| Com- 
position ability, spelling ability, legibility of handwriting, 
and neatness and arrangement of the parts of the answer 
are irrelevant factors and are ruled out because writing is 
reduced to a bare minimum. [If such abilities are believed 
to be important in any given course, then they should be 
measured separately. Scientific method necessitates the 
measurement of one variable at a time; hence knowledge of, 
and ability to think in, the subject matter of the course 
should be measured objectively in the manner indicated and 
then separate examinations be devised to measure legibility 
of handwriting as such, another to measure spelling ability 
as such, and still another to measure composition ability as 
such. With respect to the principle of objectivity, then, it 
would seem that the new-type examinations score heavily, 
 
-P-A-G-E-15
Principles Underlying Adequate Examinations 9 | 
because in this form of examination the personal opinion of 
the teacher is reduced to a minimum. 
, 3. THE EXAMINATION SHOULD BE COMPREHENSIVE 
he The third principle underlying adequate examinations 
deals with what we might term the comprehensiveness of the 
examination. Every examination must of necessity attempt 
to measure but a part of the total knowledge possessed by the 
pupil examined. Total knowledge is inferred from the 
answers to questions which sample but a part of that total 
knowledge. | This principle is the same as that which governs 
the work of the geologist in sampling the ore of a mine or of 
the grain dealer who samples the grain in a carload lot. / The 
sampling must be thorough and representative of every part of 
the thing sampled. This principle is basic, and it is this very 
principle that is most flagrantly violated by the traditional 
examination. That is, it fails adequately to cover the 
subject matter of the course. Hence it is not equally fair 
to all, for a pupil may have prepared thoroughly on certain 
portions of the subject and be unlucky enough to have the 
questions bear heavily on other parts. This lack of adequate 
sampling is very likely to result in an unreliable score for any 
individual pupil. | If one wishes to overcome this defect by 
making the traditional examination really comprehensive, a 
dilemma inevitably results because of the limitations of time 
allowed for the examination. /'To write discursive, explana- 
tory answers to even a small number of questions which 
require elaborate descriptions of complicated processes is a 
time-consuming business. Not only is it time-consuming, 
but too much wasted effort is involved in proportion to the 
/ information extracted.| Speed of writing, resistance to 
fatigue, and immunity from writer’s cramp are all at too 
great a premium. The situation is reversed when we turn
-P-A-G-E-16
  10 Preparation and Use of New-Type Examinations 
our attention to the new-type examination. The questions 
are brief, the answers are short, and little or nothing is 
demanded by way of writing. Hence most of a pupil’s time 
is consumed in cerebral activity or in thinking, and practi- 
cally none of his time is devoted to grammatical construction, 
composition, or laborious handwriting. This makes it 
possible to multiply the number of questions and to sample 
thoroughly every important phase of the subject matter. 
For this reason the new-type examination may be made 
much more comprehensive and therefore more reliable, 
because chance influences are greatly reduced. 
4. AN ADEQUATE EXAMINATION MUST HAVE HIGH 
RELIABILITY 
“In mental-measurement work reliability refers to the 
degree to which a test or examination measures whatever it 
purports to measure. The term refers to the consistency 
with which the examination measures the relative abilities 
ofa group. The reliability or consistency of an examination 
may be determined by giving duplicate forms of the same 
examination to the same group to discover if each person 
receives about the same grade on both examinations. | Or 
the odd items and the even items in a single cout are 
graded separately and the two scores for each person com- 
pared.. Or the same papers are graded independently by 
two teachers and the two sets of grades compared.) Or one 
paper is graded by a number of teachers and the agreements 
and disagreements in grades assigned to that paper are noted. 
When such tests of reliability are made of typical examina- 
tions, the results have proved startling. 
A good summary of such reliability investigations is given | 
in D. Starch’s book, Educational Psychology. Results of 
one sample study will be given here. Marks given by 116 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
  
Principles Underlying Adequate Examinations 11 
competent teachers to the same geometry examination paper 
varied from 28 to 92, the average mark being 69.9, standard 
deviation of the mean + 1.2 and standard deviation of the 
distribution + 12.8. Considering 70 as the passing mark, 
it is evident that approximately one half of the teachers 
would have passed the paper and one half failed the paper. 
Such a result is no reflection on the competency of the 
teacher ; it is simply due to the defects inherent in any such 
subjective measuring scale. The causes of the unreliability 
of the traditional type of examination are many, arising 
chiefly because of (1) the inadequacy of the sampling, the 
questions being too few in number, (2) the complex nature of 
the required answers, (3) the lack of standardized scoring 
units, and (4) the presence of irrelevant factors influencing 
judgments of the real merit of the given answers. Now 
these weaknesses, inherent in the essay type of examination 
as ordinarily given, are mentioned, not for the purpose of 
slandering the efficiency of teachers, but rather to emphasize 
the complexities and difficulties of accurately measuring the 
achievements of pupils in school subjects. 
The very factors that reduce the reliability of the tradi- 
tional examination are largely overcome by the new-type 
examination; hence it is not strange that the work of Ben 
D. Wood, G. M. Ruch, and others has invariably shown the 
new-type examination to be much more reliable than the 
traditional examination as ordinarily prepared, given, and 
graded. Ruch’s conclusions are so important as to justify 
quotation: “to to 20 minute examinations of objective 
type are very much more reliable than 5 to 10 question 
traditional examinations which require 30 to 60 minutes.” ! 
Additional evidence on this point could easily be presented, 
| but since the aim of this manual is not that of presenting a

Foresman & Co., Chicago.

  12 Preparation and Use of New-Type Examinations 
complete case in behalf of the new-type examinations, the 
writer is content to refer readers desiring additional data to 
the books mentioned here and to other similar pieces of work 
mentioned in the Bibliography. 
5. ECONOMY OF TIME AND EFFORT 
The adequacy of an examination depends in part upon 
economy of time and effort and upon ease of administration 
and scoring. Here, again, the new-type examination scores 
heavily. There is economy of time on the part of the pupil 
in taking the examination, for he can give you ten times as 
much information in a given unit of time, or he can give you 
as much information in one tenth the time now demanded 
by the traditional essay examination. There is also a real 
economy of effort on the part of the pupil, for he is freed 
from the dangers of writer’s cramp and is freed from the 
laboriousness with which he has traditionally been forced to 
organize his lengthy answers in correct grammatical form. 
The writer does not know of an instance where pupils have 
not expressed a decided preference for the new-type examina- 
tion. Furthermore, the majority of pupils have indicated 
that the new-type examination is more exacting with 
reference to the need for being fully prepared in the subject 
in order to make a good showing in the examination. Not 
only is there economy of time and effort on the part of the 
pupil, but there is an even greater economy on the part of 
the teachers. In fact, a great load can be lifted from the 
shoulders of the teachers by the adoption of this new method, 
because of the ease and economy of time in correcting papers. 
For that matter, much of the correcting work can be turned 
over to a clerk without danger of decreased accuracy of | 
grading. The traditional examination procedure involved 
little attention to the preparation of the actual questions,
-P-A-G-E-19
Principles Underlying Adequate Examinations 13 
but it did involve a great deal of attention, time, effort, and 
expertness in evaluating the bewildering variety of answers. 
The new-type examination reverses the process. Expertness 
im preparing the examination is substituted for expertness in 
correcting the papers. Furthermore, the efforts formerly 
expended in correcting the papers were lost, whereas the 
efforts now expended in preparing new-type questions can 
be preserved; that is, a comprehensive file of a thousand 
questions can be built up for each subject so that future 
examinations can be assembled with little effort by simple 
reference to the file. 
| The foregoing principles are basic in a consideration of the 
problem of measuring pupil achievement in school subjects. 
While it is true that they seem obvious after slight reflection, 
yet their application in actual examination practice requires 
considerable ingenuity and thought on the part of the teacher 
who desires to put them into practice. JA careful study of 
the material that follows should reduce the difficulties of 
successful application of these principles to a minimum, the 
detailed description of the different forms of new-type 
questions and the rules for formulating and using them being 
organized with this specific aim in mind.

  IV 
Common Forms or NEew-TypPE QUESTIONS 
NEW-TYPE questions may be divided into two general 
classes: (x) the recall type and (2) the recognition type, 
each having its different varieties as shown in the following 
outline.

By the recall type is meant the form of question to which 
the examinee supplies his own answer, as distinguished from 
the recognition type in which two or more alternative 
answers are furnished and the examinee has merely to choose 
the right answer from among the given alternatives. 
Questions of the recall type are almost always to be 
answered by one word. The form of the question may 
vary, however. The two principal forms are the ordinary 
question (a) and the so-called completion form of ques- 
tion (6). Both these forms will be described and illustrated 
below. : 
There are various forms of the recognition type of question, 
depending upon the number of alternative answers from 
14
-P-A-G-E-21
  Common Forms of New-Type Questions 15 
which the choice is made, the number of choices to be made 
from the alternative answers, and the form of the question 
itself. The natural division may be made between questions 
having but two alternative answers and those having more 
than two, for the reason that the former kind involves a 
relatively large element of chance and for that reason usually 
involves a specialized type of scoring called the “‘right- 
minus-wrong” method. Of those questions having two 
alternative answers, the most important type is the so-called 
“true-false”’ type (c), which will be explained and illustrated 
below. 
The questions involving a choice among three or more 
alternatives may be divided into sub-classes according to 
whether a single choice is made (d), whether two or more of 
the alternative answers are to be chosen (e), or whether the 
answers are indicated by matching answers with questions, 
questions and answers being given in parallel columns (/). 
A special form of question known as the analogy (g) deserves 
particular mention, although this may be answered in any 
one of the ways mentioned above. In the majority of cases, 
however, analogies are answered by a single choice of four 
or five alternative answers. 
In the following pages these types are described more in 
detail and are illustrated. 
(a) ONE-WORD-ANSWER RECALL TYPE 
This form requires as a correct answer a single word or 
phrase to be written by the student. Suppose that we desire 
to test a pupil’s knowledge of a barometer. The usual 
form of question would be, “What is a barometer?” The 
one-word answer would be, ‘‘ What is the name of the measur- 
ing device which is used to measure air pressure?” Here, 
only one answer is correct; i.e., barometer.

their preference. The result showed 55 per cent preferring the dots, 34 per cent 
not preferring the dots, and 11 per cent indicating no preference.

correctness of the answer that occurs to him, at least so far as 
the number of letters in the correct answer is concerned. 
Furthermore, it discourages guessing and encourages defi- 
niteness of expression. As a result, the variety of possible 
answers is reduced to such an extent that keys of acceptable 
answers can be prepared by the teacher, so that assistants 
(some of whom may not even know the subject matter) can 
readily and accurately score the examination papers. 
The dot technique does not reduce the variety of answers 
to one, and indeed does not necessarily reduce the number 
of correct answers to one only, for, in spite of great care in 
framing the question, the teacher will discover that some 
pupils will be able occasionally to produce an equally good 
answer which is longer or shorter than the one intended. 
The writer advocates that such equally good answers be 
given full credit, even though they do not have the required 
number of letters. 
The example given above illustrates the use of the one- 
word-answer recall type of question in testing knowledge of 
definitions. Instead of asking a pupil to give a definition of 
something, he is given the definition itself and asked to 
indicate what it defines. This form of question is equally 
well adapted to test knowledge of dates, events, authors, 
characters, experiments, etc. ‘These illustrations seem 
limited to matters of information and memory; yet the use 
of the one-word-answer question to test ability to apply 
principles, to make comparisons in terms of similarities and 
differences, or to give reasons is not impossible. It is true 
that such questions are more difficult to prepare, but the 
difficulty is not necessarily due to the one-word-answer form 
of question. Such questions usually are more difficult to 
prepare in general, regardless of the form of question. An 
illustration of the one-word-answer question involving more 
than mere information and memory is as follows: 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
    18 Preparation and Use of New-Type Examinations 
Testing knowledge of a principle. New-type question: 
“What volume at o° C. would zo liters of oxygen gas at 30 C°. 
occupy? Answer ________ degrees C.” The definite 
answer required is 9.0099 and cannot be given unless the 
pupil knows not only the general principle involved in 
Charles’ Law but also how to apply that principle to a 
concrete problem. It goes without saying that failing this 
question would not necessarily indicate lack of knowledge 
of the principle or law itself; so it would be desirable to 
precede this applicational question by a question testing 
knowledge of the principle itself. 
Perhaps a further word is necessary concerning the 
assumed opposition between memory or information and 
reasoning. A quotation nicely illustrates the point : “There 
is not as much opposition between ‘information’ and ‘reason- 
ing’ as some teachers would have us believe. Facts do not 
exist in the mind in isolation. We remember by thinking, 
and we think by remembering facts. Those who declaim 
_against tests of ‘mere facts acquired and remembered’ 
should realize that we cannot think without facts. We could 
not neglect the measurement of facts without neglecting 
the measurement of the very fabric of thinking. When we 
consider that facts are not only a legitimate and undoubted 
aspect of thinking, and also that they can be acquired, 
retained, and reproduced only by thinking, only by organiz- 
ing material in a logical and systematic manner, there can 
be no doubt of the value of the pure information test. In 
fact, the measurement of reasoning and organizing ability 
in a field of knowledge would be very defective and incom- 
plete without a measurement of the breadth of information 
in that field... . Every experimental study thus far made 
and reported has shown a very high relationship between 
measurements of information in a field and intelligence or 
ability to think in the material of that field.” ?

General rule for preparing ordinary questions of the one- 
word-answer recall type. Write out what you consider to 
be an adequate and concise answer to the question you 
would ordinarily ask and then use this answer in framing a 
question which calls for a single-word answer (or, at most, 
two short words) — that is, a key word which is vital to an 
adequate understanding of the question. For example, 
you desire to test a pupil’s knowledge of the term “value” 
as used in elementary economics. You would ordinarily 
state the question, “‘What is value?” and would accept this 
concise answer as adequate, “‘ Value is usually used to denote 
the rate at which any two commodities are freely exchanged.” 
You can now use this answer in framing your question as 
follows: ‘What denotes the rate at which any two com- 
a valwe 
modities are freely exchanged? Answer ..... (eye 
It is sometimes desired to have the pupils give an answer 
requiring two or more parts, in which case it is often possible 
to state the question in the form described above and to 
provide spaces for giving the two or more single-word or 
single-phrase answers. ‘Questions involving the listing of a 
number of terms, or of a number of characteristics of an 
event or process, etc., are easily arranged in this form. 
(6) COMPLETION FORM OF RECALL TYPE 
This form of question originated as an intelligence test 
many years ago, when the German psychologist Ebbinghaus 
first proposed its use as a psychological test method. Gt 
consists of the preparation of a statement with certain 
words omitted, the requirement being to supply the miss- 
ing words so as to make the statement sensible} For ex-

ample, “Many abnormal symptoms are only... “*...... (11) 
forms of mental processes found in normal persons.” To 
complete this satisfactorily requires a knowledge of the

  20 Preparation and Use of New-Type Examinations 
nature of abnormal symptoms as studied in abnormal 
psychology and also of the fact that a given mental process 
varies quantitatively from a minimum degree to a maximum 
degree. The student who fully understands the import of 
these facts would have little difficulty in supplying the miss- 
ing word “exaggerated” to complete the sentence. Of 
course, a student who had memorized this particular state- 
ment in advance, even though he had little knowledge of the 
implications, would be able to supply the missing word on the 
basis of sheer rotememory. This possibility makes it unwise 
for a teacher to burden an examination with incomplete sen- 
tences and incomplete statements taken verbatim from text- 
book or lectures. To avoid “parrot-like” memory answers it 
is necessary to paraphrase or re-phrase important principles, 
methods, or facts when putting them into completion form.

General rule for preparing the completion form of recall-type 
questions. Here, again, make a list of the questions you 
would ordinarily use in preparing an examination ; then write 
out adequate concise answers, using these answers as the 
basis for your new-type completion question. In using 
these concise answers, eliminate the words that seem to be 
the most important, making certain at the same time that 
the remaining words and phrases are sufficiently complete 
to suggest the proper missing words to one who is thoroughly 
familiar with the principle, fact, or method stated. This 
procedure can be illustrated by utilizing the question and 
answer about value mentioned above. The completion form 
of handling the answer describing the meaning of the term 
“value” would be something like this: “Value is usually ae vate 
used to denote the .... (4) at which any two........... 
bu a 
(x1) are freely Ge (9). The assumption here is that 
a good pupil could have given the essentials of the meaning 
of value in some such language and hence, if he knows the 
whole, will be able to complete a partial or incomplete state- 
ment by supplying the missing parts. 
(c) TRUE-FALSE FORM OF RECOGNITION TYPE 
Discussion of this form is deferred, since its significance 
is better understood after the discussion of the form involving 
a choice among three or more alternatives. 
(d) SINGLE-CHOICE FORM OF RECOGNITION TYPE 
This type of question presents a statement, together with 
several (usually four or five) alternative answers, only one of 
   
-P-A-G-E-28
  22 Preparation and Use of New-Type Examinations 
which is correct. The pupil is thus required to exercise his 
judgment as to the right answer by underlining or other- 
wise indicating which of the several alternative answers he 
considers to be correct. It is a test of his ability to recognize 
the right answer and to make a choice among several alter- 
native answers. For example, ‘What denotes the rate at 
which any two commodities are freely exchanged? (labor 
cost; demand; value; supply).” The pupil is given credit 
if he underlines “value” and is given no credit if he under- 
lines one of the other three words, if he fails to underline any 
of the four words, or if he underlines any two. The assump- 
tion here is'that the pupil who knows what value is will 
readily recognize the statement as a description of value and 
will answer accordingly. On the other hand, it is assumed 
that the pupil who does not know what value really is will 
find the alternative answers equally or more plausible and 
hence will underline the wrong one. The chance of getting 
the correct answer on the basis of guessing is only one in 
four mathematically ; hence effort and ingenuity should be 
utilized to reduce further this chance of guessing correctly. 
This can be done by including among the alternative answers 
those which seem plausible and yet are unequivocally wrong. 
The alternative, wrong answers which seem plausible to the 
person who is uninformed must really be wrong answers. 
This point is emphasized because it is easy for partially 
correct or possibly correct answers to creep into these alter- 
natives in the effort to make them plausible. When this 
occurs, the value of the question is destroyed, for it gives 
rise to disagreement and argument as to what really con- 
stitutes the correct answer.!   
1 Some teachers deliberately attempt to include among the alternatives terms 
which are partly correct but which are not so good as the intended correct term. 
They feel that this scheme is a more delicate measure of judgment or reasoning. 
The writer has no quarrel with the attitude, but he feels that a teacher should have 
had a great deal of practice and experience in preparing single-choice questions 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
  
Common Forms of New-Type Questions 23 
Instead of having the pupil merely underline the correct 
word or phrase, it is much better to number the answers 
and have the pupil place the number in parentheses at the 
right-hand margin of the page, in order that the responses 
may all come in a single column to which a key may be 
applied much more easily than to underlinings scattered here 
and there over the page. It is also desirable to have the 
pupil indicate the correct answer by underlining it, to serve 
as a reference in case any of the numbers he places in the 
margin prove to be illegible and as an aid to the pupil in 
reviewing his work. This device was invented by Arthur 
S. Otis and was first used in employment tests prepared 
for Cheney Brothers’ Silk Mills in 1919. Otis later used it 
in his General Intelligence Examination and then again in 
his Self-Administering Tests, and it is now coming into 
quite general use.

General rule for preparing the single-choice form of recogni-

of question differs in no essential from that noted for the 
various forms of the recall type as described above. The 
technique differs only in the ingenuity that must be exercised 
in making the wrong alternatives as seductive as possible. 
Special care must be taken to make these plausible and there- 
fore seductive alternatives wrong beyond question. 
(€) TRUE-FALSE FORM OF QUESTION 
The true-false form of question is the most common of the 
various forms of the recognition type having but two alter- 
native answers. Among the other forms is the one involving 
a choice between “yes” and “‘no,” as, for example, in Test 6 
of the Terman Group Test of Mental Ability, of which the
-P-A-G-E-31

first item is, “Are cartoons made by cameras? Yes No.” 
Another form is that used in Test 3 of the same Terman test, 
in which the first item is, 
alert —sluggish . . . . same — opposite 
The true-false form of question has been used so com- 
monly in the new-type examinations, that many have made 
the error of making no distinction between the new-type 
examination and the true-false question. As is evident from 
the foregoing description of different kinds of new-type ques- 
tions, the true-false kind must be considered as only one of 
many forms of new-type questions. (As the name indicates, 
the true-false question consists of a statement which the 
student must judge true or false) There is a variety of ways 
of having the pupil express that judgment; sometimes the 
pupil is required to place a plus sign before the statements 
he considers true and a minus sign or a zero before those he 
considers false; or the letters “T” and “F” or the words 
“True False” may appear before each of the statements, 
the pupil being required to underline or to encircle “T” or 
“F” or “True” or “False” foreach. If the pupil is required 
to place a sign before the statement, then the method requir- 
ing the placement of a zero before the wrong statement is 
especially recommended, because the discrimination between 
the plus signs and the zeros is more easily made; hence the 
scoring is speeded up without any decrease in accuracy. 
The encircling of the letters ‘“T” or “F'” or the words “True” 
or “False” before the statements is perhaps the better 
method. And it is better to have the pupil encircle or under- 
line these than it would be to require him to write the letters 
or words in a column, partly because such letters are easily 
confused in scoring and partly because it is easier to score a 
paper when the answers zigzag than it is when they are in a

the scorer can soon partially memorize.

In preparing these statements, some of which are true and 
some of which are false, the opportunity for exercising con- 
siderable ingenuity presents itself. “The false statement, 
as a general rule, must not be so obviously false that a 
relatively uninformed person would recognize its falsity. 
For example, in preparing a statement about “false beliefs,” 
advantage is taken of the known fact that pupils tend to 
confuse the terms “delusion” and “hallucination.” The 
better pupils acquire a clear-cut knowledge of the difference 
between the two terms, whereas the poorer pupils frequently 
fail to see the distinction. With this in mind, the statement 
“False beliefs are called hallucinations” is placed before the 
pupil. The better pupils know that an hallucination is not 
a false belief but is a false sensory experience, and they also 
know that a delusion is a false belief; so they are able to
-P-A-G-E-33
  Common Forms of New-Type Questions 27. 
utilize this knowledge in judging that the statement before 
them is false. The poorer pupils, lacking this clear distinc- 
tion, are inclined to mark it true because the word “false” 
which characterizes both delusions and hallucinations is 
here used with the word “hallucinations.” 
In spite of such ingenuity as may be exercised to mislead 
the less-informed pupil, there may be still a large element of 
guessing. That is, a completely ignorant person can mark 
50 per cent of the statements correctly by chance. There- 
fore, if true-false statements are to be used, it is necessary 
to utilize a very large number of them and to adopt a scoring 
method that will counteract this guessing factor. Discussion 
of this point will be presented in a later section of this manual. 
(f) PLURAL-CHOICE FORM OF RECOGNITION TYPE 
This type of question is merely an extension of the single- 
choice recognition form. It has been devised for use where 
the questions require two or more items in the answer. 
These two or more correct answers are given along with a 
number of unequivocally wrong but seductive alternatives. 
Two examples will suffice to show that this form of question 
is very similar to thesingle-choice form of the recognition type.

water; nitrogen; ammonia; sugar; argon; bismuth).

correct and should be underlined.

(g) PAIRING OR MATCHING TERMS IN PARALLEL COLUMNS 
This form has been used only to a slight extent in new-type 
examinations but is mentioned here because it is admirably 
adapted to testing certain kinds of knowledge. For in- 
stance, suppose that in a history course you desire to test 
knowledge of the chief characteristic of each of a dozen or 
more administrations and you wish to do this without having 
the pupil write lengthy answers. In this case you would 
list in one column in chronological or any other order 
(logical or haphazard) the various administrations, number- 
ing each, and then in a parallel column you would present, 
in random order, a list of chief characteristics. The pupil 
would then be required to match or pair each characteristic 
with its appropriate administration, indicating this in each 
case by placing the appropriate administration number 
before or after its characteristic. The following is an 
example :

(hk) THE ANALOGY FORM OF QUESTION 
This form is given special mention because of its difference 
from the ordinary question. It is especially well adapted 
to test a pupil’s ability to see fundamental relationships 
between various items studied in a course. The question is 
based upon an analogy such as “Day is to night as white is 
to black.” In giving the question, however, one of the four 
terms (usually the fourth) is omitted. The pupil may be 
required to supply the missing term, making it a recall-type 
question; but usually four or five alternative answers are 
given, only one of which is correct, and the pupil is required 
to choose the correct answer. The analogy form of question 
is, therefore, of the recognition type. The following are 
samples of this form: 
Automobile is to carriage as motorcycle is to (walking, horse, buggy, 
bicycle, train). « 
Circle is to square as sphere is to (circumference, cube, round, corners, 
ball). ; eee 
Gastric juice is to the stomach as (saliva, adrenin, tears, bile) is to the 
lachrymal glands. eer   
Note that grammar is to be sacrificed in some cases, as, 
for instance, in the third example just given. 
This form of question loses all meaning unless the first two 
terms bear the same relation to each other as the third and 
fourth terms bear. The precautions noted in preceding 
sections for the proper preparation of the one-word-answer 
question and for the recognition form of question also hold 
in the analogies form.

ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF EAcH FoRM OF 
QUESTION 
Tue following attempt to list the advantages and dis- 
advantages of each form of question, while not exhaustive, 
is sufficiently complete to give an inkling of some of their 
less obvious characteristics.1 
(ADVANTAGES OF THE RECALL TYPE | 
Success in answering this form of question is dependent 
upon the capacity to recall and apply principles, methods, 
facts, etc., which have been thoroughly learned. For this 
_ Teason it is one of the best of the new-type questions to test a 
pupil’s thoroughness of learning and the degree to which he has 
organized the theoretical and factual materials in the course. 
There is little danger that this type of question will tend 
to test in a rote manner that which has. been learned in 
recitation drill. It is so difficult to prepare this form of 
question that teachers will continue to quiz pupils orally 
with the old “how” type of question. Hence pupils will 
not be coached specifically in oral quizzes to answer exami- 
nation questions of this type. 
This form of question forces the pupil to be brief, concise, 
definite, and specific in thinking out and phrasing his answers. 
Such questions lead the pupil to give greater attention in 
study and preparation to the organization of subject matter 
and to the correct understanding of the details as a basis for 
1 No specific rules can be laid down to govern the question as to how large a 
class should be before it becomes “practicable” or “‘economical” to use objective 
examinations. This manual has been prepared primarily with the needs of large 
classes in mind. However, some teachers use objective examinations with classes 
as small as ten or twelve. The writer’s bias in favor of this form of examination 
leads him to advocate their use whenever the accurate measurement of pupil 
achievement is considered to be really important. Hence he would advocate their 
use with small classes as well as with large classes.

  Advantages and Disadvantages of Each Form 31 
accurate generalization. Thus halfway measures in learning 
tend to be discouraged and pupils are led to depend less on 
vague ideas, general impressions, and empty generalities. 
Brevity in this form of question coupled with brevity in the 
required answers permits the use of a relatively large number 
of questions without crowding the pupil for time. This re- 
sults in a very decided advantage as far as permitting an ade- 
quate sampling of every phase of the course is concerned. By 
utilizing this type of question in large numbers the teacher is 
able to sample or test each pupil’s knowledge of every phase 
of the course content, thus necessitating, on the pupil’s part, 
consistent application to and study of each textbook assign- 
ment, each reference reading, and each class discussion. 
Ease in scoring must also be listed as a distinct advantage 
possessed by the one-word-answer question. By controlling 
the correct answers and so framing the question as to permit 
of but one correct answer, it is possible to make a key for 
scoring the questions so that the routine scoring can be 
turned over to a clerk who need know little or nothing con- 
cerning the course content itself. Such a key gives to the 
examination a series. of definite units, each to be credited 
with one or two points when answered correctly. Because 
of the number of questions and the adequacy of the sampling 
of subject matter, it is possible to disregard the usually 
vexatious problem of weighting questions. 
DISADVANTAGES OF THE RECALL TYPE 
The chief disadvantage lies in the difficulty of preparing 
this type of question. Teachers find it very difficult to 
abandon suddenly their habits of phrasing traditional ques- 
tions. Not only is it a matter of breaking long-standing 
question-framing habits, but it is also a question of the time 
and effort required to write out adequate yet concise answers 
as a basis for framing this type of question. This disadvan-
-P-A-G-E-38
32 Preparation and Use of New-Type Examinations 
tage becomes less serious as one develops skill in framing such 
questions. Such skill develops, of course, in proportion to 
the amount of practice one has in preparing such questions. 
VAnother disadvantage may be said to exist in a somewhat 
natural tendency to base many of the questions on minor 
and relatively unimportant details of the course and to 
stress matters of rote memory rather than to stress items 
involving meanings, principles, applications, and the like. 
Here, again, the disadvantage tends to disappear as the 
teacher acquires skill in selecting and preparing thought- 
provoking questions bearing on the more fundamental and 
important phases of the subject matter. 
One drawback to the single-word-answer question is its 
lack of inclusiveness. In testing knowledge of some involved 
process, it is impossible to select one key question that will 
infallibly indicate the extent to which any given pupil knows 
the whole process. To overcome this disadvantage requires 
either the framing of a series of key questions each covering 
a phase or part of the total process (and there is certainly no 
objection to doing this) or adopting the expedient of framing 
the question so as to call for a multiple answer. In resorting 
to this expedient it is merely necessary to follow the direc- 
tions governing the preparation of the one-word-answer 
question involving a multiple answer. Since this variant 
of the one-word-answer method is practically the same as 
the one-word-answer type of question in principle and 
method of construction, it will not be discussed further here. 
THE COMPLETION TYPE 
The disadvantages of the completion type of question are 
somewhat less than for the ordinary recall question, for it is 
relatively easy to cover a whole complicated process by 
describing it and leaving blanks at critical points in the 
description. It is also somewhat easier to prepare. Good 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
Advantages and Disadvantages of Each Form 33 
judgment in determining the parts to be left blank is neces- 
sary, and, since no rules or principles are available to serve 
as a certain guide, it is best to submit a proposed completion 
test to several teachers for independent checking so as to 
secure the benefits of a combined judgment in preparing the 
final test for actual use with a class. 
It is probably true that a pupil’s success in handling 
the completion form of examination is dependent to a con- 
siderable extent upon his general intelligence. However, 
a person rating very high in standard intelligence tests but 
lacking in knowledge of a given subject would be certain to 
do poorly in a completion examination in that subject. On 
the other hand, of two pupils equally well prepared in the 
subject, the one who rates higher in standard intelligence 
tests would probably make the better mark. Some would 
classify this fact of dependence on general intelligence as 
an advantage, whereas others would consider it a disadvan- 
tage. If we define the function of an examination to be the 
reliable measurement of “knowledge of, and ability to think 
im, the material of the course,” ? then we should be inclined 
to classify this dependence of the completion question upon 
general intelligence as a decided advantage. 
ADVANTAGES OF THE RECOGNITION FORM 
The advantages of this form of question are similar to 
those mentioned for the recall-type question. It is an easier 
type of question to answer, for we are able to recognize much 
more on the basis of previous experience (study, hearing 
lectures, etc.) than we can actually recall. We are able to 
recognize the meaning of many more words than we are able 
to recall and use in sentences of our own construction. It 
is just this fact of being able to recognize more than we can 
1 Ben D. Wood, Measurement in Higher Education, page 153. 
   
-P-A-G-E-40
  34 Preparation and Use of New-Type Examinations 
recall that makes it wise to use this form of question as a 
supplement to the recall or single-word-answer form; it 
gives a measure of the pupil’s “acquaintance with’ the 
many phases of the subject matter, whereas the recall type 
of question is more likely to give a better measure of the 
pupil’s “knowledge about” the subject matter. This 
comparison or contrast is not to be taken too literally, for 
the recognition form is not limited to measuring simple 
“acquaintance with” the subject matter. But it is true 
that the latter is generally easier to answer and hence a 
pupil may be expected to answer in a given time a much 
larger number of recognition questions than of recall 
questions. 
This type is somewhat easier to prepare and is much more 
easily scored, for you need only compare the underlinings 
with the correctly marked key, or place a correctly numbered 
key alongside the numbers written in the column at the 
right-hand side of the page, without even reading any of the 
words on the examination page. 
There is a decided advantage in the use of several alterna- 
tive answers as compared with the use of only two, as in the 
case of the true-false type, because the chance of guessing 
the correct answer is less (i.e., only one out of four instead of 
one out of two), depending of course upon the number of 
alternative answers given. When this type of question was 
first used, it was the common practice to use four alterna- 
tives, one being the correct answer, but of late there is a 
strong tendency to use five alternatives, one of them being 
correct. Sometimes even as many as seven alternatives are 
used. 
DISADVANTAGES OF THE RECOGNITION FORM 
One disadvantage is found in the tendency to make the 
alternative incorrect answers partially or possibly correct.
-P-A-G-E-41
  Advantages and Disadvantages of Each Form 35 
This results in ambiguities and disagreements concerning 
the correct answer. Such ambiguities are very likely to 
creep in because of the teacher’s efforts to make the incorrect 
alternatives as plausible and seductive as possible. The 
only remedy for preventing this unfortunate error is to 
submit the questions to another equally competent teacher 
for trial, his job being to take the test. A check-up on his 
answers in comparison with the supposedly correct answers 
designed by the one preparing the examination will reveal 
those questions about which there is disagreement due to 
ambiguities either in the statement or in the possible answers. 
The practice of making such an independent check of the answers 
cannot be too strongly recommended. This method is followed 
by those who have had most experience in preparing and giving 
such examinations. 
ADVANTAGES OF THE TRUE-FALSE FORM 
On first sight the answering of true-false statements seems 
relatively simple. But the mental processes involved in 
making the judgments concerning the truth or falsity of those 
statements are by no means so simple. They demand the 
application of learned facts and principles to new situations 
and may involve thinking or reasoning of a high order. The 
extent to which such a question evokes involved reasoning 
is dependent, of course, on the ingenuity of the teacher in 
reparing thought-provoking statements. Such ingenuity 
pparently is itself dependent in large part on experience 
nd practice in preparing true-false statements. 
Another advantage inherent in this type of question lies 
the speed with which a pupil may answer these questions ; 
ence a relatively large number may be given in a short 
eriod of time with a resultant thorough sampling of every 
hase of the subject matter. From eighty to one hundred 
nd fifty may be given in an hour examination. The time

  36 Preparation and Use of New-Type Examinations 
   
       
    
    
    
                     
       
   for checking or underlining the “True” or “False” printed 
before each question is of course negligible, and the time 
required for simply reading the questions, while not negli- 
gible, is very short. This means that the bulk of the hour 
may be given over to genuine thinking, the results of such 
thinking being indicated without the use of writing. 
It is obvious that these true-false questions are very easily 
scored or marked by the use of a stencil or correctly marked 
key. The correctness or incorrectness of the underlining or 
encircling may be noted and indicated opposite each question 
without reading the questions at all, comparison with the 
stencil or correctly marked copy alone being necessary. 
DISADVANTAGES OF THE TRUE-FALSE FORM 
The chief difficulty with this form of question, as with any 
of the forms calling for a choice between only two answers 
such as “‘yes-no” questions, arises because of the “fifty- 
fifty” chance of guessing the correct answer, though it is 
true that the seductiveness or the obviousness of the state- 
ment affects this guessing element so markedly that we 
cannot assume the guessing factor to be present to this 
extent. Nevertheless, there is sufficient evidence on record 
to indicate that this guessing element is present to such aj 
degree as to render a surprisingly large proportion of ques- 
tions valueless. This being true, we are forced to utilize} 
a very large number of questions in order that the group o 
true-false questions may differentiate between the goo 
pupils and the poor pupils. This simply means that thi 
value of a true-false test is to be found in the relatively sma! 
number of questions which really differentiate between thi 
good and poor pupils while the rest of the questions, eve 
though they may not be detrimental, constitute so muc 
“excess baggage.” Most workers have recognized th
-P-A-G-E-43
  
Advantages and Disadvantages of Each Form 37 
necessity for overcoming this disadvantage by using a very 
large number of true-false statements whenever this form 
of question is used at all. The recommended number is 
seventy-five as a minimum, with one hundred as the more 
desirable number. Wood, in a recent study of the use of 
this type of question in law examinations, found this recom- 
mended number to give results not sufficiently reliable for 
his purpose and hence recommended the use in such exami- 
nations of two hundred questions as a minimum. These 
recommendations make this form of test somewhat unwieldy, 
especially when allowance is made for the fact that other 
forms of new-type questions should be employed as well. 
Since the use of a large number of true-false statements is 
not sufficient to counteract the effects of guessing, a method 
of scoring commonly known as the right-minus-wrong 
method is frequently used. This method is also used for the 
other forms of recognition test having but two alternative 
answers, such as the “yes-no,” “same-opposite” forms, etc. 
The way in which the scoring method counteracts the 
effect of guessing is as follows: Suppose that 100 statements 
are included in a true-false test and that a pupil has positive 
knowledge of 50 of them and no knowledge whatever of the 
other 50. At first thought the reader might assume that his 
score in the test would be 50 (the number of statements 
about which the pupil had positive knowledge); but it 
should be remembered that since there are only two ways of 
answering any question, even if the pupil has no knowledge 
of it whatever, he is as likely to guess right as to guess wrong, 
so that in thus guessing at the 50 about which he has no 
knowledge whatever, he will most probably guess 25 of them 
right. He may guess somewhat more or somewhat less than 
exactly half of them right, but he is more likely to guess 25 
right than any other number. This means that his score 
instead of being 50 is most probably 50 plus 25, or 75. Now, 
A
-P-A-G-E-44
  38 Preparation and Use of New-Type Examinations 
since the number that he got right by pure guess is most 
probably equal to the number wrong, if we subtract the 
number wrong from the total number right, this will have 
the same effect as if we subtracted from the total number 
right those which were got right by pure guessing and leave 
a score equal to the number that were got right because of 
the student’s having positive knowledge. Thus, in the case 
we have cited, subtracting 25, the number wrong, from 75, 
the number right, would give 50, which is the number of 
questions about which the pupil was supposed to have 
positive knowledge. In using this scoring method, questions 
omitted by the pupil are not counted as wrong, for it is 
obvious that if the pupil does not guess at the answer to a 
question but leaves it blank, he could not get a right answer. 
The above example is stated as if the number of wrong 
answers is always equal to the number of answers guessed 
correctly. Obviously this is not true, the facts being of the 
nature of probability. The scoring formula, based as it is 
on probability, represents the best estimate under the cir- 
cumstances, this estimate being close to the facts in each 
individual instance in proportion to the square root of the 
number of questions. Hence the formula applied to 1000 
questions would be closer to the true score for each person 
than it would be if applied to 100 questions. But it would 
not be ten times as close, being, in this instance, only three 
times as close. Such reasoning is based on the theory of 
pure chance and does not hold strictly in true-false examina- 
tions because of the seductiveness or the obviousness of the 
questions and because the pupils are not completely ignorant 
of the facts covered by the examination. The writer’s 
opinion is that, in a roo-question examination, the student’s 
score would not be in error on the average by more than 
five or six points. The error is far less than a layman would 
ordinarily anticipate, at least if that layman has the preva-
-P-A-G-E-45
  Advantages and Disadvantages of Each Form 39 
lent exaggerated notion of the accuracy of traditional 
examination methods. 
The score by the “right-minus-wrong”’ method may be 
found more quickly in some cases by subtracting twice the 
number wrong from the number of items attempted. For 
example, suppose that in a 100-item true-false test a pupil 
attempts 90 items, having omitted or left blank 10 items, 
and gets15 wrong. His score would be go attempts minus 30 
(twice the number wrong), which would be 60. Stated the 
other and longer way around, this pupil omitted 10 items, 
answered 75 items correctly, and answered 15 items incor- 
rectly. The 75 rights minus the 15 wrongs yields the same 
score; i.e., 60. 
The true-false type of question suffers from still another 
disadvantage similar to that mentioned for the single-choice 
type; namely, the tendency to include statements which 
are partly true and partly false. The writer knows of at least 
one instance where a teacher made a dismal failure in using 
this type of question simply because his examination con- 
tained many ambiguous statements. Some statements 
thought to be true by many pupils were marked wrong by the 
teacher, and some statements considered false by many 
pupils were considered to be true by the teacher. When the 
papers were handed back, some of the pupils were not con- 
vinced that their papers had been correctly graded. They 
consulted with another teacher, asking his opinion concerning 
the truth or falsity of the disputed questions. Unfortunately 
(for the examining teacher) this consultant disagreed with 
the original teacher’s answers, with a resultant dissatisfaction 
that was far from wholesome. Here, again, prevention of 
ambiguities is accomplished by submitting the prepared list 
of true-false statements to two or more teachers for inde- 
pendent judgments concerning each item. In this way 
ambiguities may be detected and the items either modified 
or dropped from further consideration.
-P-A-G-E-46
    40 Preparation and Use of New-Type Examinations 
THE PLURAL-CHOICE FORM OF RECOGNITION QUESTION 
The chief advantage of the plural choice of answers is that 
the chance of guessing the right answer to the item is 
reduced. For example, there is one chance in five of a pupil 
- guessing the right answer in the case of a single choice among 
five alternatives, but if two answers out of the five must be 
chosen, there is then only one chance in ten of the pupil 
getting the item right by guessing both of the answers. 
Two answers, of course, take slightly longer to score than 
one. The use of two choices also prevents the convenient 
use of numbering the answers and having the numbers placed 
in a column at the right-hand margin of the page. 
Apart from these, the advantages and disadvantages of 
the plural-choice form of question are approximately the 
same as those for the single-choice form. 
ADVANTAGES OF THE ANALOGY FORM 
The peculiar advantage possessed by this form of question 
lies in the possibility of testing a pupil’s knowledge of rela- 
tionships existing between various principles, theories, facts, 
etc., in the course. Thorough mastery of the isolated parts 
of the course is usually essential for the perception of rela- 
tionships. The pupil who is able to think of the various 
aspects of the course in terms of their relationships, their 
similarities, and their differences is certainly superior to one 
unable to do so. This form of question, therefore, would 
seem to be almost ideal for testing ‘‘knowledge of, and 
ability to think in, the material of the course.” 
This form of question, in addition, possesses the ad- 
vantages already noted for the single-word-answer and the 
single-choice form of questions, these being utilized in the 
formation of the analogy type of question.

    The chief drawback to this form of questions is found in 
the difficulty of preparing them. At least, teachers in 
psychology have found it a very difficult task, but their 
persistence has been rewarded by the final production of a 
fairly large number of analogy questions covering the 
elementary course. Even a small number of those questions 
are worth including in an objective examination because our 
analyses, as far as they go, indicate that a surprisingly large 
proportion of such questions actually differentiate between 
the superior and the inferior students. 
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF PAIRING OR 
MATCHING TERMS IN PARALLEL COLUMNS 
This form possesses the same advantages as the recall 
‘orm involving several answers, since it is similar in make- 
1p. This form, however, tests recognition or “acquaintance 
ith,” whereas the other form tests ability to recall or 
‘knowledge about.” No writing is involved in answering 
his form; hence its scoring is somewhat more objective. 
This form is not desirable when the list of terms is few in 
umber, because of the possibility of guessing. This dis- 
dvantage disappears if the number of pairs in the question 
s as large as twelve or-fifteen. At first sight it might appear 
o be a disadvantage to have as many as twelve pairs in the 
uestion, because of the possibility of eye strain and the 
aste of time in looking all the way up and down a long 
olumn. This disadvantage is more fancied than real. The 
iter included in a recent examination a matching question 
f twenty-seven pairs, none of the pupils complaining of 
iscomfort or waste of time.

DIRECTIONS FOR PREPARING AND USING OBJECTIVE 
EXAMINATIONS 
Tue following directions are based largely on the writer’s 
experience in preparing objective examinations for his own 
courses,’ in aiding the staff to prepare objective examinations 
for the eight or nine hundred students in elementary psychol- 
ogy, and in consulting with other faculty members and 
teachers who sought aid in preparing the new-type exami 
nations. In addition, these directions are based on general 
principles of examining derived by those who have experi 
mented in the development of standard intelligence tests. 
trade tests, and educational measuring scales. As far a 
possible the reasons for the various directions will be stated. 
but even so the writer fears that they may seem dogmatic 
        
    
    
     
        
      
   
   
     
      1. In assembling questions, care should be taken to cover 
every phase of the course. ang 
One of the advantages of new-type questions lies in thei 
brevity and hence the possibility of covering every phase 
the course. It is essential to sample widely the contents 
the course to be covered by the examination in order thal 
each pupil’s rating or grade will represent his mastery of th

assistant in the Department of Psychology at Ohio State University, he learn: 
from Dr. A. P. Weiss the technique involved. Reference is made in the bibliograp! 
to an article published by Dr. Weiss in 1911, describing the use of the “‘completi 
test” method of examining students in introductory psychology at the Universi 
of Missouri. One cannot discover the exact origin of such methods, for they we 
probably developed in one form or another in many places. The present wi 
spread interest shown in schools and colleges, of course, is due to the successful 
of objective examinations at Columbia University since 1919, these being ma 
possible by the ingenious devices invented by Arthur S. Otis and successfully utiliz 
in the Army Alpha intelligence tests, which were given to 1,700,000 draftees duri 
the recent war.

course as a whole. The principle here is the same as that 
which governs the work of the geologist in sampling the ore 
of a mine or of the grain dealer who samples the grain in a 
carload lot. ‘The sampling must be thorough and representa- 
tive of every part of the thing sampled. 
The best way to insure thorough sampling is to prepare 
questions for each chapter studied, for each lecture delivered, 
for each reference reading assigned, or for each experiment 
performed. When two or more teachers codperate in pre- 
paring an examination, it is economical for them to divide 
the various assignments among themselves, each preparing 
questions on a specified part of the course. 
2. In preparing questions, an effort should be made to 
secure many more questions than will actually be 
included im the examination. 
If this be done, ample opportunity will be given for 
selecting from among the suggested questions those which 
are most thought-provoking, rejecting those which are based 
on insignificant details or are ambiguous, poorly phrased, 
or labored. 
3. Ambiguous questions should be avoided. 
The only safe way to accomplish this is to have two and 
preferably more teachers answer each proposed question 
independently, and to compare their answers in order to 
reject those questions concerning which there is disagree- 
ment or to revise them so as to bring about agreement as 
to the correct answer. Those who have had little experience 
in the preparation and use of the new type of examination 
are especially cautioned with reference to this point. Much 
may hinge on meanings read into the terms used in phrasing
-P-A-G-E-50
  44 Preparation and Use of New-Type Examinations 
a question, and yet these various possibilities may remain 
hidden until independent answers given by two or more 
teachers are compared. Too much emphasis cannot be 
placed upon the necessity for rejecting ambiguous or poorly 
worded questions by some such method as is here recom- 
mended. Each question should be phrased in such words 
that there would be no disagreement among competent 
judges as to their meaning. The same, of course, applies to 
the answers. 
4. In determining the eligibility of any question, the 
basis of judgment should not be the apparent difficulty 
of that question. 
In the first place, judgments concerning the difficulty of a 
question are prone to error. In the second place, easy ques- 
tions are just as desirable as hard ones. There is a common 
tendency among teachers to refrain from asking an easy 
question because they seem to fear that every pupil will 
pass it. Experience has shown, however, that frequently a 
question thought to be easy by a teacher is not so easy when 
the pupils attempt it. Furthermore, an easy question 
which actually differentiates between the “D” and “F” 
pupils on the one hand, and the “C” or better pupils on the 
other, is just as valuable and indeed just as essential as a hard 
question which differentiates between the superior pupils 
and the medium pupils. Moreover, an easy question which 
differentiates between the poorest pupils and the rest is more 
valuable than a hard or difficult question which fails to 
differentiate between the superior and the less superior 
pupils. Certainly mere difficulty of a specific question, 
then, should not be the basis for its acceptance or re- 
jection.
-P-A-G-E-51
  Preparing and Using Objective Examinations 45 
5. In assembling the acceptable questions for the examina- 
tion, an effort should be made to include an equal 
number of easy, hard, and moderately difficult questions. 
Ifa 150-question examination contains fifty easy questions, 
fifty moderately difficult questions, and fifty hard questions, 
then there is a good chance for the examination to measure 
the inferior, average, and superior pupils with equal exact- 
ness. It is obvious that an examination consisting only of 
very difficult questions would fail to differentiate between 
the inferior pupils and the average pupils, because both 
groups would fail most of the questions and hence would 
have similar scores. In like manner an examination con- 
sisting only of easy questions would fail to differentiate 
between the average and the superior pupils because both 
these groups would pass practically all the questions. Simi- 
larly, an examination containing only questions of average 
difficulty would fail to differentiate between the average 
pupils and the superior because the latter in such an examina- 
tion would not be pushed to the limit of their capacity. For 
these reasons it is necessary to include a sampling of ques- 
tions of all degrees of difficulty in about equal proportions. 
Differentiation must be secured all along the line: from 
those pupils who are so inferior that they will fail some of 
the easy questions, to those who are so superior that they 
will pass most of the very difficult questions. 
6. In assembling the acceptable questions, it is well to 
have the first half dozen or so questions so easy that 
all pupils will pass them. 
This recommendation arises from the principle of the 
“shock absorber” theory of testing, which holds that the 
initial test in a series should be so easy that the person tested 
is able to do it without effort, thus embarking on the real
-P-A-G-E-52
  46 Preparation and Use of New-Type Examinations 
test series without initial shock. Compliance with this 
principle prevents the resentment felt by pupils when they 
are unable to handle the first few questions and avoids or 
reduces any nervousness due to apprehension and dread 
which a pupil may have as he begins an examination. 
7. Each of the acceptable questions should be an inde- 
pendent unit in the examination, not depending on 
any other question for its meaning. 
Teachers sometimes place a series of related questions in 
an examination, the answer to several being dependent 
on ability to answer the first one. If that one be missed 
the pupil automatically misses the others, although his 
knowledge of the several elements involved may by no means 
be as limited as his series of failures would seem to indicate. 
Or, it sometimes happens that one or more of the related 
questions is unknown to the pupil, yet its correct answer 
is either given directly or is strongly suggested by others in 
the series. These considerations make it wise to build the 
examination out of independent questions each a unit in 
itself. 
8. Each of the acceptable questions should be short. 
Other things being equal, the shorter the question the 
better. This recommendation means that complexly worded 
questions or statements should be avoided. Unusual or 
1 The attitude of pupils toward this type of examination is important and 
fortunately has usually been favorable. Data, recently obtained from 226 students 
in elementary psychology, who had already experienced two one-hour objective 
mid-quarter examinations and one two-hour final objective examination, show 
84 per cent definitely expressing a preference for the new-type examination, 13.3 
per cent preferring the traditional written examination, and 2.7 per cent expressing 
no preference. A larger proportion of those making a high grade in these objective 
examinations prefer them as compared with the proportion of those making a low 
grade. However, 72 per cent of those getting an ““F” grade in the objective 
examination actually stated a preference for the short-answer examination.
-P-A-G-E-53
Preparing and Using Objective Examinations 47 
unfamiliar terms and the use of double negatives should 
likewise be avoided. If these are not avoided, the question 
is likely to turn out to be a test of language or vocabulary 
rather than a test of subject-matter knowledge. 
g. The examination should include a very large number 
of questions. 
Within the limits permitted by the time allotted to the 
examination, the larger the number of questions the better. 
If only a few questions are included, chance or accident is 
permitted much greater sway than if many questions are 
utilized. In other words, the examination should give the 
pupil as many opportunities as possible to show what he 
knows. Teachers, experimenting with the new-type exami- 
nation for the first time, are more likely to err by giving too 
few than too many questions. One teacher, for example, 
gave a new-type examination consisting of the ridiculously 
small number of eight questions. He concluded that the 
new-type examination is a failure for his particular subject. 
Not one of those eight questions was significant or valid 
because each was so easy that approximately eighty to ninety 
per cent of his pupils passed it. The only thing that this 
teacher proved was that eight new-type questions, each one 
valueless, when combined into an examination would like- 
wise be valueless. This teacher was surprised when informed 
that a fair trial would have demanded at least seventy-five 
or one hundred questions. 
10. Questions should be grouped according to form or type 
of question, the examination itself consisting of as many 
parts as there are types of questions. 
There are three reasons for this direction. In the first 
place, each type of question needs to be introduced by 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
    48 Preparation and Use of New-Type Examinations 
specific directions to the pupil in order to avoid any pos- 
sible misunderstanding as to what the pupil is expected to do. 
In the second place, it is possible that a pupil’s “set” or 
attitude toward different types of questions varies with each 
type; hence he is able to work at higher efficiency if his 
“set” toward single-word-answer questions is permitted 
full sway on that type of question before he is required to 
shift to answer completions or some other form of question. 
In the third place, scoring of the examination is facilitated 
and probably made more accurate if the different types of 
questions are assembled in separate parts. If the papers 
are marked by two or more persons, each can specialize 
on a given part of the examination, one person marking 
the single-word-answer questions, another the single- 
choice questions, another the completions, andso on. Such 
division of labor in itself speeds up the marking process, 
greater accuracy probably resulting from marking or 
scoring one type of question at a time. 
11. Within each part of the examination the questions should 
be arranged according to topical sequence in the course. 
Cognizance is given, here, to the importance of the 
“mental set” developed by the logical arrangement and 
presentation of the various topics in the course. Since 
course outlines usually aim to do this in the hope of instilling 
logical organization of subject matter, it would seem desir- 
able to maintain, as far as possible, the same arrangement in 
the examination questions. It is true that we do not have 
experimental evidence of the wisdom of such arrangement 
compared, for instance, to the arrangement of questions 
according to difficulty. Nevertheless, in the present state of 
our ignorance, it would seem wiser to arrange the questions 
according to topical sequence in the course.

12. The new-type examination as a whole should be pre- 
ceded by general directions as distinguished from the 
special directions preceding each part of the examination. 
The aim of such general directions is to give the pupil an 
attitude of deliberateness and thoughtfulness so that he will 
not become flustered or worried over inability to answer 
particular isolated questions. The following general direc- 
tions have been successfully used in examination procedures : 
General directions. “The aim of this examination is to 
give you an opportunity to show what you have learned from 
your study of United States history (or whatever the subject 
may be). It is not expected that you will be able to answer 
every question. Read the directions for each part carefully 
and be sure you understand what you are to do before you 
begin.” 
13. Specific directions should be given in regard to answering 
items about which a pupil may be uncertain. 
Some teachers penalize for wrong answers without so 
informing the pupils, whereas other teachers exact the same 
penalties and do inform the pupils. Some teachers do not 
penalize for wrong answers and so inform their pupils, while 
others do not penalize and do not inform their pupils of this 
fact. With this unfortunate diversity of practice it is 
no wonder that pupils going from a new-type examination 
given by one teacher to a similar examination given by 
another teacher are often in doubt as to whether they should 
guess or not guess on the questions concerning which they 
may be uncertain. This diversity of practice is almost cer- 
tain to continue for some time, until gradually a common 
practice is established through common understanding and 
agreement. In the meantime each teacher should announce 
for each examination, and for each part of each examination, 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  50 Preparation and Use of New-Type Examinations 
his plan of scoring. The writer advocates the announcement 
of the plan of scoring but does not recommend that the 
pupils be instructed to guess. This position is not based on 
theoretical considerations, but on grounds of policy. If 
one definitely advises pupils to guess, then pupils, whose 
“defense mechanisms” work overtime when they feel they 
have done poorly, will be justified, to a slight degree, in 
branding the examination as nothing more than a “guessing 
contest”? akin to a crossword puzzle. It does not seem 
wise to facilitate such criticism, even though it be ill- 
founded; hence the avoidance of advice to guess. 
Some will take exception to this procedure on the following 
theoretical grounds: It is better that pupils should guess, 
because a pupil may know the right answer to several ques- 
tions but not feel entirely sure, and, if conscientious, he may 
think he is not living up to directions if he puts down an 
answer which may be right, when he is not absolutely certain 
about it, and in this way he would be penalized for not 
writing down the answers to a number of questions to which 
he might know the right answers. In other words, guessing 
enables the pupil to get credit for all that he knows, both 
thoroughly and partially, for if the pupil does not feel sure 
of the answers to ten questions but partially knows each one, 
the chances are that he will get six or seven or even eight of 
them right even though he thinks he is merely guessing, 
and in this way will get credit for his partial knowledge. 
Hence the pupil should be instructed to guess. This posi- 
tion has much to commend it theoretically; yet the writer 
would not advocate instructions to guess because of the 
“defense mechanisms”’ mentioned above. Furthermore, it 
seems worth while pedagogically to develop an attitude of 
certainty of knowledge on the part of pupils by teachers, so 
that pupils will come to know what they know, and what 
is even more important, will know what they do not know.
-P-A-G-E-57

However, this whole discussion may be much ado about 
nothing, since recent experimental work by Ruch and by 
Paterson and Langlie shows that the right-minus-wrong 
formula contributes nothing of value to the technique of 
true-false tests; on the contrary, it actually results in lower 
reliability coefficients than simply scoring by the number 
right.’ In view of these results, indicating that such tests 
should be scored number right, it would seem wise to dis- 
courage guessing by definite instructions not to guess. 
The following are sample directions that may prove sug- 
gestive and helpful : 
Directions for single-word-answer questions. “The ques- 
tions in this part can be answered by a single word. The 
number in parentheses after a blank indicates the number of 
letters in the right answer. If you cannot think of the exact 
word called for but are reasonably certain that a shorter or 
longer word is equally correct, then write it down. Your 
score for this part will be based on the number of questions 
correctly answered, no penalty being exacted for wrong 
answers.” 
Directions for completion method. “The following ques- 
tions can be answered by a single word for each blank. The 
number in parentheses after a blank indicates the number of 
letters in the right word. If you cannot think of the exact 
word called for but are reasonably certain that a shorter or 
longer word is equally correct, then write it down. Your 
score for this part will be based on the number of blank 
spaces correctly filled. No penalty will be exacted for blank 
spaces incorrectly filled.” 
Directions for single-choice recognition form of question. 
“After or in each statement there are four or more words or 
phrases in parentheses, each preceded by a number. You

  52 Preparation and Use of New-Type Examinations 
are to underline the one word or phrase that makes the truest 
or best statement and write its number on the line at the 
right-hand side of the page. Your score will be based on 
the number of correct words or phrases underlined and 
entered in the margin. If a wrong word or phrase is under- 
lined as well as the right one in any given statement, no 
credit will be given for that statement. No penalty will be 
exacted for those statements incorrectly answered.” 
Directions for true-false type of question. “The letters F 
and T precede each statement below. Encircle the letter 
F if the statement is false. Encircle the letter T if the 
statement is true. Do not guess. If you are unable to 
decide whether a statement is true or false, leave it alone. 
You will be penalized for each statement incorrectly marked 
by deducting one point or credit from the number of 
correctly marked statements.” 
Directions for plural-choice recognition form of question. 
“Underline one or more terms in the parentheses in or follow- 
ing each statement to make the éruest or best statement. Do 
not guess. You will be penalized for each incorrect under- 
lining by deducting one point or credit from the number of 
correctly marked terms.” 
Directions for the analogies form of question. ‘In each of 
the statements below, the first term is to (:) the second 
term as (::) the third zs fo (:) one of the four terms in 
parentheses. Example. boy: man:: girl: (human being; 
youth; woman; adult). The right word in parentheses is 
woman, therefore it is underlined. Similarly, proceed to find 
the right term in the parentheses for each statement below 
and underline it. Your score for this part will be based 
on the number of correct terms underlined. If a wrong term 
is underlined as well as the right one in any given state- 
ment, no credit will be given for that statement. No penalty 
will be exacted for those statements incorrectly answered.”
-P-A-G-E-59
  
Preparing and Using Objective Examinations 53 
Directions for pairing or matching terms in parallel columns. 
Directions for this form of question will vary according to 
the material included, because the directions must indicate 
what things in both columns are to be matched. The 
following directions are taken from a psychology examination 
covering in part certain phases of abnormal psychology. The 
last two sentences of these directions could be used whenever 
this form of question is used, regardless of the subject matter 
involved. ‘The left-hand numbered list below is made up 
of instances of normal behavior resembling in principle the 
forms of abnormal behavior listed in the right-hand list. 
For each item in the left-hand list there is the name of its 
principle or class in the right-hand list. Find the principle 
corresponding to each instance and give it the same number 
as the instance. Your score will be based on the number of 
terms in the right-hand column correctly numbered. No 
penalty will be exacted for incorrectly numbered items.” 
If the teacher desires to counteract the guessing element in 
this form of question (and he should do so whenever the 
number of terms is rather small), the last two sentences of the 
above directions should be changed to read as follows: ‘Do 
not guess. You will be penalized for each incorrectly 
numbered term by deducting one point or credit from the 
number of correctly numbered terms.” : 
14. The arrangement of true-false items should be a random 
one, and there should be approximately an equal number 
of true and false items. 
When true-false statements are used, care should be taken 
to avoid any regular sequence of true and false items. The 
safest way to insure a random order is to toss a penny, letting 
heads represent true statements and tails false statements, 
arranging the items in the examination according to the 
outcome of the penny tossing. Ordinarily there should be 
   
-P-A-G-E-60
  54 Preparation and Use of New-Type Examinations 
approximately the same number of both true and false 
statements in the test, in order that their arrangement may 
follow a chance order. This direction holds also for the 
plural-choice recognition form of question. 
15. The placement of the correct answers among the 
alternative answers in the single-choice and the plural- 
choice questions should follow a chance order. 
This means that the correct answer should not always be 
found in the same position, the order being determined by 
chance, so that the correct answer sometimes appears first, 
sometimes second, and so on. To insure a purely chance 
arrangement for the single-choice questions, one can place in 
a hat a large number of slips of paper with an equal number of 
ones, twos, threes, fours, and fives written on them, and then 
draw out the slips of paper one at a time, the number drawn 
each time indicating the place among the alternatives of the 
correct answer in each successive question. To insure a 
chance arrangement for the plural-choice questions, one can 
prepare a large number of slips of paper, half containing the 
word “right” and half containing the word “wrong,” and 
then draw out one slip of paper at a time and arrange the 
right and wrong answers in the parentheses accordingly. 
The drawings should be repeated for each successive ques- 
tion, to avoid any definite order from question to question. 
16. The use of a red or a blue pencil in scoring the examination 
papers and a uniform method of marking correct, incorrect, 
and omitted answers is recommended. 
The use of a colored pencil in scoring is recommended be- 
cause the number of correct answers on a page then stands out 
in bold relief and may be more quickly and accurately summed 
and recorded at the bottom of each page. A uniform method 
of marking the questions reduces the uncertainty a teacher
-P-A-G-E-61
  Preparing and Using Objective Examinations 55 
may feel in recorrecting a paper at a later date, in going over 
an examination paper with a pupil, or in later making statis- 
tical studies concerning the difficulty and validity of each 
question. The following marks are suggested : a check mark 
(V) for right, a cross (X) for wrong, and an O for those 
omitted when necessary in right-minus-wrong scoring, to keep 
the omitted items separate from those wrong. 
17. The use of scoring formulas is not ordinarily recom- 
mended, with the possible exception of a “right-minus- 
wrong” formula for scoring true-false questions. 
In scoring single-word-answer questions or completion 
questions, the common practice is to give a credit of one 
point for each correct word supplied by the pupil. In 
scoring the single-choice or recognition questions a credit 
of one point for each correct underlining is also the rule. 
Experiments have demonstrated that no advantage arises 
from any effort to counteract the guessing element in this 
type of question by using such a formula as “number right 
minus one-third or one-fourth the number wrong.” In 
scoring true-false questions, however, it may be advisable to 
use the “right-minus-wrong”’ formula, because the guessing 
element is so strongly present in these questions, even 
though great ingenuity to prevent the possibility of guessing 
be exercised in their preparation. 
18. The vexatious problem of “weighting” the marks 
assigned different questions can best be solved by the 
avoidance of any “weighting” whatsoever. 
This recommendation is based on the general lack of 
knowledge concerning the proper procedure for determining 
“weights.” Furthermore, the problem of weighting is 
much less important when new-type examinations are used, 
because the large number of questions greatly reduces the  
-P-A-G-E-62
  56 Preparation and Use of New-Type Examinations 
significance or importance of any given question. Weight- 
ing should be resorted to, of course, only when one question 
is much more important than another; and since there is no 
way of determining in advance the relative importance of 
each question, the problem of weighting loses significance 
and can safely be abandoned.? 
19. The total scores for the examination papers should be distrib- 
uted on graph paper and a key for converting total scores 
into letter grades derived, and put in the form of a table. 
This recommendation recognizes the necessity of making 
a clear-cut distinction between measuring the capacity of 
pupils in terms of scores on the one hand and rewarding their 
efforts in the form of grades on the other. The measurement 
of pupil capacity is a technical problem, just as the deter- 
mination of the height of individuals or the rate of basal 
metabolism of individuals is a problem involving scientific 
measurement. The awarding of grades, however, is an 
administrative problem involving essentially the establish- 
ment of educational policies. It is an interpretation of 
particular scores made on the examination with reference 
to established practices, standards of grading, or norms. 
Measurements of capacity cannot be absolute at present 
because there are no defined zero points for the various sub- 
jects and there are no definite units of capacity each equal to 
every other. Therefore measurements of capacity must 
necessarily be relative —the score made by the average 
student in a group being the best point of reference, the other 
1 This recommendation deals with the question of weighting individual questions. 
However, when the various parts of the examination are disproportionate in length, 
it may be desirable to weight the scores for the various parts differently in deriving 
a total score for the examination as a whole. No single rule can be laid down for 
such procedure. This whole question of “weighting” must usually be settled 
arbitrarily and can best be avoided by endeavoring to prepare an examination with 
each part containing approximately the same number of questions.
-P-A-G-E-63
  Preparing and Using Objective Examinations 57 
scores being so much above or below that average. By 
distributing the scores made in an examination on a graph, 
the relativity of the scores will at once become apparent and 
the extent of the differences in capacity between the various 
pupils will be revealed. How many pupils should be given 
a grade of “A” then becomes a question of educational policy, 
just as the matter of how many individuals in a given group 
are to be designated “tall” on the basis of height measure- 
ments depends upon consensus of opinion and agreement as 
to just what height measurement must be exceeded by a 
person to warrant the label “tall.” 
Suppose that the prevailing practice demands 1o per 
cent A’s, 20 per cent B’s, 40 per cent C’s, 20 per cent D’s, and 
zo per cent F’s, and suppose that the teacher has no good 
reasons for assuming that his particular pupils differ in 
capacity from the average run of pupils; then a key for 
translating scores into grades could be derived as follows : 
  
  
  Scores mv Exam. Per Cent Makinc Scores GraDE To BE ASSIGNED 
134 to 170 9-5 A 
105 to 133 21.0 B 
83 to 104 39.0 Cc 
55 to 82 20.5 D 
o to 54 10.0 F 
  
  
The writer has no intention, in this place, of dictating 
or even suggesting the standard of grading to be followed by 
teachers in carrying out the recommendation for distributing 
the examination scores and transmuting them into letter 
grades. That standard may be made severe, resulting in 
few A’s and B’s and in a great number of D’s and F’s; or it 
may be lenient, resulting in many A’s and B’s and few D’s 
and F’s; or it may approximate some form of the normal 
frequency curve such as is used in the above example. The  
-P-A-G-E-64
  58 Preparation and Use of New-Type Examinations 
standard to be used should be dictated by the prevailing 
practice in a given school or by the instructions issued by 
supervisors, principals, heads of departments, deans, or 
other administrative officers. 
It scarcely need be pointed out that the relativity of 
measurements of capacity makes unnecessary the scoring 
of examinations on a percentage basis. Such a percentage 
basis has little meaning, since an 80 per cent mark on one 
examination may represent the capacity of one of the least 
capable pupils, whereas a 55 per cent mark on another 
examination may typify the work of one of the most capable 
pupils. The lack of meaning attaching to any particular 
percentage score arises, of course, because of the difficulty, 
if not the impossibility, of preparing a series of examinations 
each one of which is equal in difficulty to every other one. 
Because of these facts, the best practice in using new-type 
examinations consists in counting the number of right 
answers. The total possible score may, therefore, be 58, 
93, 125, or what not, depending upon the number of units 
in the examination. It is not good practice to convert the 
number of points earned by a pupil into a percentage of the 
total possible number of points. 
20. The examination should be mimeographed or printed 
so that each pupil will have a copy; the examinations 
when scored should not be returned to the pupils. 
The nature of the many responses made in the new-type 
examination makes it necessary to submit to each pupil a 
mimeographed or printed copy. These should be filled out 
by the pupils and handed in to the teacher, care being taken 
to prevent any stray or extra copies falling into the hands of 
the pupils. Some teachers have attempted to give such ex- 
aminations orally, thus avoiding the necessity of mimeograph- 
“ing the examinations. This practice is not recommended,
-P-A-G-E-65
  _ Preparing and Using Objective Examinations 59 
for it is reported that pupils develop signaling systems 
especially for the true-false and single-choice questions. 
It is generally believed that various student organizations 
collect and file for the benefit of their members copies of vari- 
ous examinations given in the several courses. This results, 
of course, in unfair competition, because members of such 
organizations are favored by the opportunity to coach one 
another to answer typical sample questions, many of which 
are used over and over again in given courses. The new- 
type examination is so lengthy that pupils will be unable in 
the time allowed to copy it and attempts to copy can be 
prevented by proper proctoring. Hence the teacher can 
prevent the possibility of specific coaching for his examina- 
tions by simply retaining under lock and key all used and 
unused examinations. It is true that pupils have a right 
to know the results of their work on an examination, and 
this can be provided for by giving out examination scores and 
grades and by announcing that any pupil should feel free to 
consult the teacher concerning his actual work on any exami- 
nation. This procedure has worked well both in satisfying 
the pupils that their individual interests are being protected 
and in preventing student organizations from becoming 
examination-coaching bureaus. 
21. The prevention of coaching should also be accomplished 
by using equivalent duplicate forms for classes in the same 
subject taking the examination at different hours or on 
different days and by changing the examination questions 
from semester to semester. 
This recommendation is in harmony with prevailing opin- 
ion and is to be followed in those situations where the pupils 
might know that the same examination was being repeated 
without change or where pernicious coaching bureaus or 
coaching tutors infest the educational community. Readers
-P-A-G-E-66
  60 Preparation and Use of New-Type Examinations 
are referred to the article by W. S. Miller, listed in the 
Appendix, in which the same examination has apparently 
been used successfully for ten successive quarters, as an 
instance where duplicate forms have been unnecessary. 
22. The diagnostic significance of each question should be 
determined and a large file of valid questions should be 
built up in order constantly to improve the accuracy of 
examinations. 
This recommendation is idealistic in so far as it looks for- 
ward to the distant day when teachers will have on file a very 
large number of diagnostic questions to serve as a reservoir for 
the ready assembly of highly accurate examinations. This 
recommendation urges various teachers to build up a file of 
all questions used for a period of years, so that a reservoir of 
from 1500 to 2000 objective questions could be developed 
from which examinations in endless variety could be quickly 
assembled and used as occasion demanded. Some provision 
would have to be made, of course, to eliminate from time to 
time those questions which become obsolete as the subject 
matter changes. 
To carry out this recommendation completely would 
involve an enormous amount of clerical labor. The required 
methodology will be briefly described in terms of the work 
now actually under way by the Minnesota Department of 
Psychology for its own courses. As soon as a course is com- 
pleted and the final course marks are reported to the registrar, 
a tabulation of the results for each objective question given 
during the course is made in the following manner : 
a, Examination papers submitted by all students receiv- 
ing final grades of A, B, D, or F in the course are segregated, 
together with a random sampling of at least 100 papers of 
students receiving the grade of C in the course. 
6. The percentage of students in each of these five groups
-P-A-G-E-67
Preparing and Using Objective Examinations 61 
who pass each question in the objective examination is then 
computed. 
c. A card is made out for each question, giving the ques- 
tion and the acceptable answer, the date when the question 
was used, and the percentage of the A students passing it, 
the percentage of the B students passing it, and so on. 
d. These cards are classified according to the form or type 
of question and the topic dealt with and are then filed for 
reference. An index of topics in the elementary course has 
been prepared for this purpose. 
e. Whenever a question has been used a second time, its 
card is removed from the file and the percentage of A students 
passing it and so forth is recorded again, with a notation as 
to the date when it was used this second time. 
The department, in following this method, is gradually 
building up a file of questions, each having been analyzed to 
determine the extent to which it differentiates between the 
superior, the average, and the inferior students in the course. 
The analysis for certain typical questions is given below as 
an illustration of the results. 
Question: By the .. . . (a1) method we 
investigate likenesses anid differences between individuals and groups. 
This is a completion type of question, the correct answer 
being “comparative.” The tabulated results for this 
question were :

    Per cent passing . . . 25 52 
  
  
These figures show that there is a progressive increase in 
the per cent passing this question, proceeding upward from 
the F students to the A students. This is a good question,
-P-A-G-E-68
  62 Preparation and Use of New-Type Examinations 
for success in answering it is shown to have a close relation- 
ship to ability in the course as a whole. 
Question: The junction of one neurone with another is known as a

This is a one-word-answer question requiring the correct 
answer ‘“‘synapse” to be written over the seven dots. The 
results for the question were:

Here we have a question that is much too easy — so easy, 
in fact, that those of little achievement in the course (the 
F and D students) are able to pass it without difficulty. 
It is obvious that such a question neither adds nor detracts 
from the value of the examination, its presence merely adding 
to the total expense without serving any diagnostic purpose. 
However, such a question is useful if it is placed at the very 
beginning of an examination, with other equally easy ques- 
tions, to serve as a “shock absorber.” 
Question: TF Unless a person intends to learn he cannot memorize. 
This is a true-false question requiring T or F to be encir- 
cled according to the truth or falsity of the statement. The 
statement is actually false, and F should be encircled. The 
results for the question were :

This question fails to differentiate between the five groups 
of students. Indeed, the A and B students actually show 
less ability in answering this question than do the F and D 
students. While it is true that this is an extreme example 
of an unsatisfactory question, yet such questions are rather 
frequent. In fact, the type of question given in the first 
illustration is rather rare and is far less common than one 
would ordinarily suppose in the absence of actual experience 
in attempting to discover experimentally the validity of 
examination questions. Additional examples of the results 
of such analytical work are given in the accompanying 
graph.

  Graph illustrating different types of diagnostic questions. Small Charts I-IV 
illustrate ideal questions which sharply differentiate between one level of ability 
and all higher levels of ability. Such questions are so “ideal” that they are rarely 
found to exist in practice. Charts V-VIII illustrate satisfactory questions which 
show more gradual increases in the percentage passing them as you proceed from 
the F pupils to the A pupils. Charts IX—XI illustrate unsatisfactory questions 
which show little or no differences between the various levels of ability. Chart XIT 
also illustrates an unsatisfactory question; in this case a smaller percentage of A 
and B pupils passed the question than of C, D, or F pupils. See J. C. Chapman’s 
Trade Tests for a more complete discussion of similar analyses made in the construc- 
tion of Army trade tests.

Some will question the wisdom of such a procedure in the 
absence of actual evidence demonstrating that diagnostic 
questions at one time continue to be diagnostic when used at 
a later time, and that non-diagnostic questions at one time 
continue to be non-diagnostic when used again. Unfortu- 
nately, such evidence is not plentiful, largely because this 
method of analysis has been used so infrequently. Our own 
departmental analysis has not been carried far enough to 
give adequate evidence on this point, but such results as we 
have indicate that a question found to be diagnostic tends 
to be diagnostic when used again. Only one published 
experimental study on this specific point has come to the 
writer’s attention, that study concluding: “The stability 
of difficulty and distributing value of information questions 
is sufficiently stable so that questions can be evaluated one 
year for use the next.” * 
SUMMARY OF ABOVE DIRECTIONS 
Perhaps a summary of the above directions in condensed 
outline form will be serviceable for ready reference purposes. 
1. Questions covering every phase of the course should 
be utilized to insure wide sampling of pupil knowledge. 
2. An excess number of questions should be prepared to 
allow ample opportunity for the selection of the best ques- 
tions for the examination proper. 
3. Ambiguous questions both with respect to meaning 
and possible answer should be rejected. 
4. The apparent difficulty of a question should not be 
the basis for either accepting or rejecting a proposed question. 
5. Acceptable questions should include an equal number 
of easy, hard, and moderately difficult questions. 
1 This conclusion is taken from the following article: W. R. Wilson, G. Welsh, 
and H. Gulliksen, “ An Evaluation of Some Information Questions,” Journal of 
Applied Psychology, Vol. VIII, No. 2, pages 206-214; June, 1924.
-P-A-G-E-71
  Preparing and Using Objective Examinations 65 
6. The first half dozen or so questions should be so easy 
that practically all can answer them, thus serving as a “‘shock 
absorber.” 
7. Each acceptable question should be an independent 
unit in the examination. 
8. Each acceptable question should be short. 
g. The examination should include a very large number 
of questions. 
to. Each form or type of question should be segregated, 
the examination consisting of as many parts as there are 
types of questions. 
11. Within each part of the examination the questions 
should be arranged according to topical sequence in the 
course. 
12. The examination itself should be preceded by suitable 
general directions. 
13. Specific directions should be given for each segregated 
group of questions. 
14. There should be a random arrangement of true-false 
questions, with approximately an equal number of true and 
false statements. 
15. The correct answers among the alternative answers in 
the single-choice and in the plural-choice questions should 
be placed according to chance. 
16. A uniform method of marking the papers, together 
with the use of a colored pencil in scoring, should be used. 
17. Scoring formule should not be used except possibly 
for the true-false type of questions, when a right-minus- 
wrong scoring formula may be used. 
18. “Weighting” of questions according to difficulty or im- 
portance is rendered unnecessary in new-type examinations. 
19. Total scores should be computed for the examination 
papers, distributed on a graph or table, and then a key for 
converting total scores into letter grades derived. 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
  66 Preparation and Use of New-Type Examinations 
20. The examination should be mimeographed or printed, 
and both used and unused copies should be kept under lock 
and key in order to avoid the possibility of coaching. 
21. The prevention of coaching should also be accom- 
plished by using duplicate forms for classes in the same sub- 
ject taking the examination at different hours or on different 
days and by changing the examination questions from 
semester to semester. 
22. A large file of questions should be developed for each 
course, so that a reservoir of from 1500 to 2000 objective 
questions would be available from which examinations in 
endless variety could be quickly assembled and used as 
occasion demands. The ideal plan is to determine the 
diagnostic significance of each question, thus developing a 
large list of valid questions to be used in the preparation of 
examinations.

  APPENDIX A 
ILLUSTRATING THE NEW-TYPE EXAMINING TECHNIQUE 
IN ELEMENTARY PsycHoLocy * 
Tus Appendix has been prepared in the belief that a presenta- 
tion of the data yielded by an objective examination will be 
welcomed by those who have not experimented with such 
methods. It includes sample questions taken from the two- 
hour final examination given to one section in elementary 
psychology on December 16, 1924. These are followed by 
statistical data typifying certain profitable and illuminating 
manipulations of the examination results. The analyses here 
described are applicable in a variety of courses, whether taught 
in the elementary grades, in high school, or in college. 
I. SAMPLE QUESTIONS 
Part I consisted of 35 single-choice questions, the instructions 
being to underline the one word in parentheses which makes the 
truest or best statement. Ten of the questions were : 
1. The appearance of a response after a succession of weak stimuli is 
called: (codrdination; serial combination; summation; inhibition). 
2. Allied reflexes (are learned; inhibit each other; reinforce each other ; 
do not exist). 
3. The autonomic nervous system (makes connections with smooth 
muscles; never acts except in emotion; has no connections with the 
central nervous system; is primarily a sensory system). 
4. Glandular responses inhibited in emotional experiences are the 
(adrenal; thyroid; pituitary; salivary). 
5. Euphoria is (a “‘higher emotion”; a primary emotion; an organic 
state; a state of extreme depression). 
6. Hate may be considered as (an instinct; a primary emotion; a 
compound of anger and fear; a sentiment). 
1 The emphasis on examinations in this course results from the conditions under 
which it is given. No reliable class impression of the work of individual students 
is possible, since the quiz instructors meet each group only one hour a week for 
recitation. No laboratory work, no board work, no themes, no library reports are 
involved. Enrollment in the course is not open to freshmen; hence the number 
failing the course is much smaller than in a freshman course. 
67 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  68 Appendix A 
7. “Showing the teeth in scorn” is (an emotional state; a sensation; an 
expressive movement; a conditioned emotion). 
8. Negative adaptation occurs quickly when the stimulus is (painful; 
very intense; natural; harmless). 
9. In maze learning a rat is guided chiefly by (vision; hearing; smell; 
muscle-sense). 
to. The jerky movements of the eyes in reading a book (are due to the 
nervousness of the person; can be suppressed at will; cannot be 
avoided; disappear with learning). 
Part II consisted of 36 analogies. The instructions called for 
underlining the right word in the parentheses. Ten of the 
questions were : 
1. Comparative method : differences and similarities : : genetic method 
: (development; degeneration; complete mastery; mnemonic 
systems). 
2. Central fissure : frontal lobe and parietal lobe : : fissure of Sylvius 
: (parietal lobe and occipital lobe; parietal lobe and temporal lobe; 
occipital lobe and cerebellum). 
3. Inhibition : codrdination : : facilitation : (reinforcement; codrdina- 
tion; allied reflexes; mass action of cerebrum). 
4. Spinal reflexes : cord : : natural balance movement : (cortex; thala- 
mus; cerebellum; somesthetic area). 
5. Knee jerk : lower spinal center : : speaking : (motor area; somesthetic 
area; super-motor area; thalamus). 
6. Simple reaction (as in the reaction experiment) : reflex :: quick 
: (slow; quicker; hesitant; fast). 
7. Native : acquired : : pupillary reflex : (sneezing; smiling; coughing; 
reading). 
8. Anger : fighting : : fear : (rage; attack; elation; flight). 
9. Play responses : fighting : : responses to organic needs : (locomotion ; 
vocalization ; self-assertion; sleep). 
to. Removal of support : fear :: restraint : (disgust; anger; joy; 
sorrow). 
Part III consisted of 25 completion statements which included 
a total of 85 blanks, the students being instructed to fill in the 
blanks with the correct word or words. Three of the completion 
statements were:

9. muscle-sense g. sleep 3a. pain 
Io. cannot be avoided Io. anger 3b. failure 
2. SCORING 
Correctly marked copies were prepared by the instructors and 
used as keys in scoring the papers. One point credit was given 
for each acceptable answer. The analogies were weighted by 
multiplying by two, giving in all a total possible score of 192. 
The scheme in table form is as follows:

3. DISTRIBUTING THE TOTAL SCORES OR MARKS 
As soon as total scores had been secured for each student’s 
examination paper, they were plotted on a large sheet of co- 
ordinate paper. A scale was drawn on this sheet, allowing one 
coérdinate distance for each point score in the examination, a 
small cross mark to indicate the score of any student being made 
above the appropriate point on the scale. Such a lengthy scale 
is used in order to facilitate the drawing of dividing lines between 
the A’s and B’s, etc. The accompanying graph shows the dis- 
Frequency Distribution of Total Scores in Objective Final Examination 
in Elementary Psychology 1f, IT Hour Section, 1924 
Re Ay 
  Final Examination Total ‘Point Scale 
tribution of the scores made by the 226 students in this section. 
This graph differs from the original distribution sheet with 
respect to the scale intervals, there being a five-point range of 
scores on the base or scale line instead of one-point score intervals, 
and the number of students scoring at any particular point being 
represented by the height of the column instead of by a number of 
crosses one above the other, each representing the score of one 
student. 
Attention is invited to the fact that these examination scores 
approximate the “normal probability curve,” the great mass of 
scores piling up in the middle ranges of the scale, whereas scores 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  New-Type Examining Technique in Psychology 71 
deviating in either direction from the middle become less and less 
frequent. The average score is 104.0 points, with approximately 
68 per cent of the scores falling between 83 and 125. 
4. KEY FOR CONVERTING SCORES INTO LETTER GRADES 
The next step in the treatment of the scores involved the 
determination of the score limits to be used in transmuting the 
crude scores to letter grades. These limiting points were deter- 
mined by the instructors in charge of the course, in part by 
inspection of the nature of the distribution of scores and in part 
by determination of various score limits, including certain per- 
centages of the students. This done, lines were drawn on the 
original distribution sheet separating the A’s from the B’s, the 
B’s from the C’s, etc. Then the following key for converting 
crude scores into letter grades was prepared :

It will be noted that the proportion of A’s and F’s practically 
equals the proportion of B’s and D’s, and that these percentages 
are slightly larger than those contemplated as final course grades. 
This is done for the purpose of counteracting in part the inevi- 
table restriction of range of average grades when the several 
grades for each student are averaged in determining the final 
letter grades for the course as a whole. 
1In actual practice the department usually further subdivides the C group into 
C+, C, and C—, a small percentage of the papers being given a C+ grade or a 
C— grade. These qualified C grades are helpful in averaging a number of grades 
when a student’s average grade is on the borderline between a B and a C or between 
aCandaD. 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  72 Appendix A 
5. DETERMINATION OF COURSE MARK i. 
Each instructor proceeds to post in his grade book the actual 
scores and the corresponding letter grades on the final examina- 
tion. He then averages the grades for the ten weekly written 
quizzes (each ten minutes in length) given during the quarter, 
by giving numerical values of 4, 3, 2, 1, or o to the grades of 
A,B,C,D, or F, respectively, and then averaging these numerical 
values. The letter grades in the mid-quarter and the final 
examinations are given numerical values in the same way. The 
average grade on the weekly quizzes, the grade on the mid-quarter 
examination, and the grade on the final examination are then 
pooled to form the final grade in the course. Departmental 
custom decrees that the weekly quizzes shall be given a weight of 
three sixths, the mid-quarter examination a weight of one sixth, 
and the final examination a weight of two sixths; hence it is 
necessary to multiply the weekly quiz average by 3, the mid- 
quarter examination by 1, and the final examination by 2, and 
then to divide the sum of these three grades so weighted by 6. 
The distribution of grades in each of these three components of 
the final course mark, together with the distribution of the final 
course marks themselves, is as follows:

1 The three-hour course in elementary psychology is conducted as follows: Two 
lectures a week are given to-all 226 students in one group; the 226 students then 
meet for a third hour in small sections for quiz, review, and discussion of the lectures 
and assignments. At the beginning of each quiz hour a ten-minute written quiz 
is given to each section. The mid-quarter and final examinations are given to all 
226 students in one group, being uniform for all.

6. RELATION OF VARIOUS COMPONENTS TO EACH OTHER 
AND TO FINAL COURSE MARK 
The fact that the distributions given in Section 5 are similar is 
no guarantee that the grades given to the individual students in 
any one component will be closely related to those given the same 
individuals in the other components. Hence it is desirable to 
know the extent of the relationship existing between these various 
examinations for estimating each individual’s performance in the 
course. These relationships are revealed in the following 
“scatter tables” :

The above relationship is remarkable in spite of the fact that 
it must be discounted slightly because two sixths of the course 
mark itself is determined by the final examination grade. It is 
especially significant to find 68.1 per cent of the cases in perfect 
agreement, with not a single disagreement of three or four steps. 
1 Perfect agreement indicates identity between the mark in the examination and 
the mark in the course.

Here again the correlation is remarkably close, even though

Once again a close relationship is demonstrated, although 
greater discount needs to be made because three sixths or one

It must be remembered that we are comparing here the status 
of the students in each of two objective examinations covering 
for the most part different subject matter and separated by a time 
interval of seven or eight weeks. This would seem to mean that 
both examinations are measuring consistently a capacity to learn
-P-A-G-E-82
  76 Appendix A 
. the content and profit from the instruction in elementary psy- 
chology and, further, that this capacity is a characteristic mani- 
fested by these students in approximately equal relative amounts 
at both the middle and the end of the quarter. According to 
accepted standards, current in the field of diagnostic testing of 
human traits, this is evidence of the high reliability of this 
method of examination.

The above relationship is the lowest of those reported in this 
Appendix, although even here we find agreement within one 
step in the case of 84.5 per cent of the students. This lower 
relationship would be interpreted by some as due to the fact that 
weekly quizzes are measuring a different phase or aspect of the 
student’s capacity in psychology from that which the final 
examination measures; hence they would conclude that it is 
wise to have the course mark reflect both kinds of achievement as 
representative of what the student can do in the course as a whole.
-P-A-G-E-83
  New-Type Examining Technique in Psychology 77 
There are reasons, however, for believing that such an interpreta- 
tion errs in the direction of overvaluing the reliability and sig- 
nificance of the average weekly quiz grade. 
The following reasons make us hesitate to place such reliance 
on the weekly essay-type quizzes. In the first place, the 226 
students were divided among eight quiz sections, their weekly 
quizzes being read by three graduate assistants whose grading 
cannot be considered to be infallible, and whose standards of 
grading must inevitably vary among themselves and are likely 
to vary from week to week. In the second place, the questions 
constituting the weekly quizzes were not uniform for all sections 
in any given week, such lack of uniformity involving undesirable 
but uncontrollable variations in the difficulty of the questions. 
In the third place, only one or two general questions of the essay 
type could be used each week for any given section; hence the 
questions inadequately sample the content covered in the two 
preceding lectures and the forty to sixty page assignments. 
These constant and variable errors are supplemented by others 
of less importance not mentioned. All together, one would be 
safe in concluding that the average of even ten weekly quizzes 
must fall short of the standards of good examining technique. 
For these reasons the writer would be inclined to place much 
more emphasis on the objective mid-quarter and final examina- 
tions and would even go so far as to eliminate the weekly quiz 
grades from the course mark, were it not for the incentive to con- 
sistent weekly application that is afforded by the weekly quizzes 
and the knowledge that they are to count one half toward the 
course mark. Realization of the errors involved in the present 
weekly essay-type quizzes and at the same time realization of the 
importance of these quizzes as an incentive to consistent applica- 
tion has led the staff to begin the accumulationof short-answer 
questions for use in weekly quizzing. These are being tried out 
in four sections of the course this year, access to a “Ditto” 
duplicating machine making possible the plan of using a one- or 
two-page new-type examination of from 30 to 40 questions to be 
answered in ten minutes.

7. SUMMARY OF APPENDIX A 
It is hoped that the preceding sections may serve as illustrative 
material descriptive of the various steps in the scoring of the 
objective examinations, graphing the examination scores, con- 
version of the crude scores into letter grades, determining the 
final course mark, and analyzing statistically the relation between 
the marks derived from the various components of the course 
mark. It is the hope of the writer that other instructors may 
be sufficiently interested in this technique to analyze their own 
course marks in a similar manner. He feels certain, from a 
knowledge of like analyses in courses using traditional examina- 
tions, that few courses will be found where the various components 
will show such close relationships with final course marks or with 
each other. In other words, he predicts that teachers adopting 
this analytical method will find many more inconsistencies and 
will be led, naturally, to take a more questioning attitude toward 
their grading problems and to experiment with more uniform and 
objective methods of measuring achievement.

PREFACE 
Tuts study of the elementary school consists of two 
parts; the first is concerned with the broad general 
problems dependent upon its organic structure, the 
second with specific phases of its work as planned and 
directed by the principal of a school or the teacher of 
a class. Although these two parts might imply each 
its own audience, I venture the hope that the general 
discussion in Part One may not only give the general 
student and the lay reader food for reflection, but that 
it may also meet responsive interest in the thought of 
earnest practical teachers. 
For the past few years our teachers have been the 
subject of rather microscopic study; their shortcom- 
ings have been duly analyzed and their responsibili- 
ties extensively chronicled. While they have been 
diligently tilling the educational soil, the educational 
geologists have looked on with voluminous criticism 
of their methods and manners, and latterly show a 
tendency to charge the teachers with responsibility 
for the very faults and fissures which inhere in the ed- 
ucational substratum. It seems but just that the

teachers should seek to deflect this charge, and the 
first three chapters of this book may, in one sense, be 
construed as a brief in their behalf. 
It is clearly impossible for an essayist to make form- 
al acknowledgment of all the sources of his inspira- 
tion. The student of education keeps his mind open 
to the influence of every honest word whether spoken 
by the thinkers of old or by the seers of to-day, and he 
keeps his heart open to the influence of the living 
child, to whom all educational systems owe their ex- 
istence. And who shall say which speaks the more 
effectively, Plato and Emerson and Mark Hopkins, or 
the tow-headed boy in the fourth seat in the third row 
and the patient teacher who is leading him, helpfully 
and hopefully, according to her lights? 
So I make no attempt to catalogue in full my indebt- 
edness to the many writers and preceptors who have 
touched me. I must, however, record with pleasure 
my obligation to Mr. E. W. Fielder for his counsel, es- 
pecially regarding the statistical work at page 12, and 
to Professor Henry W. Holmes, of Harvard University, 
and Superintendent C. N. Kendall, of Indianapolis, 
for constructive criticism. Finally, it would be an 
inexcusable breach of duty were I to pass over in 
silence the names of Miss Mary A. Mason, now prin- 
cipal of Public School Number 79, Brooklyn, and 
Miss Alice H. Story and Mrs. Jessie N. Mainwaring,

heads of department in Public School Number 85, 
who have in turn so ably carried to successful fruition 
the work described in the last chapter. It would be 
presumptuous for me to offer them any word of com- 
mendation; the memory of their service to scores of 
girls will ever speak to them with a glowing eloquence.

THE ORGANIC STRUCTURE 
CrviizEp societies have developed many argu- 
ments in favor of the proposition of state support 
of education. Although some of these flow from 
philosophic and altruistic premises, it is evident 
that by far the most potent of all arguments is the 
practical, egoistic one of self-protection and self-pres- 
ervation. In this the social group is but the analogue 
of the human individual, for although man has 
become so civilized a creature that under normal 
conditions his primal impulses are successfully sub- 
merged under the refinements of modern ideals, never- 
theless his basic instincts persist and it takes but a 
little disturbance of normal condition to bring them to 
the surface. 
The most fundamental instinct, the very life- 
spring of the actions of primitive man, is that of self- 
preservation. The modern man, in polite society, has 
inlaid and overlaid this elementary function with a 
mosaic of modern conventions, so that very many of 
3

  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
his acts bear the stamp of genuine altruism. But let 
there be a disastrous fire on shipboard or in a crowded 
building, and rapidly indeed do the modern conven- 
tions fall away before the ancient impulses. Excep- 
tionally fortunate is the record of such a disaster that 
does not show scores of men reduced to blind followers 
of the primal forces. Thus, however much altruism 
may function in the daily routine of the individual, 
we cannot ignore the fact that self-preservation and 
its correlated instincts remain the most potent regu- 
lators of the conduct both of men and of nations. 
Society recognizes, in general, two distinct require- 
ments as to the education of its members which are 
necessary to its own proper development, namely, sat- 
isfactory, universal, mass intelligence, and a contin- 
uous and sufficient supply of exceptional ability. The 
first of these conditions the existence of the state; 
the second, its progress. The intelligence of all its 
members must be kept at so high an average as shall 
prevent deterioration; the intelligence of a few of 
its members must so far reach above the average as 
to insure progressive leadership. In consequence 
there are to be seen everywhere two phases in the 
provision of public education, the compulsory phase 1, 
and the opportunity phase. These in turn impose 
the duty of education on the one side and extend the 
privilege of education on the other. 
4
-P-A-G-E-13
  THE ORGANIC STRUCTURE 
To all its members of worth and promise, the state 
extends the invitation to avail themselves of the op- 
portunity to pursue the educational privilege to the 
utmost. America stands foremost among the nations 
in the richness and fullness of this invitation, in its 
lavish provision of educational institutions of the 
highest type. To every young man of ability and de- 
termination, however humble his birth, however ob- 
scure his ancestral line, however limited his financial 
resources, there is issued this invitation to a liberal ed- 
ucation. The state cheerfully contributes to the sup- 
port of that education out of all proportion to the im- 
mediate return which it is possible for the youth to 
make—all with the hope as to each particular youth, 
that he may prove in his maturity to be the one who 
shall render back to the state in intelligent leadership 
such service as shall justify the outlay expended upon 
a hundred of his contemporaries. 
This leadership is no more necessary to progress, 
however, than is an intelligent constituency necessary 
to that stability which is the prerequisite of progress. 
Unerring leading could not construct a successful mod- 
ern state out of an inert and stupid following. For 
one leader there are hundreds who are led. Whether 
or not these hundreds appreciate or desire education, 
the state of to-day gives them no option. Our very 
stability, our very safety, it says to them, require that

PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
you shall not remain unintelligent; although we offer 
you the opportunity to educate yourselves liberally, we 
cannot compel you to do so, but we can and will compel 
you to rise aboveignorance and illiteracy. Compulsory 
education dates back to 1717 in Germany, to 1833 in 
France, to 1842 in Sweden, and to-day is in effect in 
some form in nearly every Europeanstate. In America, 
limited but definite efforts in this direction are record- 
ed even in colonial times; and to-day a majority of our 
American states recognize in their statutes this phase 
of educational effort. 
In general, the compulsory education laws apply 
only to children between the ages of eight and four- 
teen, although a few states extend this a year or two 
in either direction. This means that the compulsory 
phase of school provision concerns itself chiefly with 
what we have come to call a “common-school’’ edu- 
cation, or that grade of our school system which we 
term elementary, whereas the opportunity phase ex- 
tends downward to the kindergarten and upward to 
the secondary school, the college, and the university. 
Hence we see that the elementary school is unique in 
that it is the only grade of school in which both the 
compulsory and opportunity purposes are operative. 
“The chief problem of the elementary school in 
America, as abroad, is concerned with the organic struc- 
ture of the school, and it is intimately connected with 
6 
 
-P-A-G-E-15
  THE ORGANIC STRUCTURE 
the primary distinction between the two phases above 
emphasized. It is true that both phases are officially 
recognized in scattering records from the Massachu- 
setts Colony ! down to date, and yet many a current 
discussion of the needs of the elementary school is be- 
fogged by lack of appreciation of this fundamental 
distinction in the purposes of the state as related to 
its schools. 
The problem as it exists in America is the converse 
of that in Germany and in France. A few words in 
reference to the school organizations of all three coun- 
tries will help to make this clear. In America, the ele- 
mentary school, with its course of seven, eight, or 
nine years, enrolls children from all walks of life, those 
with every advantage of good breeding and good for- 
tune, and those with the handicap of parental igno- 
rance and incompetency; those of physical robustness 
and those of physical weakness; those of innate alert- 
ness and those with inherited mental inertia; those 
destined to trade or the trades and those scheduled 
for a liberal education and the learned professions; in 
short, every possible type of child in the land. And 
this because, in the words of our distinguished mon- 
itor and adviser, Dr. Eliot, ‘We are trying to prepare

all American boys and girls for a life of unprece- 
dented freedom—freedom of thought and speech; 
freedom to travel, to change the place of abode, and 
to change the occupation; freedom to enter into any 
sort of public or secret association or union; freedom 
from everything resembling castes or insurmountable 
social or political barriers.” ! 
To the American turning his thought to the Ger- 
man schools, the characteristic which first arrests his 
attention is the definition of “higher schools” which 
there denote, not a higher grade of school in the Amer- 
ican sense, but schools of whatever extent of grade, 
which lead to higher grade work. The lower school is 
the popular Volksschule with its course normally of 
eight years; the higher schools are all those which, 
beginning at the fifth school year or even lower, carry 
pupils forward parallel to those of the Volksschule but 
through a different curriculum, and beyond into work 
of collegiate grade. Somewhat similarly in France, 
“the division between primary and secondary schools 
is purely a longitudinal one. ... The secondary 
school which begins normally at nine years and con- 
tinues for nine years has always a preparatory section, 
so that the child may really enter at six or seven years

of age and follow work which is of exactly the same 
nature as that given in the primary school... . 
The primary school in France is in no sense a prepara- 
tion for the secondary school.” ! 
The problem abroad is recognized, as in Germany, 
where “many cf the leaders of the pedagogic world 
are crying out for the Hinheitsschule—one school for 
all—and in some bright spots the system is actually 
at work. As the barriers of social life in modern Ger- 
many are broken down—as doubtless they will be— 
so will disappear the barriers between the various 
types of German schools.’”’? Part of the criticism of 
the German schools is that “it is as difficult for a lad 
to pass from one school to another as in German social 
life it is to rise from one class of society to another,” 
although it is admitted that “this statement may 
seem too general.” The assumption seems to be 
made by the German reformers that the establishment 
of the Einheitsschule is their salvation. 
The American problem is the converse of this. We 
have the Einheitsschule and are beginning to awaken 
to a realization of its inadequacy and imperfections.

  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
We may state the criticism of our present system, per- 
haps not too strongly, as follows. Into the same school, 
into the same classroom, we thrust those pupils to 
whom we wish to extend the opportunity of seeking 
a liberal education and also those others, in the sub- 
stantial majority, upon whom we are placing the duty 
of securing that minimum of instruction consistent 
with proper usefulness in a republic. We place these 
two groups of pupils, with such divergent interests, 
into the same classroom, under the guidance of the 
same teacher, and put them through the same cur- 
riculum, and then wonder at the confessed failure of 
the public school to prepare great numbers of its 
pupils for life. 
The influence of the college has been exerted upon 
the secondary schools to the end that they may proper- 
ly and adequately prepare their pupils for college en- 
trance. The secondary schools have extended that 
influence and pressure down upon the elementary 
schools demanding that they shall make adequate 
preparation for the high school. The elementary 
school has consequently turned itself into a prepara- 
tory school for high schools. In recent years we note 
a tendency upon the part of some of those responsible 
for elementary school organization and direction to 
assert their independence and to consider their charge 
upward from the child and not downward from the 
10

college. Immediately we turn our faces in this direc- 
tion we discover that the pupils of our elementary 
schools are not preparing for college, have no thought 
or desire so to prepare, and in most cases lack the in- 
nate ability so to prepare. This, with the exception 
of a small group of pupils; how small that group is we 
scarcely realize until we consult the statistics and there 
find that ninety per cent of our pupils never go be- 
yond the elementary school grade.! Only ten per cent 
are scheduled for the secondary school and but one 
tenth of these for the college. 
Yet the casual observer of our schools might be 
warranted in supposing that we were all quite blind 
to this statistical fact, for here we are, pushing ninety 
per cent and ten per cent alike through the identical 
curriculum. And why? Because of our peculiar concept 
of democracy ; because of our strange belief, as a people, 
in the efficacy of law and education to equalize the un- 
equal; because of our mistaken loyalty to our demo- 
cratic ideals which makes it almost a crime to suggest 
that natural caste can and must exist even in a repub- 
lic. Year after year we see pupils whose earthly des- 
tiny is to walk humbly in the nonscholastic paths of 
lifef compelled to spend an allotted period inside of

We have mistaken our duty to these thousands; we

Education,” Houghton, Mifflin, 1909, p. 129.

of the Commissioner of Education, Washington, 1908, p. 22, is 
as follows

‘These percentages show the proportion of pupils found in the’

the proportion of pupils who go forward from one grade to an-

have argued that because democracy has formulated 
the ambitious programme to try “to, prepare all Amer- 
ican boys and girls for a life of unprecedented free- 
dom, etc.,”’ it is disloyalty to see the self-evident, to 
  
equivalent to the statement that ninety-four per cent of the ele- 
mentary school pupils do not go beyond them. 
To calculate the percentage of pupils who go beyond the ele- 
mentary school, it is necessary to ascertain, first, the total num- 
ber of pupils entering school in a given year, and second, the num- 
ber of those pupils who, some years later, enter secondary schools. 
In the absence of these exact figures, it will be approximately 
correct to substitute for the first, the number of all pupils in the 
United States found, in any given year, in the first-year grade 
of the elementary school, and for the second, the number of all 
pupils in the United States found, eight years later, in the first 
year of the secondary school. Even these figures seem unob- 
tainable at the present time; hence, a further approximation must 
be made. 
The following deduction is submitted, based upon statistics 
from the reports of the United States Commissioner of Education. 
The most recent figures for high school enrollment are for the 
year 1907-8 (Report, 1908, p. 859), when there were 770,456 
pupils enrolled in the public high schools. 
In 1906-7 there were in 7,624 of these high schools, enrolling 
667,305 pupils, 288,748 pupils in the first year, or 43.27 per cent 
(p. 862). Assuming the proportion to hold for the following 
year for all schools, there were 333,386 pupils in the first year 
of the high school. These pupils presumably entered the ele- 
mentary school, on an average, eight years prior to 1907-8, or 
in the year 1899-1900. 
The total enrollment for the year 1899-1900 in our public ele- 
mentary schools was 14,821,969 (Report, 1903, p. xix). Figures 
13  
-P-A-G-E-22
  
PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
admit that, as a matter of frigid fact, the average 
American boy or girl simply cannot have a life of un- 
precedented freedom. We establish our premise: any 
boy or girl qualified to secure and appreciate a liberal 
  
as to the distribution of these pupils among the various grades 
are not at hand, but for the year 1902 they are given (Report, 
1903, p. xvi) as:

PROUGI ar cclsde Aiipeteivisiey itso Wb whats 15,375,276 
This shows 33.5 per cent of the pupils in the first-year grade. 
Assuming that this percentage held for the year 1899-1900, there 
were in that year 4,965,360 pupils in the first-year grade. 
Roughly speaking, then, the 350,000 pupils now entering our 
American high schools represent a survival of seven per cent of 
the 5,000,000 pupils who entered school eight years ago. 
It is quite probable that the figure 5,000,000 somewhat over- 
estimates the admissions to the elementary schools for one year. 
I have chosen, therefore, to make a most conservative estimate, 
and to assume that 3,500,000 more closely states the fact. This 
would amply justify the statement used in the text that ninety 
per cent of our pupils do not go beyond the elementary school. 
For all the purposes of the argument of these three chapters, this 
statement is sufficiently accurate; indeed, it might be widely 
aberrant without invalidating that argument.

THE ORGANIC STRUCTURE 
education should be offered every opportunity to pre- 
pare for that education. Only in very fine print, as a 
footnote, do we observe that only one boy or girl in 
every ten is so qualified. Then we debonairly jump 
to our conclusion: therefore, every boy or girl should 
be made to prepare for that education. Again, only in 
fine print do we note that nine of the ten leave us with 
only this “preparation” for something which they can- 
not have, and which nearly everyone knew all the 
while that they could not have; and what is more un- 
fortunate, they leave us without having made proper 
preparation for that which is their inevitable work in 
life. 
It is surely time that we should cease to deceive 
ourselves or attempt to deceive others with the theory 
that because we call our nation a democracy, a repub- 
lic, a United States, there results a transformation in 
the intrinsic quality of the children of the nation—a 
transformation claimed for the children of no other 
country the world over. It is indeed a false concep- 
tion of democracy, and a mistaken notion of loyalty, 
which proceeds on the theory that this—a mere form 
of government—can in itself affect the fundamental 
distinctions that exist in human individuals, how- 
ever much it may be credited with having amelio- 
rated the conditions of existence for the average 
man, 
15

  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
The continental problem is to reform the caste 
school and approach the Einheitsschule; the American 
problem is to reform our wantonly simple Einheits- 
schule so that natural distinctions shall be rationally 
recognized. The continent cannot solve her problem 
by taking over the American universal school; Amer- 
ica cannot solve her problem by transplanting to her 
soil the German school, or the French, or the Swed- 
ish, or any other. Each nation must work out its own 
salvation with due deference to the national tradi- 
tions and the national institutions, and yet each na- 
tion must cast aside provincialism and complacency 
and accept from its fellow nations whatever may be 
received with profit. 
We may certainly benefit from the continental ex- 
perience. In Germany, the man whose social and 
financial position is such as to guarantee his inability 
to give his son a liberal education sends him to the 
people’s school, where he is frankly accepted as he ac- 
cepts himself, as one in need of such training as shall 
best prepare him during his few school years for the 
work of his life as it is bound to be, and not for the 
work of some other boy’s life as it may be. His daily 
work in the classroom is not interrupted by the pres- 
ence of boys scheduled for a university career. Such 
boys are early diverted into schools which specialize 
for them, and their progress is not impeded by the 
16 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
THE ORGANIC STRUCTURE 
pace set by pupils uninterested in acquiring an edu- 
cation for which they can have no reasonable use. 
It is true that we must recognize that in America 
social orders are much more fluent than abroad, that 
the cobbler’s son of to-day may to-morrow be the 
mayor—alike for shoemaker and scion. But the fact is 
that the criticism of the continental arrangement rests 
not nearly so much in the presence of separate schools 
for separate needs of the people as in the charge of a 
tuition fee in the higher schools, while the people’s 
schools remain free. It is really this fee which accen- 
tuates caste abroad, and not the school organization. 
We have already put our public schools of all grades 
on a no-tuition basis, so that we are in little danger 
of ever falling into this form of caste-encouraging 
blunder. 
Even under our present organization we have come 
to recognize the need of differentiation in high-school 
work, but in providing distinctive courses we certain- 
ly have sacrificed none of our democratic freedom nor 
have we in any measure encouraged caste. Ask this 
boy which high school he attends or which course he 
is pursuing and he tells you the classical school or 
course; ask the boy next door the same question and 
he replies no less proudly—surely with no thought of 
self-depreciation—that he is taking the commercial 
course. Wherein has caste been established? It 
17

  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
would be a very different matter if, following con- 
tinental custom, we offered one of the courses free to 
all and charged a fifty-dollar fee to the other groups 
of students. Then might the one student look down 
with assumed superiority upon the other; but it is 
just at this point that our sane American democracy 
intervenes to save us from any such anticlimax. In 
our attitude toward our high-school students we have 
learned to estimate with equal dignity and apprecia- 
tion all honest workers, in whatever department they 
are found. It remains for us to carry this same spirit 
into our treatment of the elementary school problem. 
Our problem, then, is so to reorganize our American 
schools that the child who is scheduled for six or eight 
years of schooling and then an immediate entrance 
into vocational life shall be given an education that 
shall be his, and not the education that belongs to 
the child who has before him a university career and 
the preparation therefor. The resultant organization 
must give to each of these two great groups, and to all 
of those intermediate to these, that education which 
fits its special needs. It must provide for the great 
ninety per cent for whom education is a duty, and 
also for the important ten per cent for whom it is a 
privilege; and must so provide by intelligent differen- 
tiation and not, as now, by the offering of a universal 
hodgepodge. Moreover, it must be so flexible as to

permit the exceptional child to transfer from one of 
these groups of pupils to another upon occasion; this 
is of prime importance, for we must not subject our- 
selves to the criticism now fairly leveled against the 
continental systems in this respect. 
No doubt exception will be taken in many quarters 
to the use of the word scheduled, but it has been em- 
ployed advisedly in the preceding paragraph. Many 
of our American educational thinkers shrink from 
using such a word as this on the ground that no 
American child is to be considered as scheduled for 
any career until he schedules himself. We are not 
justified, they say, in assuming in advance that his 
educational programme is in any way limited. Now 
the present criticism is that the contrary assumption is 
an unwarranted one because it is an ideal one, and 
that our present school organization is built upon this 
imaginary ideal instead of upon a known state of 
affairs. We are forced to admit that the actual con- 
dition is this: that only a tenth of our children take 
advantage of the opportunity phase of the state’s 
educational purpose, while the entire after life of the 
remaining nine tenths is built upon the schooling of 
the elementary grades only. 
It is of course conceivable that a supersocialistic 
government might take over the entire nurture and 
education of all the children of its people, leaving 
19
-P-A-G-E-28
  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
little or nothing of responsibility to the individual 
parents. In that case each child might be so suc- 
cessfully evaluated as to result in his receiving the 
education which exactly fitted his innate ability; and 
we can imagine further that under this form of pa- 
ternalistic government, ninety instead of ten per cent 
would be given a secondary schooling. But why 
speculate upon an all-providing government which 
has, and can have, no actual existence? And why 
maintain a school organization founded upon some 
such speculation? 
The fact is that every child, short of those subject 
to charity, is dependent upon the material prosperity 
of his parents for the measure of his scale of living. 
His clothing is costly, his fare is elaborate, his housing 
is luxurious, all in proportion to the ambition and 
ability of his parents to provide these for him—and 
it is the same with his education. There comes a 
time in his life, of course, when he is thrown more, if 
not entirely, upon himself, when either through his 
own industry he manages to provide more lavishly 
for himself, or else through his own inertness he loses 
some of what he has been enjoying at his father’s 
expense. 
The average father estimates himself pretty ac- 
curately. The moderate wage-earner to-day, what- 
ever his hopes, knows that, for all practical purposes, 
20 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
  THE ORGANIC STRUCTURE 
he must assume that eight years from now he will 
still be a moderate wage-earner. He knows that if 
his six-year-old boy were to-day fourteen, it would be 
out of all question for him to support him longer as 
an unproductive member of his family; and he knows 
that the chances are many to one that the same will 
be true when his child has actually reached the age 
of fourteen. He clearly recognizes this fact and we 
have no right to ignore it. Moreover, we may recog- 
nize it without yielding one point in our devotion to 
the true ideals of our American democracy. We may 
recognize it without assuming that the boy must 
necessarily follow his father’s trade; we may recognize 
it without charging the father with neglect of duty 
or even implying the charge; we may recognize it 
without relegating the boy or his family to the posi- 
tion of a subordinate caste; above all, we may recog- 
nize it without injury to the occasional boy who 
decides for himself that he will, through his own 
efforts, pursue education beyond the point marked 
by his father’s interest or ability to provide. 
We have too long accepted Huxley’s figurative de- 
scription of our school organization as “a great edu- 
cational ladder with one end in the gutter and the 
other in the university.”” When we recover from the 
anesthesia induced by the implied compliment and 
begin to study the picture, the fact is revealed that 
21

PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
our children are climbing this ladder with some rather 
disastrous results. We see the ladder with one end 
planted in the “gutter,” if you will have it so, and 
the other end leaning against the university portal. 
Below the university floor in the house of life, however, 
are several others, the high-school graduates’ floor, the 
grammar-school graduates’ floor, the elementary vo- 
cational floor; and as we come down through the build- 
ing we notice that the crowd increases wonderfully 
until you find some four fifths of all the inhabitants 
occupying the first floor. But the curious thing is 
that as you come down, the ladder stands farther 
away from the building. Shall we picture it a little 
more clearly? (See diagram p. 23.) 
The disaster is shown in the thousands of children 
who are jumping or tumbling from the educational 
ladder to the first floor, landing approximately upon 
their feet rather by virtue of the natural toughness 
and agility of the human youth than by any foresight 
of our school administration. 
We notice two saving features in this diagram in 
the form of two supplementary ladders. Our typical 
secondary schools offer to their students a variety of 
courses so that they may prepare either for college or 
for the business life which lies before them at the end 
of their high-school career. They may choose the ap- 
propriate ladder before mounting, and on it climb to

their natural goal. It is true that there are a few stu- 
dents who, going through high school with the ex- 
pectation of passing on to college, find that the college 
course, for some personal reason, is closed to them. 
These must jump to thenearest life platform, but 
there are considerably fewer making the jump, and 
the jump is not so long a one as in the great disaster

The other cross ladder is a private one, but one em- 
ployed by thousands of boys and girls who have been 
marooned on the big ladder, who dislike the flying 
leap to the first floor, and whose parents, having al- 
ready paid a school tax for something they did not 
want, yet have enough left over to buy that which 
they do want. This ladder is the private commercial 
school, thriving throughout the land,! which takes the 
graduates of our public elementary schools and pro- 
ceeds in a few months to teach them to write a busi- 
ness letter and to add a column of figures. 
Now both of these short ladders have proven to be 
safe and serviceable and are already in a position. of 
stable equilibrium. Why shall we be so timid about 
running out one or two more? Why not run one di-

rectly from the gutter to the first floor and another 
from the gutter to the second floor? For fear—and 
this seems to be the only substantial argument heard 
against it—that. there may be a few soaring souls 
who, finding themselves well up one of these lad- 
ders, discover that they ought to be on the uni- 
versity ladder. They may easily be accommodated 
by giving them a public return ladder, or they might 
be left to patronize private ladders as we now leave 
so many to do who are traveling in the opposite 
direction. Compare this proposed arrangement with 
the present. (See diagram p. 25.) 
We have eliminated the great disaster, and at the 
worst, we have substituted for the private ladder, 
carrying thousands, another private ladder—though 
we might well make it a public one—carrying scores. 
Is this to be construed as an unwarranted assault upon 
the bulwarks of democracy? 
It may be that experiment would prove that it is 
not necessary to start the supplementary ladder from 
the gutter in order to secure the best results at a min- 
imum of stress in reorganization. Very likely all 
groups of pupils might be kept at the same work at 
the same pace for the first two, three, or four years of 
school. As to this, however, we can make no dogmatic 
prophecy. We are bound to suspend judgment on 
this point until sufficiently extensive experimentation 
26  
-P-A-G-E-35
  THE ORGANIC STRUCTURE 
provides us with adequate data upon which to gener- 
alize. 
The National Education Association, at its 1909 
convention, unanimously adopted a “ Declaration of 
Principles and Aims’ which throughout breathes a 
noble spirit of democracy. “Our free schools,” it 
says, “must advance along the lines of educational 
democracy in the sense that they must provide equal 
educational opportunities to all.” However hearty 
may be our assent to this statement, it still remains 
for us to make a conscientious attempt to discover in 
what ‘equal educational opportunities” really con- 
sist. Certain it is that we are not giving such equal 
opportunities when we say to-ten per cent of our chil- 
dren “The education you desire is freely yours,” and 
to the ninety per cent “ You, too, are welcome to as 
much of this education provided for the ten per cent 
as you care to take, but you must not expect any- 
thing meeting your distinctive needs.” Indeed, this 
bears all the marks of a purpose to establish caste, 
although we well know that such a purpose has been 
farthest from the thoughts of the organizers and ad- 
ministrators of our schools. 
This, then, is the greatest, the fundamental prob- 
lem of our elementary schools. Until it is solved the 
most important of our other problems stand in abey- 
ance. In particular, the problems of the curriculum 
au
-P-A-G-E-36
  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
and of moral training are irrevocably dependent upon 
this one. Or, to make a better statement by trans- 
posing the equation, an overwhelming difficulty is 
introduced into the solution of these two problems by 
our failure to recognize this fundamental defect in 
our school organization, and the pity of it is that this 
disturbing factor may readily be eliminated. For 
the repair of this defect is entirely a question of senti- 
ment, intention, and authority; in the working out of 
the details it would seem to present no serious tech- 
nical difficulties. 
It is a question of sentiment because educational 
leaders have not yet learned to face bravely such facts 
as this: the American child does not schedule himself; 
he is scheduled by heredity and by circumstance. It 
is a question of sentiment because as yet the call of 
the demagogue meets so large a measure of unthink- 
ing response when he talks glibly of a liberty, frater- 
nity, and equality, the truest and highest interpreta- 
tion of which is beyond his own powers of imagination. 
1t is a question of intention because once the Ameri- 
can people sense the defects in their school organiza- 
tion, they will set about to repair it. It is a question 
of authority because once they determine to perfect 
the organization, they will command their educational 
officials to do the work. 
Once given this command, this authority, based 
28

THE ORGANIC STRUCTURE 
upon the aroused sentiment of the people, our school 
administrators will have little difficulty in working 
out the details of reorganization. 
The movement of our pupils along the education- 
al rails is a matter of routes and speeds. We must 
first reform our routes so that each pupil is taking 
approximately that one which leads to his normal 
destination. In this we must reform our curric- 
ulum for both the child booked for the secondary 
route and the one booked for the elementary route. 
As to the latter, I have reserved the second chapter 
for a discussion of his needs. As to the former, only 
a hint of possible reform is here given and that by a 
single illustration. The French and the Germans 
have satisfied themselves that the time to start the 
boy on his secondary route is not at the end of his 
eighth school year but at the end of the fourth. One 
result is that the German gymnasial student, for in- 
stance, is given in his fifth school year eight periods 
a week of Latin or six periods of French. Contrast 
this with our American scheme which keeps our boy 
waiting four years before he gets his smattering of a 
foreign language. 
Next we must reform our speed laws. The strug- 
gling and sincere attempts already made to solve this 
problem of speed regulation foreshadow what might 
be done in this respect if their authors had freedom 
29  
-P-A-G-E-38
  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
of manipulation commensurate with the gravity of 
the problem. It is needless to review here any of these 
schemes; they must at best remain makeshifts until 
we strike deeper at the problem and get authority to 
use our schoolhouses, our school materials, our school 
moneys with the same degree of freedom which the 
trainmaster has in directing the movements of his 
rolling stock and equipment. 
We have long been accustomed to regard man in 
his threefold make-up, mental, moral, and physical. 
So long have we had this trinity of words incorporated 
in our daily speech that we have grown careless in 
their use and prone to overlook their vital significance. 
Only in recent decades has there been in school man- 
agement a practical recognition of the necessity for a 
balanced culture of these three attributes. Mental 
training has taken a long-distance precedence over 
moral nurture and physical development in every con- 
sideration of our public schools. To offset this, how- 
ever, there is evidenced to-day a very determined effort 
in many directions to reduce the emphasis usually 
placed upon the training of the intellect and to divert 
a proper amount of attention to physical and moral 
development. This is in part due to the recognition of 
the inevitable interdependence of the three phases, as 
we find it stated in such self-evident propositions as 
that an unsound body cannot ordinarily support a 
30
-P-A-G-E-39
  
THE ORGANIC STRUCTURE 
sound mind, that moral delinquencies may be due to 
physical deficiency, that the intellectual giant may 
yet be a moral coward, etc. 
Of these three groups of problems, that dealing with 
the physical welfare of the child seems most hopeful 
of solution. In the first place, this is the only one of 
the three groups which is in any measure—though not 
entirely—independent of the organic structure of the 
school system. The hygiene of the child who is set at 
the wrong intellectual tasks or is put to doing his work 
in the wrong way is not so very different from the hy- 
giene of the child who is undergoing a normal mental 
training. Hence, whatever reforms must yet be made 
in the direction of school hygiene and physical culture 
need not wait upon the reform in school organization. 
Moreover, there are few unsettled points along the 
line of progress in physical education. The laws of 
physical growth have been well established and clear- 
ly formulated, there is a large and powerful body of 
medical experts constituting the natural leaders in the 
movement for improvement, and there is little room 
for argument as to the proper hygienic conditions un- 
der which people should work. As fast as the state 
makes the necessary financial outlay for bettered con- 
ditions in respect to physical education and physical 
environment, those betterments can be materialized, 
for the technical difficulties are few. We have such 
31 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
encouraging signs as the organization of the American 
School Hygiene Association, in 1907, and of kindred 
influences, working for improvement in material 
school equipment. It is evident that the idea of 
formal gymnastics as a necessary means to physical 
training is increasingly accepted as a part of pedagogic 
dogma. In the language of Dr. Payne, “‘it seems fair- 
ly settled in the public mind that the school shall pro- 
vide for the child a physical training to parallel his 
mental training... . Evidently the time has already 
come when a school to be called progressive must make 
provision for some sort of physical culture.” 1 
Doubtless there is’ need for conscientious study of 
pedagogic technique on the part of teachers and direct- 
ors of physical culture, but it may be safely assumed 
that no one more fully recognizes this need than they 
themselves. It may be many years before the rights 
of the child to his physical education are fully assured 
to him, but annually our schoolhouses are improving 
in quality, our people are more and more appreciative 
of the importance of hygienic protection and physical 
training, and our communities are increasing their 
financial support of the public schools. Along this 
line we may well be optimistic in our hope for the 
future.

  THE ORGANIC STRUCTURE 
But when we turn our attention to the other two 
phases—mental and moral development—we are in- 
clined to be less sanguine. For both of these are inti- 
mately dependent upon the organic structure of the 
school system, and so long as that structure stands 
aslant we cannot hope for rectangular solution of the 
problems of mental and moral training. As to the 
latter of these we must note,.as an additional difficulty, 
that the proposition that moral training is a legitimate 
function of the public school is by no means es- 
tablished. Dr. Butler proclaims that “That democ- 
racy alone will be triumphant which has both 
intelligence and character. To develop them among 
the whole people is the task of education in a democ- 
tacy.” 1 
Other writers drive home this same thought, as for 
instance Hughes and Klemm, who say: “‘ Every school 
must have a twofold object, (1) to give technical 
knowledge and train the intellect, and (2) to ennoble 
the soul and establish character.’ 2 The pulpit preach- 
er and the lay speaker reiterate, amplify, and vivify 
this proposition day after day. We cannot say that 
they are unheard, nor that thoughtful men do not

promptly accept the thesis that character training 
should be a vital aim of the school. 
But who would venture the assertion that the aver- 
age man is very effectively impressed? It is to be 
feared that to his mind the school is, in return for 
his taxes, to teach his boy arithmetic, not integrity; 
writing, not righteousness; reading, not religion; and 
mental acumen, not moral insight. And can we 
much blame him so long as the school itself seems 
to take this view; so long as the school officer con- 
tinues to ask of the teacher, ‘Why did your class 
get only 69.3 per cent on this grammar test when 
the general average was 70.1 per cent?” and never 
thinks of asking, ‘What gain in honesty and self- 
control have you effected among your boys this 
term?” 
If we were willing to accept as the idea of moral 
training, of character building, the usual content of 
the pedagogue’s time-worn term discipline, we would 
have to admit that the school is permeated with the 
distinction between intellectual and moral culture. 
Indeed, instruction and discipline are universally 
contraposed in pedagogic thought and we even go to 
the length of “rating” a teacher in each of these 
separately. But so long as discipline in the school 
sense is merely synonymous with control—such con- 
trol as is exercised by the animal trainer over his 
34 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
  THE ORGANIC STRUCTURE 
charges—we cannot admit that true moral training 
has far advanced. 
Having distinguished between mental and moral 
training, we are immediately impressed with the ab- 
sence of any consensus of conviction as to the treat- 
ment of either phase. In this they differ from 
the physical phase: for instance, we well know that 
the pupil’s eyes must be protected—he must not 
read badly printed text-books, he must not work 
facing the windows, he must not write in incor- 
rect posture, etc.—all of this and very much more 
is axiomatic. But there is no great body of axioms 
covering the training of the intellect and the will. 
Hence, both the curriculum and moral training, the 
formule through which we seek the development of 
intellect and character, must be regarded as prob- 
lems which, so long as they remain unsolved, are 
legitimate subjects for discussion. 
In the two chapters following, the relation of these 
problems to the fundamental one of the form of school 
organization will receive foremost consideration.

THE CURRICULUM 
Durine the many decades which have elapsed since 
our public elementary schools first took form, “the 
curriculum has undergone many modifications, and 
received additions, until it has lost. all resemblance to 
its former self.” ! ‘From the testimony of men who 
were educated in the common schools prior to 1800, 
it appears that the course of instruction was limited 
to spelling, reading, writing, and the elements of 
arithmetic.” 2 This seems meager indeed when com- 
pared with our present-day elementary curriculum. 
The development of the course of study in the 
direction of the inclusion of new subjects is signifi- 
cantly presented in the comparative tables which 
appear? in Dr. Payne’s interesting and valuable 
study, “Public Elementary School Curricula,” with- 
out appreciative reference to which any discussion of 
the subject would be shamefully lacking. In these 
tables are compared the curricula of 1868, 1888, and

1904, for each of the five cities, New York, Boston, 
Chicago, St. Louis, and Louisville. Perhaps the most 
striking change revealed is in the case of St. Louis, 
where, in 1868, the course consisted of but seven 
grades. Reading, arithmetic, physical training, and 
singing appeared in all seven, and writing in all but 
the first; spelling was provided in three grades, decla- 
mation and geography each in four; while grammar and 
history for the seventh year only, completed the list. 
In 1904, in an eight-year course, reading, arithmetic, 
physiology, and singing, as before, together with 
writing and four new subjects—morals and manners, 
language, nature study, and drawing—making a total 
of nine subjects, are found in all grades. Geography 
has extended to six grades, history to two, and spell- 
ing to seven, while grammar and declamation as 
separate subjects have disappeared. 
We may note a corresponding variation among the 
courses of study of the present day throughout the dif- 
ferent cities. For instance, in addition to the ortho- 
dox subjects, Boston introduces bookkeeping; Chicago, 
German and Latin; Kansas City, civil government; 
San Francisco, cooking; New York, civics, algebra, 
English history, and options in foreign languages. 
The changes in the content of the curriculum, 
variant both as to time and locality, have not been 
brought about except after strenuous conflict between 
37
-P-A-G-E-46
PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
conservative and radical forces. Circumagitating 
this conflict, which has by no means ended, there has 
developed a technical terminology to which passing 
reference must be made. 
The utilitarian aim in public education has so strong 
& grip upon popular opinion and sentiment as to have 
incorporated into our daily speech the expression “the 
three R’s,” used to represent the alliterative staples 
of the old curriculum, reading, writing, and arith- 
metic. In more refined circles this is replaced by the 
term, ‘the essentials,” which at once has the advan- 
tage of saying less and meaning more, and so is grate- 
fully received into the polite society of pedagogic 
parlance. The essentials have been alternately lauded 
and anathematized, yet the fact remains “that to-day, 
even after all our talk about the new education, the 
_ three R’s are in the ascendency.” ! 
Another way of indicating the contention between 
conservatism and radicalism is to distinguish between 
the “form” and the “content” studies. Included in 
the former are those of the old discipline, such as 
arithmetic, spelling, and writing; and in the latter, 
those of more recent introduction, such as geography, 
literature, and history. Although the reformers have 
been persistently attacking the preponderance of the

formal studies in the curriculum, the programmes for 
ten typical cities! show “that the formal studies re- 
ceive sixty-two per cent of the assigned time, while 
the numerous studies known as the content studies 
receive but little more than thirty per cent.” ? 
Yet another style of referring to the demands of 
the reformer is to refer to him as pleading for “en: 
richment.” New York stands preéminent among the 
cities for the high degree 3 of enrichment of its course

of study, and the question arises, in the words of Dr. 
Payne, “Will the New York curriculum in its ex- 
treme movement toward what are known as the 
content studies be followed by these superintendents 
[of other large cities], or will New York under force of 
popular conservative opinion be forced to retreat from 
its present curriculum?” 1 
Let us glance at both sides of the question. We 
may look upon the enrichment of the curriculum as 
the result of a philanthropic desire to set before the 
elementary-school pupil a more varied diet than he 
otherwise would enjoy. Not only shall he be fed the 
meat and potatoes of the essentials, but these must be 
supplemented with entrées and desserts in the form 
of content studies, so that when he arises from his 
educational repast he shall have no epicurean desire 
unsatisfied. Now the chief danger from such a diet 
is that the subject may, through the continued gusta- 
tory appeals, partake too freely. Moreover, in his 
eagerness to get all that is put before him, or what is 
more likely, in the zeal of his servitors to have him not 
miss anything on the table, he is quite likely to bolt 
his food and in consequence suffer severely from in- 
digestion. A too highly enriched curriculum meets 
its chief objection in the danger that a chronic mental 
dyspepsia will seize the child.

State it less figuratively and a little more con- 
cretely. I put my son into the care of the pedagogue. 
He tells me that the boy must learn to read, to write, 
and to cipher, to which I cordially assent, and he pro- 
ceeds to instruct him in these important articles of 
faith. But presently, of a summer’s evening, as I sit 
out in the open under the starlit dome, with my nine- 
year-old on my knee, I find myself discoursing with 
him of planets and satell tes and comets and meteors 
and signs and seasons, in all of which he seems much 
interested. I know that the hour is a delightful one 
to me and surmise that it has been equally so to 
him. 
Then the next day, as I recall my own pleasure and 
the boy’s delight and interest, I grieve to think that 
not every boy can sit out an evening with his father 
and listen to the music of the spheres; and I wonder 
why the schools cannot do something for the other 
boy, and for my own, too, for I am unable to spend 
every evening with hm and the stars, and so I pass 
my thought on to the pedagogue. “ Why certainly,” 
says he, “we ought to teach astronomy. It is very 
important and instructive; no intelligent man should 
be uninformed in the subject; I will introduce it at 
once.” And next there is complaint that my son has 
neglected his homework in astronomy, and that he had 
only 57 per cent in the last examination in that sub-

ject. Exaggerated? Yes, certainly. Noelementary 
school schedules astronomy as a formal subject? I 
know that, of course. But, after all, is this so very 
far from illustrating the spirit which has prompted 
our campaign of enrichment? 
To have a first-hand acquaintance with the natural 
environment is very desirable, very desirable; the 
more we repeat the statement, the more convinced 
are we that it is not only very desirable but absolutely 
indispensable. Yes, “nature study” must go into the 
curriculum. And the laws of physics, an under- 
standing of which is so necessary to a proper inter- 
pretation of the moving world about us; and the his- 
tory of England, a knowledge of which is so essential 
to a proper appreciation of the history of our own 
country; and the elements of algebra, without which 
we cannot get a glimpse of the glories of higher 
mathematics—all these subjects, and many more, 
must be added so that the child may not be deprived of 
anything which may have a possible value to him in 
either a practical or a cultural sense. And so he is 
jerked from forty minutes of this to twenty minutes 
of that, to thirty minutes of something else, essentials 
and non-essentials all held officially imperative, until 
at the end of the school day he is released, merely to 
transfer his activities to his home, with an armful of 
text-books and the demand for the production of a

bulk of “home work.’’ Can we wonder that the 
average boy or girl finally goes forth from our ele- 
mentary school. possessed of an ill-digested jumble of 
facts and fictions, Jack of all subjects, but master of 
none? This, then, is the case against the enriched 
course of study. 
But this is only one side of the question. If enrich- 
ment has its risks, certainly impoverishment is not 
free from danger. If we seek relief from overfeeding / 
and indigestion, we cannot find it in malnutrition. 
The child for whom school means nothing but a cease- 
Jess grind in the machine shop of the formal studies 
is deserving of the same pity which we accord the child 
employee of any other factory. No wonder that con- 
templation of him has incited the indignation of the re- 
former. No wonder that in the name of Childhood our 
curriculum has been wrested from the clutches of those’ 
who would make of it a treadmill. Much of the crit- 
icism of the curriculum-enricher is the natural out- 
break of the taskmaster protesting against the demand 
that he shall learn new arts and new manners. This 
protest takes the convenient form of attacking the 
“fads.’’ Indeed, as some one has said, the chief fad 
of the day is pounding the fads. But no epigram- 
matic assault upon the new education is going to re- 
sult in a return to the three R’s as the sole substance 
of the curriculum. If the case against excessive en- 
43  
-P-A-G-E-52
  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
richment is strong, surely the case against complete im- 
poverishment is equally strong. 
Like many another educational problem, this of 
the curriculum has both its ideal and its practical 
phases. The closet philosopher may evolve a paper 
curriculum which proves flawless when tested by even 
the highest ideals of the educational theorists. The 
private tutor responsible for the progress of one or two 
children in a wealthy family may devise a course of 
study for his wards which may quite measurably ap- 
» proach the ideal schemes offered by the philosophers. a“ But the school board, face to face with a city public- 
school system, encounters a very different problem. 
Here, as in so many troublesome places in school 
administration, the root of the difficulty is financial, 
and, carrying out the figure, two main branches are the 
burden of large classes and the handicap of untrained 
teachers. 
Of course each of these terms is used comparatively ; 
a large class is large only when contrasted with a 
smaller one, and an untrained teacher is untrained 
only as we consider him less trained than another. 
Just what shall constitute a normal class as to size or 
a normal teacher as to training, is open to argument. 
But it is evident that in order to increase its standard 
in either respect, a school system must spend more 
money. As compared with present conditions, con- 
44

sider a school system wherein all teachers possessed 
a professional training equal to that of our best trained 
physicians, and wherein no class exceeded fifteen in 
number. Without doubt the expense would be at 
least quadrupled, but can we not also assume that 
there would be a commensurate increase in effective- 
ness? Many acurriculum, now existing only on paper, 
could then be materialized in the minds and hearts of 
the children. But the mere hope that we may some 
day have such favorable conditions is not sufficient to 
warrant us in prescribing a curriculum keyed up to 
those imaginary conditions, but actually to be used 
under practical conditions several tones lower in the 
scale. Let us then avoid utopian visions and keep to 
the practical view of the problem. 
We have already noted the fact that ninety per cent 
of our public-school pupils do not go beyond the ele- 
mentary school. For the ten per cent who do, it may 
be that the average course of study is fairly well adapt- 
ed, though this may be questioned. At any rate, in 
recognition of the limits of the present discussion, we 
will not give the point further attention. Rather, let 
us consider the ninety per cent—one would naturally 
suppose that these would enlist the chief interest of 
the school administrators when they manufacture 
courses of study—and examine more closely into what 
is the opportunity which ought to be offered these pu- 
45

pils. The hasty sketch which we have already drawn 
of the conflict between the opposing protectors of the 
curriculum has foreshadowed the fact that this offer- 
ing should be of two distinct kinds. 
‘Our first duty is to train the child in the use of cer- 
tain tools in order that he may qualify for an intelli- 
gent and profitable share in the world’s work. He 
must learn to read and to write. These two essen- 
tials, which include spelling, should be studied until 
they become habits, until there is an immense group 
of automatic reactions set up, so that the printed word 
calls forth easy and rapid rendering either orally or 
mentally, and the need for expression impels the hand 
to write in accordance with form conventional as to 
spelling, penmanship, and the arrangement of a social 
or business letter. Added to these are certain other 
elementary habits which must be acquired. One of 
these is the ability to express oneself in well-formed 
sentences, without hesitation and without violation 
of the ordinary rules of grammar. Another is the 
ability to perform simple arithmetical computations 
and to reason rigorously in simple practical problems 
involving numbers. A thorough development of these 
habits will enable a child forced into the business 
world at the age of fourteen to offer a satisfactory 
groundwork upon which his employer can train him 
along the special lines of his employment, and upon

which he may in his unemployed hours build up a 
technical equipment entitling him to advanced con- 
sideration in the labor market. 
But it would be cruel indeed to send the hyperes- 
sentialized child out from the school with an eye blind 
to the beauties of nature, with an ear deaf to the voice 
of the poet, with a mind dull to the joys of the phi- 
losopher, in short, with a soul dead to the things of 
the higher and broader life and incapable of cultural 
growth. Therefore a second’ kind of offering must be 
provided—the child must be given a taste and an ap- 
petite for those studies which are outside the realm 
of immediate practical utility. 
Now these two offerings represent in turn just what 
the two contesting forces have been fighting for: the 
“conservatives have striven to magnify the essentials; 
the radicals, to magnify the culture studies. But, un- 
fortunately, the struggle has resulted in a compromise, 
when what is needed is an arbitrament; and it is the 
child who has suffered from the effects of the compro- 
mise. It is as though the educational court had award- 
ed the custody of the child to the joint guardianship 
of the utilitarian and the culturist with the result that 
each of these good Samaritans has him by an arm and 
is tugging at him hourly with unremitting attention. 
A saner decree would be to grant to each of his guard- 
ians full control of the child for a specified number 
Av

of hours daily, and to hold each responsible for the 
child’s progress along his special line. 
Let us particularize. There are two great harms 
done the child as a result of the compromise between 
the two ideas of utility and culture, namely, the harm 
of teaching the utilities in the cultural spirit and the 
harm of teaching the culture studies in the utility 
spirit. 
The difficulty that is introduced into the teaching 
of the utility subjects by the spirit of the new educa- 
tion is multifold. First of all there is the difficulty 
with the time schedule. In their zeal to enrich the 
curriculum through the introduction of new subjects, 
the programme makers have been obliged to abbre- 
viate the time allowed the essentials, and yet the work 
to be done in these subjects has not been reduced 
materially if at all. This is axiomatic: a twenty-five- 
hour week given over to fifteen subjects cannot allow 
each subject so long a period as when the same week 
is apportioned to ten subjects. 
In the second place, the more recently developed 
methods appropriately applicable to the teaching of 
the content studies have been carried over into the 
teaching of purely formal studies. The method of the 
recitation in geography, for instance, has extended to 
those subjects whose chief aim is the development of 
formal habits; and the spirit of laissez faire has 
48
-P-A-G-E-57
THE CURRICULUM 
superseded that of drill. In fact, good old-fashioned 
drill is at a discount, and emphasis of its importance 
is too frequently rated as a punishable educational 
heresy. 
A few pages back the utilitarian essentials of the 
curriculum were outlined. That presentment occu- 
pies but a few lines of print, and yet it constitutes in 
itself a course of study which well might employ a 
teacher and her forty or fifty pupils for three hours a 
day throughout six or more years of the elementary 
school course. For, and this is the rock on which the 
enriched curricula go to wreck, there is nothing in the 
new education which has succeeded in nullifying the 
law of habit-building, so accurately expressed by Dr. 
Bagley as “Focalization of consciousness upon the 
process to be automatized, plus attentive repetition of 
this process, permitting no exceptions until automa- 
tism results.””1_ The italics are my own. 
Charles Dickens, the lay teacher, had no obscure 
notions on this subject. Reread your “Oliver 
Twist” and along toward the end of the ninth chap- 
ter you will recall how Mr. Fagin drilled his pupils, 
through “a very curious and uncommon game” in 
the art of extracting “with the most extraordinary

rapidity, snuffbox, note case, watchguard, shirt- 
pin, pocket handkerchief, even the spectacle case,” 
from the pockets of “the merry old gentleman.” 
Nowhere throughout the account do we hear of prep- 
aration, presentation, association, but we do learn 
that this game was repeated ‘‘a great many times.” 
Even sixty pages farther along in the narrative we 
are told that the two boys, not what we would call a 
large class, “played the old game with the Jew every 
day.” Drill, drill, and more drill, was the method, 
and carefully indeed did Fagin the pedagogue avoid 
the modern educator’s curious vagary of supposing 
that if a lesson is “presented” once to a class it is 
sure to be at the recall of all the members of the 
class weeks afterwards. 
Moreover, from the practical exigencies of school 
management, the effects of insufficient drill are sadly 
cumulative. A certain standard in a subject is fixed 
fora certain grade. At the end of the term an ortho- 
dox proportion of pupils must be promoted out of that 
into the succeeding grade. These pupils are duly 
forwarded. The requirements of the new grade are 
definitely scheduled on the supposition that the class 
which the teacher confronts is grounded in the pre- 
liminary work and prepared to take up the advanced 
work without review of the old. This assumption is 
quite contrary to the fact, as practical class teachers 
50
-P-A-G-E-59
  
THE CURRICULUM 
well know. There is no time in the new grade to rivet 
the work presented in the grade below. 
From grade to grade the difficulty accumulates, the 
pupil’s incompetency increasing as the square of his 
distance from the starting point of his school career. 
We are speaking, be it remembered, of the ninety per 
cent. In their interest the work demanding drill 
should be reduced in quantity. For instance, in 
mathematics, cut out, not a topic here and there, but 
fully half of the work ordinarily presented, retaining 
at least all of the time now allotted to the subject, and 
then teach that half. 
To give but a single illustration of the present situa- 
tion, contemplate the eighth-year girl, the girl whose 
destiny it is to leave school within a year to busy 
herself in the home or in outside vocational employ- 
ment, and picture her as she flounders around in a 
swirling Sargasso of cylinders, cones, trapezoids, 
pi-r-squares, x—y’s, and yet is quite incompetent to 
audit her mother’s grocery bill—I mean to add it up 
once and be sure it is correct. She has been taught 
the . distinction between adjectives and adjective 
participles, that is, the distinction has been duly and 
pedagogically “presented” to her, but if she is not 
serious-minded, it dwells with her but fleetingly, and 
if she is, worse luck, it takes the part of an unbridled 
evil spirit in her troubled dreams. In the midst of 
51
-P-A-G-E-60
PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
her struggles to do her “home work” in parsing, 
imagine her mother saying to her, offhandedly, some 
evening: “By the way, daughter, I forgot to order 
some white muslin when I was at Brown’s Emporium 
to-day. Drop them a note and ask them to send two 
yards of the eight-cent quality to-morrow when they 
send.what I ordered to-day. Be sure that they send 
it to-morrow without fail, as I must have some of it 
to mend Robert’s shirt that he tore yesterday. They 
can charge it, of course.” Do you, gentle reader, 
picture her saying cheerfully, “Yes, mother,” and in 
a few minutes presenting a note for her mother’s in- 
spection, concise, correctly worded, legibly written, 
and properly addressed? If so, you are a remarkably 
venturesome optimist. I seem to hear her petulant 
appeals, such as: “ What paper shall I use? Do you 
spell Emporium witha uv or ano? Is this the 19th? 
Shall I write Tuesday in the date? Was it white you 
said? How do you spell muslin? What shall I tell 
them about Bob’s shirt? Do they know you have an 
account there?” ad libitum until the overworked 
mother resolves not to bother daughter another time 
with so plebeian a task while she has verbals and 
parallelograms to groom for to-morrow’s appearance 
at school. 
Thus far, we have been contemplating the damage 
done to the utility subjects by the uncurbed influence 
52
-P-A-G-E-61
  THE CURRICULUM 
of the enriching subjects. Conversely the new and 
cultural subjects have suffered acutely at the hands 
of the drillmasters. For teachers of the old school, 
the time-hardened drillers, there is no method of 
attacking any subject except through formal teach- 
ing. Hence we see cultural studies subjected to drill 
methods. Even if such a teacher waxes enthusiastic 
over the new subjects, his zeal comes perilously near 
complying with Professor Santayana’s definition of 
fanaticism which he says “consists in redoubling 
your effort when you have forgotten your aim.” 
We are told that the word school is from the 
Greek, ‘‘a transferred use of oyody, spare time, 
leisure.” Would it be such an alarming matter if we 
were to revive this idea, and frankly treated part of 
our school day as leisure, or spare time? The boy or 
girl who is one of the fortunate ten per cent, scheduled 
for higher education, may perhaps justifiably be put 
to a formal and persistent study of the cultural sub- 
jects in preparation for their more intensive con- 
sideration later on. But for the ninety per cent, 
may we not safely provide the environment and the 
seductive atmosphere of culture on an extensive but 
necessarily shallow scale, and then let these pupils 
browse about, under skillful guidance, not compelled 
to absorb it all, but free to pick and choose much of 
it for themselves? 
53
-P-A-G-E-62
  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
No one person can reasonably be expected to evince 
an absorbing interest in all departments of culture. 
Here is a boy who delights in bees but eschews 
Browning; here is another who relishes Shakespeare 
but hates science. Must we beat and hammer each 
into a duplicate of the other, and turn him out a 
composite pseudo-scientist and dilettante littérateur? 
We know some first-class scientists who are wretch- 
edly indifferent to Browning; and we know some men 
of letters who are hopelessly ignorant of the habits of 
bees; and yet we do not think of any of these as un- 
cultured. Is it not more reasonable for us to en- 
courage the bee-boy to become a thoroughgoing 
scientist and the Shakespeare-boy to become a thor- 
oughgoing student of literature? As Superintendent 
Chancellor puts it, “The general fact is that at the 
present time the fashion in the schools is to carry out 
too narrow, too uniform a curriculum. It needs to 
be broadened and enriched. But it does not need to 
be increased in the case of any individual child.” ! 
The culturist must abandon his hope of so schooling 
our children that they may go forth at the age of 
fourteen with a “finished” education. He must 
modify his hope so that it may reasonably become an

expectation, and work for the coming of the day when 
the child meets his practical adult world equipped in 
the essential utilities so that his material progress 
is assured, and yet imbued with the spirit of reading 
and research, of discontent with the limits of his in- 
formation and his mental grasp, and of determination 
to persist in his self-education all the days of his life. 
Give him this double equipment, and you will be giv- « 
ing him that which surely the average public ele- 
mentary school of to-day lamentably fails to give him. 
These two main purposes, then, must we have in 
our public education: to teach the child to work while 
he works, and to teach him to browse while he 
browses; to teach him to work honestly, earnestly, 
unremittingly, and effectively, to browse intelligently, 
profitably, and joyously. We cannot effect these two 
purposes by permitting them to contest throughout 
the school day for the possession of the child—there 
must be arbitrament, not contest. 
To restate it in more specific terms, this is the pro- 
gramme: give the essentials two or three hours of the 
school day; give the culture subjects the balance. 
Give the essentials those portions of the morning and 
afternoon sessions during which the pupil has a maxi- 
mum of available energy. Cut down the details of 
the essentials, prune them to a very simple but a very 
definite programme, then teach thoroughly, relentless-

ly, demanding of the child unremitting and increasing 
concentration of attention. Let this complete his 
school day so far as hard work is concerned, leaving 
nothing to be done at home. For the balance of the 
day introduce him to the content studies and the arts, 
but extend this to him in the spirit of privilege, not 
as a duty or task. Give him a reasonable liberty, 
growing in amount as he grows, to cull for himself that 
which his individuality demands. Most important of 
all, do not hamper or depress him with home work, 
tests, or examinations, in these subjects. 
We may well agree with Dr. Hanus when he says 
that “The education demanded by a democratic so- 
ciety to-day is an education that prepares a youth to 
overcome the inevitable difficulties that stand in the 
way of his material and spiritual advancement.” 1 
But we need to make very sure that our schools are 
giving a true preparation, and above all, that they are 
not themselves augmenting the “inevitable diffi- 
culties.”

MORAL TRAINING 
Her would be presumptuous indeed who would 
undertake to discuss with any air of finality the sub- 
ject of moral education. The large and excellent 
bibliography on the subject serves to emphasize both 
the seriousness and the intricacy of the problem and 
the earnestness and sincerity of the attempts at its 
solution. ‘Moral Training in the Public Schools” 
is of such gravity as to have elicited a volume,! bear- 
ing this title, in which are gathered five from out of 
a total of three hundred essays which were submitted 
in competition for cash prizes offered by a citizen of 
California. Upon reading these selected essays one 
is impressed not alone by their uniform excellence and 
scholarly spirit, but perhaps even more by the im- 
mensity and complexity of the subject, as evidenced 
by the variety of viewpoint, of method of treatment, 
and of suggested solution, advanced by the different 
authors. And so, I repeat, one who presumed to 
dispose of this subject in a chapter would be giving

prima facie evidence of his total inability to discuss 
the subject at all. In these pages, therefore, the 
subject can be touched only tangentially, and the 
tangent will be drawn from the point of view of the 
preceding chapters. 
By way of introduction, we may remind ourselves 
that moral development is a threefold phenomenon.! 
Conduct, our “three fourths of life,” is the index by 
which we gauge moral ability in others. Each of us 
has a supplementary gauge which he can apply to him- 
self, but to himself only, namely, the quality of such of 
his own thought as issues not in specific action. But 
in evaluating the moral strength of our fellows we have 
only their tangible acts upon which to base our judg- 
ment. 
Conduct, as we have said, has a trinitarian basis: it 
j is dependent upon the exercise of intellect, feeling, and 
will. The child may be both quite eager and quite 
willing to do the right in a specific case, and yet be 
honestly in doubt as to which constitutes the right 
act; that is, his deficiency is not one of feeling or of 
will, but of knowledge. Again, he may know per- 
fectly which of two actions is the right, may have a 
will thoroughly capable of leading him to one or the 
other of these actions as he may decide, and yet fail 
  
1 Cf. “The Management of a City School,” p. 247, et seq. 
58
-P-A-G-E-67
MORAL TRAINING 
through an utter indifference as to whether his acts 
are right or wrong; that is, his intellect and his will are 
not at fault, but a moving feeling for the right is 
absent. Or again, he may clearly see the right, may 
ardently desire to do the right, and yet find himself 
too weak-willed to do that which his intellect and 
his feeling prompt him to do. 
And all this is true, of course, not only of man in his 
childhood but throughout the entire span of his life. 
The only difference is that the school and the home are 
prone to assume a degree of moral perfection in its chil- 
dren which it rarely demands of the adult. Witness the 
mother who daily exclaims: ‘I don’t see why George 
acts so,” George being the five-year-old whose de- 
ficiencies in arithmetic and reading are taken for 
granted, whose esthetic shortcomings elicit no com- 
ment, and yet whose moral ability is regarded as 
something that ought to grow up of itself. All of 
which suggests that if the school is to concern itself at 
all with moral training it must consider it just as 
seriously as it does the training of the pupil in intel- 
Jectual acumen, manual skill, or art appreciation. 
There is just one unanswerable reason why the school 
must consider the moral training of its pupils, and that 
is because it cannot possibly leave it unconsidered. 
The child is bound to get a moral training of some kind 
wherever he goes; he is particularly sure to get a moral 
59 4
-P-A-G-E-68
  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
training of some kind when he goes to school. So that 
the question is not, “Shall the school give moral train- 
ing?” but, “The school 7s giving moral training; what 
kind shall it be?” The school may rightfully be held 
accountable in the matter. If the school environment 
gives a moral training in grade below that of the child’s 
environment outside the school, then must the school 
be condemned as an institution dangerous to the wel- 
fare of society. But the school cannot hope to escape 
this condemnation by merely letting well enough 
alone; it must give positive attention to the moral 
growth of its pupils. 
For there is nothing intrinsically moral in the school. 
I mean by this that the mere fact that a child enters 
aschool building and there meets scores of other chil- 
dren and with them is compelled, one way or another, 
to acquire certain information, is no guarantee that he 
is thereby to grow in moral ability. That ability is 
bound to be affected in some way, but not necessarily 
in the direction of growth and improvement. It may 
be so affected as to make him morally weaker than if he 
had remained on the street; or again, it may be so af- 
fected as to make him tremendously stronger morally 
than if he had remained on the street. The child can- 
not go to school, nor anywhere else, and remain un- 
affected morally ; his environment trains him positively 
either toward morality or toward immorality.

MORAL TRAINING 
Were it possible for the school to deal with the child 
intellectually only and have no effect whatever upon 
his moral nature, whether for better or for worse, then 
the teaching of morals might be considered an ex- 
traneous thing, and the advocates of its intrusion 
would be on the defensive. But the case is not so. 
Select any incident at random in the pupil’s school 
day. Here, for instance, is a boy who has just solved 
a problem in arithmetic. He carries his paper to his 
teacher, who looks over his work and disposes of it. 
In all of this simple procedure there is a definite moral 
tone which has its inevitable, though not always star- 
tling or recognized, effect upon the boy. The spirit in 
which he attacked the problem, the manner in which 
he walked to the teacher’s desk, what the teacher said 
and how he said it, the boy’s reaction toward the 
teacher’s attitude—all these have their moral value, 
all have their sure effect, be it ever so little in quan- 
tity, upon the boy’s moral progress or retrogress. 
Thus every exercise and event in the school touches 
the moral spirit of the pupil—the school cannot escape 
its responsibility. 
We are not to suppose that the child himself is ana- 
lytic concerning his own gain or loss in moral culture. 
He, like the adult, ordinarily “senses” things, not syl- 
logizes them. For example, he does not often say: “IT 
did so and so; the teacher treated it thus; that was un- 
61   t
-P-A-G-E-70
  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
just; therefore, I am unjustly treated; therefore, I 
will . . . etc.” Rather has he an indefinite rankling 
sensation that he is not being fairly treated; but his 
consequent conduct is no less positive because it is 
based on a general feeling and not on a specific intel- 
lectual inference. This preambles the thought that 
the very organization of the school cannot fail to ex- 
ercise an indirect though nevertheless powerful effect 
upon the moral training of its pupils. It is this influ- 
ence of the organic structure of the school system upon 
the problem of moral culture that constitutes the 
theme of this chapter. 
America unfurls the flag of democracy on which are 
emblazoned “‘liberty, fraternity, and justice,” and we 
all cheer lustily. But as she takes up the educational 
banners upon which are inscribed the golden word 
“opportunity,” and proceeds to distribute them to a 
meager tenth of her children, and then, in stepmother- 
ly fashion, gives to the others the simple privilege of 
shouting while her favorites march by, can she reason- 
ably demand from these an enthusiastic devotion either 
to democracy or to the abstractions of justice and 
right? Even though he says little about it at the time, 
does not the fourteen-year-old boy, suddenly cast up- 
on the maelstrom of life, untrained to pull an oar or 
reef a sail, still sense the fact that America had appren- 
ticed him to a horticulturist and not to a navigator?

MORAL TRAINING 
Retardation is the euphemistic technical term, re- 
cently discovered, applied to the patent fact that our 
children do not get along well at school. There is, 
though, a certain felicity in the selection of the word, 
for it implies that the mishap of the pupil is something 
for which he is not responsible—retardation must 
mean that the child is retarded by something or some- 
body. In spite of much current talk on the subject, 
it is a question as to whether we quite know what it 
is all about. Shall we measure a child against an aver- 
age standard, against an abnormally high standard, 
or against an exceptionally low standard? Why not 
simply measure himself against himself? And how can 
we measure him against himself if we give him another 
person’s work to do instead of his own? 
Having set up a school machine that is not con- 
structed to do the work required of it, shall we stand 
off and wonder why the products of the machine are 
mutilated and defective? Instead of rebuilding the 
machine, we continue to patch it here and there, hope- 
ful that by some chance stroke we may improve the 
product. Then when the tinkering is unsuccessful, 
recourse is had to shifting the blame to the engineers. 
There is surely no teacher who would pretend to have 
fully mastered the teaching art, nor any principal who 
would claim to manage his school faultlessly; it is to 
be hoped that each employee in the school system is 
63
-P-A-G-E-72
    
PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
ready to acknowledge his own shortcomings in his 
position; and yet he would seem justified in protesting 
against being charged with defective results which 
are presumptively due to false organization. Retarda- 
tion is not an indictment against the teacher and his 
teaching method so much as it is against the organic 
structure of the school. 
It may seem that this reference to retardation would 
more properly have been made while we were consid- 
ering the curriculum, but it belongs right here. Moral 
nurture requires all the favoring conditions which it 
can command. Moral integrity is so tender a plant 
that we should not take any chances in trying to raise 
it in poor soil. Pupils, set to doing the wrong tasks, 
are making the struggle to grow morally, in arid 
soil. Undoubtedly the plant is not conscious of its 
meager growth nor does it philosophize about the 
quality of the soil from which it springs—but the 
gardener is nevertheless responsible. The child has no 
very clear notion of why he stumbles in his moral 
progress, or even perhaps of the fact that he is stum- 
bling. But whether the retarded child realizes it or 
not, his very retardation is a force making against his 
moral growth—and the school is responsible. Re- 
organize the school; measure the child against a stand- 
ard appropriate to himself; eliminate the strain on 
his moral development which results when, owing

him one kind of schooling, we thrust another upon 
him. 
We may look at this subject of moral training with 
advantage if we reconsider it in its relation to the 
curriculum, and once more recall the contest between 
the formalist and the culturist for the possession of 
the child. To give the child naught but the disciplin- 
ary, the formal, the utilitarian, subjects of study, and 
to compel him to toil throughout his school day and 
school year in their atmosphere, is to exclude all the 
incentives to moral growth which inhere in the culture 
group of studies. 
It is true that there is a certain knowledge of the 
right to be acquired through the study of the truths 
of mathematics; there is a certain feeling for the right 
to be experienced through the ideals of mathematical 
accuracy and precision; there is a certain development 
of the will power resulting from the struggle with the 
formal processes and the rigorous reasoning involved 
in mathematical calculations. And yet to depend 
wholly upon arithmetic and the other formal studies 
for the culture of the knowledge, the feeling, and the 
will, which function in every moral act, is unneces- 
sarily to limit opportunity and to employ a method 
needlessly harsh and forbidding. There is very much 
in the realm of literature, of science, of history, of art, 
of handicraft, that teaches effectively the knowledge 
65
-P-A-G-E-74
  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
of and feeling for moral issues, and we are demanding 
the impossible of the child when we exclude him from 
this realm of profit and yet hold him to a high-quality 
virtue. 
On the other hand, to give the average child a cur- 
riculum overloaded with content studies—studies 
which he should pursue not as a preparation for further 
formal study in higher institutions but solely for inter- 
est and inspiration—is to set his mind in such a whirl 
that thé moral virtues are in danger of being sub- 
merged and lost. In their laudable eagerness to 
relieve the child from the severities of the utilitarian 
programme, the culturists have weakened him in all 
three departments which make for moral strength. 
In the first place, knowledge of right and wrong 
comes either through the acceptance of dogmatic 
teaching or through careful thinking on a few well- 
considered facts, never from slipshod thinking about 
a vast multitude of facts. Was it Josh Billings who 
told us that “it is better not to know so many things 
than to know so many things what ain’t so’’?, Who- 
ever the author, it is the expression of a saner peda- 
gogy than many of the professional pedagogues preach 
or practice. The digestive capacity of the average 
child is as limited for mental food as for bodily food; 
when his mind is stored with innumerable scraps of 
knowledge and then these are tamped down day after 
66
-P-A-G-E-75
     MORAL TRAINING 
day so as to stuff in still more, he is sure to be harbor- 
ing, many, many things “what ain’t so.” And the 
pity of it is that either he charges the school with bad 
faith when his condition is finally revealed to him, or 
else he never learns his plight and goes through life 
thinking hazily and lazily. If a boy cannot think ac- 
curately in terms of arithmetic, or of geography, or 
of civics, how are we to suppose him capable of think- 
ing accurately in terms of moral precepts and moral 
definitions? 
In the second place, the pressure of the culture 
studies on the time schedule reduces the total time 
given to the formal group; and the inclusion of an 
immense number of totally unnecessary topics in the 
various formal studies, materially reduces the time 
available for each topic. The result is that the teacher, 
under average conditions, cannot teach thoroughly, 
with the further result that the ideal of thoroughness 
is shattered. Pupils present indifferent work; the 
teacher knows that it should not be accepted, that a 
higher standard should be set before the pupil and 
compliance therewith imperatively demanded. But 
to maintain this standard is a physical and mental 
impossibility, and so the child accepts as his standard 
the carelessness which circumstance compels the 
teacher to accept from him. Now carelessness is dis- 
tinctively an immoral ideal. How can we expect a 
6% 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
a 
PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
child whose ideal has been thus untrained or wrongly 
trained in regard to intellectual tasks, to carry over 
to the moral realm careful ideals of duty and truth? 
In the third place, the spirit of the cultural studies 
has exerted a decided influence upon the teaching of 
the formal group. The keynote of the new education 
is interest, and even the teaching of the multiplica- 
tion table may be made, in a way, interesting, intrin- 
sically so in its presentation and artificially so in its 
drill. But there is an acquisition of formal knowledge 
and power which can come only through intense con- 
centration of attention. To make a subject interest- 
ing through the petty devices of teaching method, is 
to make it fruitless in will training. And so the in- 
fluence of the interest-rousing spirit upon those essen- 
tials of the curriculum which are to be acquired only 
by brute force, as it were, has not been altogether a 
profitable one. Moral development, while dependent 
upon knowledge and feeling, is predominantly a mat- 
ter of will. The education of the will, by very defini- 
tion, means fundamentally training in doing what we 
do not especially desire to do. It follows then that 
will training cannot be made “interesting.”’ This is 
true when we mean by interest any direct stimulus 
which compels attention; it is of course not true if we 
extend it to include that higher interest which func- 
tions indirectly through ideals. 
68
-P-A-G-E-77
MORAL TRAINING 
Consider a single crude illustration. A boy is left 
alone in a room with a luscious red apple in sight which 
belongs to another boy. He knows that to appro- 
priate that apple to his own use would be a wrong 
act—an act which he has learned to call stealing. His 
general sentiment, his ideal, is honesty; his higher self 
prompts him to overrule his appetite and not take the 
apple. If he succeeds in so controlling his will that it 
is obedient to his ideal and not to his appetite, he has 
won a moral victory and has made a distinct advance 
in the subjection and training of his will. If we call 
this ideal an interest, as probably we should, then we 
must admit that interest does factor favorably. But 
suppose, as the boy is about to steal the apple, he 
suddenly recollects that he has an orange of his own 
in his lunch-box, and also that he really likes oranges 
better than apples. This direct interest, this demand 
upon his involuntary attention, though it does result 
in his not stealing, has done little or nothing in 
training him in the virtue of honesty. Or again, sup- 
pose that while he is debating the question with him- 
self and is about to take the apple, his teacher 
suddenly appears upon the scene and imposes her 
will upon his. Although the act of stealing has been 
averted, it is clear that there has been no advance in 
the training of the boy’s will. In other words, the 
essence of moral power is the ability to do, of one’s 
69
-P-A-G-E-78
  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
own volition, those things which we desire not to do; 
it is the victory of the imperative ought over the se- 
ductive please. ‘ 
When the teacher attempts to give the pupil the 
elements of the formal studies through an interest 
which aims to inveigle him or trick him into their ac- 
quisition, he is depriving the child of the very train- 
ing in will development which is his due. Of course 
the drillmaster is not to construe this into a license to 
do naught but drill his class in intellectual perform- 
ances; there is no moral virtue in drill, per se. It is 
only when the pupil submits himself to unattractive 
drill through the operation of some ideal which he rec- 
ognizes for himself, that he is gaining in will power. 
I recall the case of a girl sent to me by her teacher 
with a “commendation card” for an excellent geog- 
raphy recitation. As I indorsed the card with my sig- 
nature, I said, ‘‘So you like geography, do you?” 
Her frank reply came with explosive promptness, 
“No, [hate it.”” It was evident that she had made an 
important gain in the power of self-application to a 
distasteful task, and it was no less evident that the 
teacher was alive to her responsibilities for the train- 
ing of her girls toward moral conquest. 
Now, the essence of an ideal is that it shall in some 
way represent an ultimate and transcendent “good.” 
It must have a recognizable “value.”” The pupil must, 
70
-P-A-G-E-79
MORAL TRAINING 
in one way or another, be brought to sense his duty, 
which is but his epitome of ideals. He learns that it 
is his duty to do his school work—including all the 
disagreeable phases of it—because, broadly speaking, 
it is right for him to become educated and wrong for 
him to grow up in ignorance. But if we recognize the 
fact that the so-called education which we put upon 
him is not the education which will make him most 
effective, either individually or socially, how can we, 
with any conscience, lead him to a faith in this mis- 
directed education as an ideal? A curriculum which 
gives pupils so much to do that they can do none of 
it thoroughly, which leads them to believe that their 
full duty consists in passive submission to the active 
determination of the teacher to interest—we had al- 
most said amuse—them, which seems to teach them 
that it is easily possible to get something for nothing, 
is a curriculum immoral certainly in its effects, if not 
in and of its very self. 
The central thought of the kindergarten, as I « 
understand it, is to provide the child, early in his 
life, with practical ideals which shall become effective 
motives in directing his activities and shall gradually 
transform his aimless play into purposeful work. 
It must be admitted, however, that this spirit has 
been misinterpreted by many of the enthusiastic 
disciples of Froebel. They seem to have read the 
val 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
word play in enlarged capitals and to have entirely 
overlooked the great moral implications of the kinder- 
garten idea. Hence the plea that the spirit of the 
kindergarten be extended through the elementary- 
school grades has all too frequently resulted in attempts 
on the part of misguided teachers to convert into play 
those activities of the school which must ever involve 
work, hard work, work in the performance of which 
inheres the essence of moral stamina and true virtue. 
Professor Wendell, in his essay on “Our National 
Superstition,”’ scores the weakening effect of these 
misdirected ideas in the so-styled “new education.” 
“The whole new system of education, from a child’s 
first school to a man’s last degree, is based on this 
principle, which we may call the principle of the kin- 
dergarten—not literally, of course, but as a matter of 
general temper. You must try to find out just what 
everybody likes best, and then help him to do it 
just as kindly as you can.” ! He traces the effect of 
this principle in these words: “boys fitted for college 
at schools where the new education has supplanted the 
old, seem to me, almost year by year, when they get 
to college, flabbier and flabbier in mind,” and he il- 
lustrates with the story of the Harvard sophomore 
whom he advised to “take in hand some hard and 
1 Barrett Wendell: “The Privileged Classes,” Scribners, 1908, 
p. 157. 
12

MORAL TRAINING 
solid subject, and therewith to plow out the traces 
of the kindergarten.” 
Probably Professor Wendell would not wish his 
essay construed as an attack upon the kinder- 
garten per se, nor do we need to make any such 
attack in order to convince ourselves that the power 
of relentless concentration is not one of the virtues de- 
veloped by the latter-day pedagogy. And if the effect 
upon the chosen one per cent of children who go to 
college is so marked, can we wonder that the ninety 
per cent in our elementary schools succumb to the 
enervating spirit of dolce far niente? We may well 
question our right to demand of our pupils that they 
shall exhibit in the moral sphere a will power which 
we neglect to develop in their intellectual training. 
How can we expect the child who has never learned 
to face forbidding and distasteful intellectual tasks and 
conquer them through sheer force, to meet the moral 
crises of his life with infallible strength of will? 
There are many other causes, some of them pain- 
fully patent, of the present unsatisfactory relation of 
our public schools to moral education, but I purposely 
refrain even from referring to them. I wish rather 
to support the single thesis that the curriculum it- 
self exercises an influence upon the moral develop- 
ment of the pupils to whom it is applied, an influence 
which may neither be lightly disregarded nor readily

/ measured. The substance and spirit of the curric- 
ulum should therefore be such as to promote and not 
to impede this development. Our American curric- 
ulum, so closely related to our illogical school organ- 
ization, is on trial charged with increasing the diffi- 
culties attending the problem of moral training when 
it should be one of the most powerful and positive 
contributions toward its solution.

INTRODUCTION 
Tue distinction has elsewhere been drawn! be- 
tween the general and the specific relations which the 
school principal and the class teacher sustain toward 
the state. The problems discussed in the preceding 
chapters are such as ordinarily concern the subordi- 
nate in a school system only as he is interested in ful- 
filling his general obligation to society. His specific 
contract does not call upon him to settle general pol- 
icies or to solve the broad problems of school admin- 
istration. Nevertheless, as an honest student and a 
thoughtful observer he is bound to have some opin- 
ions regarding these policies and these problems; and 
it is in recognition of the general duty which the state 
imposes upon him as one of its professional members 
that he offers the results of his study and his obser- 
vation, hopeful that they may be received at their 
face value and render to society a service proportioned 
to their merit. But as attention is transferred from 
these broader problems to the details of school and

class management, the specific obligations of princi- 
pals and teachers come into view. 
So long as the whole subject of educational theory 
and practice is in a state of unstable equilibrium, each 
school must be considered an experiment station, and 
each executive head—whether of a class, a school, or a 
system—must regard himself as a research student in 
the pedagogical laboratory. The principal particu- 
larly has a unique opportunity to work out tentative 
solutions to definite problems in both management 
and methods. He occupies a position midway 
between the enthusiastic exponent of educational 
reforms and the practical teacher upon whom falls 
the burden of attempting to realize those reforms. 
His consequent function is that of intermediary be- 
tween theory and application, and his philosophy will 
be a practical idealism. Keeping his head in the 
radiant but shifting clouds, he yet grounds his feet 
squarely upon the prosaic and solid earth. He 
recognizes the value of ideals and appreciates the 
sincerity of those educational writers whose ex- 
pression is largely in terms of the ideal; but he also 
sympathizes with the class teacher whose devotion 
to the philosophic phase of her work is imperatively 
diverted by the demands of a very present and actual 
condition of fact. Through receptive sympathy the 
most ardent thought of the progressive educationalist

may be properly tempered by the cool judgment of 
a practical principal and safely passed on to the 
teacher for her to apply to the factual situation. 
Those who are directly engaged in school and class 
management are in search not so much of the state- 
ments of new theories, though the motivating value 
of these is duly acknowledged, as of reports of the 
applications of such theories in actual current prac- 
tice. From which it follows that, in proportion as. 
the school executive has opportunity to experiment, 
it is his duty to report upon the results of his experi- 
ments to his fellow workmen. It is with a sense of 
this duty, which overrides my own recognition of the 
shortcomings of the following pages, that I send them 
forth. 
My lines have fallen in pleasant places, and the 
large elementary school which I have had the good 
fortune to administer for several years has afforded 
an excellent opportunity for the study of definite 
problems as well as encouragement to attempt their 
solution. But however willing the spirit may be to 
devote itself to work of this character, the time left 
for such work after the hours demanded by the daily 
routine have been subtracted from the school day, is 
all too brief. Of the specific subjects treated herein, 
those of chapters four to seven may more properly 
be considered as problems of methods and those of 
19
-P-A-G-E-88
  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
the succeeding chapters as problems of management. 
I have aitned to include nothing that has been defi- 
nitely worked out in the same way by other school men 
and already described in published form. _ If it should 
prove that I have been anticipated in any respect by 
matter already published which has escaped my no- 
tice, I here record my assurance that it is in spite of 
a conscientious effort to acquaint myself with the 
bibliography of the various subjects. 
It seems unnecessary to apologize to practical teach- 
ers for entering quite fully into working details. It is 
the interchange of views in just such detail that is 
most desired by craftsmen already grounded in the 
philosophy of education and the essentials of method. 
At this point, too, I may, once for all, express my 
apology—if apology be needed—for the prevalence 
of the first person in the language of many of the 
following pages. Most of the sentences could be 
recast so as to give them the air of impersonality, but 
the results of experience seem to be most effectively 
presented in the direct speech of the deponent, and 
any formal attempt to avoid the possible criticism of 
egoism would seem an unnecessary affectation.

COMPOSITION * 
“ComPosITION,” as it is understood in its limited 
school sense, is the art of composing thoughts, that 
is, of putting thoughts together properly. The ex- 
pression of a detached, random thought or collection 
of thoughts may no more be dignified by the term 
composition than the careless daub of the brush is 
deemed a composition in the pictorial arts. Hence 
the essence of composition teaching is to train the 
pupil to arrange his thoughts. He needs to learn 
this art for both its personal and social value. It 
is the latter phase which perhaps comes most prom- 
inently to mind when we consider composition work 
in the schools, namely, the necessity for proper 
thought conveyance so that the individual may be 
  
1 Particularly sixth-, seventh-, and eighth- year grades. For 
primary composition, see, among others: Percival Chubb, “The 
Teaching of English,” The Macmillan Co., 1907, pp. 106-117,

A. 8. Barnes and Co., 1906.

  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
an effective and agreeable member of his social 
group. 
¥ Equally important, however, is the development of 
the habit of clear and orderly thinking, even when 
there follows no immediate formal expression of the 
results of this thinking. This is necessary to any 
substantial progress in the personal cultural life of 
the individual. By way of illustration we have only 
to note how unthinking is the reading of even in- 
telligent people. For many, the novel is the only 
literary form with which they are at all intimate. 
The value of the novel is certainly not to be min- 
imized—its power to stimulate, to soothe, to interest, 
even to instruct—but as a means of intellectual dis- 
cipline how far inferior it is to such a form of literary 
composition as the essay. 
Few people read in order to think. Quite frequently 
their reading results in a substantial inhibition of their 
own impulse to thinking, with danger of an eventual 
atrophy of the power to think in any true sense of the 
word. Compared to the number whose only concep- 
tion of reading is the absorption of the plot and in- 
cident of the novel, few indeed are they who are 
willing to read one page, say of Emerson’s Essays, 
and think five pages, and extremely few are those 
who have deliberately cultivated such a habit. The 
development of the habit of self-reliant thinking, 
82
-P-A-G-E-91
  ENGLISH IN THE UPPER GRADES 
then, is an aim of school training justified by con- 
sideration not only of the child’s responsibility as a 
social unit, but also of his personal culture. 
Thought arrangement is impossible, moreover, 
without the presence of a store of thoughts. Of 
course no person can be absolutely thoughtless, and 
yet there exists an undeniable necessity, in any 
method of training, for deliberately providing a sup- 
ply of thoughts. 
Composition teaching consequently involves definite 
cultivation of (1) the pupil’s power and habit of 
searching for and seizing upon the raw materials of 
the thinking process, (2) the ability to work over 
these raw materials so that they may be properly 
classified and correlated in his mental storehouse, 
and (3) the ability intelligently to convey the results 
of his thinking to others by means of verbal ex- 
pression. For convenient reference, we may des- 
ignate these three stages: (1) Acquisition, (2) Organ- ~ 
ization, (3) Expression. 
(1) Acquisition is directed toward materials which 
will work up into various forms of literary composi- 
tion and is concurrent with all the instructional ex- 
ercises of the school. Every subject of the curriculum 
forces upon the pupils’ attention materials which are 
stowed away in consciousness, where they remain 
subject to a more or less ready recall. The skillful 
83 u
-P-A-G-E-92
  
PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
teacher recognizes that in teaching each subject he is 
not only working toward the specific ends by virtue 
of which that subject has a place in the curriculum, 
but he is also accumulating for the pupil subject- 
matter which the pupil is to reorganize for the dis- 
tinctive purpose of exercising his powers of ex- 
‘pression. That is, he is teaching each subject not a only directly for itself, but also indirectly for results 
in composition. Hence he will bear in mind the 
various uses to which the acquired facts may be put 
in the work in composition, and the pupils themselves 
in their progress through the grades will gradually 
learn to classify the chief kinds of production. 
The forms which verbal composition may take are 
those which constitute the time-honored categories 
of rhetoric, namely, narrative, description, expo- 
sition, and argument. Professor Gardiner! groups 
these into the literature of thought (the last two) 
and the literature of feeling, and includes, too, in the 
former group a type which is scarcely to be con- 
sidered in the elementary school, criticism. 
All acquisition may lead toward any one of the four 
kinds of composition; and the pupil, unless he is de- 
liberately acquiring facts for a particular kind of com- 
position, will absorb ideas regardless of the exact form

of their eventual use. However, certain school studies 
and exercises seem to be better adapted to the devel- 
opment of one rhetorical form than another and hence 
to be most prolific in supplying this particular need. 
This field of the subject has been well worked over ! 
and is not further referred to here. 
(2) Organization makes such a selective arrange- 
ment of the raw materials already acquired as will 
dispose them economically in the mental storeroom 
and prepare them for appropriate expression? “An _/ 
agglomeration of material has no literary value, any 
more than a stone-heap has an architectural value. 
If the author has done nothing but amass he is unin- 
teresting.” 3 Under the head of “ organization” should

sition whole, and models for this purpose should ex- 
emplify not alone beauty of language but excellence 
of logical arrangement.! In addition to the analytic 
study of the model, formal synthetic exercises in or- 
ganization should be given, wherein the pupils have 
set before them a series of detached sentences, or less- 
er elements, which they are to rearrange into proper 
sequence.2 The teacher may most readily get mate- 
rial for such exercises by disarranging the sentences in 
a model. It will add interest to the work if the pupils 
know the source of the material and are permitted to 
compare the results of their efforts at reorganization 
with the original. 
| The discussion incident to the study of the model 
and the reorganization of material will afford oppor- 
tunity for the inductive development of the funda- 
mental rules for rhetorical unity. The rules thus de- 
rived may in turn be taken as the basis for application

in organization exercises. Chief among these rules 
are: “put but one main assertion and appropriate 
modifiers in a sentence, treat one subordinate topic in 
a paragraph, refer, when possible, in the closing sen- 
tence of a paragraph to the subject introduced in the 
opening, arrange paragraphs according to a well-con- 
sidered plan, review the main positions in the close, 
give digressions an evident relation to the main prop- 
osition. ...”1 
One other form of exercise is indispensable in devel- 
oping the organizing faculty: the making of outlines 
for compositions on given subjects, unaccompanied by 
either the acquisition process for the particular sub- 
jects considered or their expression in amplified form?

division, followed by subtopical notes.3 Care must

be exercised in the selection of subjects,! and they 
should be more truly subjects than the more limited 
titles which are often prescribed for finished composi- 
tions.? For instance, the subject of a class exercise 
may be “Vacation Experiences”’ and the titles of the 
several compositions quite dissimilar, as: “A Snake 
and a Stick,” “An August Afternoon,” “When the 
Golden-Rod Blossoms,”’ ete. 
(3) Expression is the final stage. This of course 
does not mean that, in the development of the pupil, 
all expression is postponed until he has mastered the 
arts of acquisition and organization, but that in the 
construction of any single composition, expression is 
the goal, with the other two exercises merely prelim- 
inaries in reaching it. In this stage the whole question

of style! comes to the front, and the detailed arrange- 
ment of words becomes the subject of careful and crit- 
ical study. 
All composition is verbal, but its expression may be 
either oral or written. From the pedagogic viewpoint 
I would make a further distinction by classifying all 
school composition exercises in expression as formal 
or informal. The formal exercise plans to produce a 
complete composition of some one of the four rhetor- 
ical forms. The informal exercise secks to strengthen 
expression in points of detail and has only incidental 
by-products, consisting of some unit less than a com- 
position whole. 
Under the informal phase there should be no rigid 
distinction between oral and written exercises. 
Teacher and pupils should not hesitate to go from 
one to the other in the most informal manner. Dur- 
ing an oral composition, for instance, the teacher may 
say: “John, you expressed that extremely well; see 
if you can write it as well as you talked.” John 
dashes it off quite informally while the rest of the

class proceed with their oral work. Conversely, dur- 
ing an informal written exercise. Under this head 
may be grouped a great variety of exercises, some of 
which are here enumerated. 
(1) Drills on correct grammatical forms, as, for in- 
stance, the correct use of prepositions, of personal 
and relative pronouns, of irregular verbs, the proper 
location of explanatory modifiers, correct syntax, 
substitution of language for the pupils’ “slanguage.” 
(2) Preparation for the formal composition involv- 
ing search for and discussion of subject matter, 
arrangement of topical outlines, reports of indi- 
viduals or committees assigned to research work. 
(3) Discussion and criticism of pupils’ formal com- 
positions. Samples of the best and worst—the latter, 
of course, incognito—may be read or written on the 
blackboard. 
(4) Reports on home reading, current events, per- 
sonal adventures, topics studied in geography, history, 
and the other subjects of the curriculum. 
(5) A series of pupils each talking to a single topical 
title of an outlined composition whole. 
(6) Very brief—five-minute or so—written compo- 
sitions, with no emphasis upon mechanical features, 
dealing with whole subjects or single paragraphs or 
topics, or reproducing stanzas of poetry or paragraphs 
of prose from memory or more immediate dictation. 
90

(7) Exercises in condensation, such as advertise- 
ments, “lost and found” items, the reporting of events 
and incidents in telegrams of a limited number of 
words. 
(8) Exercises in expansion, such as invention of de- 
tails of the story of “Jack and Jill,” “Old Mother 
Hubbard,” “The boy was Benjie; the bear was 
bulgy; the bulge was Benjie,” etc. 
(9) Speed exercises, in which pupils endeavor to 
report in writing as much as possible of a vivid narra- 
tive within a certain time limit. This is allied to the 
work of the newspaper reporter who strives, in the 
parlance of his trade, to “get a scoop.” 
Formal expression may be classified, somewhat 
arbitrarily, thus: 
Ox. { Declamation 
Debate

The declamation is the oral essay presented without 
thought of immediate rejoinder,! whereas the debate 
deliberately sets one declamation against another.

audience with corresponding modification in form

and substance, whereas the theme is addressed to a 
general and impersonal audience. Both kinds of 
formal expression require systematic cultivation, but 
the pedagogy of each differs. One large aim is com- 
mon to both: the development of facility in thought 
expression, or more specifically, the cultivation of 
proper habits as to logical arrangement, rhetorical 
style, and grammatical correctness. 
Another important aim, that of the development of 
facility in mechanical arrangement and accuracy, is 
present only in the written expression. Hence, in 
general, it may be laid down that in the criticism of 
written compositions only those matters of detail 
should be given attention which are unreachable in 
the oral composition. Detailed correction, in a 
written exercise, of errors in rhetoric and grammar, 
or even their indication, is inadvisable for many 
reasons, but chiefly because it tends to repression 
rather than to expression.!. The pupil to whom is 
returned his two-page effort in composition, com- 
pletely reticulated with colored cabalistic advertise- 
ment of his incompetency, is distinctly discouraged, 
and his next attempt will be cautiously abbreviated 
1 “Fluency must be sought for before correctness; or, in other 
words, the teacher must have freedom and spontaneity in view.”

to a single page. The pupil is in need of every 
possible encouragement to express himself freely and 
fearlessly. If deprived of ample opportunity to prac+ 
tice expression without fear of consequences, he will 
never develop any skill in composition. His errors 
in rhetoric and grammar should therefore be pointed 
out to him orally when they occur in his written ex- 
ercises, or referred to in written criticism in general 
terms only. The habit of making these errors must 
‘be deliberately and systematically overcome through 
the class exercises of informal character and his own 
formal oral compositions. 
The ability to write is certainly not more than half 
of what is sought in composition study, so that we 
are safe in limiting written exercises at most to half 
of the time allowed for the entire subject of compo- 
sition. Again, not more than half of the time allotted 
to written composition should be devoted to formal 
exercises.! That is to say,.one-fourth of the entire 
composition time should be the maximum limit set 
1 “In ordinary life oral language predominates over the writ- 
ten. So it should be in the language period. The oral expres- 
sion should precede and prepare the way for written work .. . 
writing involves all the difficulties of oral expression, with the 
added burden of spelling, punctuation, and manipulation of pen, 
ink, and paper.”

  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
for the writing of formal compositions. This results, 
under the usual programme, in one formal written 
‘composition about every two weeks. These exercises 
are both tests and drills. As tests they indicate the 
measure of success of the teaching of expression dur- 
ing the other three-fourths of the time, and conse- 
quently will afford a basis for subsequent teaching, 
showing what faults in rhetoric and grammar that 
teaching should especially aim to correct. As drills, 
they afford opportunity to train the pupil in the 
mechanics of written expression. 
It follows, then, that the problem in devising a 
scheme for the criticism of formal written composi- 
tions is how best to develop correct mechanics. The 
mechanical points introduced by the written compo- 
‘ sition are four: arrangement, spelling, capitalization, 
and punctuation. None of these has a place in oral 
expression; all four are unavoidable incidents to the 
formal written exercise. Arrangement (not to be 
confused with thought organization) applies to the 
proper adjustment of the written matter to the space 
at hand. Proper margins must be allowed at left 
and right of the page. In a theme, the title must be 
distinctly set apart from the subject matter; in a 
letter, the distinctive elements of address, subscrip- 
tion, etc., must occupy the conventional positions. 
The turning of the sheet from its obverse to its re- 
94  
-P-A-G-E-103
    "ENGLISH IN THE UPPER GRADES 
verse page must be in one direction or in another 
according to whether the collected sheets are to be 
bound at the top or at the side. Spelling, as it must 
be in a language so devoid of phonic consistency as is 
ours, is chiefly a matter of correct visualization and of 
effective training of the hand so that the writing of 
words correctly becomes for the most part submerged 
below the realm of conscious attention into that of 
automatic habit. Capitalization is but a phase of 
spelling with the distinction that it is particularly 
subject to the application of formal rules. Punctua- 
tion is to written expression what emphasis, pause, 
and gesture are to oral expression, and like these must 
be reduced to a subordinate position in the mind 
while it is engaged in conscious expression of thought. 
With these considerations in mind the following 
scheme for the review of formal written compositions 
is offered: 
1. All the pupils of the class are to write one such 
composition every fortnight. 
2. The teacher is to read critically one half of these 
compositions each time. Thus each pupil will have 
his exercise reviewed once in four weeks. 
3. The teacher will annotate each composition re- 
viewed as follows: 
a. Indicate all errors in mechanical arrangement 
by the simplest marking of the paper or a statement 
95  
-P-A-G-E-104
  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
thereon; e. g., if the margin is not properly provided, 
draw a line showing the correct bounding of the 
margin. If the title is not sufficiently indented, in- 
dicate its correct position by vertical boundary lines. 
b. Indicate each error in spelling by two crosses, 
one at the misspelled word and one in the margin on 
the same line. 
c. Indicate each error in capitalization by a cross 
at the word and by a sign in the margin on the same 
line, thus: C5, meaning that capitalization rule 5 has 
been violated. 
d. Indicate each error in punctuation by a cross at 
the place of error and a sign in the margin, thus: 
P12, meaning that punctuation rule 12 has been 
violated. 
e. Do not indicate or correct errors in grammar or 
rhetoric; but at the top of the sheet write a brief 
critical statement of the composition as a whole. 
4. No first-draft compositions are to be written 
at home. 
5. Every pupil who receives his composition re- 
viewed as above described is to rewrite it, preferably 
as a home exercise, correcting in the second draft 
all errors indicated on the first. In addition he will 
write correctly each misspelled word five times and 
every violated rule once, together with the incorrect 
sentence correctly written to show the application of 
96
-P-A-G-E-105
ENGLISH IN THE UPPER GRADES 
the rule. This written work is to be submitted to the 
teacher within a certain time limit at the option of 
the teacher. The half of the class whose compositions 
are not reviewed make no second draft. 
Corollaries to and explanations of these directions 
are: 
1. It is understood that the limitation of one per 
fortnight applies only to the formal written compo- 
sition. There will be frequent exercises of an in- 
formal character as already indicated. 
2. The reading of half of the total number is 
merely a minimum requirement. Naturally, if a 
teacher will read more, the returns will be commen- 
surate with the added labor. 
3. No errors are actually corrected; they are only 
indicated. 
a. Penmanship may be included under this head 
to the extent of noting general criticisms, such as 
“Penmanship is careless,” “Attend to slant in pen- 
manship,” “Avoid flourishes in penmanship,” etc. 
Too much attention must not be paid, however, to 
the penmanship of the first draft, for the mind of 
the pupil must be concentrated upon verbal expres- 
sion. More may be demanded in the second draft, 
for he is then relieved from the stress of composition. 
(b) The pupil is to discover for himself, by the use 
of the dictionary, the correct spelling. 
97 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY _ SCHOOL 
(c) and (d) The pupil is to discover what constitutes 
his error by applying the rule cited in capitalization 
and punctuation. 
(e) Errors in rhetoric and grammar are reachable 
in oral and in informal written exercises; hence their 
correction should be left in the main to those exercises. 
The pupil has sufficient difficulty in strengthening his 
habits of correct formal mechanics without introduc- 
ing these other matters of thought-expression into the 
sole exercise which involves the mechanics. The lan- 
guage of our most honored professional authors is open 
to the criticism of competent experts. Art perfection 
is wholly a matter of degree, as shown, for in- 
stance, in the comparative ability of the primary 
pupil and his teacher. There is no absolute in art. 
With the mechanics it is different. The modes of 
arrangement, spelling, and for the most part punc- 
tuation, are arbitrarily fixed. The professional nov- 
elist and the grammar-school pupil are at a level 
when it comes to spelling; they must both reduce the 
drudgery of spelling to a habit, and when they have 
fixed the habit they will both find themselves spelling 
the same words in the same way, however wide may 
be the chasm between their respective abilities as lit- 
erary artists. The pupil’s shortcomings in style may 
be safely left unremarked when he is under the strain 
of literary expression plus attention to mechanical 
98
-P-A-G-E-107
ENGLISH IN THE UPPER GRADES 
details. The teacher will by no means overlook these 
shortcomings, but will carefully note them and upon 
them build up his subsequent language teaching. He 
should, however, pass a definite general judgment upon 
each pupil’s effort considered apart from its mechan- 
ical merits. This judgment will find expression in 
brief statements at the head of the sheet such as: An 
interesting story; Very entertaining; Consult me about 
paragraph three; Where is the verb in paragraph two?; 
You have improved much in construction; A very 
clever invention. 
(4) There is much to be said against a pupil’s writ- 
ing a composition at home, as indeed there is against 
his preparing any written home work. At any rate, 
by having the original draft written in school the 
teacher has a guarantee of the authenticity of the 
pupil’s work and thus insures to all pupils the oppor- 
tunity for performing the school exercise under equally 
favorable environment. 
(5) There is less danger in letting pupils write second 
drafts at home, for this work is almost entirely me- 
chanical and involves no “composition.”” The rules 
laid down above as to the rewriting of misspelled 
words, etc., are quite arbitrary and may well be mod- 
ified to suit varying conditions. Correct spelling must 
become a matter of habit. In misspelling a word the 
pupil’s habit has followed in the wrong groove and in 
99
-P-A-G-E-108
PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
consequence has deepened that groove. To insure 
its following the proper path the next time there is 
occasion to write the same word, it is not sufficient 
that he become aware that he made the error, but it 
is further necessary that he deliberately send his men- 
tal and muscular rolling stock—to change the meta- 
phor slightly—over the proper track a number of 
times. What this number shall be, depends upon cir- 
cumstances and particularly upon the personal co- 
efficient of the individual pupil. If he is ordinarily a 
“good”? speller, five is perhaps more than is necessary, 
though it can certainly do him no harm; if he is a 
“wretched”’ speller, perhaps ten would be none too 
many. The slip in capitalization or punctuation is 
also a habit gone wrong. Something here must be 
done to focus the attention not upon the error but 
upon the error corrected. This may be done by writ- 
ing the violated rule, or by writing correctly the word 
miscapitalized or the sentence in which the punctua- 
tion error occurred, or by a combination of these two 
such as has been suggested above. To carry out this 
scheme of criticism, a set of rules for capitalization 
and punctuation must be agreed upon. Such will 
be found in every standard text in grammar. The 
rules should, however, be carefully graded, and all 
violations of rules not yet reached by pupils of any 
grade should be entirely disregarded.

In the formal oral composition the pupil is freed 
from consideration of mechanical points and hence 
may be more closely held to subject matter and 
expression. Declamations are of various sorts, chiefly 
according to the circumstances of their delivery. 
Among them are the oration, the speech, the lec- 
ture, the address, and the sermon. The pupil may 
be encouraged to regard his efforts as looking toward 
any of these. It must not be forgotten that he is in 
the elementary stage. His early declaiming will 
quite as closely resemble an oration as will his theme

the finished product of the mature essayist. He 
should make the same preliminary preparation in 
acquisition and organization as he does for the 
theme. He should learn to use the ordinary adjuncts 
in acquisition, such as notes, reference-books, statis- 
tical tables, reports, etc., and in organization, such 
as an outline of topics and subtopics. His progress 
in oral expression will be measured on the one hand 
by the increased ease and freedom from awkwardness 
with which he refers to these, and on the other hand 
~ by the degree to which he can free himself from their 
use. 
In the elementary school the debate should be used 
sparingly and probably only in the higher grades. 
Its chief value, in addition to the interest which it 
may be made to arouse, is in promoting a breadth of 
view and a spirit of toleration. It is better that a 
pupil should not be interrupted in the course of his 
formal oral composition. The class and the teacher 
should be alert to note faulty organization and errors 
in expression. These may then, after the pupil has 
concluded, be made the subject of frank and imper- 
sonal discussion. 
In addition to the two criteria which we have 
already seen must be applied in the classification of 
compositions, namely, those of rhetoric and of form 
of expression; the pedagogical factor necessitates yet 
108
-P-A-G-E-117
  ENGLISH IN THE UPPER GRADES 
another classification codrdinate with these. The 
pupil is led through various stages of dependence 
upon models. In one sense he never fully gets away 
from a model, but there is an ascending scale 
through which his originality functions. The teacher, 
therefore, is forced to recognize several degrees of 
originality and classifies the formal composition ac- 
cordingly. Lowest in the scale is the copy, either “ 
through eye or through ear, of the model, at which 
stage the pupil’s originality is at a minimum, practi- 
cally at zero. Next is reproduction, in which the 
pupil reproduces the model in thought but not in 
exact language. If he is deliberately abbreviating 
the model, he is producing an abstract; if deliber- 
ately amplifying it, an expansion or elaboration; if 
neither, a paraphrase. Imitation is the next higher 
stage, wherein style and general elements of form are 
reproduced without using the. same thought sub- 
stance. Recall is a form differing from reproduction 
in that the material used is supplied by memory and 
must be newly organized, and from imitation in that 
no model is employed. Research is the deliberate’ 
setting out for material, purposeful and specific 
acquisition, and differs from recall in that the latter 
is a search not in the present but in the past. 
Finally, when no model is used, and the raw material 
is the subject of neither recall nor research, but of

GRAMMAR 
It may be questioned whether the study of formal 
grammar should find any place in the curriculum of 
the elementary school, but there are few school sys- 
tems which have yet had the hardihood to banish it. 
Whatever may be the psychology of the matter, it 
is certain that the analysis of sentences and the pars- 
ing of words present considerable difficulty to the 
average pupil, and any device which makes for the 
simplification of the subject is helpful. 
The pupil must be led to see that analysis in 
grammar is merely a matter of descriptive classi- 
fication, and that in this it differs but little from 
our ordinary daily classification of common things. 
Before us stands a person; we observe him, analyze 
him, and make note of the results of our analysis. 
We do not always formally state this result, but if 
we did, it would be succinctly something like this: 
person, boy, red hair, freckles, dimpled chin, long 
arms, bow legs, etc., etc. When, instead of a person, 
there stands before us a word, we have to go through 
the same process, and state the result as before, 
thus: word, noun, collective, common gender, ob- 
jective case, etc. Now there may be no inaccuracies 
in the statement of the analysis either of the boy . 
or of the word, but the pupil must learn that as 
111 : 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
grammar is a science, there has long since been es- 
tablished a conventional form of analysis. 
When the government agent issues a passport, he 
has to enter upon his record a description of the 
person to whom it is issued. He might describe that 
person in a three-page essay, but that is not required 
of him. His government has already prescribed the 
form of his record, and it is left to him merely to 
enter the specific results of his analysis in their ap- 
propriate places. For instance, his record form may 
call for analysis of the person in respect to Sex, Age, 
Height, Weight, Complexion, Color of Eyes, etc., and 
his only duty is to make the entry in the blank space 
opposite each item. Moreover, if he were making an 
oral analysis of the person to, let us say, some other 
official who understood the form prescribed, he would 
not describe him by any such circumlocution as: 
Well, he is a boy; and he says he is twelve years 
old but he looks to be fifteen; he’s tall for his 
age, I should say five feet eight inches, and so on. 
Instead, he would give a mere summary of results 
in this fashion: Male, twelve, five-eight, blond, and 
so forth. 
In the same way certain conventional forms have 
been established for the analysis of sentences and 
words, and the pupil must be made to recognize this, 
so that his parsing of the word man, for example, is 
112
-P-A-G-E-121
  
ENGLISH IN THE UPPER GRADES 
not the discursive guesswork which we so frequently 
hear: Man is a, is a noun, it’s in the third person, 
masculine gender, it’s a common noun... . What 
should be required is a crisp catalogue of character- 
istics, thus: Man, noun, common, third, singular, 
masculine, nominative, subject of the verb threw. 
The pupil may understand that the order in which 
these characteristics is to be given is largely arbitrary, 
but it is no less binding upon him to conform with this 
conventional requirement. 
Hence when the pupil begins his work in formal 
analysis he should be provided with the conventional 
form which is to be used throughout all his subsequent 
study of grammar. He may have this form before 
him, just as the passport writer or any other cata- 
loguer has his list of required items before him. After 
a while we expect the pupil to reach the point where 
he is not dependent upon the form, that is, where he 
has learned the various items and the order in which 
they stand. This form is to be regarded as one of 
the pedagogic crutches, of which we have to use 
so many, and the general rule as to the use of crutches 
applies here. The crutch is for the lame only; just 
as soon as the lameness can be made to disappear, take 
away the crutch. Not to provide a crutch to the lame 
is cruelty ; to keep a sound person on crutches is absurd. 
Accurately to measure each pupil’s need of such

PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
a help is one of the characteristics of a superior 
teacher. 
This form may be provided the pupil as a printed 
sheet, or he may write it for himself on dictation at 
the beginning of the term, or, as a chart, it may be 
kept ready for display before the class. The form 
here given has proved satisfactory, and requires but 
little explanation. In following it, the pupil learns 
that he must first state whether the word or group of 
words which he is considering is a sentence, a phrase, 
or a word (grammatically speaking). He then, from 
each line in what follows, selects the particular designa- 
tion which describes the word or words which he is 
analyzing. The words in parenthesis are key words

HISTORY FACTS 
In discussing examinations in my book on “Man- 
agement,” I endeavored to draw very sharply the 
distinction between the testing of the memory and 
of the judgment. ‘Memory tests concern the prod- 
ucts of judging; Judgment tests concern the processes 
of judging.” Just as we must make this distinction 
in the testing of school work, so must we carry this 
distinction throughout the work itself, for, as I 
quoted from Bain, there are “the two different in- 
tellectual energies, called respectively, Memory and 
Judgment.” Much of our failure to secure what we 
eall “results” comes from failure to recognize this 
fundamental distinction. In all of the content 
studies we present a great variety of data, both facts 
and principles, with no expectation that the pupil 
will either remember or be able to recall any consider- 
able number of these data. 
To put it into mathematical terms, for the sake of 
clearer illustration, let it be assumed that in the 
teaching of an hour’s lesson in geography, one hun- 
118
-P-A-G-E-127
  HISTORY FACTS 
dred distinct facts have been presented. At the 
close of the hour the number of these facts that have 
been absorbed by the different pupils of the class will 
vary toa large degree. The phlegmatic A has caught 
and held five of these; the nervously attentive B, 
twenty; C, who has given but indifferent attention, 
ten; and so on throughout the class. Now while this 
variation in acquisition is to be expected and cannot 
be prevented, we are at least responsible to see that 
five of the facts that A and B and C each get are five 
of the important ones and not five lacking in vital 
significance. The greatest common divisor of the 
numbers of facts each pupil acquired should consist 
of the most significant and important of the hundred 
facts presented. That is, although our lesson, through 
pedagogic considerations, has included the presenta- 
tion of a host of data, there is a small selection of these 
which it is really important that the pupil should re- 
member. All of the data are in a sense important, 
yet this selected group is necessary to him, and so it 
is our duty to compel him to get this group, what- 
ever becomes of the rest of the material. 
For example, if the pupil remembers some incident 
which befell Captain Peary on his trip to the Pole, 
enlivening and interesting and true as that incident 
may be, and fails to learn and carry with him the fact 
that it was the North Pole and not the South Pole 
119
-P-A-G-E-128
  
PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
which he visited, the pupil cannot be credited with 
having “learned his lesson.” Again, the apochryphal 
narrative concerning the Father of his Country and 
the mischievous hatchet may serve to add zest and 
background to the study of Washington, but if the 
child recalls this and remains ignorant of the fact that 
Washington was the first President of the United 
States, the history lesson has not been a true success. 
But this is just what is likely to happen unless the 
Aeacher takes special precautions. Each lesson must 
v be thoroughly clinched after the facts have been driven 
home. It is not sufficient to trust to luck that the 
pupil is retaining the essentials of a lesson, or that he 
is carrying the essentials of any subject through its 
successive lessons. 
It has been found practicable in managing a school 
to provide a schedule of important facts in certain 
subjects, notably history, which shall serve as the 
skeleton upon which the pupil shall hang all his study 
of the subject. The memorizing of any one of these 
facts is never to precede the presentation by the 
teacher and the consideration by the pupil of all the 
material surrounding this fact. There is a serious 
danger, however, that without final concentration of 
the attention upon the essential points of history, 
the chronological perspective will be lost. The fol- 
lowing sets of facts, one in American, and the other 
120
-P-A-G-E-129
HISTORY FACTS 
in English history, have proven satisfactory. The 
facts are memorized in the grades indicated, and are 
constantly reviewed in the succeeding grades. By 
this means each pupil has always at hand an appro- 
priate background against which he may put, in its 
proper place, whatever comes to him in his study of 
history, his general reading, or his discussion of cur- 
rent topics.

THE FUNDAMENTAL OPERATIONS 
Tue distinction between Judgment and Memo: 
holds as well for the formal studies as for the conten 
studies. In fact, there is even greater necessity tha 
a substantial fund of memorized judgments shall b 
accumulated in the study of arithmetic, for instance 
than for history or geography. The elementary jud, 
ments of arithmetic, once memorized, must be sub 
ject to a recall so immediate as to merge into habii 
When the pupil has once acquired the concepts of th 
symbols 9 and 8, and their product 72, his further e: 
fort is to be concentrated upon fastening these sym 
bols in this relationship, so that to the presence o 
8X9, his mind may instantly react with the though 
72. The teaching of the fact that 8 times 9 is 72 wi 
require an appeal to the pupil’s judging faculty; bu 
this once accomplished, it will be a decided detrimen 
to the pupil if, on future occasions calling for the mul] 
tiplication of 8 by 9, he is obliged to retravel th

judging process. The intrusion of the. judging atti-’ 
tude while he is multiplying is a distinct embarrass- 
ment, and the more completely habit controls the 
process the better equipped is he for doing such work. 
The appeal to the reasoning power of the child con- 
stitutes a very large duty in our work in arithmetic, 
but we are not justified in pursuing this phase at the 
lexpense of the development of effective, habitual re- 
actions in performing the fundamental operations. 
We need then to employ every device available which 
will help to reduce these reactions to the state of au- 
itomatism. 
We are all familiar with the use of the drill cards 
fin number work. I have found, however, that) fol- 
lowing the emphasis placed upon the multiplication 
table in the early school years, there is a marked weak- 
ness in the ability of the pupils to add and subtract 
hen they reach the higher grades.! How to reach this 
ifficulty has been a problem, and a partial solution 
as been found in the scheme which I here describe. 
e have already had occasion to refer (see page 49) 
o Dr. Bagley’s statement of the law of habit build-

the old law that attention and drill are reciprocal, 2— 
that the greater the attention the less the amount 
of drill required to secure a given result, and con- 
versely. Moreover, the law is equally old and reliable 
which tells us that attention is largely dependent 
upon interest; so that the pedagogic prescription is~ 
interest the pupil and he will attend; if he attends, 
he will acquire. 
Our problem then is not only to devise a drill in the 
fundamental operations which shall be a proper one, 
but so to conduct it, by the creation of a moving in- 
terest, that no loss shall accrue from lagging atten- 
tion. For this drill we use sight cards of the usual »- 
type; for the interest we use a stop watch or, if a stop 
watch is not available, any ordinary watch with a sec- 
ond hand. 
Both in addition and subtraction, those combina- 
tions which involve “carrying” of the units place 
are most troublesome. There are comparatively 
few errors made in such combinations as 52+3, 
65+4, 48—3,etc. In addition, the carrying combi- 
  
This was at an average speed of 7 minutes, 22 seconds, for all 
100 combinations. It will be noted that all the combinations in 
addition and subtraction involve carrying. As the experienced 
teacher might have prophesied, the greatest number of failures 
in multiplication and division were on 12 X Oand 0 + 12, point- 
ing to the need for special drill on these particular combinations,

and so on, made up of one hundred combinations, plus 
and minus, selected diagonally from among the total. 
Series IT consists of the next diagonal selection, and 
so on. 
These cards, used all of one series each day, are 
divided into two fifties, one fifty to be shown, one by 
one, to the class, and the other fifty to be dictated. 
Pupils state the result of the combinations in order, 
each pupil one, around the class as many times as 
required. In case of failure, the card is put aside for 
special drill, and the next pupil given the next com- 
bination. The number of errors made is noted, and 
also the elapsed time for the entire exercise of one 
hundred cards. 
To give the necessary stimulating interest, the 
elapsed time is regarded as a score and the class is 
urged to reduce its own record or to defeat the score 
of another class of the same grade. In a small school 
where there is but a single class in a grade, the class 
may be divided into two competing groups. 
It is clear that as a means of comparison between 
two classes or groups, neither the time alone nor the 
percentage of correct answers can be regarded as a 
just basis. One class might go through the exercise 
in five minutes, and another in three minutes; but 
the speed of the second might be due to carelessness 
in answering. On the other hand, one class scoring 95 
138
-P-A-G-E-147
  SOME DEVICES IN ARITHMETIC 
per cent of correct answers as against the 80 per 
cent of another class, might owe its success to the 
extra amount of time consumed. It is necessary then 
| to combine these two factors of speed and accuracy 
into a single “score.” To do this, we divide the 
speed, expressed as a whole number of seconds, by the 
degree of accuracy expressed asa decimal. For exam- 
ple, if the class takes 6 minutes 14 seconds for the 
exercise and has .91 of correct answers, 374+ .91= 
411, and 411 is the “score” for the class. An increase 
both of speed and accuracy will of course reduce this 
score; for instance, 94 correct cards in 5 minutes 49 
seconds, 349+.94=371. A bettering of either fac- 
tor, the other remaining constant, will decrease the 
score; for instance, 91 cards in 5 minutes 49 seconds, 
349 +.91=383; and 94 cards in 6 minutes 14 seconds 
=398. A bettering of one factor alone, may or may 
not reduce the score; for instance, 90 cards in 4 min- 
utes 30 seconds, and 80 cards in 4 minutes, each give 
a score of 300 (270+.90=300 =240+-80). The score 
is always kept in whole numbers, a fraction being dis- 
carded or carried to the next unit, according to 
whether it is less than one half, or equals or exceeds it. 
Pupils answer while sitting, thus saving the time 
otherwise consumed by rising. Pupils are given one 
chance only on each card; that is, no credit is allowed 
a pupil giving a wrong answer and then correcting 
139

himself. In dictating questions the teacher varies 
the form, thus: 17 subtract 9, 23 less 8, 83 take away 
7, had 73 lost 9; 65 and 9, 26 add 8, 45 plus 7, ete. 
In our playrooms we keep bulletin boards showing 
the best score to date, by grades, crediting the class 
in the grade which holds the record. 
Teachers are directed to have this exercise daily, 
and they record the score on the blackboard, making 
a special note each time a record is broken. This 
score, however, is not accepted as official as a com- 
parative guide between classes. For the official score 
the principal visits the room and, while the teacher 
conducts the exercise, keeps the record of accuracy, 
notes the time, and calculates the score. His atti- 
tude toward the work of the class, one of encourage- 
ment or criticism, according to the quality of their 
performance, makes for improvement. The first 
scores which we made after instituting this system 
were, for classes of the grades indicated: 
8B 378 +273 365 
8A 442 480 437

After one year, the best scores, for each grade, were:

6A 331 553 
5B 338 421 
5A 422 570 
4B 425 683 
This shows a present average best score of 339 as 
against 424 the year previous, or a general gain of 
twenty per cent. It is of incidental interest to 
note that the score for the cards by sight is almost 
invariably less than that for those by hearing. In 
many cases I have timed each fifty cards separately 
and thus obtained independent scores. These average 
to the effect that the sight cards take but forty-one 
per cent of the gross time, and the hearing cards 
the other fifty-nine per cent. 
That pupils could be trained to improvement in 
this work was to be expected, and the fact that they 
did so improve is perhaps not a sufficient justification 
for the device, which, after all, is but a device and 
is not to be mistaken for an end in and of itself. To 
express general improvement in mathematical terms 
141 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
is not always possible, nor is it always the most tell- 
ing expression. However, I questioned all teachers 
who had been using this method for a year, as fol- 
lows: 
1. Is there an appreciable improvement in pupils’ 
accuracy in their computations in oral and written 
mathematics? If so, roughly speaking, what per cent 
of gain has been made? 
2. Have these drills had any effect upon the aver- 
age ability of pupils to reason in mathematics, 
whether to improve or to impair that ability? 
3. Do you note any other advantages which have 
accrued from these drills? 
4. When you introduced Series II, what was the 
effect upon the results in Series I? If possible, give 
answer in mathematical terms, e. g., the class could do 
Series I in about 300; by the time they were able to 
do Series II in 300, they had fallen back to 320 for 
Series I. 
5. What modifications of the method do you sug- 
gest? 
The answers to the first question ranged from zero 
to sixty per cent. One teacher reported “no appreci- 
able improvement”’; another, “slight”’; another, “not 
much.” All others reported gains of five per cent 
or more, and the average was 14.6 per cent. That 
is, roughly speaking, the drills have bettered the 
142
-P-A-G-E-151
  
SOME DEVICES IN ARITHMETIC 
accuracy of pupils’ work by fifteen per cent, which 
we consider worth while. 
The general answer to the second question was 
“no effect.” There were a few exceptions, how- 
ever. One says, “ Pupils’ ability to reason is im- 
proved through raising the ideal of speed and ac- 
curacy.” 
Among the “other advantages” accruing from the 
drills, several speak of the increase in the power of 
sustained attention; others, of the contribution to a 
good class spirit; and others, of the value of the 
emphasis placed upon addition and subtraction as 
compared with the other processes. 
Only six out of thirty-four were able to reply in 
mathematical terms to the fourth question. Their es- 
timates would average to this statement: “The class 
could do Series I in about 292; by the time they were 
able to do Series II in 292, they had fallen back to 
324 for Series I. 
Various replies were received to the fifth question, 
but none seemed important. 
Another measure of the improvement effected was 
found in the repetition of the test referred to on 
page 133. One year after that test was made, the 
identical combinations were given to the classes of 
the same grade. Although the number of classes in 
each grade had changed some, it so happened that 
143 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
the total number of classes was the same, 34. The 
comparative results were:

ee ere eae 78.0 81.4 
Dubtraction...2...-........ 57.2 75.6 
ION 5 6 ah sb 80.2 84.9 
This shows a very substantial gain in the subtraction 
work, which had been extremely weak before. The 
multiplication shows a slight falling off and the divi- 
sion is at a standstill, due, perhaps, to the emphasis 
which had been placed upon the other two opera- 
tions. 
The net gain of 4.7 per cent does not fairly ex- 
press the improvement, in that it does not take 
account of the time factor. The 80.2 per cent was 
obtained at an average speed of 442 seconds, while 
the 84.9 per cent was at an average of 323 seconds. 
Equating these two factors, the comparative figures 
for the two tests are 551 and 380, showing a reduc- 
tion in the time-accuracy score of 31 per cent.

  SOME DEVICES IN ARITHMETIC 
A SPECIAL EXERCISE IN FUNDAMENTAL 
OPERATIONS 
One of the exercises frequently employed for the 
development of the power of rapid calculation con- 
sists in the performing of a series of operations dic- 
tated by the teacher. For example: 8, multiply by 
4, add 18, divide by 5, subtract 7, multiply by 15, 
subtract 12, divide by 11; answer =? A special in- 
terest may be injected into such an exercise if the 
teacher occasionally permits each pupil to select his 
own starting number, and then, miraculously to the 
class, brings them all to the same correct result. 
To do this, of course it is necessary for the teacher 
to follow the operations in general terms, that is, by 
algebra, while the pupils are working in terms of arith- 
metic; and the secret of the uniform results lies in 
eliminating the special number selected at some time 
before the operations are completed. For instance: 
Select a number, add 5, multiply by 4, subtract 12, 
divide by 4, subtract the number selected; answer =? 
One pupil selects 4, another 5, another 8, another 15, 
and so on, without announcing beforehand what his

MULTIPLICATION DRILL CHART 
The multiplication table, for all numbers from zero 
to twelve, involves 169 permutations or 91 combina- 
tions. For use in drill work these combinations may 
be written each upon a separate card, but in place of 
this, or to supplement this, a drill chart may be easily 
constructed. 
This device consists of two discs, in appropriate 
frame, on each of which is written the set of numbers,

that the plus sign is used, making the chart available 
for a certain amount of addition drill. 
This chart may easily be made by using the follow- 
ing diagrams, drawn to scale, as patterns. Three 
pieces of cardboard, each 22” by 11”, are required. 
From these, five parts are cut out, two according to 
pattern A, one according to pattern B, and two accord-

A number of methods of demonstrating the formula 
for the area of the trapezoid are available. Two are

AB and cut along the fold. Replace the upper por- 
tion along the side of the lower, as in Fig. 1. 
This gives a parallelogram, whose base is BASE

area of the parallelogram, which is that of the equiva- 
lent trapezoid, is: 
ALTITUDE (BASE + TOP) X ——~——

Either of these two figures may be cut out of thin 
wood in two pieces hinged at F, making a model which 
forces clearly upon the mind of the pupil the equiva- 
lence of the original trapezoid and the resulting rec- 
tangle or triangle. The triangle method has the advan- 
tage of not disturbing the notion of the aLtrrupE, 
which remains the same in both trapezoid and tri- 
angle. The method of passing a line through F paral- 
lel to AD and fitting the resulting triangle on to the 
upper half presents the difficulty of the average be- 
tween BASE and TOP.

LONGITUDE AND TIME 
This subject is perhaps one of the most difficult to 
grasp of any of the grammar-grade topics. The fol- 
lowing outlines an order of presentation which has 
been found to give good results: Using the globe, re- 
view latitude and longitude, meridians and prime 
meridians, the revolution of the earth, the direction 
of this revolution from west to east, the consequent 
“rising” of the sun in the east, and the apparent mo- 
tion of the sun from east to west. The first appear- 
ance of the sun at any place is called “‘sunrise’’ for 
that place. As the sun travels westward, easterly 
places have sunrise before westerly places. Hence, 
when it is sunrise at a westerly point, it is after sun- 
rise at an easterly point. Similarly develop: When it 
is sunset at a westerly point, it is after or later than sun- 
set at an easterly point; when the sun is directly over- 
head, or on the meridian of, a westerly point, it is past 
the meridian of an easterly point, i. e., when it is noon 
at a westerly point, it is after noon at an easterly point; 
when it is 4 P.M. at any point, it is after 4 P.M. at any 
point east of it; when it is 7 a.m. at any point, it is 
after or later than 7 a.m. at any easterly point; when it 
is 5 P.M. at any point, it is earlier than 5 P.M. at any 
westerly point; and finally, at any given moment 
easterly places have later time and westerly places have 
156 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
SOME DEVICES IN ARITHMETIC 
earlier time. This fact of difference of time and of 
earlier and later time, dependent upon longitude, 
having been established (and this point might well 
mark the end of the first lesson), it remains to consider 
the exact relation between the difference of time and 
the difference of longitude. 
From noon to noon for any given place, the sun has 
traveled 360° of longitude, but from noon to noon for 
any given place is a cycle of twenty-four hours of time. 
Hence the rate of the sun’s traveling is 360° in twenty- 
four hours, or 15° in one hour. 
On the blackboard build up this diagram: 
  Use this diagram as the basis of a large number and 
variety of oral questions. The solutions should be

that the following questions have been asked:

THE USE OF THE BLACKBOARD 
Up to a few years ago any essay concerning the 
school blackboard could refer only to a narrow panel of 
inferior slate or painted wood or perhaps a single easel 
of slated surface. To-day the graded school is every- 
where equipped with a comparatively large amount 
of blackboard space, and every effort is made by pro- 
gressive superintendents of school buildings to insist 
upon a quality of surface which shall contribute most 
satisfactorily to the work of the school. 
In the meantime the blackboard has become one of 
the recognized implements in the teacher’s tool chest, 
and the use of the blackboard has become one of the 
most important features in the technique of teaching. 
It is unfortunately true that many a teacher falls 
short of realizing the full value of the blackboard as an 
essential element in the teaching process. I recently 
visited one teacher, for instance, who had covered her 
blackboard for a space of eight running feet with a 
denham background upon which were hung samples of 
161
-P-A-G-E-170
  
PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
pupil’s written work, the while certain spaces of bare 
wall remained undecorated. It is not that such a 
teacher would surrender the blackboard altogether or 
that such a teacher does not make a certain profitable 
use of the board, but rather that she fails amply to 
comprehend its tremendous pedagogic value. 
y There are many teachers who give little attention 
to the psychology of sense-impression. This is true 
even in the appeal to the sense of hearing. “Use of 
voice”’ means to the average teacher only that he shall 
not raise his voice, shall not rant, in short, shall not 
develop what is popularly known as the “school- 
teacher’s voice.” It does not occur to him deliberate- 
ly to train his voice and perfect his control of it for 
pedagogic purposes. He may recognize the necessity 
of mastering the “five formal steps” in presentation, 
but not that of mastering his voice, the chief instru- 
ment through which he presents the ‘‘steps’’ whether 
formal or informal. 
Mere sympathy for the child who must listen to the 
same voice for the greater part of the school day 
should impel every teacher so to train his voice that 
it shall be relieved as far as possible of monotony. He 
should practice variety of modulation out of mere pity 
for his auditors, if for nothing more. Every adult re- 
calls some hour-long lecture to which he has been 
subjected with nothing left of recollection but a sense 
162 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
  THE USE OF THE BLACKBOARD 
of pain, due to the speaker’s failure to use his voice to 
advantage. 
But variation in voice, necessary as it is, is not all 
that is demanded of the teacher. The professional 
teacher will study the individual qualities of his own 
voice, and so master its tone and timbre that he can 
make it do his will. As he wills, in turn, to command, 
to reprimand, to soothe, to stimulate, to attract, to 
distract, his voice does his bidding and his pupils are 
controlled at a minimum of strain. Not only this, 
but teaching is an art and shares with other arts the 
dictum that the best art conceals art. Just as the 
painting must not betray the painter’s struggle to 
master the mechanics of his art, just as the poem 
must bear no trace of the poet’s efforts to acquire the 
technique of verbal construction, just as the violinist 
swaying his audience by the overpowering beauty of 
his performance must inject no hint of the years of 
toil spent in formal exercises, so in the teacher’s art 
there must intrude no indication of the strain of prep- 
aration. 
The wise teacher realizes that in that part of his 
work which consists in “impression”’ of his pupils, he 
is guilty of waste when he continues to impress them 
through the single sense of hearing. The skillful 
teacher instinctively teaches “chalk in hand,” and 
loses no legitimate opportunity to supplement his 
163 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
appeal to the pupils’ hearing with a contemporaneous 
appeal to their sense of sight. We appreciate the 
popularity of that form of entertainment known as 
a “chalk talk’? wherein a lecturer sketches a pic- 
ture while he maintains a running monologue on the 
subject of the picture and things in general. The 
teacher is not, of course, to aim to become a vaude- 
ville artist, but it is certainly not out of place for him 
to learn from such a performer whatever he may of 
the psychology of attention. 
The children, while listening to the teacher, are 
bound to look at something. If the ear alone is to be 
appealed to, why not require the pupils to close their 
eyes while listening. Concentration of attention im- 
plies the exclusion of contrary attractions. The full 
beauty of a symphony is best to be sensed by closing 
the eyes and surrendering the whole field of attention 
to the sense of hearing. Every sensation of touch, or 
taste, or smell, unless it might happen to illustrate 
the theme of the music, is a distinct distraction, and 
should be avoided if possible. So in the classroom, 
if the teacher’s appeal to the pupils’ attention is to 
be made solely through the gateway of the ear, all 
other gateways should be barred and bolted. But if 
the attention, instead of being distracted, can, on the 
contrary, be augmented through the play of the other 
senses, then good pedagogy demands that those other 
164 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
THE USE OF THE BLACKBOARD 
senses should be used, and used freely and intelli- 
gently. 
The sense which, in the classroom, is the most valu- _ 
able as supplementing that of hearing is of course 
that of sight. The whole personality of the teacher 
forms a sight impression which may make or mar a 
lesson. His attitude, his posture, his gestures, his ~ 
facial animation—all are elements which contribute 
toward attracting, distracting, or repelling the class. 
That is, the teacher’s personal presence may attract 
attention directly to the subject, reinforcing it and 
welding its materials; or it may distract attention 
from the subject-matter to the speaker himself and 
his idiosyncrasies; or it may repel attention, through 
its very colorlessness, from both the subject-matter 
and the teacher. He will therefore study to make 
his personality a positive force contributing to his 
pedagogic method and not subtracting from it or 
negativing it. 
With chalk in hand, the teacher is doubly armed 
in his assault upon the citadel of attention. For 
example, each verbal stroke of emphasis has its ac- 
companiment in the written stroke. The strange 
word to which the tongue can give but a partial intro- 
duction, is simultaneously written on the blackboard, 
not as a stilted exercise, but as a natural incident 
causing no appreciable extra expenditure of time. 
165 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
Above all, no formal recognition is to be made of this 
extra appeal to attention. The teacher will not say, 
“this is the way that word is spelled,” “be sure you 
learn how to spell this word,” or any equivalent of 
“watch me while I write this word.’ This would be 
as inartistic as for him to say, “did you notice that 
when I spoke the word ‘flit,’ I gesticulated thus?” 
There is, too, an incidental gain that is not to be under- 
valued. The use of the blackboard in this and similar 
ways is one more evidence of the teacher’s aliveness 
to his subject. Interest begets interest. Enthusiasm 
is contagious. The listless teacher cannot condemn 
his class for inattention. The intelligently alert 
y teacher cannot help carrying his class with him, and 
the use of the blackboard is one of the tangible evi- 
dences of his alertness. 
If all this holds good for the impression which the 
teacher aims to make upon a class, it is equally valid 
when it is the pupil and not the teacher who is talk- 
ing. The teacher’s use of the blackboard must be 
patently free and unrestrained, and the pupils should 
be trained toward a like freedom and facility. It will 
not come except by patient effort and encouragement, 
but it can be gained to a varying degree by every 
pupil. Weare only just beginning to make reasonable 
use of the social value of the class. The recitation is 
no longer addressed solely to the teacher, but also to 
166
-P-A-G-E-175
THE USE OF THE BLACKBOARD 
the class or the individual interlocutor in the class. 
The pupil must be led to feel that the nearest panel 
of blackboard is his whenever he needs it to illustrate 
a point in his recitation, and he should be trained to 
turn to it instinctively whenever he can use it to 
advantage. 
We are fast learning that all impression and no ex- 
pression makes Jack a dull boy, and yet for many rea- 
sons teachers find it difficult to yield the floor to the 
pupils. For one reason, the tradition is a strong one 
that defines a recitation as the stating of a direct ques- 
tion by the teacher and its answer by the pupils. For 4 
another, under the pressure of the time schedule, the 
teacher feels hurried and believes that valuable time 
is lost when the class does much of the talking. So we 
find many teachers doing for the pupils what they 
should be doing for themselves. 
As one goes through the classrooms of a school, he 
is rightly suspicious of a teacher’s method if he inva-~ 
riably finds the blackboard immaculately clean or bar-. 
ren of pupils’ work. It would seem a fair test to ask 
how many pupils of a class at the close of a day have 
not done some work at the blackboard, and the pro- 
portion of such pupils ought to be very small. In 
much of the class work it is economy for some one to 
act as secretary for the class and carry on at the board 
the exercise which belongs to the class as a whole. It 
167  
-P-A-G-E-176
  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
is also true that the teacher is best qualified to act as 
secretary, but it may often be questioned whether it 
is wise for him to do so. The little longer which it 
takes for the pupil to do the same work is probably 
repaid in gain to the particular pupil and in class in- 
terest. 
The use which the teacher will make of the black- 
board will vary somewhat with the grade of the class. 
The lower the grade the greater the necessity for the 
_ teacher’s exercising great care in her board writing. 
The teacher’s work is always a model to the pupils, but 
most so in the lowest grades. 
It may be a question to be settled on its own merits 
as to whether words should ever be printed on the 
board, but it is certain that, if so, they should be prop- 
erly printed. It is not uncommon to find such exam- 
ples of lettering as: 
nm 308" 4 se 
Instead of letters indiscriminately embellished with 
curlycues such as these, a simple font should be used, 
one which is consistently free from extra and mean- 
ingless marks. It is true that book print uses a font of 
type in which there is shading and elaborate complex- 
ity of line, but it is impossible for the teacher to copy 
this and so he should frankly not attempt to. For 
168
-P-A-G-E-177
THE USE OF THE BLACKBOARD 
instance the letter h. No teacher could in less than 
five minutes make a letter on the board which would 
faithfully reproduce this form: I; she can how- 
ever easily make the form A her model and sketch 
quite rapidly such a font as : 
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz 
In the lower grades a certain amount of black- 
board decoration is permissible, provided that it is 
really decorative and not grotesque; but it must 
be kept in mind that decoration is the least prof- 
itable use to which the board can be put. Allied 
to this is the use of the board for lists of names of 
merit with stars or flags to indicate degrees of excel- 
lence, all of which may be more or less legitimately 
effective in the middle grades, but which should dis- 
appear, as less artificial incentives operate to control 
pupils. 
Few permanent entries should be made on the board. 
Certain records, the day’s register and attendance of 
pupils, for instance, may be kept there, but the largest 
possible space should be reserved for everyday use. 
Tables or tabular forms may be reserved for a few 
days at a time, such as an outline for geographical 
study, thus:

3. Coast line 6. Climate 10. Government 
7. Resources 
The chief advantage of using the blackboard for this 
is that as fast as the pupils become adept in its use in 
part, that part may be erased until the outline event- 
ually disappears. But if it is to be kept intact for any 
length of time, it would be better to print it on paper 
in chart form and thus release the board space for 
other purposes. 
~7 One of the pedagogic means commonly neglected 
is the use of colored chalk. In advocating its liberal 
use I would not be understood as recommending its 
display merely that there may be a touch of color on 
the board. To write one sentence in red, the next in 
white, and the next in blue, would be inane. But 
just as the skillful teacher uses the blackboard with a 
definite purpose, knowing exactly what part in his 
art of teaching each stroke contributes, so will he 
deliberately and purposefully substitute some color 
for white wherever his method will gain thereby. 
Much of the time of the teacher is spent in developing 
in his pupils the power of voluntary attention, and 
yet there is frequent opportunity for the legitimate 
170

THE USE OF THE BLACKBOARD 
use of involuntary attention. In the course of a 
presentation lesson, when it would be a distinct loss 
to interrupt the trend of thought to secure volitional 
attention from the wavering few who are found in 
every class, a stroke of color may very often be made 
the means of compelling attention.' By way of 
illustration: 
1. There is an appropriateness in the use of certain 
colors for specific illustrations. For instance, the 
month’s calendar may be drawn on the board, with 
spaces reserved for a daily entry as to the weather. 
It is appropriate that sunshine should be expressed 
by a yellow sun, and rain by a colored, rather than a 
white, umbrella. 
2. Emphasis that is made in speech by accent may 
be made in board writing by colored words or under- 
lining. For instance, 
Washington was inaugurated first President 
of the United States in 1759, 
makes a more successful appeal than 
Washington was inaugurated first President 
of the United States in 1789, 
and sepvrate is better than separate.

3. The distinction between a law and its application 
may profitably be made by variety of color.

may represent the formula, and the application is 
then made directly, thus: 
Bee! Oi

4. Similarly as to the distinction between original 
work and corrections, as in composition or any subject 
where there can be a variety of opinion as to correct 
form. John may write a sentence as he thinks it 
should be. James makes his alterations in red. 
Harry follows and amends in green, and so on, and 
confusion as to authorship is avoided. 
5. Similarly as to the distinction between work and 
its illustration. This is frequently necessary in mathe- 
matical operations. For example, when first-year 
172

THE USE OF THE BLACKBOARD 
pupils are learning the simplest combinations, the 
child writes, 
{+ e+ = S&S 
He is having some difficulty with both the content 
and the form. In aiding him as to content, the 
teacher must be careful not to puzzle him as to form. 
She may aim to help him by writing above the figures, 
thus: 
o C20°O COSA 
ae ee eS 
Now she may call these circles oranges, and she may 
easily think of them as oranges; yet there is danger 
that the child will see in them something too much 
like the zeros to which he is also being introduced. 
The use of orange-colored chalk for the oranges elimi- 
nates this danger. The same criticism would not 
apply to the sketching in white of characteristic forms 
which could not be confused with numbers, as 
CO S&S CE Ciorapples, or fh fF’ F’ for flags, 
or SO & o& for cherries, or fy 4 hh 
for chairs, etc., and yet even these might profitably 
be done in appropriate color—it would certainly take 
no longer to do so, and there are then distinct im- 
pressions made by the numerical symbols and by the 
illustrative pictures.

by the use of color. For example, in diagramming in

7. Unseen lines in an illustration may best be indi- 
cated in color. For instance, this figure 
may represent a rectangular prism in either of two 
positions, but the ambiguity is eliminated thus: 
The illustrations which have been given are neces- 
sarily but few, and are merely suggestive, but they 
hint at the constant employment which may be made 
of the simple expedient of color. Not alone the pen 
is mighty ; a fragment of chalk in the hand of a skillful 
teacher may illumine the mind of the pupil as can 
nothing else.

THE SCHOOL MUSEUM 
Every alert teacher appreciates the value of ob- 
jective illustration as a factor in teaching method, and 
in consequence will gradually accumulate such mate- 
rial as experience proves appropriate to the work at 
hand.! The principle of codperation yields as marked 
a beneficial return when applied to the establishment 
of this sort of equipment as it does in any other de- 
partment of school management. 
  
1 “In France, one finds a musée scolaire, or school museum, 
in almost every school, and this is often of great assistance in 
the object lessons. The teacher encourages the children to bring 
here things that have any unusual interest, and they often take 
great pride in their botanical or natural-history collection, neces- 
sarily small, but none the less valuable from an educational 
point of view.” 
—Frederic Ernest Farrington: “The Public Primary School 
System of France,” Teachers College, Columbia University, 
1906, p. 88. 
I am glad to acknowledge the source of my own inspiration 
along this line, namely, the Sixth Burgher School, in Leipzig, 
which Dr. Klemm, in his “European Schools” (p. 282), calls 
“the best equipped in the world.”

  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
When a school museum is established upon this 
basis it is clear that its aim should be to provide such 
material as will be of practical use to the teachers in 
{ their daily work. The display idea should be elimi- 
nated; the museum should be regarded as a depository 
of material rather than a collection for exhibit. Other- 
wise the museum is likely to degenerate into a mere 
showroom, quite meaningless and of little practical 
value. 
My own experiment with the school museum has 
convinced me that the time devoted to it has been 
eminently worth while. I began ten years since by 
donating a number of specimens of my own gathering. 
The collection aggregated about six shelffuls in an 
ordinary cabinet in the principal’s office. To-day the 
museum occupies one hundred thirty shelves in a room 
seventeen by twenty-five feet devoted exclusively to 
this purpose. The growth has been gradual and un- 
forced. The teachers of the school have supported a 
museum fund by contributing ten cents each per 
month. This contribution represents less than the 
amount which each teacher would probably expend 
on illustrative material if there were no codperative 
scheme. This fund is drawn upon to meet all expenses 
of the museum, which are of three kinds: cataloguing, 
preparing specimens, and purchasing material. 
Our catalogue, of which four editions, with inter- 
178
-P-A-G-E-187
  
THE SCHOOL MUSEUM 
mediate supplements, have been issued in ten years, 
consists in the present edition of twenty-four pages, 
and costs us about twenty dollars for three hundred 
copies. We are also under expense for mailing a small 
number of catalogues to school authorities and others 
interested in the work and to people whose interest 
might result in their donating specimens. These cat- 
alogues are accompanied by an explanatory statement 
as follows: 
This little catalogue is sent in the hope that it may 
interest you in our School Museum. We desire to em- 
phasize the fact that the teachers make daily use of the 
collections, reénforcing, by illustration, their work in 
nature, reading, geography, history, ete. Many de- 
partments are as yet unrepresented. Material of any 
kind would be acceptable—perhaps you will help us. 
The preparation of specimens takes various forms. 
We receive birds and other small animals which have 
just been killed, and these we send to the taxidermist 
for mounting. We receive second-hand specimens 
which require a little repairing. Our specimens in al- 
cohol and in camphor require a renewal of the pre- 
servative periodically. A random selection from our 
records shows that we have paid the following prices 
for mounting: 25 cents for a mouse; 50 cents each for 
a woodlark, a canary, a parrot, a humming bird; 75 
cents each for a robin, a kingfisher, a bluebird; $1.25 
179  
-P-A-G-E-188
  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
each for a squirrel and a woodpecker; $1.50 for a frog; 
$3 for an owl; $5 fora hawk. Material purchased 
consists of mounted specimens, pictures, models, etc., 
and raw material for the construction of models. For 
example, a gallon box, made of zinc, three by seven 
by eleven inches, cost 75 cents; a hen, mounted, $5; 
a piece of kangaroo skin, 25 cents; bottles for speci- 
mens average 20 cents per dozen; silk flags of various 
nations, eight by twelve inches, cost $2.80 per dozen. 
A few other items in our collection are here noted as 
» typical of what it is aimed to provide. For elemen- 
‘tary school purposes, classification of nature specimens 
must not be carried out to any extended detail. The 
aim must be the modest one of teaching the pupil to 
distinguish, for instance, between a sparrow and a 
swallow, a butterfly and a moth, an elm and a pine; 
energy must not be wasted in illustrating such dis- 
tinctions as papilio zolicaon and papilio daunus. 
Among our mounted specimens are: bat, flying squir- 
rel, ducks, hen, orioles, fox. There are also birds’ nests 
and birds’ eggs. Where it has been impossible to pro- 
cure specimens of animals, pictures, many in color, are 
provided. Among the objects preserved in alcohol we 
have snakes, fishes, etc., and a series of “from tadpole 
to frog.” A few skins or pieces of leather—snakes, 
bear, elephant—and a few skeletons—horse’s skull, 
teeth, etc.—are included. Sea products are well rep- 
180 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
THE SCHOOL MUSEUM 
resented in shells, corals, urchins, starfish, and the 
like; agricultural products by a particularly fine series 
of grains in the seed—about one hundred varieties; 
and mineral products by several hundred specimens. 
Trees are represented by pictures, by cross-sections of 
trunk and branches, by bark, and by lumber in va- 
rious degrees of finish. Insects are mounted each in a 
separate box. Series illustrating the evolution of in- 
dustrial and manufactured products are particularly 
valuable. We have coal in its various commercial 
sizes, silk from the cocoon to the ribbon, cotton from 
the seed to the spool, etc. There is a small ethno- 
graphic section of miscellaneous specimens such as 
tools and coins. 
In addition to purchase, material comes to us in 
many ways. The public museum has given us sev- 
eral of its duplicate specimens and material which, 
though not quite up to their standard, is yet suffi- 
ciently good for our purpose. Teachers, pupils, and 
others make frequent contributions. As one illustra- 
tion, a stranger, passing the school building one holi- 
day, got into conversation with the janitor, by virtue 
of which he was invited to visit our museum room. 
He accepted the invitation, and soon after sent us our 
mounted fox. We find it advisable to make it a rule 
not to accept specimens as loans; they must be given 
to us outright or not at all. This is chiefly desirable 
181 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
because of the responsibility which would accrue for 
the care of loaned articles. 
The arrangement of material is on shelves which are 
numbered on a flexible basis: 
1-120 Animal 
121-240 Vegetable 
241-300 Mineral 
301-350 Miscellaneous 
Thus if expansion makes it necessary, the number of 
a shelf may be changed, but the specimen follows the 
number. The catalogue shows names of specimens 
with the shelf number at the end of the line. A sec- 
tion reads:

Abbreviations used are: a=preserved in alcohol; m= 
mounted; A=series of pictures of animals; B=of 
birds; T=of trees; F =of flowers. 
Each teacher is provided with a catalogue and is 
expected to make constant use of the museum for 
illustrating his work, not only in nature study, but 
also in reading, history, geography—in fact, in all 
subjects which permit of objective illustration. 
It is necessary that some one be placed in position 
of responsible supervision of the museum. A teacher 
sufficiently interested to undertake the work can 
usually be found and should then be excused from 
other assignments of work outside the classroom. 
The duties of the curator are to act as treasurer of 
the museum fund, to accept and prepare specimens, 
and to care for the museum room. Pupils are always 
available who will enjoy helping the curator. Teach- 
ers may be directed either “ When returning specimens 
be sure to place them on the proper shelf—if in doubt 
look up the shelf number in the catalogue” or “. . . 
place them upon the table and do not replace them 
in their shelf positions.” If the latter rule is made, 
some one must be assigned to replace the returned 
specimens daily. 
We have found it profitable to have boxes con- 
structed, approximately a foot in each dimension, with 
the front and sides of glass. These are located on 
183
-P-A-G-E-192
  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
the walls at convenient places in the corridors and a 
specimen from the museum is placed in each. These 
specimens are changed from time to time, and if they 
are appropriate to” the season, so much the better. 
For instance, a robin may be accompanied by a plac- 
ard: “Robins were seen in the park yesterday, March 
18th. Have you seen any this year?” 
Whether pupils should be permitted to visit the 
museum or not is an open question. As a reward, or 
from some other motive, a class with its teacher might 
very occasionally be given a period devoted to in- 
spection of specimens in their cases. On the other 
hand, if the pupils are debarred from the room and 
the museum is regarded as a storehouse and not as 
an exhibit, their interest in specimens when they are 
used in the classroom in the course of the regular work 
is apt to be heightened.

THE ALUMNI 
Tue full value of alumni organization is universally 
acknowledged and appreciated in respect to any edu- 
cational institution of collegiate or university rank. 
But it is sometimes overlooked that even to the public 
elementary school, alumni interest is equally valuable 
though its expression may take somewhat different 
direction. Thus, aside from an occasional contribu- 
tion of pictures or other supplementary equipment, 
the financial support which is directly rendered with 
telling effect by the alumni of many private higher 
institutions, is not a practicable consideration in the 
immediate relation of the public-school graduates to 
their alma mater. 
There is for the public school, however, an indirect 
alumni influence bearing upon financial support, that 
merits attention. Any municipal system of schools is 
dependent upon the taxpayers for maintenance, and 
this support in turn depends upon the degree of fa- 
vorable estimation to which the schools are regarded 
by the great citizen body. If the graduates from the 
18 185
-P-A-G-E-194
  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
public schools of any city are imbued with a spirit of 
loyalty and devotion, each to his own alma mater, 
their collective support of the entire system when they 
in turn become taxpayers and voters, will be whole- 
hearted and correspondingly effective, and will react 
favorably upon the succeeding generation of pupils. 
Contrariwise, the boys who sustain for their individ- 
ual schools a sentiment of indifference or distaste are 
likely to become the men whose regard for the school 
system is flaccid or perhaps positively inimical. Upon 
this broad consideration it is clear that there is wis- 
dom in developing an alumni spirit in and for a 
school. 
There is a more specific value in alumni support. 
That school which establishes favorable traditions has 
an asset of immeasurable worth. Any school acquires 
a tradition of some sort—it cannot hope to escape— 
and hence it behooves the responsible head of the 
school to assure to it the best quality of traditional 
spirit and to protect it against the baneful effects of 
an unfavorable tradition. If the pupils of a school are 
permitted to feel that once they are graduated they 
are cast adrift and that the interest of the school in 
them automatically ceases, their own interest in the 
school is unlikely to endure. On the other hand, as- 
suming that the school has exercised an inspiring in- 
fluence upon its pupils, that influence and its reaction 
186
-P-A-G-E-195
  THE ALUMNI 
for good upon the school may readily be extended into 
the postgraduate years. 
As a single concrete example, consider the princi- 
pal’s handling of discipline cases. Henry Smith, let 
us say, is reported to him by his teacher for misbe- 
havior. Discussing the matter with the boy, he says: 
“George Smith is your brother, is he not? And he was 
graduated from this school. What would they think 
of this sort of conduct at home?” However effective 
may be his respect for his father and mother, Henry 
has a wholesome regard for his older brother’s good 
opinion. If George is an inspired alumnus of the school 
—even though in his time he may have had his own 
disciplinary troubles—Henry immediately recognizes 
that he has done something which George will not 
countenance. George, as Henry knows, is with the 
school, and that definite and positive support may be 
made a controlling factor in the disposition of the case. 
By contrast, if George is a negative alumnus of the 
school, Henry may well suspect that he is indifferent 
to his brother’s shortcomings—might indeed applaud 
his misdemeanors—and the case is correspondingly 
more difficult to settle. 
In turn, how far may school interest extend to the 
alumni? Ought graduation to close the personal ac- 
count of the pupils with the school? I do not here dis- 
cuss the place of the alumni association and kindred 
187
-P-A-G-E-196
PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
forms for the promotion of alumni interest, but re- 
strict myself to the consideration of the more personal 
duty of the principal of the school. Should not the 
interest of the school extend to the individual welfare 
of its alumni and exert an inspiring influence in their 
lives? In the typical city school, with its graduates 
numbering hundreds, the problem of thus reaching the 
individual graduate assumes serious proportions and 
if a principal is to extend his influence in this direction 
he must set about it deliberately and work system- 
atically. His hit-or-miss efforts will undoubtedly 
yield some return, but one meager in comparison with 
that resulting from an expenditure of an equivalent 
amount of time and energy in pursuance of a carefully 
formulated plan. 
My own effort to solve this problem, though limited 
in its results when compared with ideal aims, has yield- 
ed much in both sentimental return and practical use- 
fulness. I believe that it is better that my interest in 
a graduate’s welfare should find definite expression 
periodically though occasionally, than at such random 
that he may or may not receive my attention according 
to quite adventitious circumstances. Hence it is that 
each of my alumni (over a thousand in number) re- 
ceives from me a personal letter or greeting on each 
of four consecutive birthdays, beginning with the 
first after his graduation. 
188
-P-A-G-E-197
THE ALUMNI 
On the first occasion I write him a note more or less 
in accordance with the following form: 
Dear Jon: 
If I am not mistaken, to-day is your birthday, and 
I congratulate you upon the occasion. I hope you 
still think of “Eighty-Five” and are bringing credit 
to the school in your present career. I should be very 
glad to receive a letter from you telling me what you 
are doing, how you are getting on, and your plans for 
the future. 
Cordially yours, 
(Signed). 
John receives this by mail and recognizes it as a 
birthday present of the kind for which we all have a 
growing regard as we learn to value our gifts by other 
than a dollars-and-cents measure. The expression of 
my personal and official interest is to him unexpected 
and pleasing. But better than this, it is frequently 
effective as a stimulus to profitable introspection. It 
may be that John has settled into a life of more or 
less perfunctory service in a shop or office and his 
interest in his work is at a standstill. The fact that 
I have an interest in that work which I am willing to 
turn out of my appointed way to express, is quite apt 
to heighten his own respect not only for his work but 
for himself. And then that word plans usually holds 
him. Either he is dreaming dreams and is grateful

ings, was a great pleasure to me, as well as to my 
parents.” 
“Your kind letter was received yesterday and I 
was very much pleased to hear from you. Accept my 
sincerest thanks for your congratulations. Am also 
pleased to know that I am still remembered in 
‘Highty-Five’ and very often think of it. . . .”

“T hardly think I can forget the good times I have

On the next birthday, I jot down and send a mere 
memorandum, such as: 
December 8, 1892 
June, 1907 
December 8, 1908 
Congratulations! 
(Signed) 
The first date is that of John’s birth; the second, of 
his graduation; and the third, the current date. 
This note serves as a birthday greeting and as a re- 
minder of the first, and usually elicits a reply. Some 
of these replies have been: 
“Since your last letter I have graduated from the 
—— High School, and am now in the —— Bank, 
where I am starting at the bottom of the ladder to 
learn the banking business thoroughly. I shall be 
pleased to write you how I am progressing in my 
work,” 
“ After receiving your letter on my previous birth- 
day, I hardly expected to be remembered this year, 
and it was a very agreeable surprise, I assure you, to 
receive your kind remembrance.” 
“T have received your congratulations and thank 
you heartily for the same. School life has not ended 
as yet, for 1 am now studying at ——, and I hope to

be an illustrator some day. My health has not failed, 
as I now weigh one hundred and forty-five pounds, 
this being forty pounds more than when I graduated.” 
“Thank you very much for that kind reminder of 
my debt to ‘ Highty-Five.’” 
“T assure you I have not forgotten it by any 
means, yet I am glad to have it recalled so vividly to 
my mind.” 
On the third occasion I send a copy of the school 
song with my autograph and the date, and receive 
such responses as: 
“T thank you very much for the little card you sent 
me as it made me wish that I were back in school 
again and also glad that after being out of school for 
three years I am not forgotten. Those words ‘When 
school is o’er may we be true yet more and more,’ 
made me feel as though I could do anything for the 
school. 
“«”, . So I made up my mind right there and then 
that I was going to do something this year; that when 
I give an account of my doings to you on my next 
birthday there will be at least one thing among them 
that you will approve.’ 
On the fourth I write after this fashion: 
Another birthday is here, and once again I send you 
my sincere congratulations. This time I have to con- 
fess that I am like “the old woman who lived in the 
13 193

shoe.” I find that it is impossible for me to keep up 
writing to all my children, and so I am asking you to 
accept with this letter my best wishes for all your 
birthdays to come. Next year, and every other year, 
too, when your birthday arrives, please write me a 
letter telling of your progress during the year, remem- 
bering that I have you on my mind and am always 
interested in your welfare. 
Cordially yours,

This usually receives attention even if there has been 
a lapse in replying to the previous notes. I have had 
such responses as: 
“Tt is indeed kind of you to think of me on my eight- 
eenth birthday, and I want you to accept my thanks. 
I should say you were like the woman who lived in a 
shoe and I don’t see how you could think of us as often 
as you did,! but never mind, we won’t forget you nor 
’85, at least I won’t as long as I live.” 
“". . it must keep you very busy remembering 
them all. But I am afraid I don’t like the idea of not 
hearing from you any more. I have appreciated your 
letters so much and wish you would find time to write 
to me again.”

“T thank you very muchforyourkind letter. Irecog- 
nized the writing immediately and even before open-

graduated. So I was not surprised to read that they 
were getting too numerous. . . .” 
“ Of course I can appreciate how utterly impossible a 
task it would be to continue the custom, since year by 
year our ranks grow in numbers; yet, although I shall 
have to forego this pleasure in the future, I shall deem 
it a privilege, as you suggest, to write to you, confident 
that my woes or joys, failures or success, shall be heard 
by asympathetic ear and receive such praise or counsel 
as they merit.” 
“You seem to be in quite a predicament, but I hope 
you will not find it necessary to treat your children as 
that same ‘old woman’ did... . 
“T am sure that I owe a great deal to ’85 and love it 
more each year as I get older and realize a little more

which it might be ashamed. . . .”

make three records. The first fifty pages are devoted 
to a list of the graduates by classes, a page or two to 
each class. Next follows a chronological record, one 
page to each two days of the year, thus:

THE ALUMNI 
The explanation of these entries is: John Peterson 
was born April 27, 1889, was graduated January, 1904, 
and lives at 80 Cooper Street. I wrote him on April 
27, in 1905, 1906, 1907, and 1908, and received replies 
from him in 1905 and 1908. Similarly for the other 
names. In the case of Paul Hester, in one of his re- 
plies he has informed me of his change of residence to 
527 Hancock Street. Richard Smith replied in 1903 
and 1904, but not in 1905, andmy 1906 letter was re- 
turned to me by the post-office authorities as ‘Not 
Found.” Harriet Wilmer has a brother George, who 
was graduated before she was, which I must remember 
when I write her in order that my letter will vary 
from that which I sent her brother. I also note 
cases of death and marriage, with dates. 
The last fifty pages are given to an alphabetical 
list, thus:

The dates given are the birthdays, and so give a 
reference directly to the previous record. Susan 
Abbott married, and her married name is Stone; 
she will also appear in this record under that name. 
It may be that a card-catalogue record would be 
19%
-P-A-G-E-206
  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
even more convenient, though the book scheme in 
use seems to meet the requirements quite satis- 
factorily. 
I keep letters written up sufficiently in advance 
so that I am free to neglect this particular business 
on any day when other matters would crowd it out. 
On my desk memorandum are noted the names of 
those to whom letters are to be sent each day, so that 
the only attention required is to see that the letters 
are mailed on the proper day. 
Replies received are indorsed at the top with send- 
er’s name and birthday and year, and filed according 
to date. They are thus available, chronologically, as 
to any particular pupil, by means of reference to the 
second record. 
Perhaps the thought that is most likely to occur 
regarding the scheme I have here described is that 
it must take too large an expenditure of time. I am 
safe in saying, however, that an average of ten 
minutes a day more than covers the attention which 
it demands, and I am convinced that there are few 
more profitable ten-minute periods in my school day.

THE CARE OF ADOLESCENT GIRLS 
THERE are several reasons why special consideration 
of adolescent girls at their critical periods is com- 
monly neglected in the elementary schools. Chief 
among them are: 1 
1. It is generally regarded as a high-school problem 
only. 
2. Teachers are carelessly or ignorantly indifferent 
to their duty in this regard. 
3. The attendance record is overemphasized in 
many schools and school systems. 
4. Overconscientiousness and fidelity to school re- 
quirements, one of the mental characteristics of ado- 
lescence, leads many girls to neglect their physical 
well-being. rf 
5. There is a widespread conviction that the sub- 
ject is a delicate one to discuss, and that consideration 
of it would be resented by the public concerned.

  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
6. There is uncertainty as to how far the school 
should go in recognition and solution of the problem. 
As to each of these considerations in turn, I answer 
as follows: 
1. Any investigation of the facts shows that it is 
not a high-school problem alone, but, to a very impor- 
tant extent, one seriously demanding the attention 
of the elementary school. 
2. The indifference of teachers is not willful and 
exists in consequence of ignorance and of loyalty to 
conventional school traditions. 
3. The attendance record is one of the conventional 
school traditions, blindly worshiped as a special fea- 
ture of the “system.”’ 
4, Girls may be brought to see that there is a truer 
definition of Duty than the nearsighted one of 
always doing the present work at whatever future 
expense. 
5. The delicacy referred to is essentially a false 
one, and the public will not resent a sane recognition 
of the problem by the school. 
6. A few definite propositions as to the limitations 
of the school may be established, and within these 
limitations much positive good may be done. 
These statements result from conservative generali- 
zation based upon a review of five years’ experience 
in endeavoring to solve the general problem. I shall 
200

first briefly recount that experience and then return 
to these six statements to give them more detailed 
and convincing support. 
For a number of years my conviction had been 
growing that the school shirks its plain duty when it 
deliberately refuses to consider the patent fact that 
hundreds of adolescent girls are forced through the 
curriculum, in competition with boys, with utter dis- 
regard of the consequences as related to their physical 
well-being. Whatever may be said in favor of a 
curriculum providing identical subject matter for both 
boys and girls, no argument is needed to prove that 
maturing girls should not be put through the work at 
the same pace with the boys. It is probably true that 
the preadolescent girl can pursue her school work 
side by side with the boy without the slightest danger, 
subject only to the ordinary variations in individuals, 
which are unrelated to difference of sex. 
But to the older girl is due special consideration; 
first at the time when her maturity is establishing 
itself, and then at her regular periods as they recur. 
If this consideration is extended her and she is per- 
mitted at these times to slacken her speed and inten- 
sity as applied to the school work, under ordinary 
circumstances she will more than make up the result- 
ant loss by the renewed vigor of her normal atten- 
tion to the work. If this consideration is withheld, 
14 201
-P-A-G-E-210
  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
serious impairment of her phy: ‘cal self may follow, 
and in a certain proportion of cases is sure to follow. 
One may read Dr. Clarke’s “Sex in Education” with 
profit, without taking sides in the discussion of co- 
education, which was so violently precipitated by the 
publication of the book. Dr. Clarke’s arraignment 
of the school for its neglect of its girls may or may 
not have been too strongly put, but that there is 
neglect is not open to serious question. 
But to determine that the school has a duty in this 
respect is far from settling the question of what this 
duty consists and how in actual practice it may be 
performed. It is clear that each teacher of girls ought 
to have. an intelligent appreciation of the impor- 
tance of modifying the effort required of a girl as 
her physical condition may demand. We may, with- 
out discussing the reasons therefor, confess that 
very few teachers have such an appreciation. The 
first duty then is to inform teachers on the subject. 
Of course, if a girl’s mother, on her part, is intelli- 
gent and determined she will, if necessary, take the 
law into her own hands and conserve her daughter’s 
health whatever the consequences to her school 
record. But few mothers do this, which is due toa 
lack of understanding, or of determination, or of 
both. 
Some mothers have a sympathetic and frank rela- 
202

THE CARE OF ADOLESCENT GIRLS 
   
                                                   tionship with their daughters which is based on in- 
telligence and in turn leads to further effective under- 
standing. As to these, the school has merely the duty 
of meeting them in a spirit of comprehension and co- 
operation. But many mothers—it is to be feared a 
great majority of them—are either diffident about thus 
intruding into the daughter’s personal life or are ig- 
norant of the seriousness of the matter. As to these, 
the school has the further duty of informing them and 
of awakening them to a sense of their own obligations. 
There is a work then to be done which shall bring the 
mother and the teacher, who are both concerned with 
the welfare of the same girl, into a position of mutual 
understanding and intelligent and effective codpera- 
tion. 
To do this was the aim which I set for myself as 
principal of a mixed school in which are enrolled over 
one thousand girls. In furthering that aim I have been 
fortunate in having women assistant principals of ex- 
ceptional ability and devotion to the needs of the 
school. Without such assistance, of course, a man 
principal would be estopped from carrying out any 
systematic plan of campaign along this line, but with 
women of mature poise and tactful judgment, into 
whose hands the details of such a plan can be placed 
for execution, much good may be accomplished. In 
five years three different assistants successively have 
203
-P-A-G-E-212
ey Ter nner 
PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
carried out my plan, with uniform tactfulness and 
with continued success. | 
The first move was a campaign of education among 
the teachers; every girls’ teacher was invited to read 
Dr. Clarke’s book—some other might have served just 
as well, but that was at hand and seemed at the time 
most valuable. The assistant next conferred with the 
teachers, explaining our plan of action and particu- 
larly impressing upon them the thought that the school 
would hold them more responsible for considerate 
treatment of their girls than for a perfect attendance 
record. They were assured that a roll book which 
showed periodic absence for some of the girls would be 
given appreciative recognition and that no criticism 
would be made of such record. They were further as- 
sured that they were not expected by reason of this 
new attitude toward legitimate absence, to overlook 
or condone inexcusable neglect of school work. In 
other words, “discipline” in its best sense, was not to 
be impaired—to the contrary, it would be strength- 
ened, for it would be put upon an intelligent foot- 
ing. 
In order to reach the mothers, the assistant planned 
a schedule of all but the youngest girls in the higher 
grades and began to request the mothers of these girls, 
a few each day to call at the school. These individual 
conferences have continued ever since, with practi- 
204
-P-A-G-E-213
  THE CARE OF ADOLESCENT GIRLS 
cally no modification of method, which consists in 
making clear the following points: 
(1) The mother is assured that the school wishes to 
consider her daughter’s health and codperate with 
the home in intelligently conserving it. By most par- 
ents, as indeed by many school authorities, the school 
is regarded as an institution concerned exclusively 
with the training of the intellect, and it is assumed 
that consideration of physical and moral welfare must 
be subverted to intellectual progress. It is therefore 
necessary in most cases to make very explicit the as- 
surance that the school regards both the “marks” 
which the girl gets in her studies and her record of at 
tendance of less consequence than the fulfillment of 
her future happiness as a woman. There must be no 
misunderstanding on this point. It is not that the 
school wishes in any way to neglect the intellectual 
training of its pupils, but that, to put it quite con- 
cretely, it is more concerned with graduating a girl at 
the age of fifteen with a record of “satisfactory” 
in her lessons, knowing that her future physical and 
mental integrity are guaranteed, than with graduat- 
ing her at the age of fourteen with a record of “supe- 
rior,” if this is at the expense of normal health and 
comfort in her adult life. If, as is quite possible in ex- 
ceptional cases, she can graduate at the age of twelve 
with a striking record, without having augmented her

chance of physical derangement, she must not be hin- 
dered from doing so; but the fact that an occasional 
girl can do this, does not warrant us in citing her as a 
model for every other girl to emulate, regardless of 
circumstances and consequences. 
(2) The mother is questioned as to her daughter’s 
physical condition. This discovers the mother’s own 
attitude toward the subject. She may never haye 
given it a thought ! and frankly says so. If this is the 
case she is urged to consider its importance, to secure 
her daughter’s confidence, and to direct her daughter 
wisely and sympathetically in all matters, physical 
and moral, growing out of her adolescence. If she has 
already established herself in this proper maternal re- 
lation, she is quite ready to give the school the neces- 
sary information which shall act as the guide to the 
school attitude toward her daughter. If there has 
been any functional disturbance which seems abnor- 
mal, for which medical advice has not been had, the 
mother is urged to consult the family physician with- 
out delay. In addition to the direct subject of the in- 
terview, it is possible in many cases to discuss other   
1 The following reply from one of the mothers to whom the 
usual request to call at the school had been sent, is an index to 
the attitude of some: “Please excuse me for troubling you with 
this writing. I received a card from school this morning for me 
to come to school. I hope —— has not done anything wrong, if 
she has I will punish her. . . .” 
206

matters bearing upon the health of the girl, such as 
dress, late hours, dancing, etc. 
(3) The mother is introduced to her daughter’s 
teacher and if there is anything unusual in the girl’s 
condition this is explained to her with instructions as 
to what special consideration is to be shown to the 
girl in the classroom. 
(4) The mother is urged to give her daughter’s 
health prior consideration to her studies; she is urged 
to keep the girl at home one or more days as neces- 
sary during her catamenia, or if she is sufficiently 
normal to send her to school, to direct her to inform 
her teacher of her condition or to write for her a pri- 
vate note to the teacher to that effect. The teacher 
is instructed that, upon receipt of this information, ~ 
she is to modify the strict requirements of the class 
work in this case for the time being. 
We have found the response to our efforts friendly 
and interested and in many cases intensely apprecia- 
tive. In not more than one-third of the cases have the 
mothers failed to respond—employment during the 
day undoubtedly accounts for many of these. It may 
be noted that our register of pupils is made up ra- 
cially! as follows: American, 52 per cent; German, 22

Trish, 3.2 per cent; balance, scattering, In general it 
may be said that we note practically no difference in 
attitude or degree of appreciation along racial lines. 
In order to systematize the work a card-catalogue is 
kept in which is entered for each girl, her name, class, 
date of birth, date of interview with mother, date of 
physical maturity, remarks as to special features of 
the case. A study of these cards serves to indicate the 
importance of the work, and citations by a very ran- 
dom selection from these cards may throw such light 
upon the problem as general statements fail to do.

These cases, selected from hundreds, are sufficient 
in number to indicate the serious responsibility which 
the school assumes when it undertakes to administer 
education in ignorance of the conditions disclosed by 
this record. To continue administering thus in igno- 
rance would seem reprehensible in the extreme. Think 
210
-P-A-G-E-219
  THE CARE OF ADOLESCENT GIRLS 
of a class in which are included such extremes as CasE 
2 and Case 12, and consider both the great disadvan- 
tage under which the teacher labors who is utterly ig- 
norant of the difference existing between normality 
and abnormality, and the great injustice which is done 
to CasE 2 when her effort and proficiency are relent- 
lessly measured by the same standard which is applied 
to Cas 12. Consider the gain in efficiency of any class 
when these injustices are eliminated and the standard 
of management is shifted from the idea of “the girl 
for the class” to that of “the class for the girl.” How 
much more intelligently can the teacher treat Casx 3, 
for instance, knowing that she is under the care of a 
physician for spinal trouble! How much wiser will be 
the attitude of the teacher toward Casx 11 and CasE 
5, when she learns that the former although only 
thirteen years old, is already a woman, while the lat- 
ter at fourteen is yet a girl! How much more effective 
will be the work of the teacher with Casz 19 when 
she realizes that the girl thinks her “teacher does 
not like her” and knows the physical basis for this 
notion! 
I return now to restate my convictions in answer to 
the six excuses originally advanced for neglecting this 
problem. 
1. When we consider that even in the twenty-four 
cases cited, the age of maturity varied from eleven 
211
-P-A-G-E-220
  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
years, six months, to fifteen years, and that the average 
age of graduates is aboutifourteen years, six months, it 
is clear that the problem is one which essentially and 
primarily concerns the elementary school. Consider- 
ate recognition of the problem must, of course, extend 
into the secondary schools and the colleges, but. with 
that we are not. here concerned. The responsibility of 
the elementary school is especially acute because it is 
while in attendance thereupon that the great majority 
of girls establish their maturity—establish it either 
normally to their future safety and happiness or 
abnormally to their future misfortune and irremedi- 
able. suffering. 
2. Every teacher worthy of a place in the school, 
will respond sympathetically and intelligently, once 
the importance of this problem is presented to her, 
and will certainly take her part in the campaign of re- 
form.. Her enlistment. cannot help but give to her 
teaching a pedagogic value and an intelligent direction 
which has previously been lacking. 
3. A proper view of the attendance record is to be 
obtained by thinking of school problems from the 
child out.and not from. the system down. It is clearly 
our:business to consider the child first, last, and all the 
time; when we have done that we may well show an 
utter disregard of the statistical results. To promote 
a certain orthodox per cent of pupils, to secure a cer- 
212
-P-A-G-E-221
  
THE CARE OF ADOLESCENT GIRLS 
tain perfection-approaching per cent of attendance, 
to make the ratio of something to something else ap- 
proach a shibbolethic norm—all these ambitions are 
the ambitions of the pedantic pedagogue, of the self- 
seeking slave of the system, and must be eschewed by 
the professional student of educational problems. Let 
the roll book suffer and not the girl. 
4. If the girl herself cannot comprehend that true 
devotion to duty sometimes requires her apparent neg- 
lect of the school tasks, then the school and the home 
must restrain her against herself. The sex inheritance 
of the girl is such as to make her more prone to err in 
this way than does the boy. If a teacher of a mixed 
class overestimates the ability of her pupils and assigns, 
for instance, twice as much home study as any of them 
can reasonably do, it is the girls who are the most like- 
ly to suffer. The inheritance of the boy is a craving 
for the open, for activity, for conflict. If the teacher 
gives him such an amount of work as would interfere 
with the business of his life, which he instinctively and 
correctly infers is not grammar and algebra but growth 
and action, he overrules the teacher and her error with- 
out compunction, and follows the call of his instinct. 
The adolescent girl overlays her impulse with devo- 
tion, her whisper of rebellion with obedience to law 
and custom, and blindly follows the teacher who per- 
sonifies Duty. Needless tosay that this summary is 
213

ee ee ae Rae Tee OE ee ee ee ee eee Py hee had ae 
PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
stated in general terms, but the few exceptions either 
way but serve to emphasize the rule. 
5. The fear of public resentment is probably the 
most potent factor in preventing teachers and princi- 
pals from undertaking the serious duty which we have 
been considering. Broach the subject in any quarter 
and, even where recognition of the problem is un- 
questioned, the invariable reply is: We do not dare. 
I feel that the statement which I am about to make is 
the most important contribution to the subject which 
I have to offer. When starting the work I shared the 
general feeling that we should have to face resentment 
on the part of perhaps a large number of parents, and 
I forewarned my assistant that, if she undertook the 
work, she would have to be prepared to meet this re- 
sentment with patience and resignation, pursuing her 
way with the martyr’s spirit and suffering rebuke for 
the sake of the ultimate good which must surely come 
of the work. My warning was absolutely unwarranted 
by the subsequent events. Three women successively 
have managed the work; naturally, though uniformly 
‘devoted to the spirit of the undertaking the three differ 
in personality, so that if resentment were the senti- 
ment among the mothers of the district, it surely 
would have evinced itself with one or the other of 
these interviewers. They have met some mothers 
who were ignorant and a few who were indifferent, but 
214
-P-A-G-E-223
THE CARE OF ADOLESCENT GIRLS 
in five years’ time and in hundreds of cases, they have 
had no single case of resentment shown by a mother. In 
my judgment, this absolutely dismisses the question 
of delicacy, and makes it inexcusable for us to neglect 
our plain duty. 
From time to time, feeling the public pulse, we have 
written to some of the mothers in the following strain: 
You will doubtless recall coming to the school on 
, 190_, upon our request, for a conference re- 
garding your daughter 
We are giving a considerable amount of time and 
thought to this subject, and it would be of assistance 
to us in formulating our plans for the future, if we 
might have some expression of opinion from the 
mothers who have codperated with us. 
May we trouble you to advise us as to your opinion 
of the value of this work, as seen in the case of your 
own daughter, or of others whom you may know.   
  
To this request we have received many encouraging 
replies, among them the following: 
(1) Received your letter and in reply would say in 
regard to the conference concerning my daughter, that 
it is very valuable work and should be continued. 
(2) I think the interest and time you have taken in 
the health of maturing girls should be continued as I 
do not think it is a loss of time. With my daughter

your plans have worked out with great success as her 
health has improved greatly. 
(3) In answer to yours of the sixteenth, asking for 
an expression of my opinion concerning the course you 
have taken in regard to the subject in question, I 
would say that it meets with my heartiest approval, 
and I think it both a necessary and praiseworthy 
cause. I think every girl will be benefited by your 
thoughtfulness. 
(4) Your note of the sixth inst. was duly received 
and I thank you for giving me the opportunity to ex- 
press my opinion concerning your thoughtful interest 
in connection with the health of maturing girls. 
As a mother who has had three girls attend your 
school from the beginning of their school career to 
graduation to the high school, I can heartily indorse 
your system which certainly should be continued. 
(5) In reply to your letter I would state that the 
stand you are taking in regard to the girls between the 
ages of thirteen and sixteen is a very good one. I 
found it so with my daughter. She was a very nerv- 
ous and excitable child and I found as each month 
came around she was more so. I kept her at home and 
forbade all books and lessons and I think she was much 
better for it. 
  (6) In reply to your letter of 
that I think ita very wise plan.

  THE CARE OF ADOLESCENT GIRLS 
‘As'to my daughter, I'am very sure that if her health 
had ‘not been considered, she would have been com- 
pelled to give up her studies entirely and of course 
lose her diploma which she now possesses and prizes 
very highly. 
Therefore I say again the good work should be kept 
up if possible. Ever gratefully yours, 
(7) I have so much gratitude in my heart to you 
who have been so kind and thoughtful for my daugh- 
ter’s welfare, that I cannot let this time pass without 
expressing my sincere thanks to you. ——is strong 
and well, better than she has ever been, and it 
is owing to your loving consideration for her health. 
It is with regret that she leaves her teachers and I can 
only hope that she will be as well cared for in the four 
years to come in high school. 
(8) I assure you we appreciate most thoroughly 
your interest in the health and welfare of the growing 
girls under your charge. Health is very important. 
‘Your words aroused me to see the injury that might 
‘be done by sending immature girls to school to drag 
through weary hours. 
  
(9) I received your letter of the and wish to 
let you know that I think the codperation of the par- 
ents and the teachers isa very fine plan, as the best 
results.in work are thus obtained by a perfect under- 
standing of the parents ‘and teachers. The value of 
this work is very great and be assured it has done 
much for mine and many others.

(10) Answering your letter of , Lam only too 
pleased to give you my opinion on the subject of 
which you write. 
It is certainly a blessing to many girls who are at- 
tending school that the teachers are giving so much 
time and thought to the subject, as many mothers who 
keep their daughters home unnecessarily at times, do 
not think of letting them stay at home in such a case 
where it is really for the girl’s own future benefit. 
This little conference with mothers I believe will in 
the cases as above mentioned, remind them of their 
duty, and in time we will have healthier girls than at 
the present day. I do not think that it is because 
mothers are neglectful in any way toward their 
daughters, but because they do not realize that rest at 
such a time means so much in after life. 
Extending my best thanks to all the teachers en- 
gaged in this work for their thoughtfulness, . . . 
(11) I wish to say that in my opinion the method 
you are pursuing in this relation deserves approval. 
It gives to the teacher an acquaintance with the par- 
ticular physical condition of each girl and also brings 
to the attention of the parent the importance of study- 
ing her daughter’s bodily and mental welfare. 
To my mind no general rule can be of value in a 
matter like this, but each girl must be dealt with ac- 
cording to the necessities of her own case and what 
these may be can best be learned by a meeting of 
mother and teacher.

   THE CARE OF ADOLESCENT GIRLS 
  
(12) I recall my visit to the school on of last 
year. Too much time and thought I am sure cannot 
be given to the subject you have under consideration. 
(Mothers are too prone to let the future take care of it- 
elf, with the result we know only too well, trusting to 
(Providence what they should do themselves. Several 
cases have come under my personal observation which 
trengthen my conclusion in this regard and in one 
ase the ending was sad indeed. 
I am heartily in sympathy with your work. If the 
others will not take it up at home, it is the province 
f the state, through the schools, which have the care 
f the girls for such a great part of their school life, to 
lo it. 
6. A word or two as to the limitations of the work. 
understand that we have come far short of solving 
he great problem of adolescence in the large. I realize 
hat there is an important problem presented by ado- 
escence of boys, but I share the sense of bafflement 
nder which educators all over the country are labor- 
Ing. I have nothing to offer toward the solution of 
his phase of the problem. But what we have done 
as been done through conscientious work by devoted 
sistants and teachers, and done to some purpose and 
ith definite result. I believe that in this as in all 
chool difficulties, we should aim to solve completely 
limited phase of a problem rather than lightly to 
ouch upon the solution of the whole problem. Not 
219 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  PROBLEMS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOO 
too much has been nor should be attempted. Abov 
all, the school must at no point assume to replace th 
physician, but it should coéperate with him and sup 
plement his work, and where necessary, lead to ‘th 
calling of his attention to cases requiring it. Ther 
must be nothing melodramatic in our attitude; w 
must not see difficulties where none exist, nor borro' 
trouble; we must work quietly, tactfully, and dili 
gently and do thoroughly the work within the limit] 
set forth above. 
A woman principal should have no difficulty i 
carrying forward such systematic supervision as 
have indicated. A man principal should be so estal 
lished in a school that, working through compete 
women assistants, he, too, may give the impetus to suc| 
supervision. If he hesitates to discuss the subject, 
here respectfully offer the suggestion that he pla 
this chapter in the hands of his woman represen 
ative with the simple statement that he wishes her 
undertake the work outlined and that he will suppo 
her in her efforts.

  THE TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN 
THE HIGH SCHOOL 
CHAPTER I 
AIMS 
Changes in the Course in English.—In a general discus- 
sion concerning the teaching of English in high schools such 
as this attempts to be, the first requisite is some definition 
of the aims sought by the various phases under this broad 
curriculum. The timé has passed when teachers of English 
could complacently assume that their subject held an in- 
alienable and unassailable place in the predestined scheme 
of things éducational. “During the-past twenty years there 
have been mutterings of discontent, questionings of efficiency, 
departure from classic standards, differentiation of purposes, 
and a shifting of the burden of proof. Changes of material 
and purposes seemed to swing so far toward individualized 
specialization that courses in Argumentation for Aviators 
and Parsing for Plumbers were gloomily predicted. Econom- 
ic and educational readjustment have precluded any such 
splitting of the general field of English instruction, and 
teachers who apprehensively realized that they were not 
equipped for the imparting of such specialized instruction 
breathed more easily until the next movement in educational 
betterment swept into their institutions. 
An unsettling procedure which spread rapidly throughout 
the high schools of the nation was the elective system. Asa 
result of the avidity with which school pupils emulated 
1
-P-A-G-E-10
  2 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
university post-graduates, the traditional curriculum in 
English was torn to shreds and either patched together as a 
miscellaneous conglomeration, or replaced entirely by some 
course new and strange. So-called “business English” will 
occur to many as an apt illustration of this tendency, but 
there are more novel examples. Thousands of classes in 
journalism made composition “alive and practical.” Elec- 
tives in drama and dramatics were offered even in junior high 
schools. Material is grouped differently. Magazines and 
newspapers are studied. Short stories are gathered to 
exemplify “the new America” and the “joy in work.” One 
high school, at least, offered a course in literature illustrating 
liberal thought of the nineteenth century in England. Many 
give credit for little theater production. 
Four Aims.—In all these discussions and claims, these 
rejections and substitutions, these standards and experi- 
ments, there seem to be the same fundamental ideals and 
aims which have inspired the best teaching of English at 
all periods. Though the methods are various, the enthusiasts 
irreconcilable, the claims exaggerated, the content shifting, 
and the equipment inadequate, the aims appear to be forever 
the same. Emphasis may shift among the aims periodically, 
but no high school in the land will admit that its course in 
English fails to serve at least one of these aims. Stripped of 
/ modification these aims are four:—Knowledge and apprecia- 
tion of literature, ability to write, ability to speak, and ability 
tethink. 
1. Knowledge and appreciation of literature—In the ex- 
pression of the first aim—Knowledge and appreciation of 
literature—each word represents its widest rather than its 
most restricted interpretation. Literature includes the 
modern as well as the classic, the recent as well as the remote, 
the interesting as well as the venerable, the humble as well 
as the haughty. But it must still mean literature. It must
-P-A-G-E-11
  AIMS 3 
be worthy of attention. In judging it, the mere element of 
contemporary popularity must be reduced to a minimum. 
Moreover, if it possess mere interest without additional 
educating or intellectual stimulating power, it should be 
scrutinized closely before being admitted to the course in 
English. The definition of literature is no stable statement. 
The interpretation of Matthew Arnold’s “the best that has 
been thought and said” varies directly with the degree of 
exclusiveness attributed to the single word “best.” The 
teacher of English should keep abreast of the keenest critical 
pronouncements of the time so that he may almost anticipate 
the chances of permanency of a contemporary writer’s prod- 
ucts, and consequently choose wisely for inclusion in the 
course of high school English material upon which both 
knowledge and appreciation may be based. 
Appreciation of literature as here used does not mean a 
mawkish or sentimental liking for everything classed as best. 
If a pupil at the end of-a varied high school course describes 
every book or production he has read or studied as “nice” 
or “interesting’’ it is a certain indication that his apprecia- 
tion has not been developed or sharpened. He has followed 
a course of reading, but there has been little actual educating. 
Even a young man and woman of eighteen should have the 
glimmerings of judgment concerning a form of art to which 
they have been exposed for several years. If a high school 
graduate does not separate authors and works into groups 
according to value and interest, and have reasons for his 
classifications, he has secured no real appreciation of litera- 
ture. It may be disappointing for a teacher to have a pupil 
withstand all his efforts to make a poem attractive, but that 
instructor will be all the better teacher if he can accept a 
clearly stated and logically reasoned explanation of the 
( pupil’s independent judgment 
The greatest benefit the high school course can give to a
-P-A-G-E-12
  4 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
pupil is the habit of literary judgment with basic standards 
and general principles of comparison. The beginning of the 
exercise of this judgment should be seen by the teacher 
even though the faculty may not function actively until 
maturity. The teacher, however, must see clearly that the 
seed of such flowering is sown in high school years,’ In addi- 
tion to his own enthusiasm and admiration for a literary 
masterpiece, he must possess the pliant sense to recognize 
the possibility of difference of opinion. He may force an 
entire class to repeat his laudation of a sonnet when their 
just emerging sense of rime may be disturbed or not satisfied 
by the irregular recurrence of sound correspondence. He 
will be a better teacher if he shows the process of judging, if 
he explains the details of structure, if he points the way for 
their minds to search. Realizing that the maximum literary 
sensibility of an adolescent is far below his own, he must not 
become impatient or sarcastic at a failure to rise to his mature 
artistic understanding. Where his own delight fails he must 
substitute for it the essential of all good teaching—a sym- 
pathetic approach towards appreciation through the slightly 
developed grasp of the pupil. 
The teacher should never entirely identify with this 
sympathetic point of view his own mature opinion. He must 
be able to enter vicariously into youthful unfoldings, but in 
his own mental literary concepts he must be far above the 
learner. The teacher who believes The Psalm of Life to be 
great poetry displays retarded literary concepts of both 
form and content. Such a complete merging of levels does 
not make for the best teaching of literature. A pupil may 
not be able to recognize unerringly the glaring faults in the 
style of O. Henry, but a teacher who cannot is going to have 
trouble in teaching composition. The teacher who at forty- 
five is still reading Cooper and Scott with the fervor of thir- 
teen has stood still intellectually.
-P-A-G-E-13
  
AIMS 5 
Before there can be the slightest degree of worthy apprecia- 
tion there must be knowledge of literature. The teaching of 
English uses two methods of producing such knowledge— 
intensive study and rapid reading. Each enforces the other. 
Close attention to connotative, stimulating, thoughtful 
productions develops accuracy and retention in more rapid 
perusal. The latter kind of reading supports the interest in 
detailed consideration of masterpieces. One is learning how 
to read, the other is practice in reading. The latter is a usual, 
life-long habit. The former belongs more definitely to the 
realm of teaching. 
In this aspect of the aim of the teaching of English—the 
knowledge of literature—the word knowledge means exactly 
what it says. Knowledge is an idea in accord with fact or 
truth. Knowledge of literature is as definite an acquirement 
as knowledge of arithmetical processes or knowledge of phys- 
ics. Sentimentalists and unapperceptive readers to the con- 
trary notwithstanding, a knowledge of literature is capable 
of demanding as much exactitude as the most generally 
considered technical subject in the entire course of study. 
Inexact teachers: and slippery thinkers have allowed a 
_ different opinion to grow. The analysis of the theme under- 
lying a great poem, as Wordsworth’s Ode on the Intimations 
of Immortality from Recollections in Early Childhood, demands 
as much knowledge, though of a different kind, as the solution 
of a problem in permutations and combinations. The con- 
struction of the brief for an argumentative masterpiece in- 
volves as exact logic as does the solution of an original prob- 
lem in solid geometry. If members of departments of English 
find difficulty in having these statements of facts accepted, 
the fault is partly their own. 
The pupil who having studied it cannot reproduce the 
formula for the binomial theorem simply does not know one 
of the essentials of algebra. The pupil who having studied
-P-A-G-E-14
  6 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
Macbeth does not know the prophecies of the witches has 
little knowledge of that tragedy. The boy who cannot give 
the formula for the sine of angle x plus angle y knows little 
of trigonometry. The girl who having studied the Concilia- 
tion Speech cannot tell how Burke proves that the temper 
and character of the American Colonies cannot be changed, 
knows little about that production. The girl who says that 
Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation brought about the 
Civil War knows nothing of that phase of our history. The 
girl who has memorized and recited Bryant’s Thanatopsis 
and then declares that it deals with the immortality of the 
soul simply does not know the material of that poem. If a 
class has read Pope’s The Rape of the Lock and then does 
not know that Belinda’s toilet is described as a religious cere- 
mony, its members have wasted their time. A class should 
know as accurately the facts of the linguistic discussion be- 
tween Gurth and Wamba in the opening chapter of Ivanhoe 
as the rules for factoring algebraic expressions. Pupils who 
can solve problems dealing with the acceleration of falling 
bodies can distinguish the two plots in Silas Marner and 
group the characters in each. Such knowledge—accurate, 
clear, essential—may be entirely separate from the apprecia- 
tive element already considered. It is the basis of the ap- 
preciative element. Without it, all the efforts of the teacher 
to develop appreciation will be fruitless of results, or produc- 
tive only of the shallowest efforts at reproduction and 
imitation. Even to be able to say that one does not like a 
poem or play or essay, one must know what the composition 
aims to do and what it contains. It is quite possible for the 
matter-of-fact, plodding drill-master with little or no literary 
sensitiveness in himself to overestimate the time and atten- 
tion to be given to the mastery of fact. But its importance 
is paramount. Adults are criticized for not understanding 
what they read. Mnemonic schemes to train mature minds
-P-A-G-E-15
  AIMS : 7 
to retain what they hear or try to read are advertised in the 
popular magazines. Countless pedagogic devices endeavor 
to help the reader to grasp the material upon the printed 
page. The lack in reading ability is felt not only in literature , 
classes. Teachers of mathematics and science complain that 
pupils do not understand the facts over which they skim. 
In their simplest phases the fullest knowledge and apprecia- 
tion of any literary entity depend merely upon a careful 
consideration of the work itself. Knowledge of the content 
and form, weighing of the worth of the unit, may require no 
attention to anything outside the pages read or studied. 
Such restricted consideration seldom exists in good teaching. 
Almost invariably literature levies upon extraneous but 
closely related concepts for its message and impression. The 
second phase of knowledge and appreciation of any selection 
of literature is as a criticism of life. No person who has read ' 
Matthew Arnold’s exposition of this phrase will need any 
explanation of that aspect of study. No teacher who meets 
high school boys and girls needs to be reminded of their 
facility in finding in what they read the reflection of life— 
ethical and unethical. Many a boy believes The Vision of 
Sir Launfal to be a great poem because to him it expressed a 
criticism of one detail of human relationship. Pupils, asked 
to explain why fiction should be read, will invariably worm 
from it a moral benefit. Worthy imaginative delight in 
reading as a mere pleasure is almost beyond their ken. Many 
a girl feels that Romola is great because Tito receives his just 
deserts. Even some adults—though most of these have child 
brains—consider all literature from the standard of ethical 
principles and moral lessons. Countless readers, if asked, 
would be able to concoct a moral for Maupassant’s master- 
piece, The Necklace. A hard-headed and tight-fisted business 
man, confronted by a supreme work of art in music, sculpture, 
or drama, is as likely as not to ask, with contented participa-
-P-A-G-E-16
  8 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
tion in general grammatical slackness, “But what’s its use? 
It don’t get you anywhere.” Not a few teachers, lacking 
literary culture based on wide reading and sympathetic 
understanding of the logic of art, dutifully torture from story, 
play, and poetry, their little sermons of utilitarian applica- 
tion. Some of their struggles are amusing and amazing. 
A class was reading about William Penn’s quarrel with his 
father, as a result of which the boy was turned out of the 
house. Ethically, of course, the teacher tried to show that 
children must obey their parents, yet here was a model 
character who contradicted that rule of conduct. Would a 
teacher dare to distort the facts and brand William Penn 
as an unworthy person? Fortunately for teachers who must 
be ethical leaders, literature provides enough specimens of 
moral teachings, from Silas Marner to Macbeth. Better 
equipped as teacher of English is that teacher who interprets 
“criticism of life’ as stimulating reflection upon life, and 
judges a book accordingly. 
Knowledge and appreciation of literature are deepened 
and widened by the study of selections in relation to time. 
Many products do not need such consideration. They may: 
be read and studied with no attention to the dating of their 
material. They are as great when they exist in vacuo as 
when neatly placed in a literary or historical epoch. They 
belong early in high school, before literary history, biograph- 
ical reading, and cultural background can be demanded or 
provided. To this group belong such masterpieces as a few of — 
Shakespeare’s tragedies, many of his romantic comedies, 
Andersen’s fairy tales, Alice in Wonderland, Maeterlinck’s 
Blue Bird, Barrie’s Peter Pan, Rostand’s Chantecler, Cole- 
ridge’s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, many of Poe’s short 
stories. | 
The problem of the background of literature is involved 
in the study of those books in which the time of the story,  
-P-A-G-E-17
  AIMS 9 
the play, the essay, the speech, and the drama, must be con- 
sidered and mastered. Primarily, the happy solution of the 
problem depends upon the intellectual and literary equip- 
ment of the teacher. At no other time is it so dangerous to be 
only ‘“‘ten pages ahead of the class.” At no other time and 
in no other phase of the teaching of English is the meager 
preparation of the teacher so likely to betray. It is a difficult 
task to herd the alert minds of an interested group of pupils 
along a single safe highway. A teacher must at times frankly 
admit ignorance concerning certain topics, but the teacher 
dealing with a literary masterpiece should have a background 
sufficient to meet every legitimate query and to satisfy all 
intelligent curiosity. The usual notes in a school edition are 
seldom sufficient for the conscientious teacher. They should 
have been prepared by the editor for the pupil, not for the 
teacher. If they are adequate enough for the teacher’s 
mature, trained mind, they are likely to be far above the 
comprehension of the pupil. In that case, the text is not a 
good one for high school reading or study. In junior high 
schools and the lower years of senior high schools, sections of 
American literature are poorly taught because instructors 
do not know enough of the history of both American and 
English literature, and have not read enough of the books 
common among all intellectually trained minds. Can a 
teacher present Lamb’s Tales from Shakespeare without 
having studied the plays themselves? Can a teacher so 
little versed in the philosophy of existence that he believes 
death the most terrible punishment adequately present the 
theme of expiation in The Rime of the Ancient Mariner? 
‘The teacher of literature must be equipped with a great 
“reserve of knowledge and experience to draw upon in study- 
ing literature in relation to the time it displays. Transla- 
tions of Homer, poetry, and drama, require familiarity with 
antiquity. English literature is the artistic mirror of the
-P-A-G-E-18
  10 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
nation’s history. The romances of Scott reflect the history 
of a thousand years. Ivanhoe is dead without a knowledge 
of the Crusades and chivalry. Shakespeare displays the 
heart of the sixteenth century. Milton was a product of the 
seventeenth. Lorna Doone springs from that same period. 
The eighteenth century is alive with high school characters— 
Sir Roger DeCoverley, Henry Esmond, Samuel Johnson, 
Edmund Burke, Oliver Goldsmith, and Robert Burns. 
Dickens, Thackeray, and George Eliot cannot be torn from 
the Victorian period. The Idylls of the King display nine- 
teenth century ideals. In Memoriam is opaque unless 
readers know of the spread of scientific investigation and 
religious latitudinarianism some seventy-five years ago. 
Comparison with other works will support knowledge and 
appreciation of literature. In the lower grades of junior high 
school the beginnings may be made with a certainty of im- 
pression, if not with the same breadth of view as in a college 
class. The reading child can be shown how to weigh the 
effects, the qualities of two stories, two poems, two tales, 
either from a subjective impression or an objective opinion. 
As more examples of literature are read, the standards for 
comparison and contrast will be multiplied. The wits should 
be sharpened, the sensibilities cultivated. In order to operate 
most resultfully in such comparative study, the teacher 
should know all the reading of the years preceding the one 
he is teaching: Stevenson’s The Black Arrow, Scott’s 
Ivanhoe, a dozen ballads, may be linked with earlier reading 
about Robin Hood and his companions. Comparative study 
to train the appreciative and discriminating senses is the one 
form of classroom activity which reflects most closely the 
practice of mature readers and even professional critics. 
The teacher of English should seize upon this to point the 
obvious lesson—that reading in school is a regulated in- 
troduction to a life-long delight in books. In this kind of 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
  AIMS 1 
study, if in no other, mature experience confirms teaching 
method. Nearly every professional critic judges by com- 
parison and contrast. The simplest beginnings of this in any 
pupil’s judgment of a book should delight the soul of a 
teacher. He should compliment it, nurture it, propagate it. 
To grasp it fully he will have to forget his own wider reading 
and longer life—and as has been already urged, enter sym- 
pathetically into the ingenuousness of the youth, or en- 
deavor to share vicariously the widening of the pupil’s 
horizon. Every teacher has felt the glow of satisfaction over 
the unexpected pronouncement made about a book by some 
hesitant boy. Assured of its potential value in all subsequent 
English study, the teacher should consciously aim to secure 
such judgments upon every poem or book read. At times 
the sense of discrimination may be keenly marked. Classes 
have been known to declare that they liked better in actual 
life the details listed by Milton in L’ Allegro, but that they 
considered Jl Penseroso the better poem. Justifiable re- 
actions may be elicited by The Cloud, We Are Seven, La 
Belle Dame Sans Merci, The Lady of the Lake, The Raven. 
The short stories of Poe and Hawthorne, if studied or read 
during the same or subsequent terms, produce excellent 
opinions. 
Sometimes—rather rarely—the literary product becomes 
a model for the student. We nts fully now that the best 
way to learn to write is to have something to say. y‘ Playing 
the sedulous ape” is no longer considered the way to train 
oneself to become a master of literary style. Stevenson’s 
practice did not result in glorious success in his own books. 
If we tell ourselves the truth we shall have to admit that we 
do not believe that many of our charges are destined to be- 
come dazzling authors. We know that we are endeavoring 
to train the great majority into a decent, average ability 
marked by clearness, accuracy, and ease. To set over 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
  12 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
against Stevenson’s account of himself we may quote Frank- 
lin’s exposition of how he made himself write acceptably. 
Did not Abraham Lincoln know and follow a few modelsf 
For short compositions rather than for long productions the 
masterpieces of literature will serve as models. Every 
aspirant for the sale of a short story has studied master- 
pieces in this manner. Every period of literature exhibits 
its successful exploitation, from the imitative dramas of 
Elizabethan England and the satires of Queen Anne’s time 
to the recrudescence of contemporary free verse and the 
novels of Mr. Archibald Marshall. 
To secure knowledge and induce appreciation of literature, 
no one will insist that all the foregoing phases of study must 
be present in every instance, or that all of these be applied to 
every form. The type of the product, the place in the curric- 
ulum, the variation of factual to esthetic elements, the style 
of the author, the relation to the mental resources of the 
pupil—all these will determine the amount of time and 
energy to be expended upon any one of these correlations. 
2. Ability to write—The second aim of the teaching of 
English in high schools is the development of the ability to 
write. At one time this was the paramount- objective of 
teaching. Everything included in the course had become 
‘subservient and contributory to the science of rhetoric. 
© Then it suddenly dawned upon educators that composition 
‘\ is not a science concerning which one learns rules in numeri- 
cal sequence, but an art which is mastered by continual 
practice under intelligent guidance and criticism. When this 
“practical” system of teaching composition gained in vogue 
it was discovered—calamitously—that most of the guides 
and critics could not follow their own precepts. Few teachers 
had ever written anything for publication; not many more 
were able to write for publication. It is difficult to convince 
mature teachers that they should take courses in composi-   
-P-A-G-E-21
  AIMS 18 
tion. They will crowd summer school courses in the method 
of teaching composition in the upper elementary grades 
or in the junior high school, but few of them will submit for 
examination specimens of their own writing ability. They 
have discovered that writing is an accomplishment not easy 
to acquire. They frankly admit that they consider courses 
in composition too difficult. Yet these same teachers 
“teach” composition in high school. Of course it may be 
true that the master of a craft is not a good teacher of others, 
but not many secondary school instructors need fear that 
their mastery of our language will interfere with their adroit- 
ness as imparters of knowledge and trainers of youth. 
Certainly the pupil intending to enter college should know 
how to write English. Is there any reason why the pupil 
not going to college should not be trained to write well? 
Was the senior in high school right when he excused his in- 
attention to accuracy of composition by saying, ‘Why should 
I know how to write? I’m going into business’? Will the 
ordinary business letter suffer from more attention to better 
English? As used here, “writing” is not limited to the 
narrow sense of producing spelled-out words in sequence upon 
paper. The term includes writing upon the typewriter, as 
many professional writers produce their manuscripts, it 
includes dictating to a stenographer, or into a dictaphone. 
If the intention is the production of something to be read, 
the practice which produces it is termed “writing.” 
8. Ability to speak.—Of equal importance with ability to 
write is the third aim of the teaching of English—ability 
to speak. This is of equal importance not only because 
of the paramount use in business ‘of the telephone, but 
because old-fashioned oratory, debate, declamation, forensic, 
and their kindred forms, developed to extreme bombast by 
a gifted few, have become attaint;/ and because their places 
have been taken by a saner, more direct, and more thought-
-P-A-G-E-22
  14 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
ful presentation of speech upon the lips and tongue. For 
years, our schools and colleges have been neglecting this 
phase of teaching, leaving it to some adjunct or special de- 
partment, refusing to acknowledge it openly and to credit it 
worthily. The past two decades have witnessed a reversal 
of sentiment concerning speech courses. Sane reorganiza- 
tion has made this work the equivalent of the more usual 
written composition courses. In some high schools, exercises 
in speaking are merely incidental to regular study, in others 
preliminary to written composition, in many elective, in 
only a few, comparatively, required. To parallel the state- 
ment in the discussion concerning writing, many teachers of 
English make poor impressions in addressing audiences. 
Nearly every convention exhibits educators discussing the 
prime value of oral composition and public speaking—from 
closely written or neatly typed manuscripts. There is no 
need to point the moral. Let your ears be your investigators. 
Listen to the conversations, the reports, the formal remarks, 
the speeches, the lectures, the sermons, the addresses, de- 
livered by the American voice, and you will support the con- 
tention that one aim of high school training should be the 
ability to speak. 
4. Ability to think—Whenever one considers the last aim 
of the teaching of English there may spring to one’s sub- 
conciousness the remark concerning all the learning of 
James I of England. It left him the wisest fool in Christen- 
dom. A pupil as a result of the study of English should have 
attained to some ability to think. The fact that this claim 
is made for every other subject in the curriculum need not 
cause the department of English to relinquish it, or to be- 
queath it to some other subject. A willingness to do this in 
some institutions has brought upon the teaching of English 
me searching inquiries and many disturbing investigations. 
iterature is a reflection of life, an induced habit of thinking 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
AIMS 15 
about it will inevitably carry over to the larger matters of 
existence.) These may be too vast for inclusion in the daily 
duties of teachers, but those who fail to stimulate or demand 
thought about the immediate material they are studying are 
more than missing an opportunity—they are failing in the 
adequate fulfilment of their tasks. 
A thousand instances to illustrate this phase of the study 
of English spring to mind. One already cited in this chapter 
will serve here again—the failure of the instructor to think 
correctly about the punishment and penance in The Rime of 
the Ancient Mariner. The high school senior who can study 
Wordsworth’s Ode on Intimations of Immortality from Recollec- 
tions of Early Childhood without comprehending its basic 
idea of immortality before existence on this earth, has not 
thought. The pupil who cannot see the incongruities of 
style in many recent short stories has not thought. The 
pupil who believes that Hawthorne described Pike the 
peddler in Mr. Higginbotham’s Catastrophe as liking to shave 
himself with a sharp razor instead of a dull one has not 
thought. The pupil—or teacher—who cannot point out 
defects or falsities in the reasoning or explanations of Burke 
has not exercised thought. The exercise of this highest 
faculty becomes apparent in countless class discussions 
and recitations. ; Thought questions style and expression as 
well as statement of fact in everything it reads.) It explains 
the difference between the correct meaning of Lancelot’s 
excuse for not going to the tournament and the mistaken 
understanding of the word lets. 
Sir King, mine ancient wound is hardly whole, 
And lets me from the saddle. 
It links the meaning of lets with the term applied to a served 
ball in tennis partly impeded by the net. Thought leads to an 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
    16 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
intelligent criticism of the one incongruous word in these 
lines by Wordsworth. 
And now I see with eye serene 
The very pulse of the machine, 
A Being breathing thoughtful breath, 
A Traveler between life and death. 
To a large extent, appreciation of In Memoriam depends 
upon accurate and scientific knowledge. Judgment of its 
esthetic level depends upon keen thought. The frequently 
quoted quatrain describing the four methods of measuring 
the passage of time becomes really clear only after the 
exercise of thought. 
For every grain of sand that runs, 
And every span of shade that steals, 
And every kiss of toothed wheels, 
And all the courses of the suns. 
Just recognition of the labored phraseology evolved by 
Tennyson depends upon the application of thought to the 
third line. The incongruity becomes apparent at once. 
Here thought determines a matter of stylistic nicety. 
Summary.—The past twenty-five years have witnessed 
many changes in the attitude toward the teaching of English. 
Traditional conceptions of both content and methods have 
been subjected to keen investigation. Results have been 
tested by scientific measurement. Experimentation of every 
kind has been introduced. Many of the changes have 
produced so little betterment that they have been dis- 
carded. From others have come decided improvement in 
results. 
Through all the endeavors, the aims of the teaching of 
English have remained the same;—l. Knowledge and

appreciation of literature; 2. Ability to write; 3. Ability to 
speak; 4. Ability to think. Attainment in all of these is 
the purpose of instruction in English, for such attainment is 
a direct contribution towards fitting the pupil for life.

CHAPTER II 
THE TEACHING OF PROSE FICTION 
Interest in romantic literature—The boy and girl in 
high school represent in taste the youth of the race. The 
’teens delight in romance. Beginning with this fact clearly 
mind the teacher should arrange the reading and study 
of literature to link closely with that natural interest of the 
pupil.} Profiting by observation of children in the home 
or in the schoolroom, or accepting the testimony of students 
of child psychology, the teacher will be convinced that the 
younger high school pupils like romantic stories of some 
length. Periodicals for adolescents depend upon the con- 
tinued story. Children to whom stories are told like the 
never-ending ones. Parents have to develop a skill at im- 
provization and complication similar to the fecundity of the 
medieval reciters of metrical tales. A director of plays for 
children reports that his experience finds little response to 
the short dramas. His appreciative audiences are satisfied 
only by the long delineation of the adventures of hero and 
heroine. Nor do the audiences think less of a play because it 
depicts characters with which they are already familiar. 
On the contrary they seem to like all the better dramas 
written around their old friends. 
Romantic literature in earlier years.—The application 
of these facts to the teaching of English is that romantic 
stories should be included in the course of study, and in- 
cluded early. If it be true that children are not as generally 
disposed to read as they used to be and should be, and 
reading is considered a worthy form of mental exercise for 
18
-P-A-G-E-27
  
THE TEACHING OF PROSE FICTION 19 
supposedly educated adults, every endeavor should be made 
in high school to attract pupils to the value and delight of 
the printed page. Before the spreading of educational 
facilities and compulsion drew into the secondary schools 
such a heterogeneous conglomeration as they draw now, it 
was true that the pupils had been accustomed to read. 
Today teachers of English cannot complacently take the 
reading habit or training for granted. The problem of 
inculcating a knowledge and appreciation of literature has a 
novel, difficult factor which was at one time less significant. 
Skilful instruction in the grades will have done much, but 
not all. The teacher in high school must appreciate the 
more difficult point of attack against accumulated inertia, 
and into the delicate but purposeful approach inject the most 
winning pedagogical methods and personal enthusiasm. 
Teacher’s dual point-of-view.—This latter phrase must 
not be misunderstood. The mature.teacher must be appre- 
ciatively and critically far above the level of the class. 
Fully conscious of this difference between himself and the 
young high school pupil, the teacher about to present reading 
should examine the attitude of mind he should be able to 
assume. He must consider this phase of his work—in fact, 
practically .all phases of teaching—from a dual point of 
view. As a trained, cultured, mature adult, he must have 
intellectual capacity, literary taste, and artistic appreciation 
far above the level of the class he is instructing. Coupled 
with that equipment, or as an inherent part of it, he must 
have a peculiar power—call it dramatic, if you please—of a 
vicarious yet_sympathetic participation in the experiences of 
‘his pupils. (i must transfer his emphasis from the material 
to the unfolding of their minds) For some teachers, (we 
may assume that they are by“nature the most gifted and 
best suited for the profession), this dual réle is easy to main- 
tain. To others, it is the most difficult readjustment re-
-P-A-G-E-28
    20 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
quired by the classroom. Some instructors never pass from 
absorption in the material to interest in the growth of the 
pupil.! Many have intellectual attainments not much beyond 
the best in the class. This is the kind of teacher who keeps 
only ten pages ahead of the assignment. Pupils apprehend, 
dimly or clearly, the limitations of this kind of instructor. 
Other teachers become so engaged in sympathetic under- 
standing of pupil nature that they neglect the material of 
the course, and accept as highest achievement whatever the 
undisciplined offer of the class determines. Not knowledge 
of material alone, not identification with adolescent life, will 
produce the best teaching. | The dual point of view is the 
basis for the best results in the course in English. 
Qualities of romantic literature——-As romance is so 
appropriate to the youthful reader, the teacher should know 
what kind of fiction belongs under this heading. If the 
qualities become clear in his own mind, he can usé them 
neatly in a class discussion to sow the seeds of literary dis- 
crimination. If pupils are asked to tell what a romance is, 
they will invariably answer that it is a love story. A mature 
person knows better. The essence of romance is strangeness. 
/ Romance in its broad sense is not a kind of literature; it is a 
\ quality, a spirit permeating many aspects of literature, 
music, and graphic art. 
The essence of romance is found in the strange, the novel, 
the unusual, the extraordinary, the extravagant. In the 
history of the changing fashion of the world’s literature, an 
enthusiasm for romantic themes and treatment has followed 
invariably the regular periods of restriction to realistic or 
classic methods and material. The literature of the age of 
Shakespeare reached the zenith of romanticism. To corrobo- 
rate this statement, consider for a moment the elements of 
any play of his. Then having examined his plot incidents, 
visualize his characters—practically all of them are romantic.
-P-A-G-E-29
  
THE TEACHING OF PROSE FICTION 21 
Then, finally, read some of his marvelous verse to be con- 
firmed in the opinion that Shakespeare was a consummate 
romanticist. “After the glory of the Elizabethan age had 
departed, Puritan restraint, French classical influence, and 
dictation by refined society turned literature to realistic, 
ordinary matter and method, until human nature and 
artistic sensibility yearned for something new. In the latter 
half of the eighteenth century the romantic revival swept 
over all of cultured Europe. Every national literature fell 
under its sway. Notice the second word of the term by 
which this movement is known in England—revival. The 
thrill of romantic abandon was recognized then as no new 
thing; it had inspired literature before, it was now merely 
coming back to its own. The teachers of English must know 
the general outlines of this artistic upheaval throughout 
Europe. The new literature of Germany culminating in the 
unparalleled productions of Goethe must be familiar, the 
bitter struggle of the young French romanticists, and at 
least the single detail of the disturbance in the Comédie 
Frangaise when Victor Hugo’s Hernani was performed in 
1830, the European influence of the peculiar poetical and 
personal brand of ‘“‘dandyism’”’ spread by Lord Byron, the 
popularity of the Indian stories of James Fenimore Cooper, 
the dazzling success of Sir Walter Scott. With some 
understanding of the historical significance of romanticism 
as an attitude toward life, and with some appreciation of its 
world-wide spread, the teacher will be the better prepared to 
present its definite examples to pupils who by their inherent 
dispositions are avid for its pleasures and influences. 
Show how romantic themes are chosen.—As preliminary 
to appreciation, pupils should be told of the simpler methods 
by which authors determine their romantic themes. Pupils 
will enjoy this elementary training in literary esthetics. 
The most simple manner of presenting romance is by choosing  
-P-A-G-E-30
  22 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
a story distant in place. It is a common trait of human 
nature to be fascinated by the far-away.) We are prone to 
believe that we should be much happier if we were somewhere 
else. So the writer of romance travels—either in person or 
by reading books—to distant lands, and there places his 
stories. As the result of countless details we have accumu- 
lated certain prepossessions concerning “romantic” lands. 
wise teacher will let pupils discuss their personal concep- 
tions of this pe The list prepared by them may be different 
from that of an“adult, but if confined strictly to the present 
day, it will likely include Spain, India, China, Japan, the 
South Pacific, Alaska, Central Africa, Italy. Such pre- 
liminary clearing of the minds of pupils concerning their 
equipment of impressions and prejudices is of paramount 
importance to the teaching of literature. Discriminating 
appreciation by the teacher of the mental attributes of 
pupils is an essential to the teaching of any form of expression. 
To their list of romantic places pupils should add titles of 
books or pictures which corroborate their entries. 
' The second method for securing strangeness is by depart- 
ing from the present day. This may mean darting forward 
into the thirtieth century or back to the time of Caesar. 
No series of epochs listed by the teacher will have the value 
of one evolved by the class, if impressions are based upon 
reading or choice. 
The third method of securing romance is plainly a com- 
bination of the first two. This fact will unquestionably have 
been made perfectly clear in the first five minutes of dis- 
cussion concerning the use of distant scenes. 
The foregoing are not all the aspects of the romantic which 
need to be comprehended by the teacher and offered to pupils. 
They are, however, the simpler phases, those which will be 
required in the study of the more obvious kinds of romance 
writing. Specimens of these should be placed early in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  THE TEACHING OF PROSE FICTION 23 
school course. Other more mature, more subtle elements 
and accompaniments, belonging to masterpieces requiring 
keener minds, better appreciation, and therefore belonging 
in the higher grades of high school, will be discussed later. 
Preliminary discussion.—Understandingly and rapidly 
covered by a teacher who has read and still reads, the pre- 
liminary or summarizing discussion of the essence of romance 
need not be above the heads of high school pupils. It will 
serve for poetry and drama as well as for prose fiction; it 
will awaken interest in the stories about King Arthur, 
whether they be retold versions based on Malory or the 
poetic Idylls of Tennyson. It will clear the path to a com- 
prehensive view of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, As You 
Like It, Peter Pan, and The Piper. 
Pupil response to adventure.—In romances of the kinds 
so far defined here emphasis is not upon the development of 
character, but upon the adventures of the leading persons 
involved in the plot. Pupils will grasp at once this essential 
so far as it concerns events. Youth lives at white heat in the 
adventures of its friends of fiction. No amazing feat is be- 
yond credulity, at least literary credulity. The astounding 
prowess of an Indian fighter does not disturb pupils’ pleasure 
in the Leatherstocking Tales. Only a critical humorist like 
Mark Twain would or could demolish their structure of naive 
impossibilities. A teacher may go so far as to suggest, 
or get pupils to admit the difference between factual authen- 
ticity and fictional interest, and their relation to acceptable 
plausibility. Plot is a usual word in schoolrooms, but few 
, pupils are able to explain what it means. Dictionary defini- 
tions will clarify vague impressions. The point for the 
teacher to emphasize here is the interdependent relation of 
events in the story, the plan of causal sequence. He should 
make clear that sequential events do not necessarily consti- 
tute a plot. Incidents must be consequential. Concatena- 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  24 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
tion and complication are likewise helpful ideas to amplify 
before a romance is studied. 
Reading, and the teaching of reading.—Not more than a 
single recitation period should be necessary to prepare 
pupils for the reading and study of a masterpiece of romantic 
fiction. By this time the teacher should have decided quite 
accurately how much of the story is to be used for reading, 
and how much for the teaching of reading. Practically any 
volume within the comprehension of a pupil may be used for 
reading. Many of these stories should not be used in any 
other manner in school. But there is a difference between 
reading and learning how to become a better reader. Unless 
a book serves to a large degree the second purpose it had 
better be used frankly as a supplemental or outside reading 
volume, and not be dignified as educational material by in- 
tensive study and detailed discussion in the classroom. 
Many an adult who reads a great deal is a poor reader not- 
withstanding, for he misses much that the author intends 
to convey, he retains little of what he has carelessly perused, 
and he has no opinion of the relative value of the different 
parts of the story, frequently not even a valid preference 
among many volumes. “Although such a person may be an 
inveterate reader, he should be taught how to become a 
better reader. 
Planning the reading.—The teacher’s copy of the book 
may show by notes, cross-references, excisions, the result of 
his distribution of the pages according to the division sug- 
gested. Certain well-defined parts of every book are signally 
more thought-provoking or taste-developing than others. . 
Other portions are more entertaining. Others are inextric- 
ably involved in plot complications. For the purpose of 
teaching how to read, beginnings are usually quite important 
—not always. Chapter I of Quentin Durward should be read 
by a pupil, but is not necessary as material to teach the pupil
-P-A-G-E-33
  THE TEACHING OF PROSE FICTION 25. 
how to read that part of the story. On the other hand the. 
first chapter of Ivanhoe is necessary in teaching how to read 
that historical romance. The work should be so planned that 
the most significant portions should be read almost entirely 
and discussed in class. Those chapters requiring less explana- 
tion, less minute consideration as links between: salient. 
events, should be read rapidly outside class, and reported 
upon rather rapidly. Demands of time, dangers of stretching 
the study of a book over too long a period, number of details 
to be mastered, amount of comparative study to be involved, 
accuracy of memory to be developed, and appreciation of 
style to be inculcated are factors which enter into the time 
allotment for any book in high school. 
Ivanhoe.—The study of Ivanhoe might be begun without. 
a single preliminary assignment by starting to read the 
first chapter. Some teachers report that first year pupils do 
not find the opening chapter very interesting, that the real 
enthusiasm begins only when the preparations for the tourna- 
ment at Ashby-de-la-Zouche are described. It should be 
possible to make the first chapter interesting if the teacher 
presents it adequately. This adequate preparation will not 
be by a report on the life of Sir Walter Scott, though if pupils 
have already read one of the verse romances, The Lady of the 
Lake or Marmion, certain facts of the author’s life may be 
recalled. More interesting as approach to this romance than 
knowledge of Scott is familiarity with Richard. the_ Lion 
and comments by the t teacher, a fer replies by the pupils, 
perhaps a picture or so of armor, a turreted castle, or a 
knightly combat should serve to arouse anticipatory interest. 
If the teacher is at all keen about social customs and their’ 
effects upon words, the dialogue of Gurth and Wamba can 
be made as alive as anything in print. Philology must be. 
subordinated to character-drawing, however. The approach.
-P-A-G-E-34
    26 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
to the plot must be a delight, not a dry-as-dust plodding 
along the pages. 
Before this book is begun, pupils will have learned from 
other examples the relation of setting, plot, and characters in 
astory. The first of these can be made quite plain at once. 
Scott tells as much as we need to know in few paragraphs. 
No history has to be added, the only dates necessary are 
two—1066 and 1194, and these may merely be mentioned at 
this time to be recalled frequently as the plot develops. As 
will be suggested for Quentin Durward, the plot of Ivanhoe 
may be divided into three parts. If only a limited number of 
lessons can be devoted to it, the book may be assigned for 
study and discussion by reference to three signal events. 
These are the tournament at Ashby, the siege of Torquilstone, 
and the trial of Rebecca. In the passages of preparation for 
each of these crises there are other marked portions upon 
which readers love to linger. Such points of demarcation 
must be the guiding factors in the instructor’s treatment in 
order that a pupil may learn how to outline a story which 
at first appears extremely complicated. In essence this plot 
is quite simple and straightforward. Multiplicity of detail 
and introduction of minor characters do not make the 
structure complex. As pupils grasp the salient points of 
interest, follow the surging rises of interest, they are becoming 
better trained readers, better retainers of plots, and better 
students of literature. 
Plot.—As there are three main centers of action, there are 
three main threads of plot. The youngest pupils will not be 
mystified by the term “enveloping action” if they be led 
to discern exactly what it is. They may not do this until a 
considerable portion of the story has been mastered, but it 
must be one of the factors to be discussed. They will have no 
difficulty whatever in centering the main plot about Ivanhoe. 
Thought may be provoked if they are asked to make a list
-P-A-G-E-35
  THE TEACHING OF PROSE FICTION 27 
of characters and explain in a sentence how they touch or 
influence the actions and adventures of the Disinherited 
Knight. Such ascheme may be started early and continued 
until the book has been finished. The minor plot deals with 
the attempt of the Templar to secure possession of Rebecca. 
To keep before the readers the interrelation of these plots, 
there should be frequent explanations of how and when they 
touch one another. It is better to explain this plot relation- 
ship than to attempt to diagram it merely. Anything which 
can be represented graphically can be explained orally, and 
this method of expression in words is more closely related to 
mastery of English than the preparation of intricate graphs 
or broken lines. In yielding to the fascination of mechanical 
and linear devices teachers must guard against the generous 
tendency to accept something else in lieu of English study. 
Visual representations are valuable aids to the study of 
literature but a drawing of a fully-armored knight is not 
literary criticism, a plan of a medieval castle is not proof of 
knowledge of the plot of a romance, a diagram in colored 
pencils is not an equivalent of ability to relate the part taken 
in the story by Robin Hood. Scrap-books are not always 
evidences of a mastery of classroom discussions. 
Characters.—If the pupils keep a list of characters it may 
serve as the basis for an examination upon the persons of the 
book. It will be a helpful auxiliary outline for periodic 
review. It will be the starting-point for an understanding 
of what characterization means in fiction. It will vivify the 
persons. It will induce comparative estimates. The mere 
appearance of the names of DeBracy and Front-de-Boeuf 
will suggest the differences of their characters. From such a 
list will spring suggestions for written and oral compositions, 
closely or remotely connected with the events in the story. 
It will make apparent the infinite variety of the author’s 
invention. It will show the entire gamut of human nature
-P-A-G-E-36
  28 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
and worldly place among the characters, the range from 
maid to maniac, from serf to sovereign. 
Questioning.—The forty-four chapters are too many to 
read in class. The teacher should decide in advance upon 
the passages which are so vivid or valuable that they must be 
covered in this manner. In the early part of the study, the 
progress should be quite deliberate, until all the members of 
the group have mastered the essentials. Then the assign- 
ments for outside preparation should be consistently length- 
ened, and the demands for more accurate answers and more 
logical thinking made more vigorous. ‘ It is poor planning 
which necessitates the same kind of questions about chapter 
forty as about chapter ten. The dual point-of-view of the 
excellent teacher of literature will allow him to refrain from 
pointing out to the pupils the essential errors in the con- 
ception of Ivanhoe. He must not be conscientiously torn by 
scruples concerning Scott’s historical inaccuracies. He 
should know them, but for once he should stifle his twinges 
of artistic fidelity to assume that imaginative credulity with 
which all literary masterpieces should be approached. He 
may feel the prick of scholarly penance when he reads of the 
bitter animosity between Saxon and Norman in 1194, he may 
wince at the banquet in honor of Harold who in reality had 
been dead for over a century, but he must hold his peace, and 
vicariously share with his youthful friends their delight in 
this masterpiece of historical romance. 
Quentin Durward.—Such a story as Quentin Durward 
may be covered in fewer lessons over a shorter period. First, 
the book should be divided into portions according to a 
definite plan. Three chapters may be chosen to mark these 
sections. These must be chosen to serve two purposes: 1. 
To divide the book into equivalent (if not equal) sections for 
study or reading. 2. To begin certain sections of the plot; 
to open new adventures, a journey, a definite phase of plot 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
THE TEACHING OF PROSE FICTION 29 
development, a section dealing with a new group of char- 
acters, etc. 
Of these two purposes, the second is the more important 
in this scheme. It shows the main divisions of the story, thus 
helping pupils to master it. It begins the study or reading 
of each section under the direction of the teacher, who can show 
how the section is to be regarded. This is directed study of the 
right kind. In Quentin Durward the three chapters serve as 
follows: 
Chapter II. The Wanderer brings the hero into the be- 
ginning of his adventures at the Court of King Louis. 
Chapter XIV. The Journey starts him away from that 
Court to experience a new set of adventures. The journey 
forms a distinct unit of the book in itself and in its closely 
related consequences. 
Chapter XXVII. The Explosion brings together the two 
chief historic characters, Louis of France and Charles of 
Burgundy, and opens the train of circumstances upon which 
both climax and conclusion depend. 
Questions in class should be based upon the material, the 
characters, and the arrangement; not on chapter divisions. 
There should be no such question as “What happened in 
Chapter XII?” because that is a mistaken way to expect a 
reader to remember any portion of a book. Only seldom do 
chapter divisions mean anything in the progress of a story. 
Even when the chapter unit means a definite step in the 
plot, the number of that chapter is of no importance. Ques- 
tions on a portion of the work should be planned to suggest 
connected series of thoughts which should be utilized by the 
teacher for further elucidation and discussion. They should 
recall to the pupil the interest of the section he has just read. 
In this way they serve the purpose of a topical outline for 
review, yet they are not so full or exact as to obviate the 
pupil’s making an outline himself.
-P-A-G-E-38
30 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
Hawthorne’s less obvious romantic qualities.—The 
romance of Scott is the most obvious kind in the realm of 
literature. He admitted that he wrote his metrical romances 
to please soldiers, sailors, and common men. The intellectual 
level of many of his prose romances is the same. Beyond 
the literature in which interest depends upon physical ad- 
ventures, battle, murder, sudden death, hairbreadth escapes, 
and sudden coincidences, there is a higher form of romance, 
in which the element of strangeness depends upon more subtle 
ingredients. There are threads of the mysterious, the weird, 
the occult, the unnatural, the supernatural, the spiritual. 
Further removed from our existence of every day, the feature 
of romance may be a searching into the borderland between 
this world and the next, or along that verge where reality 
tapers into unreality, or into that state where consciousness 
slips into the subconscious or the abnormal, or into that 
undiscovered country where the ephemeral merges with the 
eternal. Appreciation of this more evanescent coloring of 
romance comes later and more slowly than delight in the 
romance of material adventure. Yet with this general 
principle recognized, there remain, fortunately, a few master- 
pieces of this kind of prose fiction which high school pupils 
can read with delight and profit. To the mature mind of the 
teacher, books of this second class should be suitable reading. 
If he has not become acquainted with the dozen best, he 
should at once. As Scott is the supreme master of the 
obvious form of romance suitable for high schools, Haw- 
thorne is the unapproached master of the subtle. Let me 
hasten to add that not all the long stories by Hawthorne are 
equally suited to high school use. The Scarlet Letter, the 
greatest work of fiction produced by an American, had better 
be delayed until readers are near their twenties. Ifa teacher 
learns that a pupil has read it, he need make no further com- 
ment than that contained in the preceding sentence, with
-P-A-G-E-39
  
THE TEACHING OF PROSE FICTION 31 
the added advice that the person should be sure to read 
it again, say five years hence. Nor should The Blithe- 
dale Romance be recommended for adolescents. Whether it 
should be prescribed as reading for adults is a moot ques- 
tion. 
Place of Hawthorne’s romances in high school.—Both 
The House of the Seven Gables and The Marble Faun may be 
profitably included in a high school course. In order to 
secure best results the study and reading of these stories 
should either be placed later than work in Ivanhoe, Quentin 
Durward, etc., or be undertaken in a different manner and 
for a different purpose. If these books are offered early in 
the course, they should not be used to teach reading; they 
should be read, and read rather rapidly to secure general 
impressions. In these volumes, adventures are neither many 
nor hair-raising. The subtlety of analysis and description 
displayed by Hawthorne may fail to impress the youthful 
reader, who will, however, secure from the contact with great 
writing benefits in direct proportion to his capacity and the 
guidance of his instructor. These books then serve best as 
supplemental reading; supplementary directly to a class 
study of Hawthorne’s short stories; supplementary to class 
study of romance as displayed by Scott. 
If placed later in the high school curriculum the long 
stories of Hawthorne should be studied for themselves. By 
this time, pupils properly led should have trained their 
sensibilities to respond to the power of these books as stories, 
to judge them as reflections of life, to see the skill of their 
construction, and finally and most difficult, to be able to 
recognize the qualities of their style even if not always to 
appreciate it fully. Hawthorne repays careful consideration 
as few authors do, but his books require a skill in presenta- 
tion which the high school instructor will not obtain unless 
he is literary in taste, keen in appreciation, and sound in
-P-A-G-E-40
  32 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
judgment. In leading a class to know Hawthorne’s books 
intimately, clear exposition will be aided by true liking and 
contagious enthusiasm, 
Beginning the reading of Hawthorne.—In beginning the 
study of a story by Hawthorne the teacher should emphasize 
the fact that the author put upon every title page the word 
romance. The entries are The House of the Seven Gables, a 
Romance, The Blithedale Romance, The Scarlet Letter, a 
Romance, The Marble Faun, a Romance. Delicate user of 
words in fiction, Hawthorne was a sensitive judge of the 
form he elected to produce. He understood the peculiar 
realm of this art better than most literary critics. He 
deliberately started to produce fiction tinged with the mys- 
tery of romance, with its subtle suggestion of the effect upon 
this existence of other-world influences. His statement in 
the Preface to The House of the Seven Gables cannot be 
bettered. 
When a writer calls his work a romance, it need hardly be ob- 
served that he wishes to claim a certain latitude, both as to its 
fashion and material, which he would not have felt himself entitled 
to assume had he professed to be writing a novel. The latter form 
of composition is presumed to aim at a very minute fidelity, not 
merely to the possible, but to the probable and ordinary course of 
man’s experience. The former—while, as a work of art, it must 
rigidly subject itself to laws, and while it sins unpardonably so far 
as it may swerve aside from the truth of the human heart—has 
fairly a right to present that truth under circumstances, to a great 
extent, of the writer’s own choosing or creation. If he think fit, 
also, he may so manage his atmospherical medium as to bring 
out or mellow the lights and deepen and enrich the shadows of 
the picture. He will be wise, no doubt, to make a very moderate 
use of the privileges here stated, and, especially, to mingle the 
marvellous rather as a slight, delicate, and evanescent flavor, than 
as any portion of the actual substance of the dish offered to the 
public. He can hardly be said, however, to commit a literary 
crime even if he disregard this caution.
-P-A-G-E-41
THE TEACHING OF PROSE FICTION 33 
This paragraph—in fact, the entire Preface—under elucida- 
tion in advance by an instructor who anticipates pupil dif- 
ficulties, is quite within the apprehension of high school age. 
Of more importance in the story than most beginnings is 
the exposition in this romance. The purpose of exposition 
in a short or long story should have been made clear in the 
first high school year. The exposition in The House of the 
Seven Gables is not difficult to master because of two reasons— 
first, there are only three essential facts to cull from it; 
second, Hawthorne tells them so simply and directly. The 
teacher must at this time move at a pace which will permit 
the fixing of the essential facts of the past history of the 
house indelibly in the mind. A pertinent question or two 
will elicit information concerning witchcraft persecution in 
New England. Several boys and girls will contribute or 
recall knowledge concerning early Puritanic ideals. Super- 
stition is general today, so that the operation of the curse 
will be immediately accepted. At no time should the teacher 
obtrude upon attention the doom, ‘God will give him blood 
to drink,” but he should never allow it to fade from memory. 
It is the theme of the story upon which even the chance of 
exorcism is based. 
First recitations.—This masterpiece of fiction should be 
unfolded carefully. The first approach might be made on 
say, Thursday, when fiction in general, romance in particular 
might be discussed as the result of previous assignment to 
find definitions, illustrations, discussions, and reports from 
outside reading and earlier class study. On Friday, then, 
in class the reading of Chapter I should begin. Questions 
should be designed to stimulate thought, memory, and 
comparison in the pupil’s mind. There should be no long 
disquisitions by the teacher, no involved answers by the 
readers. The purpose of this lesson is to show the youth 
beginning a new story, a different kind of fiction, how to read
-P-A-G-E-42
  34 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
to secure the best and most lasting results. Compared 
with the opening of Ivanhoe and Quentin Durward in one 
respect this initial lesson is easy for there are no linguistic or 
historical details to impress upon the mind; in another this 
initial lesson is not so easy for the expression is less direct, 
the statements more involved, the style more mature, and 
the allusiveness more remote. 
Contrast of style—In Quentin Durward Scott wrote 
this: “The other buildings seemed scarcely better adapted 
for the purposes of comfort, for the windows opened to an 
inner and inclosed court yard; so that the whole external 
front looked more like that of a prison than a palace.” 
Ivanhoe contains the same matter-of-fact descriptive writing. 
“Rotherwood was not, however, without defenses; no 
habitation, in that disturbed period, could have been so 
without the risk of being plundered and burnt before the 
next morning. A deep fosse, or ditch, was drawn round the 
whole building, and filled with water from a neighboring 
stream.” Note the plain definition of the single unusual 
word, fosse. 
When Hawthorne describes he does more than draw; he 
colors and heightens effects. ‘So much of mankind’s varied 
experience had passed there—so much had been suffered, 
and something, too, enjoyed—that the very timbers were 
oozy, as with the moisture of a heart. It was itself like a 
great human heart, with a life of its own, and full of rich and 
somber reminiscences.’”’ Will not second, third, and fourth 
year pupils understand the differences in those two styles? 
Will they not at least feel the beauty of the latter in contrast 
with the flatness of the first style? If only a dim glimmer is 
struck at this first contact, there is reason for gratulation 
over a worthy start. 
Assignments.—Not all of Chapter I of The House of 
the Seven Gables will be covered during this first recitation,
-P-A-G-E-43
  THE TEACHING OF PROSE FICTION 35 
but as much as time permits should be read. For the Mon- 
day, shall we say?—at any rate for the next recitation on this 
book, the class should be directed to begin at the beginning 
again and cover the first three chapters. Warning should be 
given that the recitation will cover just that portion. Inter- 
ested devourers of stories should be warned that though they 
may read as far as they choose, they should be sure to study 
the limited assignment, so that they will not cloud the 
clarity of the beginning of the plot by contributing details 
from later sections. From this point on, outside reading, 
detailed study, class recitation, and general discussion, 
should be determined on the basis of the importance of the 
material. The return of Clifford is more significant than the 
meeting of Phoebe and Holgrave; the chapter in which 
Hepzibah is shown Jaffrey seated in the armchair is more 
thrilling than the succeeding one. Keeping in mind both 
literary appreciation and growth of power, the teacher should 
plan for longer assignments, for careful weighing of seemingly 
small details. Every method for increasing power to absorb 
by reading, to deepen worthy response to emotional appeal, 
to facilitate oral and written expression, and to discern the 
form under the substance, should be utilized. Oral com- 
position will occur most frequently as the result of natural 
procedure in retelling and criticizing portions of the book, but 
written composition need not be slighted. Nor should both 
of these forms of expression be purely reproductive; more 
benefit will accrue to the pupils’ equipment if they are led to 
explain their critical judgments, to indicate reasons for their 
preferences and deepest absorption. No pupil to whom a book 
has been properly introduced should be allowed to give for 
liking the unmeaning reason, “because it’s interesting.” 
Pupils can be led to explain that phrase by separating it into 
details, as the regular rhetorics describe this process. : 
Contrasting the romance and the novel.—To carry out 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  36 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
the plan best answering to the development of the adolescent 
mind, planners of courses in English should place the study 
and wide reading of the novel later in the course than the 
consideration of the romance. If pupils have indulged their 
tastes sufficiently in the latter form, a teacher may make the 
transition to the novel by using the device of comparison and 
contrast. The emphasis will be upon contrast, as differences 
add to the sum total of knowledge more units than do 
similarities. The teacher may recapitulate all the main 
characteristics of romantic products. This general topic 
should elicit an animated class discussion reviewing all past 
reading directly and remotely connected with school. The 
feelings and responses sincerely experienced by young 
readers should be recounted and described. They and the 
instructor should revive the prime features in romance—the 
unusual, the extraordinary, the extravagant. They should 
admit, perhaps reluctantly, that exposed to the cold scrutiny 
of modern common sense, the exploits of romantic heroes are 
beyond credulity. They should explain why, since this is 
true, such books are popular. They should describe the 
willing surrender of belief to the imagination of the story- 
teller. The author may be as unrestrained as he can be, the 
reader follows wherever he leads. He seems to weave a 
magic spell about one. No one doubts him; no one pauses 
for an instant to reflect. His pages do actually hold one 
breathless. Such glorious thrills are the chief constituents 
of the pleasures of reading romance. A carping critic may 
complain that the romancer does not present a true picture 
of life. The reply is, he never purposed todoso. He intended 
to color it, to magnify it, or to dwarf it, for the effect of his 
story. He deals with life not as it really is, but as it may be, 
as it should be. The supply of worthy specimens of this kind 
of fiction is never quite equal to the demand. 
Qualities of the novel.—The art of the novelist is based
-P-A-G-E-45
  THE TEACHING OF PROSE FICTION 37 
upon opposite fundamentals. This artist keeps his eye 
fixed intently upon everyday occurrences, his ear tuned to 
the sound of ordinary speech, his heart open to present-day 
events. Life in a novel appears more real than life in the 
pages of aromance. From this quality comes the essential 
realism. A well-read teacher will know accurately the 
distinction between realism and naturalism but there is no 
necessity of teaching this to high school pupils. Realistic 
and romantic will roughly group for school classes all they 
have ever read. Before proceeding any further it may be an 
illuminating exercise to make two lists of titles under these 
separate headings. From the justifications by pupils of their 
entries under realistic there may be compiled a set of indica- 
tions of the qualities of the novel. 
Realism.—The realistic deals with the present rather 
than the past. It depicts the near at hand rather than the 
distant. It relates events of the author’s own land, not of 
remote kingdoms. It tells of scenes he has observed, not of 
those he has imagined or dug up from old tomes of biased 
history. Its persons are men and women of his own race, not 
weird foreigners. They are engaged in ordinary pursuits of 
life, not in feudal quests. They are merchants and factory 
workmen, farmers and bankers, not explorers and knights 
errant, feudal lords and wandering minstrels. They are 
depicted, not for what they do, but for what they are. The 
emphasis is not upon their adventures, but upon their devel- 
oping characters. The reader feels that they are not mere 
moving figures in an animated picture, but that they are 
persons like himself. He might have to pass through their 
experiences. It is easier to see himself in a realistic novel 
than in a historical romance. Realism tries not to distort 
facts about life, it tries not to color its happiness with too 
rosy a glow, not to darken its sadness with too gloomy a 
shadow. If a pupil stops:to list all that realism has to avoid
-P-A-G-E-46
    88 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
and all it tries to do, he may be tempted to declare, “How 
then can anything realistic ever be interesting?” In litera- 
ture, as in so many things, the proof is in the accomplishment. 
Realistic literature has as many supreme masterpieces as 
romanticism can show; many critics and wide readers would 
declare it has more triumphs and higher levels. 
Silas Marner.—The best book for beginning the study 
of the novel is Silas Marner. Any objection to its being con- 
sidered a novel can be swept aside by the rejoinder that it 
certainly is not a short story. It is no further below the 
average length than Tolstoi’s War and Peace is above. It 
illustrates in shortened form every quality a novel should pos- 
sess. Because of its manageable length, it is better adapted 
for use in teaching how to read a novel than any other story. 
George Eliot frankly admitted that her first fiction was 
based on her ‘‘own observation of the clergy.”” Adam Bede 
grew from an incident in the life of one of her aunts. No 
reader can be convinced that Maggie Tulliver in The Mill on 
the Floss is not a self-portrait. Felix Holt was the outgrowth 
of reflections upon an election riot the author had seen when 
she was a small girl. Sclas Marner, too, came from the vivid 
recollection of that impressionable child. 
It came to me first of all quite suddenly, as a sort of legendary 
tale, suggested by recollection of having once, in early childhood, 
seen a weaver with a bag on his back. 
Letter dated February 1, 1861 
Details to consider.—In addition to the fidelity of the story 
to actual life there are other reasons why this book is admir- 
ably suited to study. Its theme is restricted, but it delves 
deep into human relationships. That theme, which should 
be grasped and phrased by every pupil before Part I is 
finished, is the softening influence of the love of a child upon 
the hardened heart of a lonely old man. The book is as
-P-A-G-E-47
  THE TEACHING OF PROSE FICTION 39 
artistically conceived and consistently expressed as any 
longer masterpiece. It has distinctly marked plot and sub- 
plot. Its exposition is adequate and interesting. The open- 
ing scenes of the story are rapid, yet as unexaggerated as 
life itself. The rise of interest is irresistible. The two cli- 
maxes of plot and sub-plot occur as inevitably as the sequence 
of day and night. The contacts of the two plots appear like 
the consequences of life rather than the deliberate anticipa- 
tory planning of a woman whose plot had to come out just 
one way. Traits of the characters are inherent in the persons, 
not tacked on by the author as needed. There is continual 
variety under an appearance of the steady current of life’s 
advance. 
Remarkable as is the construction of the plot, the vitality 
of the persons is almost amazing. These persons do not seem 
to be alive, they live. Intimate knowledge of the book will 
fix forever in the brain the traits of the minor characters and 
those of the principal actors. Pupils will unfailingly—if 
properly taught—comprehend the sterling sincerity of 
Priscilla as superior to the determined primness of Nancy. 
If they do not declare this, it is proof positive that they do 
not know how to read fiction. 
Where short stories should be placed.—The relation of 
youth to long stories, already described in this discussion, 
might be used as a reason for deferring the study of short 
stories until late in the high school course. In some respects 
this is a good plan, especially when the study includes a 
large variety of different kinds of short stories. It is much 
better to establish firmly knowledge and appreciation of a 
few masterpieces of this modern kind of fiction than to give 
a, child a superficial impression of miscellaneousness. In the 
early years, not how much can be read should be the school 
ideal, but how well can literature be assimilated: The actual 
choosing of material is as delicate a part of teaching as
-P-A-G-E-48
  
  40 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
classroom procedure. By the time a pupil has reached the 
first year of junior high school he should be ready for begin- 
ning an acquaintance with short stories. He will very likely 
have to be taught how to get the most from them. He should 
be guided in methods of attack, in speed, in analysis, in 
recollection, and in judgment if not in liking. Specimens 
offered him should not be presented as “types” of produc- 
tions, but as reading material worth mastering. The teacher 
should call his attention to the fact that mature men and 
women the world over know intimately what he is about to 
study, therefore his school work is not for this period alone 
but for his entire life. If some recent reference in picture, 
newspaper, or public discussion can be utilized to enforce 
this statement, so much has been gained for proving the 
direct bearing of classroom English upon actual life. This 
help to t to the teacher enforces the dictum that it is better to 
begin: wi with recognized masterpieces than with. contemporary 
interests. This dictum must not be understood as depreciat- 
ing the value of the recent in school, but as suggesting a time- 
saving and energy-saving device for laying the best founda- 
tion for later really proper enjoyment of timely writing. 
Magazine stories of the day are fascinating (that is, some of 
them are) but will any teacher really convinced of the 
permanence of literature be willing to substitute for the 
well-known tales of Irving, Poe, Hawthorne, and Dickens 
recent products of short-story-by-correspondence-methods? 
To a generous assignment of the universally recognized best 
may be added as many as possible of recent suitable short 
stories. These latter, however, should not replace the former. 
Short stories in junior high school.—Teachers of junior 
high school years as well as instructors of early senior high 
school years bear almost unanimous testimony to the suit- 
ableness of certain stories. This sentence, by using the 
expression “certain stories,” indicates the basis of the entire
-P-A-G-E-49
  THE TEACHING OF PROSE FICTION At 
problem of choice. All the tales of Irving are not equally: 
suited, but surely Rip Van Winkle and The Legend of Sleepy: 
Hollow are. Even if they have read them before, high school 
pupils can get more from them by directed study. If they 
learn nothing else, they can realize the value of form, the 
effect of the inclusion of description, and the methods of 
securing vivid character delineation. Many of the narratives. 
of Hawthorne are equally good for these early years, although 
they involve a little more difficulty in presentation. Their 
quiet movement, their unexaggerated style, and their mystic. 
weirdness, make their teaching not too easy. The teacher 
who fails to grasp the difficulties from the viewpoints of the 
pupils and anticipate them is failing in his task. This 
difficulty of presenting the stories of Hawthorne to pupils 
of junior high school grades becomes apparent if one tries, 
to make them appreciate the author’s wonderful style. 
Appreciation of style, even recognition of what style is, 
comes late to any pupil, not at all to many. The most 
difficult phase of English to make plain to pupils is style. 
Recognition of this will save time and effort and prevent 
discouragement. Only the most obvious aspects. of style can 
be taught to young persons—and the style of Hawthorne is 
not obvious. Of Hawthorne, before the end of the tenth 
year, pupils may have covered these. stories: much from 
Grandfather’s Chair, The Grey Champion, The Great Stone 
Face, The Great Carbuncle, The Ambitious Guest, Drowne’s 
Wooden Image, David Swan, Dr. Heidegger’s Experiment, 
Rappaccini’s Daughter, Mr. Higginbotham’s Catastrophe, 
Feathertop, The Minister’s Black Veil, Ethan Brand.

-P-A-G-E-50
  
42 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
An intelligent acquaintance with Hawthorne is provocative 
of more thinking than a reading of Irving. In nearly all the 
narratives of the former, ‘‘more is meant than meets the 
ear.” The romantic element is less material, less adventur- 
ous, more spiritual, more mystical. The pupil should dis- 
cover, or the teacher should show, the symbolic meaning of 
The Grey Champion. One or the other should make clear the 
symbolism of The Great Stone Face. If neither teacher nor 
pupil discusses the irony of the relation of nature to man 
The Ambitious Guest may just as well not be read. If the 
parable of the elixir of Dr. Heidegger is not understood 
before the story is relinquished, there has been no educating, 
no literary reason for having read it. Time and effort are 
being wasted as has already been remarked, if pupils fail to 
grasp, and the teacher fails to explain the meaning in Mr. 
Higginbotham’s Catastrophe of this characterization of the 
peddler. “The peddler drove a smart little mare and was a 
young man of excellent character, keen at a bargain, but 
none the less liked by the Yankees; who, as I have heard 
them say, would rather be shaved with a sharp razor than a 
dull one.” Unless pupils are required to explain what is _ 
meant by “a moralized legend” as applied to Feathertop 
they are not being led to think as a reaction to their reading, 
Nor are they being taught how to read unless they are made 
to appreciate the charm in the beginning and end of that 
story. Even the youngest high school pupils can see, or can 
be led to see, the force of scourging conscience as visualized 
in the last two stories listed in the preceding paragraph, 
The Minister’s Black Veil and Ethan Brand. Hawthorne is 
an author whose pages may be in one sense very easily read 
by a youth, that is, his eye may skim the words and his mind 
receive some impression of what is occurring. This apparent 
ease is deceptive. The events seldom are told for their own 
interest; more frequently than not they are symbols, indica-
-P-A-G-E-51
  THE TEACHING OF PROSE FICTION 43 
tions, outward and visible signs of much more significant 
ideas. It is true that the narratives were prepared for mature 
readers, yet the underlying truths depicted in those listed 
here are not beyond the comprehension of adolescents. The 
teacher’s task is to induce that power of understanding to 
operate upon the material related by this master of prose 
romancers. 
Studying Poe’s short stories.—Some of the tales of 
Poe—The Masque of the Red Death, The Tell-Tale Heart— 
demand exactly similar treatment. Most of them, however, 
require in addition to an understanding of the plot or theme, 
not a comprehension of a symbolized truth but an intellectual 
keenness of factual analysis. If the pupil cannot find the 
clue to this ratiocination, as Poe himself expressed it, the 
teacher must help him to discern it. A good story with which 
to begin this phase of literary appreciation is A Descent into 
the Maelstrom. It is an adventure story, pure and simple. 
Its opening shows that its chief character escaped with his 
life, disproving the usually repeated dictum that we read 
stories to find how they turn out. In this, as in many other 
stories by Poe and other authors, we read to learn how the 
author contrived to make the story turn out as we know it 
does. Note the immense value of this realization of reading 
interest when exercised in all later judgment of books. This 
story might be begun with oral reading in class, with occa- 
sional interruptions for pointing interest and anticipating 
correspondences. Why is the first person used? Is it effect- 
ive? Justifiable? As you know that the narrator escaped, 
in what does interest now center? Should we notice how the 
author manipulates his plot? Why are we told about the 
man’s hair? Is it necessary to know the geography? (The 
teacher who answers affirmatively should not be teaching 
literature.) The assignment for the next recitation should 
contain three directions:—finish reading the story carefully,
-P-A-G-E-52
  44 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
be able to relate accurately all the important details, and 
select the one fact upon which the entire narrative is based. 
The subsequent recitation should cover all three of these, 
passing finally to expressions of personal opinion and appre- 
ciation. They might be discussed in reverse order. To 
prevent the unready from seizing a correct report of the 
single fact upon which the events are based and claiming 
that they had thought it out for themselves, the teacher 
might open the recitation by directing all the pupils to write 
upon a slip of paper the fact which they selected from the 
story. This saves doubt over those who declare they “think 
the same” after a pupil has recited orally. About this fact 
there can be no discussion—an answer is either right or 
wrong. It illustrates nicely the principle that some phases 
of English study are capable of as exact knowledge as physics 
or history. Discussions of the events of the story and judg- 
ment of their purpose, use, and effect may become as ani- 
mated a conversation as that indulged in by groups of adults, 
emphasizing again that study of literature prepares for 
exactly the same activities in later life. Such classroom 
recitation need not become a hard and fast procedure, as do 
/many so-called socialized recitations. No pupil should be 
allowed to remain inactive—whether because the teacher is 
\.assured that he knows all, or that he knows nothing. 
A similar method of study may be applied to The Pur- 
loined Letter, even down to the single underlying fact which 
makes the story so engrossing. It will be interesting to read 
the treatments of this same fact in A Scandal in Bohemia by 
Siz Arthur Conan Doyle, and in The Scrap of Paper by Vic- 
torien Sardou. Not much change of method need be in- 
troduced in dealing with The Gold Bug. All the purposes 
served by Jupiter should be discussed. Pupils should detect 
the extremely slight connection of the gold bug with the 
actual story. Would not any ether bug have served as well?
-P-A-G-E-53
  THE TEACHING OF PROSE FICTION 45 
Or a brilliant pebble raked from the hot ashes of a camp-fire? 
Or a prickly plant? Keenness of observation should be 
fostered by questions about the reasons for the dog and his 
actions, the chilliness on the day of the visit to the hut, the 
detection of invisible ink, and the ignorance of Jupiter con- 
cerning right and left. Other details to serve as the begin- 
nings of literary analysis and appreciation will be discovered 
by every teacher. The point to be kept in mind is that any 
opinion concerning any one detail must be closely related to 
the story as Poe told it. Having taken account of these and 
other differences, the teacher can return to the method indi- 
cated for the other tales. Do weread The Gold Bug to learn 
the conclusion of the adventure? If so, why do we not put 
aside the story at the middle, when the treasure is found? 
Obviously, for the reason already shown by A Descent into 
the Maelstrom. Upon what single fact does the entire story 
depend? In The Gold Bug this may not be so easy to decide 
as in the two preceding, but if the three stories are studied in 
the order here suggested, the principle of deciding should have 
been foreshadowed. A hint may be given to the pupils;— 
is the finding of the treasure or the deciphering of the parch- 
ment the more important for the story? A teacher who be- 
gins the study of Poe in this manner is not merely inducing 
pupils to read—he is teaching them how to read, a much 
more difficult but beneficial accomplishment. 
As many more good stories by Poe may be added for study 
and reading as time permits. Perhaps some of the tales of 
horror may be omitted, yet I have never seen any harmful 
effects from reading The Pit and the Pendulum, The Black 
Cat, The Murders in the Rue Morgue, or The Cask of Amon- 
tillado. Before moralizing educators hold up a warning hand 
at the citation of these titles, they had better learn what 
kinds of “visual entertainments” school children are allowed 
by their mature parents to patronize. Terror, horror, and
-P-A-G-E-54
  46 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
pathos are legitimate emotions for literary stimulation. It 
were better to have them aroused by worthy master- 
pieces than by others. Many a revivalist sermon has been 
more frightening, more terrifying than anything Poe ever 
wrote. 
Biographies of authors.—Notice that in discussing the 
teaching of short stories in the early years of high school, 
nothing has been said about biographies of the authors. 
This omission is not due to oversight. Lest readers ascribe 
it to that carelessness it is mentioned here. Some biograph- 
ical, less bibliographical information may be a desirable 
adjunct to one’s reading, but the teacher must be careful 
not to insist upon too much. How much need a boy know of 
Washington Irving to love Rip Van Winkle or of Nathaniel 
Hawthorne to enjoy Mr. Higginbotham’s Catastrophe or 
of Edgar Allan Poe to thrill over The Gold Bug? May there 
not be more advantage in leaving biography to the end of the 
reading of the productions of an author, or to have it intro- 
duced in sections as required, if at all necessary, and then 
to combine it into an entity later? There is a great difference 
between literature and biography, between appreciation 
and dates, especially for younger pupils. Do we adults rush 
to Who’s Who as soon as we decide to read our first book by 
Mr. John Galsworthy or Mr. Joseph Conrad? In school 
we should not too soon emphasize secondary information, 
usually difficult for pupils to secure and impossible to re- 
tain. 
Contemporary fiction—With slight modifications the 
methods suggested here may be used and the same kinds of 
results obtained by using recent cr contemporaneous stories 
by emerging authors instead of the usual units by recognized 
masters. Let not the teacher expect, however, that contem- 
poraneousness will arouse much more interest, inspire much 
better analysis, produce much deeper impressions, and lead to 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
  THE TEACHING OF PROSE FICTION 47 
much wider reading in his young charges. If he fondly 
anticipates such marvelous differences, he is doomed to dis- 
appointment. A large group of teachers has maintained 
rather vehemently and vociferously that pupils possess wide 
familiarity with contemporary conditions and therefore can 
provide better background for an understanding. Another 
group, not so clamorous, has doubted this claim of absolute 
knowledge of the here and now. Many teachers have visited 
classes dealing with current topics based on magazine read- 
ing and have witnessed more floundering, more indefiniteness, 
more hesitancy in discussing the soldier bonus plans, the four 
power treaty drafts, political parties in France, and condi- 
tions in financial centers, than in reports on the wrath of 
Achilles, the humor of A Midsummer Night's Dream, the 
thrill of the tournament in Ivanhoe, and the life of Franklin. 
Some recent investigations have proved that high school 
seniors are not very familiar with matters of supposed current 
interest. Of some five hundred girls questioned, seventy-five 
per cent did not know the name of the only woman in Con- 
gress. (Query. Is there any permanent, educational value 
in knowing this? Is such a fact to be known or found if 
needed?) Of one thousand high school seniors six hundred 
thirty did not know the meaning of the open shop. The 
significance of such a fact is that a recent story written for 
adults might take for granted an understanding of the open 
shop. It would be as difficult to secure background for that 
story in a high school as for The Pitand the Pendulum. Would 
the effort have equivalent permanent value? 
The teacher of English, however, must never close his eyes\ 
to the continuous production of great literature. He must \ 
not allow his mind to fossilize among the remains of the past. \ 
He must be well-grounded enough in recognized master- 
pieces to choose wisely from among the writers of yesterday —~ 
and today to lead the young to an appreciative interest in
-P-A-G-E-56
  48 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
recent books. In using more recent material he may pass in 
‘method naturally from teaching how to read to practice in 
reading. Yet, if he so desires, he may spend time and energy 
profitably upon modern short stories. As the classes become 
more mature and their powers of assimilation and compari- 
‘son develop, the field may be broadened to include sig- 
nal successes from other tongues. An interest in the short 
story presupposes some reading in foreign literatures. 
France stands highest in accomplishment, Russia perhaps 
next. 
Attention to words.—A detailed discussion of style will 
be included in a later portion (Chapter VIII), but it is perti- 
nent to remark at this time that no teaching of literature car 
\ overlook the study of words. Word-study must not be 
‘allowed to monopolize attention or time, yet the more clearly 
that teachers insist and pupils realize that words are the 
symbols of ideas, the better will instruction become. Is it 
any wonder that pupils are considered dull when they do not 
grasp that shrouds on a ship must be different from the 
burial dress, the only meaning they know for this word? If 
a boy identifies hostler with holster, is his reading going to 
produce a clear image? If a girl understands pig-tail literally, 
ean she see Marley’s ghost as Dickens describes it? In 
covering in a single recitation the longest assignments in 
prose fiction, the teacher must not forget entirely the value 
of new words to the growing mind. The attention to this 
phase of language is a direct means of teaching how to read 
and therefore forms the basis of the pupil’s actual read- 
ing. 
~The short story as a type of literature.—The most marked 
/ feature of literary history in the nineteenth century is the 
\ development of the short story. The rapid spread of educa- 
“tion produced more and more readers who found in fiction the 
delight of leisure hours, but the leisure hours were fewer 
 
-P-A-G-E-57
  THE TEACHING OF PROSE FICTION 49 
because workers were occupied with other matters. It is a 
common remark that life has become more complex in the 
last one hundred years. The complexity is in our interests no 
less than in our occupations. Thus every person today has 
to read about more different kinds of things. This diversity 
of interest has produced the hundreds of magazines, which 
cater not only to desire for information, but delight in fiction. 
All these changes have contributed to the rapid spread of 
interest in short stories and their rise in dignity until now 
practically every producer of fiction engages in their com- 
position. 
The localization of the short story in modern times does 
not mean that there were none before the eighteen hundreds. 
There have always been such short bits of entertainment, 
many as old and as famous as The Arabian Nights. Only in 
modern times, critical judgment has been exercised upon 
them, and authors have emphasized certain phases of all 
the possibilities. 
Hawthorne produced indiscriminately sketches, tales, and 
short stories. Edgar Allan Poe at about the same time 
specialized in a form more closely approximating the real 
short story. His effective artistry in both plot and style” 
impressed the entire world, especially France, where literary 
appreciation is always keen. The French authors who 
practised writing in this form became the greatest in the 
world, spreading the influence of their skill even to Russia, 
and operating upon the output in England, thence even back 
to the United States. 
Length of short stories——As the plainest difference 
between the novel and the short story is one of length, pupils 
should estimate the number of words in Silas Marner in order 
to determine whether it is a novel or a “long” short story. 
Most short stories are easily recognized in length. Magazines 
frequently stipulate the maximum number of words which
-P-A-G-E-58
  50 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
they will accept, ranging in different publications from four 
thousand to eight thousand words. The shortness of a story 
determines to a great extent what the author may include. 
No long development or change of character is possible. 
The actions of any person in a short story must be the logical 
result of character clearly indicated or described. Nor is a 
long progression of events possible in a true short story. A 
protracted, rambling accoun including a miscellaneous 
collection of interesting but rather unrelated details is now 
specifically classified as a tale, not a short story. 
Qualities of the short story.—Intensity of impression, 
swiftness of progression, directness of effect, sureness and 
conciseness of style, clearness of character drawing, reality of 
dialogue, certainty of conclusion, close interdependence of 
all incidents or situations;—these are the recognizable 
qualities of the modern short story. 
Plan of the short story.— With only a few thousand words 
at his disposal the author dare not use too many to cover his 
introduction. Once begun, his events must not stray from 
the central theme. His plot must develop; it may not stand 
still, not wander aimlessly. Without the need for contrast 
which the longer novel requires, the author may dispense 
with devices for securing variety, and press steadily to his 
climax, or accumulate tones to emphasize his desired effect. 
The interest must rise steadily. As the flight is short; 
to be impressive, it must be steep. Nearly all the characters 
when the story begins must be what they are intended to be. 
Any changes must spring not only naturally but quickly from 
the initial circumstances. The author has little time to ex- 
plain. The changes must be accepted by the reader as 
real. 
If the plot is planned properly, the climax will indicate 
quite clearly all the resultant developments, or so satisfy 
interest and curiosity that what may happen afterwards has
-P-A-G-E-59
  
THE TEACHING OF PROSE FICTION 51 
no attraction for the reader. Thus the highest point of 
interest, the climax, the crisis, may be quite close to the end 
of the story. It may coincide with the conclusion itself. 
It may be so effective that it renders unnecessary any con- 
clusion other than itself. 
The other limitations of time, locality, characters, plot, 
scenes, and situations, pupils will be able to deduce for 
themselves. 
Varieties of short stories.—While in a single story there 
are all the preceding limitations, in range of material and 
method of treatment there is inexhaustible variety. No one 
can make a list of different kinds of stories and declare that it 
covers all possible or existent varieties. As human nature has 
pronounced tastes and certain forms recognized as successful 
are likely to be repeated, there are some well marked types, 
every one of which is represented by hundreds or thousands 
of examples. 
The apologue has a purpose beyond mere temporary 
entertainment. The simplest form of the apologue is the 
fable such as Aesop told. In The Bible the parable teaches a 
moral lesson. More highly developed is the allegory, in 
which qualities are personified, and then made to act as the 
characters in the story. 
The story of local color is one in which the plot may be 
intensly interesting, yet it is so closely related to one spot 
that the mind retains a deeper impression of place than plot. 
Vividly picturesque parts of the world are utilized in such 
stories—as the Mexican Southwest of our country, the 
Creole villages of the South, the foreign slums of New York, 
the languorous isles of the South Pacific, the frontiers of 
civilization in Asia and Africa, the unreal districts of China 
and Japan, the unfamiliar steppes of Russia, and the colorful 
banks of the Nile. 
The easily distinguished kinds of short stories require  
-P-A-G-E-60
  52 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
nothing more than a heading here. Pupils should be able to 
place in such a list as this all the specimens of short stories 
which they read or study. 
Story of dramatic incident Tale 
Story of romantic adventure Love story 
Story of the supernatural The humorous story 
Story of mystery Animal story 
Story of terror Story of surprise 
Parody Detective story 
_. Burlesque 
Of course this list may be extended. In trying to char- 
acterize any single short story it is often a better exercise 
of knowledge and appreciation to use some exact short 
illuminating phrase than to try to label it with an arbitrary 
mark. 
Methods of writing short stories.—Authors vary greatly 
in their methods of composing short stories. The general 
starting point of Hawthorne has already been indicated. 
Others have declared that they start with an entire theme, 
which they then localize, and provide with characters. 
Another method is to start with the conclusion, then to work 
backward in planning until all the steps are determined. A 
problem may arise in conversation, or in an author’s mind, 
which he then treats in short story form. One of the entries 
of Hawthorne illustrates this. What would be the behavior 
of a man who knew he was going to die as he saw for the last 
time his familiar associates? Some authors declare they 
never construct two stories in the same manner. Many pick 
up bits of actual life by observation, conversation, reading 
newspapers, and frequenting courtrooms. When pupils try 
to write short stories of their own they will consider many 
different methods for their own guidance, and in all like- 
lihood try them all, or combine them. Consideration of this
-P-A-G-E-61
    
THE TEACHING OF PROSE FICTION 53 
aspect of study of the short story belongs in the chapter on 
composition. 
Summary.—In this discussion of the teaching of prose 
fiction the emphasis has been placed upon principles under- 
lying the choice of the proper material first, because the best 
teaching in the world may be vitiated by unsuitable material. 
This has been followed by general indications of what elements 
and attributes of prose fiction should be called to the atten- 
tion of high school pupils, following somewhat the progression. 
of the advancing study through successive years. Finally, 
there has been anticipated the correlation of this study with 
composition for which the only complete available unit is the 
short story. There may be rapid surveys of American and 
English literature in say the second term of the tenth year, 
or in the twelfth year, at which time cognizance should be 
taken of the place in literary development of the modern 
short story. 
Although the contents of this chapter will make plain to 
the aspiring conscientious teacher that his reading of the best 
must continue always, it supplements this direction by an 
admonition to sample contemporary productions as widely 
as discriminating taste and time will permit. The teacher 
need not be a bookworm, but it is reasonable to expect that 
he will like to read for pleasure and instruction. With 
faculties trained by knowledge of what literature has been, 
what it may be, and what it should be, he need not be 
dragged into the mad pursuit of the latest best seller. On the 
other hand he will know that the days of good books have not 
faded irrevocably from our earth. If he has to choose be- 
tween George Meredith and the latest widely-advertised 
Scandinavian he should not hesitate long or select unwisely. 
If he knows only two novels of George Eliot he has no time 
to be paging through the book form of the most recent serial 
from a woman’s periodical. These contemporary stories are  
-P-A-G-E-62
  54 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
doubtless entertaining. A teacher of English needs for his 
classroom work a certain equipment which the latest books 
cannot supply adequately. If his youthful reading has been 
wisely chosen he will early in life have made the acquaintance 
of the greatest prose fiction. Endowed with that fortunate 
background, he may read more and more freely among less 
assured productions. Nor need he be dwarfed by an immer- 
sion in standard literature. It is a disturbing revelation to 
know how few of the books mentioned in the particular his- 
tory of literature from which they are teaching, many 
  teachers have even examined, to say nothing of having | 
actually read. Prospective teachers of English may rectify 
this easily by following professorial precept. Teachers in the | 
profession may remedy lacks and fill hiatuses by systema- 
tized indulgence in the most pleasant dissipation in the 
world—the repletion of the mind by reading good books.

  CHAPTER III 
THE CONTENT OF POETRY 
The nature of poetry.—As literary critics are still discuss- 
ing the essentials to be included in an acceptable definition 
of poetry, teachers in high schools need not insist too vigor- 
ously upon securing from young pupils a satisfactory state- 
ment of the component elements of pure poetry. It may bea 
good thing in the early years not to try to define the form, not 
to worry too much over details, not to try to draw a distinct 
line between verse and poetry, not to show boys and girls 
how some writers publish their compositions under the title 
of verses, while others boldly claim the right to designate 
them as poems. Such discussions belong in the last two 
years of high school study. ‘Before that time pupils should 
be taught poetry, rather than facts about poetry. \ When the 
mind is ready for some statement of what real poetry is, the 
definitions in the Encyclopedia Britannica and the Century 
Dictionary may be memorized and explained. If these 
descriptions seem too intricate and abstract for pupils, an 
easy approach may be made by starting with the famous 
definition of the Frenchman who said that poetry was 
unequal lines upon a page with irregular wide margins. A 
further step is provided by the qualities suggested in the 
Encyclopedia Britannica discussion. “No literary expression 
can, properly speaking, be called poetry that is not in a cer-~ 
tain deep sense emotional whatever may be its subject) 
matter, concrete in its method and its diction, rhythmical 
in movement, and artistic in form.” Every word of this, 
every phrase, every implication, must be absolutely clear 
55 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  
  56 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
to the teacher who attempts to lead pupils to a knowledge 
and appreciation of poetry. 
Poetry and verse.—Although he may not care to pass 
on the differences to classes, the teacher will fortify himself 
in discrimination if he reads the illuminating exposition by 
Coleridge of the antithesis of verse and poetry. Doubtless 
this analysis may be made clear to upper class members, as 
they will be interested in the function of science as contrasted 
with the purpose of poetry. Hundreds of critical works will 
show the instructor what men have thought about poetry, 
but no perusal of them can take the place of intimate knowl- 
edge of the most beautiful poetry itself. If he is unmoved by 
finished verse, if supreme poetic achievement leaves him un- 
responsive, if his pulses do not quicken at the movement of 
perfect rhythm, if beauties of assonance, alliteration, onomat- 
opeeia, and rime strike no reverberations in his ear, he will 
have a rather difficult time to make pupils like verse, even 
though he may be able to teach the facts about poems. No 
teacher can be expected to have read all the best poems in the 
English language. He should not, however, substitute for 
good poetry newspaper jingles and humorous weekly effu- 
sions, for these are not successful in developing esthetic and 
philosophic appreciation, both of which are stirred by real 
poetry. 
Not only will material chosen for study and reading be 
different in the seventh year from that in the twelfth, but 
there will be perforce a difference in method of study. This 
difference is more apparent than real, after all, for the most 
simple ballad should be as intellectually and esthetically 
appealing to the twelve year old pupil as is a historical 
dramatic monologue to the eighteen year old senior. 
The meaning of poetry.—The first aspect of poetry to 
be mastered is its content, Contrary to the impression of 
some pupils and adults, poetry does mean something. It is_
-P-A-G-E-65
  THE CONTENT OF POETRY 57 
based on common-sense. It has a logical structure. It 
corresponds to-rigorous and vigorous thinking. All real 
poets have something to say. They have the ability to say 
it effectively.* 
In schools where pupils are forced to read, memorize, and 
recite lines the meaning of which they do not understand, 
there is pernicious teaching. Yet every teacher has met 
boys and girls half through school who have memorized 
dozens of poems without the slightest idea of what the 
stanzasmean. Some may slip into higher grades unawakened 
to the sense value of verse. It is any wonder that under 
such attainments pupils declare they do not like poetry? 
How can they be expected to like it? Convinced that they 
should pretend to like it, in order to placate the teacher’s 
wrath and help the grade for passing, they blandly declare 
that they “like it pretty well,” and ae to luck not to be 
discovered. 
The meaning of the title-—The first sini! about a poem 
which should be studied is its title. This sounds extremely 
simple. If you believe it is the universal starting point for 
study in all classes, walk into a few where Thanatopsis is 
being memorized and ask the pupils what the title means. 
You may be amazed also if you proceed further and ask how 
much hope of existence after death the poem offers. Count- 
less persons believe the poem promises immortality. As a 
matter of fact, only one phrase can be so interpreted, and it is 
not confidently reassuring. (The meaning of the title is en- 
lightening to a beginning student of poetry; it gives him the 
clue to the entire poem; the lines then unroll like a long series 
of pictures bound together by a single idea. Understanding 
the title teaches the poem. Reading the lines carefully with 
the theme clearly in mind makes the pictures vivid, the

-P-A-G-E-66
  58 TEACHING OF ENGLISH sk THE HIGH SCHOOL 
phrases unforgettable, the beauty apparent. The rather 
stoical attitude towards death expressed in these lines may 
be beyond experiences and emotions of young pupils, yet 
they will be able to grasp the general idea if not all the 
philosophy. - Death to them is not a close experience, usually. 
Later in life the calm dignity of Thanatopsis may sustain 
them in face of that unsolved mystery which shares with life 
itself and love the preéminence among all our mundane 
experiences. 
How many pupils know the difference between the words 
poem and ballad? The proper beginning for reading The 
Ballad of the Oysterman should teach that difference so im- 
pressively that it should spring to the mind when the man or 
woman chances upon The Ballad of Reading Gaol. The 
situation and antecedent circumstances of La Belle Dame 
Sans Merci become clear only after the meaning of the title 
has been made clear. Explain who Chapman was, and you 
have made absolutely simple On First Looking into Chapman’s 
Homer. Ten years from now, a study of the title will be 
necessary to induce pupils to appreciate In Flanders Fields. 
No child will see the point of I Have a Rendezvous with Death 
unless the title is made plain by the definition of the French 
word. Before the first stanza is read, every particle of 
meaning and suggestiveness should be drawn from The 
Rime of the Ancient Mariner. The difference between 
mariner and sailor or seaman should be the starting point. 
May ancient suggest ‘“‘of times long past’’ as well as old? 
Is rime usually spelled thus today? What effect has the 
form upon us? How does it look? Has it its ordinary 
modern meaning? Is tale a fair substitution? Will not a 
five minute discussion of such details prepare for the poem 
itself? 
To pupils familiar with the sea, the title Crossing the Bar 
is perfectly plain. To inland pupils the phrase means
-P-A-G-E-67
THE CONTENT OF POETRY 59 
practically nothing. Nor is this title much plainer after 
the poem is read. Not many young persons actually know 
what a pilot does. They have a vague idea that he guides 
ships into port, but how he happens to be on the ship is 
beyond their knowledge. L’Allegro and Il Penseroso are 
too apparent to need any comment here, except that no 
teacher should allow a pupil to translate the latter, “the sad 
man.” If any does, show the error by quoting the conclusion 
of the poem, calling attention to the word pleasures; 
These pleasures, Melancholy, give, 
And I with thee will choose to live. 
Browning’s Prospice and Tennyson’s Idylls of the King 
are plainer after these titles have been discussed. So are 
The Lay of the Last Minstrel and Ode on Intimations of Im- 
mortality from Recollections of Early Childhood. Quite ob- 
viously, study of all the following poems should begin with 
discussions of the titles: The Forsaken Merman, Philomela, 
The Eve of St. Agnes, Cavalier Tunes, Rabbi Ben Ezra, Epitha- 
lamion, On the Late Massacre in Piedmont, A Nocturnal 
Reverie, Retaliation, Ode on a Grecian Urn, English Bards and 
Scotch Reviewers, Address to the Deil, The Rape of the Lock, 
Chevy Chase, The Twa Corbies, The Lost Leader, Auld Lang 
Syne, General Booth Enters into Heaven, Address to the Unco 
Guid, The Higher Pantheism, Old Ironsides, The Man with 
the Hoe, The Paisley Shawl, De Gustibus, Rizpah, Invictus, 
Recessional, Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, The Bridge of 
Sighs, Ivry, Iliad. This invariable direction of making clear 
the title applies to all kinds of poems. In the foregoing list 
are the sonnet, the metrical romance, the old ballad, the 
modern ballad, the ode, the song, the translation, the 
satire, the dramatic monologue, the mock heroic, and the 
epic. 
Study of the diction.—Next to the study of the title of 
   
-P-A-G-E-68
  
60 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
the poem is the consideration of the poem as a unit, unless it 
be too long for such a comprehensive grasp by the pupils. 
An adequate idea of the full significance of poetry can be 
secured only from a complete mastery of the words and 
phrases of which the poem is composed. Contrary to the 
opinion of some impressionistic teachers, thought of the 
highest and most stimulating order may start from an 
examination of single words A large portion of the success 
of poetry is due to the phraseology. Was not one of the 
essentials of the reform of Wordsworth concerned with terms? 
Did not Walt Whitman proudly claim, “I had great trouble 
in leaving out the stock poetical touches, but succeeded at 
last”? In the recent revival of interest in poetry, nearly 
every “school,” from the imagists to the spectrists, has 
asserted certain principles governing the vocabulary of 
poetry. Impressionistic critics are serviceable in the func- 
tioning of esthetic criticism, for their writings are interesting 
and illuminating reading to cultured minds, but the merely 
appreciative appreciator is seldom a good, clear teacher of 
literature.y A knowledge of poetry, even in the earliest grade 
of high school must be based upon an understanding of 
words. \Unless the meanings of words are clearly appre- 
hended, no imaginative picture corresponding to that of the 
poet can be formed in the pupil’s mind. Thus the first, the - 
essential purpose of poetry will be nullified-\(The poet is an 
artist in words, therefore, we must understand his product 
from the response we make to his materials. There is no 
necessity at this place to enforce this dictum by adventitious 
gains displayed in vocabulary building, aids to composition, 
sense of style, spreading of horizon, deepened knowledge of 
life. While every one of these results may be claimed for 
this attention to the terms of poetry, we shall confine the con- 
sideration here to the value in knowing the poem itself. All 
these other things are added to that.
-P-A-G-E-69
THE CONTENT OF POETRY 61 
Difference between prose and poetic diction.—Should 
the teacher begin the study of poetry by a preliminary dis- 
quisition on the differences between prose and poetic diction? 
Good teachers answer in the negative. A sense of these 
differences had better be acquired inductively. The youngest 
high school pupils are not prepared for abstract linguistic 
principles. By the time pupils have reached the upper years 
—if skilfully taught to read, know, and like poetry—they 
will have passed from the thousands of specific instances 
they have met and discussed to the broad, general rules 
concerning the practices of various poets. Teachers in the 
last two years will be able to secure interesting reports on 
broad topics or detailed studies of certain poets, specified 
periods, or single kinds of poems. 
Use of the dictionary——The study of words entails 
dictionary reference in all its phases. The teacher is perform- 
ing an incalculable benefit if he induces or requires continual 
reference work. It must be intelligent, for the entries in a 
dictionary are meaningless to the brain which cannot use 
them intelligently. (Recall the humorous use of this fact in 
Gentle Julia by Mr. Booth Tarkington.) A certain class 
was studying The Finding of the Lyre by Lowell and had 
reached these two lines: 
So there it lay, through wet and dry 
As empty as the last new sonnet. 
As this was a young class they could not be expected to 
perceive the crass inappropriateness of the second line in a 
poem dealing seriously with Mercury’s fashioning of the 
musical instrument, but the pupils could be asked to tell what 
asonnet is. One boy declared that the dictionary defined it, 
“to write poetry.” He was right, only he had not tested this 
definition by the common sense of the line. He had over- 
looked a longer definition of the word a little higher up in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  62 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
column—an explanation of the word as noun, its use in the 
poem. Every teacher can supply countless illustrations of 
this same failure to use material correctly. Teachers should 
anticipate the liability to error because of apparent similarity 
of words. This principle of understanding is applicable to a 
play by Shakespeare, the tales of Chaucer, the lyrics of 
Swinburne, the simple ballads of Longfellow, the oriental 
verses of Kipling—to all poetry. Mention of the English 
curfew requires explanation in any American city where it is 
blown by a factory whistle instead of being rung. The word 
fancy must be understood as love in Elizabethan language. 
Can and could are likely to mean know and knew in Chaucer’s 
Canterbury Tales. 
Unless the pupil knows what the poet’s words mean, he 
will not form in his imagination the picture which the poet 
intended to arouse. 
Denotation and connotation of words.—Coupled within 
literal meaning, often difficult to separate in the teaching of a 
poem, but of more and more importance as the poetry rises in 
the scale of esthetic excellence, is the connotation of a word. 
Every pupil in school can grasp the differences between two 
words meaning practically the same thing. Such a begin- 
ning brings the sense of suggestiveness, the knowledge of 
connotation. The teacher need proffer no elaborate explana- 
tion of what connotation is to have the class seize the idea. 
Connotation is everything a word suggests in addition to 
what it says. Let the teacher mention to the class the word 
queue, then ask the pupils of what they are thinking. At 
once will come the answer, “A Chinaman.” Yet the word 
queue means only plaited hair. What they thought is the 
result of the word’s connotation. This mind-opening exercise 
may be continued with such familiar terms as sombrero, 
bandana, scimitar, tome, chalice, celestial, victuals, snooper. 
Verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and phrases should follow. Pupils
-P-A-G-E-71
THE CONTENT OF POETRY 63 
should be encouraged to note, bring to class, present, and 
discuss signal instances of connotations, as ““He was an 
incisive as well as a decisive speaker.” 
Onomatopeia.—Not less fascinating but introducing 
another aspect to the mere meaning of the word or phrase is 
the quality of onomatopoeia. Perhaps in its most apparent 
form this quality is secured by the form—the rime and 
rhythm—of verse. The sound of such marked lines as those 
imitating the galloping of horses in Paul Revere’s Ride, How 
They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix, The Destruc- 
tion of Sennacherib, and those deliberately chosen for bizarre, 
exotic effects as in The Skeleton in Armor, Hiawatha, The 
Bridge of Sighs, The Last Leaf, need only a comment in 
teaching. Line and phrase effects should never be neglected. 
Both visual response and aural appeal should be recognized 
by even the dullest mind in the class. “Five miles meander- 
ing with a mazy motion” arouses the sensory centers as well 
as it paints a picture upon the imagination. The quality of 
alliteration is not beyond the seventh grade pupil, who may 
begin in that class to recognize and appreciate its use in 
poetry as well as in advertising. The high school senior 
should be made to note and comment on the quality of this 
matchless lyric. 
When the hounds of spring are on winter’s traces, 
The mother of months in meadow or plain 
Fills the shadows and windy places 
With lisp of leaves and ripple of rain. 
The poetry of Milton is full of onomatopeeia artistically 
wedded to the idea. It varies from single lines like the 
description of music, “Linked sweetness, long drawn out,” 
and that of the curfew bell, “Swinging slow with sullen 
roar,” to sequences of lines:  
-P-A-G-E-72
  64 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
Thee, chauntress, oft the woods among 
I woo to hear thy even-song; 
Sweet bird, that shunn’st the noise of folly, 
Most musical, most melancholy. 
Milton will serve to introduce the fuller sense of onomat- 
opeeia as related to meaning by displaying elements of 
harshness, of unpleasant sounds. In the introduction to 
L’ Allegro is this line, purposely grating to the ear, ‘‘’Mongst 
horrid shapes and shrieks and sights unholy.” To show a 
similar effect the teacher should quote the line from Enoch 
Arden: “Cataract over cataract to the sea.” A sustained 
flight of verse in this same tone is the song of the knights at 
the wedding of Arthur in The Idylls of the King. 
Blow trumpet, for the world is white with May; 
Blow trumpet, the long night hath roll’d away! 
Blow thro’ the living world—‘‘Let the King reign.” 
Shall Rome or Heathen rule in Arthur’s realm? 
Flash brand and lance, fall battleaxe upon helm, 
Fall battleaxe, and flash brand! Let the King reign. 
Strike for the King and live! his knights have heard 
That God hath told the King a secret word.. 
Fall battleaxe, and flash brand! Let the King reign. 
Blow trumpet! he will lift us from the dust. 
Blow trumpet! live the strength and die the lust! 
Clang battleaxe, and clash brand! Let the King reign. 
Strike for the King and die! and if thou diest, 
The King is King, and ever wills the highest. 
Clang battleaxe, and clash brand! Let the King reign. 
Blow, for our Sun is mighty in his May! 
Blow, for our Sun is mightier day by day! 
Clang battleaxe, and clash brand! Let the King reign. 
The King will follow Christ, and we the King 
In whom high God hath breathed a secret thing. 
Fall battleaxe, and flash brand! Let the King reign.

  THE CONTENT OF POETRY 65 
Studying the structural divisions.—A unit of understand- 
ing in the study of poem is the unit corresponding to some 
division of the material of the poem. This is frequently 
indicated by section divisions, as in the seven parts of 
The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, by paragraphs, as in 
The Idylls of the King, by strophes, as in odes, by collections 
of stanzas, as in Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage, by breaks in the 
organic structure, as between the octave and sestet of a 
sonnet. Attention to this method of grasping the material 
of a poem is in some classrooms completely unknown, yet it 
is of inestimable help in mastering poems accepted as most 
familiar, yet too often not adequately known. L’Allegro and 
Il Penseroso can hardly be neglected in this way; they divide 
themselves as parallel contrasts. (The introduction of each 
poem consists of ten lines, The body of each poem is in 
marked contrast with the introduction. The next section, 
the invocation to the character personifying the mood, in- 
cludes a list of suitable companions. Then follows an 
imaginative list of pleasures which each kind of man, or the 
same man in contrasted moods might care to experience. 
The teacher who calls these poems “program lyrics” is 
connoting something less beautiful than they are; it would 
be just as fitting and correct to label them time-tables. They 
are not programs. The author did not actually go through 
the day of L’Allegro—he passed in meditative review the 
suggestions of such delights. Notice the provisions for 
different seasons of the year;—“Oft listening”—‘‘ Sometime 
walking”—‘Or, if the earlier season lead” —‘‘ Sometimes, 
with secure delight”—“Towered cities please us then”— 
“There let Hymen oft appear”—‘‘Then to the well-trod 
stage anon,”—“ And ever, against eating cares.’”’ Divisions 
of the day are perfectly clear within the body of the poem— 
dawn, sunrise, morning, noon, afternoon, evening, night. 
The conclusion of only two lines is quite definite, yet few
-P-A-G-E-74
  66 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
teachers see the importance of the future time—‘‘These 
delights if thou canst give, Mirth, with thee I mean to live’— 
when applied to the interpretation that this poem is a medita- 
tive review of the joys offered by this mode of life. The 
material of this lyric is structurally easy of mastery. 
No more difficult in structure is IJ Penseroso. Its sections 
are parallel contrasts in almost every detail. The intro- 
duction is the same in length and identical in intent as 
related to the body of the poem. There are the same indica- 
tions of differing weathers, seasons, and places:—‘‘Oft the 
woods among”—‘ Missing thee, I walk unseen”—“Or if 
the air will not permit”—“Or let my lamp at midnight 
hour’”—“Oft outwatch the Bear”’—‘‘Or unsphere the 
spirit of Plato”—‘Sometime let gorgeous Tragedy”— 
“Oft see me in thy pale career” —‘ Or ushered with a shower.” 
The mention of the curfew in line 74 indicates clearly enough, 
one would think, that the list of meditative delights begins 
quite early in the evening. This opinion is corroborated by 
the definite mention of midnight in line 85. In spite of this, 
one widely-used textbook of English literature bearing upon 
its title-page credit entries of a leading university contains 
this statement to neutralize the accurate teaching of con- 
scientinus instructors: “Jl Penseroso, on the other hand, 
opens at midnight, when the moon is stooping through the 
cloud-drift, [Sic. The poem mentions the moon’s “ highest 
noon” before it speaks of midnight.] and the song of the 
nightingale, ‘most musical, most musical,’ is flooding the 
air.” As has already been stated in this chapter, no pupil 
who says that Il Penseroso is a sad man knows the material 
of this poem, for the conclusion is: 
These pleasures, Melancholy, give 
And I with thee will choose to live 
Suggestiveness in poetry.—When the material of these
-P-A-G-E-75
  THE CONTENT OF POETRY 67 
companion poems has been mastered structurally, a long step 
has been taken towards knowing them in detail and in 
appreciating their suggestive picturesqueness and beauty. 
The significance of every detail should be made clear, the 
idea behind every reference and allusion brought out to show 
its fitness in the theme, the amplified panorama here con- 
densed into a line, a phrase, a word. /These poems are re- 
markably well adapted to serve both as material to teach how 
to read a poem and as material of poetry to be read.) The 
study of L’Allegro should explain the appropriateness of the 
parentage of Euphrosyne. Judgment and criticism begin 
when the pupil explains which pair of parents Milton consid- 
ered the more appropriate. The answer depends upon under- 
standing of the four parenthetical words, “as some sager 
sing.”” Which poet is better—he who tells everything, or he 
who suggests to your imagination and has you fill out the 
picture? Describe fully, then, what you see when you read 
“Laughter holding both his sides.” Every class will provide 
two figures, the ponderous Falstaffian humorist and the 
motleyed court jester. A slight comparative view of kinds of 
poetry is bound to follow an accounting for such names as 
Corydon and Thestylis in an English landscape. Not much 
concerning the pastoral should be taught, but its permanence 
as a heritage from Greece through the Renaissance, its 
existence in all modern European literature, should be ex- 
plained. All the tales of the peasants before the fire, all the 
city evening’ entertainments should be amplified to their 
fullest extent. A pupil led to consider all the phases of 
poetry so far indicated in this chapter, should in studying 
L’ Allegro be ready for the many-sided activity of mind by the 
employment of which only the greatest enjoyment can be 
secured from the highest achievements of this art. Pupils 
should be instructed that they are no longer to read merely 
the words but to read all ’round the words; their minds must
-P-A-G-E-76
  68 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
be alert to seize upon a phrase and dart off to ancient Greek 
my hology to bring back instantaneously an understanding 
of all he poet intended by inserting the name Cerberus. As 
they read with their eyes, their ears must hear the daintiness 
in the description of the dance, ‘“‘Come and trip it as ye go.” 
From early reading in Hans Christian Andersen they must 
seize the story which furnishes the clue to the understanding 
and pleasure of the tale of the threshing lubber fiend. The 
sight of the name Hymen must conjure up the joys of all 
wedding ceremonies. They must hear ravishing strains of 
music as they read the tribute to its power. 
The study of Il Penseroso can be made just as illuminating, 
just as productive of delight, knowledge, and discrimination. 
Every high school pupil should be able to see at once the 
difference between Orpheus and Morpheus, and while reading 
the latter name to think of morphine. The citation of the 
Muses should awaken a Greek reminiscence, but it should 
not be led by the teacher to a mispronunciation of Terpsichore, 
then on to a class discussion of the dance, concluding with a 
preceptorial general condemnation of modern dancing. This 
social reform has nothing to do with Milton’s beautiful lyric. 
It draws pupils too far away from a subsidiary detail of the 
poem. It exhibits disproportionate emphasis. By the time 
Il Penseroso has been studied, pupils should know which of 
the two poems makes provision for old age, and be able to 
offer an intelligent reason for the difference. They should 
express their preference of pleasures, and further discriminate 
concerning the relative qualities of the two poems. 
If Lycidas is studied the same plan of mastering its contents 
can be based upon its structural arrangements. Milton has 
indicated the sections of his thought very clearly by both 
indentations and phrases. The poem divides itself into a 
series of paragraphs each marked by a single emotional stress 
enduring for only a short time, as the poet knew that strong  
-P-A-G-E-77
THE CONTENT OF POETRY 69 
passion does not last long, and as he also realized that even a 
poem of grief must be varied to be interesting. The sections 
may be conveniently indicated by such expressions as these: 
occasion of the elegy, references to companionship, the lament 
of nature, questioning the nymphs, the reward of life’s toils, 
fixing the blame, the church’s loss, flowers to deck the hearse, 
the false surmise, the loss of the body in the sea, the spirit in 
heaven, the hope for others; conclusion, the poet’s lament 
and departure to “fresh woods and pastures new.” 
Many of the poems of Burns can be mastered because the 
poet made his material correspond with the structure. A 
large number may be studied in this manner. To a Mouse 
will illustrate to a class better than others the real significance 
of the definition of lyric poetry. This poem, based on an 
actual event, begins with nothing personal. It deals with 
the tim’rous beastie, saying not a thing about the poet, 
through all of the first six stanzas. In the seventh there is a 
change from the mouse to all mankind, whose best laid 
schemes gang aft a-gley. As yet there is no definite personal 
application. This appears only in the concluding stanza. 
Still thou art blest, compar’d wi’ me; 
The present only toucheth thee: 
But och! I backward cast my e’e 
On prospects drear! 
An’ forward, tho’ I canna see, 
I guess an’ fear! 
Exactly similar in structure is To a Mountain Daisy, except 
that the transition from the modest, crimson-tipped flower is 
made by an application of the daisy’s fall to the betrayal of 
an artless maid. The last three stanzas describe the fate of a 
bard on life’s rough ocean luckless starred, without citing 
the poet himself until the last stanza of the poem. Yet the 
personal application is clear from the first mention of the
-P-A-G-E-78
    
70 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
bard. The dreary outlook is the poet’s own; the flower and 
the maid are parallels to his own nature. The wail from his 
heart is none the less bitter because he speaks in the second 
person. “‘E’en thou who mournst the daisy’s fate, That 
fate is thine—no distant date.” To a Louse is built in exactly 
the same manner. In this poem the conclusion is not a per- 
sonal, but a universal reflection. The Address to the Deil has 
two stanzas of introduction—direct apostrophe to the 
“chief of many throned powers”; then follow short descrip- 
tions and rapid narrations of his power, finally the conclusion 
of two stanzas jocularly tells how auld Cloots may be cheated 
by the rantin’ bardie, who when he thinks of “yon den” can 
sympathize with its occupant, the Devil himself. 
In spite of claims by poets themselves and a wide-spread 
impression that contemporaneous verse has freed itself 
from most tenets of form, it is possible to begin the study of 
free-verse units by a search for structural planning. A good 
example is Chicago by Mr. Carl Sandburg. The space 
arrangement enforces the progressionof the phases of the idea. 
The conclusion follows the most regular plan—it repeats the 
introduction. Less apparent is the plan of The Hotel by Miss 
Harriet Monroe. Yet no pupil would fail to arrange the plan 
after a single attentive perusal. From the glamorous part 
of the hotel seen by everyone—the marble corridors—details 
follow until the sleeping-rooms are listed. Then the poet 
passes to the clothes, to the persons within the clothes, the 
souls within the bodies, God within the souls. 
At times a poet may destroy the correspondence between 
material and structure deliberately, almost, it seems, wilfully. 
One of the most memorable instances of this is in The Rime 
of the Ancient Mariner. Five of the six divisions of the seven 
parts are adroitly placed to emphasize the progress of the 
story. These are of the greatest help in teaching the poem. 
The first marks the shooting of the albatross, the second  
-P-A-G-E-79
  THE CONTENT OF POETRY 71 
the hanging of the bird from the Mariner’s neck, the third 
the flight of the souls sounding like the whizz of the cross- 
bow, the fourth the dropping of the bird into the sea, the 
sixth the hope that the Hermit will wash away the blood. 
But the fifth division seems to have no relation to the story. 
It occurs in the course of a conversation between two spirits, 
which has reached no definite point at the division. 
Summary of methods for understanding poetry.—The 
discussion so far has suggested that the meaning of poetry be 
the first aim sought in studying it. As contributing directly 
to this essential, there should be consideration of the meaning 
of the title; study of the diction of the poem, including 
reference to the dictionary, discrimination between prose and 
poetic diction, response to connotation of words and ono- 
matopceia; attention to the structural divisions of poems; 
and response to the suggestiveness of poetry. 
The foregoing suggestions are not definite, comprehensive 
methods for studying any single poem. They are intended 
to indicate methods for utilizing the obvious parts, plans, 
qualities, and thoughts of poems, by means of which pupils 
may be shown how to master the first essential of great 
poetry—the material. They are general directions for 
winning for poetic treatment the same respect accorded 
matter-of-fact prose, for dispelling an impression that poetry 
is plunged in vagueness unworthy of penetration, for arousing 
the recognition that poetry is more than an esthetic soporific. 
Poetry and the imagination.—So far the part played by 
the study of poetry in appealing to the imagination and 
developing it has been mentioned merely incidentally. It is 
incredible that a youth, at an age when imagination is most 
active, should study poetry and not have his imagination 
kindled. Many teachers, perhaps, do not realize that the 
imagination can work only with what it knows, passing from 
what is familiar to new combinations and strange aspects, but
-P-A-G-E-80
  
72 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
always utilizing a clear idea as the point of departure. An 
acceptance of this will save many a false or wasteful begin- 
ning in poetry. A teacher who had seen the glory of night in 
Arabia might pardonably be enthusiastic about utilizing 
that experience in teaching to a class of eighth grade pupils 
the poem Night by Southey. But the pupils did not respond. 
Rapid readjustment to actual conditions resulted in transfer 
to Gilpin’s Ride, followed by Lochinvar. Similarly, if a teacher 
were expected to deal with the fourth book of Palgrave’s 
Golden Treasury in the tenth year, he would be making a 
wrong start to begin with the first selection and follow the 
order of the book. Three of the first four poems—To the 
Muses by Blake, Ode on the Poets by Keats, Love by Cole- 
ridge—will be difficult. He can find better poems for the 
opening lesson: Lucy Gray, Ye Mariners of England, Battle of 
the Baltic, Burial of Sir John Moore, Simon Lee. Not all the 
poems included in this section can be taught to best advan- 
tage this early in the high school, e. g., Ode to a Nightingale, 
Ode to the West Wind, Ode on Intimations of Immortality. 
Developing the imagination—The simplest poem can 
be used to develop imagination. A more direct, unadorned 
tale can hardly be found than The Wreck of the Hesperus, yet 
it contains lines from which a humble beginning may be made 
in culture of the imagination. The story is easily enough 
mastered. No teacher should rest content with the mere 
retelling of the events. Every word, every phrase, every 
line, every stanza, should be made absolutely clear, prefer- 
ably by the recitations of the pupils. Where their knowledge, 
logical deductions, and intelligent guesses fail, the teacher 
should elucidate. What are some of the difficulties for a 
child, almost unnoticed by an adult, therefore requiring all 
the keener analysis by the teacher of the material from the 
standpoint of the pupil? Most members of the class will not 
know where the Spanish Main is, in spite of childhood reading 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
THE CONTENT OF POETRY 73 
  about pirates. The description of the moon should be made 
perfectly clear. If this class has read Sir Patrick Spens, the 
corresponding—but more poetical—description of the moon’s 
weather indication in it should be recalled. Hardly a pupil 
will know what brine is. The description of the dashing 
vessel must be clear in every one’s mind. Why was she like 
a sheeted ghost? Why is “trampling” a better word to 
describe the surf than “tramping?”’ The pupils must 
be made to see the frozen crew swept away like icicles. 
“Shrouds” must be explained, especially if it is accepted by 
pupils as “shrouds” meaning burial robes. “Sheathed in 
ice” will be clearer if the sheath of a sword is mentioned. 
Few children know the meaning of “went by the board” even 
though the context seems to make it plain, or of “she stove.” 
Study which regards these details is contributing to every 
result which can be secured from careful consideration of 
poetry. No claim can be made for any inherent beauty 
in this ballad, nor for any noble appeal to the imagination, 
but the principle underlying the study of all poetry governs 
such a simple beginning as this affords. The same methods 
may be used in a poem as long as The Lady of the Lake, or 
later in the course, in so compact a form as the sonnet, 
Ozymandias or The World Is Too Much with Us. In The 
Rime of the Ancient Mariner attempts must include a wider 
field of knowledge, a longer period of time, a keener sense of 
life values. To illuminate the thread of the plot there must 
be a deal of supplemental inquiry ranging from particular 
superstitions, through supernatural mysteries, to historical 
aspects of religions. The imagination will be stirred con- 
tinually with definite vivid pictures, not in outline only, but 
tinted brilliantly with the colors stipulated by Coleridge. 
Approaching the higher forms of poetry.—In the study 
of the supposedly most difficult poetry, as well as in the 
presentation of the easily assimilated, the method of ap-
-P-A-G-E-82
  74 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
proach is all-important. If an upper class is about to begin a 
study of the poetry of Browning, it might read or re-read his 
Pied Piper of Hamelin. High school pupils always take 
kindly to a person who has a large share of the saving grace 
of humor. This poet’s productions need an attentive imag- 
inative response demanded by those of few other writers. 
A good short poem to illustrate the requirement is My Last 
Duchess. This the teacher should read and explain to the 
class. He should explain the need of a background for all 
Browning’s poetry, informing the class of the poet’s prodi- 
gious knowledge and amazing keenness. In a few words he 
should introduce them to the term “dramatic monologue” 
and make it clear. Then he should turn to the poem itself. 
Browning intended that the single word “ Ferrara”’ after the 
title should be eloquently connotative to the reader. As 
pupils never know much about the Italian Renaissance, the 
teacher should in a few words give a picture of the glory and 
wickedness suggested by the name. 
My Last Duchess.—It is better that the teacher 
read the poem, pausing as often as necessary to indicate 
the situation, any change in the speaker, in fact to illuminate 
in every way the present events and the past tragedy. The 
scene is easy to grasp—below, the gay gathering of lords and 
ladies, here on the stairs, the representative sent to discuss 
the marriage terms of the probable next duchess. As the 
two men slowly descend, the Duke stops upon the landing, 
draws aside the curtain, and begins to speak. The class must 
be made to explain the compliment in the imagined remarks 
of the painter. A few words should analyze slightly the 
annoyance of the arrogant husband at his wife’s happy 
innocence. The teacher should emphasize his pride in his 
nine-hundred-years-old name, his sense of caste, his feeling of 
proprietorship in everything belonging to him, most of all, his 
beautiful wife. More dazzling is the flash in his boast,  
-P-A-G-E-83
  THE CONTENT OF POETRY 75 
“And I choose never to stoop.”’ The pupils should have 
their attention directed to the fact that Browning does not 
tell what the husband did, or what occurred. The reading 
should be suspended for just a short interval to allow every 
person to decide in his own mind what he believes happened. 
That the fair young wife died there is no doubt; only about © 
the method of her going is the poet silent. A comment 
should make clear the significance of the Duke’s protest 
about the dowry, for youthful listeners do not always know 
the artistic value of denying a thing. The last few lines are 
excellent to indicate suggestiveness in few words. The 
pupils must be led to see the two men rise, the visitor drawing 
back slightly in deference to the other’s rank as Duke and 
host, they must see the suavity with which the visitor is 
allowed to descend as an equal. And they must understand 
that the guest doubtless has his mind on the portrait, while 
the Duke has evidently dismissed it from his hardened 
consciousness, already alert for the effect his next object of 
art will make upon his companion. 
Pupils who have been shown in this manner how to read 
Browning will be quite able to get pleasure from Fra Lippo 
Lippi, Andrea Del Sarto, Saul, and Evelyn Hope. 
Rabbi Ben Ezra.—A similar approach should be 
offered to Rabbi Ben Ezra. First of all, the teacher should 
be careful that the text under his pupils’ eyes is correctly 
printed. There are in high schools books in which the form 
of this poem is badly mangled. In order to save space, the 
stanzas are printed as quatrains, the first and third lines 
having internal rimes produced by the short lines. So many 
unthinking older persons tell young ones that their teens are 
the happiest times of their lives that they almost believe it, 
whereas the slightest amount of keen self-analysis would 
prove to them that their own hopes of happiness contradict 
this statement. The skilful teacher will seize this as a start-
-P-A-G-E-84
  76 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
ing-point to win at least a respectful attention to the glorious 
sermon of the venerable Rabbi. Most high school pupils 
live in anticipation of more happiness at graduation, some 
when they enter college, when they finish, when they marry, 
enter business, or have families, or retire for a placid old age. 
All life exhibits this optimistic trust in the delights of the 
years to come. Mankind hopes to be happier later. It is the 
underlying, unquenchable preservative of the human race. 
A few minutes’ simple discussion of this trait of human 
nature will open the minds of high school pupils in the two 
upper years to understand nearly all of this poem. A con- 
venient contrast is apparent if the class has read the same 
idea in different guise in The Old Man Dreams by Oliver 
Wendell Holmes. Then the class must be asked to see the 
venerable old preacher—perhaps before his congregation— 
propounding this noble philosophy. The teacher must be 
equipped with a universal alertness and a power of clear 
exposition in simple language to make plain such ideas as the 
paradox of apparent failure, the mutual dependence of 
flesh and spirit, the measure of intention rather than result, 
the figure of life as potter’s clay (many persons have no idea 
of how pottery is shaped), and the comparative merit of the 
daring of youth and the judgment of age. 
Ode on Intimations of Immortality——A method exactly 
similar should be followed in teaching Wordsworth’s Ode on 
Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Child- 
hood. As persons have a preconception concerning old age 
which must be removed before Rabbi Ben Ezra becomes clear, 
so they have an interpretation of immortality after death 
which must be extended to existence before coming to earth 
before they can participate in the beauty of Wordsworth’s 
poetry. With this logical extension of the meaning of the 
word immortality, the study of the poem becomes less 
difficult. The ordinary conception of immortality is exist-
-P-A-G-E-85
THE CONTENT OF POETRY 77 
   ence after death, yet logically the idea is unceasing existence. 
It must extend into the past as well as into the future. 
Centering his thoughts upon the previous existence of the 
soul, the poet describes how the child, still surrounded by his 
recollections of the glory from which he so recently came, 
perceives it gradually fade as the appearances of this world 
take his interest, and occupy his attention. The teacher 
should explain that appreciation of this beautiful poetry has 
nothing to do with what any reader may believe. All that is 
necessary is a temporary acceptance of Wordsworth’s 
theme—which the poet himself makes quite clear in a note. 
Having prepared pupils for the reception of the poem, the 
teacher need merely be careful that all the strophes, rimes, 
and phrases are understood in relation to this central theme 
of the poem. In this kind of development of receptivity 
lies the greatest opportunity of the teacher of literature. 
Great poets need only the opportunity to make themselves 
heard and understood to win appreciation. The teacher must 
never forget for an instant that poetry—originally addressed 
to mature adults—will make its way into the consciousness of 
youths only if properly presented. The method here de- 
scribed may be applied to any poem, the material of which 
embodies an idea or conception novel to the reader. It is as 
necessary for an understanding of The Hound of Heaven 
by Francis Thompson, for The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, 
for The Forsaken Merman, for In Memoriam, for The Rape of 
the Lock. It must not be assumed that the preliminary 
presentation is always necessary before reading the poem. 
The explanation of the new idea may be required further 
along. One illustration will suffice. Wordsworth’s Lines 
Composed a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey may be started by 
almost any pupil, although this poem belongs as far up in the 
high school as it may be placed. The first explanation will be 
helpful to fix in the minds the four ways in which the poet has
-P-A-G-E-86
  
78 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
regarded nature. His enumeration of his changing love is so 
compact, so filled with words the meanings of which speakers 
do not carefully limit, that hasty or unattentive reading will 
pass them over too quickly to arouse discriminating re- 
sponses in the imagination. These four are an unrestrained 
animal enjoyment of the outdoor world, then a passion, 
later an appetite for its calming and elevating influence, and 
last a communion with a spiritual presence behind nature’s 
visible forms. Perhaps some comment will be needed to make 
quite clear the statement, “ Knowing that nature never did 
betray the heart that loved her,” because the single word 
betray is here used in a slightly unusual sense. 
Adapting the foregoing methods to other poems.— 
Modifications of the plans outlined in this chapter for teach- 
ing the contents of poetry may be used for practically any 
poem. In some cases preliminary discussion may be reduced 
to the slightest, in others it will have to be amplified to 
include many more related phases. An example of this is 
The Rape of the Lock for which some account should be given 
of the definite occasion which induced the poem, and the 
customs and costumes of the period it depicts. What may 
seem to the adult the simplest lyric may be based upon an 
assumption, a detail of knowledge, an interpretation of life 
quite beyond or outside the pupil’s experience. The con- 
scientious teacher will by exercising the second phase of his 
nature—the vicarious participation in the mental growth of 
his pupils—strive to anticipate difficulties arising from the 
impact of novel ideas and prepare clear, interesting explana- 
tions of them. In this manner the teaching of poetry may 
be made for both instructor and taught, a vitally valuable 
and fascinating part of the teaching of English.

CHAPTER IV 
THE FORM OF POETRY 
Recognition of the form of poetry.—No American school 
child can suddenly realize as did Monsieur Jourdain in 
Moliére’s Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme that he has been speaking 
prose all his life without knowing it, for in the earliest ele- 
mentary grades the difference between prose and verse is 
made apparent. Later the usual school reading and reciting 
of a pupil indicate that there are two main manners of ex- 
pressing ideas in words. The form of poetry will strike the 
eye of an observing child not only in school books but in the 
young people’s magazines, in the newspapers, in street car 
advertisements, and upon sign boards. So it is a mistake to 
say that comprehension of the form of poetry is beyond the 
high school age. It is quite true that a painstaking practice 
in verse scansion and a deliberate forcing of verse composi- 
tion may not be worth the time consumed to master them, 
but it is not correct to say that an amazing degree of pro- 
ficiency even in this technical skill cannot be reached before 
the senior year. The scansion of the most irregular poem by 
Browning is not more difficult than some of the proofs in solid 
geometry or trigonometry. The form of the rondeau is as 
easy to memorize as are the provisions of the covenant of the 
League of Nations. The only basis for deciding whether such 
practices be followed in high schools is whether the results 
justify the time and energy. 
Form should be considered.—It is a safe rule that no 
‘poem is known unless its form is at least apprehended. In 
order that form may be made a sensible thing to pupils, the 
19
-P-A-G-E-88
ee 
80 la OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
teacher must know a great deal more about verse structure 
than he need ever impart. Form is not the essential quality 
of poetry—he must believe and teach that truth; but he 
must know at the beginning or he must learn from his class- 
room exercises, that form marks practically all the poetry he 
will be called upon to study with his pupils. He may wax 
enthusiastic over the poetical passages of Ruskin, of George 
Meredith, the Bible, but seldom will he be asked to teach these 
passages as poetry. The body of material for study in high 
schools is fairly well recognized, depending as it does upon 
an acceptance of the world’s masterpieces by a few acknowl- 
edged poets. Even the tendency to introduce recent and 
contemporary verse has not changed the recognition of form, 
for the first striking characteristic of free verse, be it that of 
Walt Whitman or Miss Amy Lowell, is its appearance upon 
the printed page. Pupils will hardly grasp all the nuances of 
the explanations published by the artists and artisans of 
the contemporary popular outpourings; to them cadences 
will be form in spite of protests of the versifiers; so we may 
return to the pronouncement that to the adolescent poetry 
is marked by form. 
Teaching rhythm.—No one who lives can escape rhythm. 
All the sounds and movements of nature exhibit it. It is the 
most easily sensed of all marks of verse. The teacher of 
English who has been trained in Latin and Greek prosody 
must accept the characteristic of rhythm in English as based 
on accent. If he still persists in thinking of quantity—longs 
and shorts—he is sure to have some unpleasant times when 
he meets it—one of the shortest words in our language— 
strongly accented, while strefched—a much longer word in 
time—bears no stress. He will see the difference between 
the two schemes if he acknowledges that in Latin a dactyl, 
one long and two short syllables, corresponds to four-four 
time in music, a half note followed by two quarter notes; 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
  
  THE FORM OF POETRY 81 
while in English a dactyl, one accented syllable followed by 
two unaccented syllables, corresponds to three-four time in 
music with a strong beat upon the first count. Specialists and 
refiners declare that it is, even in English, next to impossible 
to accent a syllable without lengthening it, but such con- 
comitant relationship need not be introduced into any class- 
room discussion. Another reason why English has been 
confused with Latin prosody is because so many teachers 
have used for the marking of verse the symbols used in the 
classic grammars. A straight line stands for a long vowel 
or syllable, a curved line for a short vowel or syllable. In 
our dictionaries accented syllables are indicated by an accent 
mark. Let us carry this over to our marking of verse, in- 
dicating unaccented syllables by a cross, as in multiplication. 
Besides the fact that long and short marks do not accurately 
represent the qualities of English rhythm, the straight and 
curved lines lose their direction when rapidly written, so that 
their significance is difficult to decipher. On the contrary, 
crosses and accents may always be recognized. In addition, 
they may be jotted down much more rapidly than the in- 
correct classical signs. 
Teach four kinds of rhythm. “Pour more or less usual 
rhythm units are recognized in English verse. These are the 
iambus, the trochee, the anapest, the dactyl. Two other 
verse feet occurring infrequently are the spondee and the 
-pyrrhic. The iambus is a verse foot (ask a pupil to explain 
why the unit should be called a foot rather than a hand or a 
‘head) of two syllables, the second of which is accented. The 
trochee is the reverse—a foot of two syllables, the first of 
which is accented. The anapest is a foot of three syllables, 
the last of which is accented. The dactyl is a foot of three 
syllables, the first of which is accented. The spondee is a 
foot of two syllables, both of which are accented. The pyrrhic 
is a foot of two syllables, neither of which is accented. Ask 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  
82 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
pupils whether an entire poem can be written in spondees, or 
in pyrrhics. These feet may be graphically represented. 
iambus x ’ dactyl’ xx 
trochee ’ x spondee / ’ 
anapest x x ’ pyrrhic x x 
After a class has learned these forms a rapid drill should 
be based on such questions as these: Which feet have two 
syllables? Which three? In which is the first syllable 
accented? The last? The second? The third? In which 
is the first syllable unaccented? The last? Which feet have 
the same effect in sound? Explain why. Which might be 
termed opposites? Which name is accented as the foot it 
names? Cite a few words which are examples of these verse 
feet. Recite single lines of verse and tell the prevailing 
rhythm. How does a knowledge of the rhythm aid in read- 
ing, or appreciating? What effects can you feel or hear in 
the different rhythms? Do any sound like galloping horses? 
Do you know of any poems to support your impression? 
(Pupils in one seventh grade who had just recited The 
Destruction of Sennacherib sensed this correspondence. 
Paul Revere’s Ride clinched it.) 
Teach the effect of variety——For pupils, substitutions 
of verse feet had better be explained as they are met, but two 
general practices may be announced or deduced in the 
beginning. Iambic and anapestic feet are interchangeable. 
So also are trochaic and dactylic. The reasons are obvious. 
The next usual substitution—there is no need to label 
it an irregularity—is the placing of a trochee for an iambus 
anywhere in the line, usually after a pause. Ask a pupil why 
so many trochees occur in the beginning of lines. Spondees 
and pyrrhics occur infrequently. To the casual reader of 
poetry, this knowledge is of paramount value in showing the 
beauty and sense of lines, for such substitutions provide the 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
THE FORM OF POETRY 83 
countless variations which make of great poetry such a thing 
of sounding beauty, while they also aid the poet in throwing 
emphasis where the rhetorical sense requires it. 
~- When most I wink, then do mine eyes most see. 
To be or not to be, that is the question. 
Day after day; day after day; 
We stuck, nor breath nor motion. 
Little we see in nature that is ours. 
Teach the value of pauses.—Pupils must be taught the 
value of pauses in poetry. The artistic device of omitting 
syllables, at times even an entire foot, will show them the 
skill of the poet in securing effects. Let them see that the 
first line of Break, break, break is exactly the same in value 
as the first line of any other stanza, even though it contains 
only the three accented syllables, while the corresponding 
line of the second stanza contains eight syllables. 
As the ninth year in high school is such a crucial period in 
education, it may be a mistake to burden pupils with names, 
but it is not a mistake to point out to them sources of beauty 
and elements of form. This opinion is as applicable to what 
has immediately preceded as what is about to follow. No 
degree of indifference in the teacher is going to prevent 
pupils from noticing differences in lengths of lines. In spite of 
his belief that they must not be burdened by technical details 
they are going to recognize the difference in The Raven and 
The Last Leaf. In the tenth year they should be learning 
the names of lines in the poetry they study. They will rec- 
ognize and name monometer, dimeter, trimeter, tetramter, 
pentameter, hexameter, or they will describe the lines as 
three-accent lines, etc. Distinction between the hexame- 
ter and the alexandrine is hardly necessary until they meet 
the six-foot iambic line. Their reading of Longfellow will in 
all probability have fixed the dactylic line in their minds.
-P-A-G-E-92
  
  84 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
Teach the nature of rime.—While not all poetry has this 
quality, rime is an adjunct of verse. Perhaps a great many 
unintelligent people associate the presence of rime with 
all kinds of poetry, finding in rime poetry’s most marked 
characteristic. Accurately defined, rime is the correspond- 
ence in sound of the accented syllables of two words and 
everything which follows. Pupils in school have to be shown 
that condition does not rime with determination even though 
the last syllables correspond exactly. The reason this is not 
considered rime is that the vowel in the accented syllable is 
different in condition from the vowel in the accented syllable 
of determination. In the case of a single syllable riming with 
a single syllable the vowel correspondence and the likeness of 
all that follows are very easy to distinguish, yet there are a 
great many inexact rimes due to mere likeness of sound in- 
stead of absolute correspondence, as for instance noon and 
June, true and too, both of which are inexact rimes. The 
easiest method of riming is to make one syllable correspond 
with another syllable. This is called single rime or masculine 
rime. Frequently two syllables correspond with two sylla- 
bles. In this case the rime is called double or feminine. 
Triple, quadruple, and quintuple rimes do occur in English 
but their effect is decidedly humorous, jesting, clever. Lord 
Byron in the scoffing passages of his Don Juan perpetrated 
some of the most remarkable instances of these multiple 
rimes. Only seldom is an author able to use more than double 
rime and preserve dignity and seriousness in his treatment. 
The most signal existence in English verse of this ability is in 
The Bridge of Sighs by Thomas Hood. This poem is a 
masterful tour de force for its meter is hardly more than comic 
patter. The wonderful choice of theme, the impressive 
details, and the seriousness of treatment make it a master- 
piece in a form which might have resulted in bathos and 
ridiculousness.
-P-A-G-E-93
  
  THE FORM OF POETRY 85 
Rime is not the only correspondence of sound which is 
found in verse, but in modern English verse it is the only 
sound correspondence which is the distinguishing mark of the 
form. It clearly tags the ends of lines. Even when it occurs 
in the middle of a line, it serves not so much to mark that 
point as the end of the preceding line or the same line with 
which it rimes. This is illustrated perfectly in The Raven by 
Poe. 
Teach other sound-correspondences.—A lliteration.—The 
second sound-correspondence in verse is alliteration. 
Alliteration is the correspondence of sound at the beginning 
of successive words in series. Frequently students get the 
impression that alliteration is a matter of spelling, but it is 
essentially and only a matter dependent upon sound. In 
Anglo-Saxon verse the form of the line was based upon three 
words which alliterated—two in the first half of the line, one 
in the second. This was the form on which all Anglo-Saxon 
poetry was based. Its last appearance in English poetry of 
any consequence was in The Vision of Piers Plowman in 
which its archaic effect repels readers. Since then it has not 
disappeared entirely from English poetry but has been used 
as a beautifier of the expression and a means of securing 
onomatopeeia. Specimens of this are so frequent that it is 
unnecessary to quote any at this place. It can be made, if 
used skilfully by a master of English sound, one of the most 
beautiful, subtle accomplishments of great poetry. In the 
hands of a third-rate stringer of words it becomes an annoy- 
ance to the ear, an evidence of fastidiousness, and proof of 
word-jugglery. Verse of this level is better unadorned. 
Pupils who are never too ready to grasp some of the details 
and principles can be held to some regard for this device 
when their attention is drawn to the value it has in advertis- 
ing, not only in the high-sounding phrases of the circus 
dodger, but also in the more dignified publicity of the highly 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
    
86 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
trained copywriter. A teacher interested in the tech- 
nicalities of language as a thing of beauty should never 
pass without comment a phrase, part of the effect of 
which depends upon the apparent or unobtrusive use of al- 
literation. 
Assonance.—If rime be considered as correspondence 
of one end of words, and alliteration correspondence in sound 
of the beginning of words, there is a third quality, which is 
sound-correspondence of the middles of words, that is, of the 
vowels. In Spanish poetry this quality is used frequently 
instead of rime at the end of lines. An appreciation of sound 
due to the same vowels seems to satisfy the Spanish ear as 
marking off the ends of lines. In the following the three 
words rocinante, talle, and Cervantes assonate because the 
vowels a and ¢ occur in the last two syllables. 
peice co un hombre 
Que de un flaco rocinante 
A la vuelta de esa esquina 
Se aped, y en rostro y talle 
Parece a aquel Don Quixote 
De quien Miguel de Cervantes 
Escribié las aventuras. 
In English verse assonance has always been an adjunct to 
the beauty of expression and a means of securing tone color 
or onomatopceia. Any one who writes poetry knows he can 
find a thousand illustrations of the beauty and emphasis, the 
tone and mood produced by this quality of sound. Those 
students who become interested in the reasons for the effect, 
and the methods by which it is produced will enjoy analyzing 
phrases, lines, stanzas, and poems in order to trace the re- 
lationship between sound and effect. One of the best in- 
stances of this critical ability is in an essay by Edgar Allan 
Poe, The Rationale of Verse. A striking illustration is in 
Milton’s sonnet on The Late Massacre in Piedmont, which
-P-A-G-E-95
  
THE FORM OF POETRY 87 
Macaulay declared sounds like a noble prayer written by some 
early father of the church. 
Avenge, O Lord, thy slaughtered saints, whose bones 
Lie scattered on the Alpine mountains cold; 
Even them who kept thy truth so pure of old, 
When all our fathers worshiped stocks and stones, 
Forget not: in thy book record their groans 
Who were thy sheep, and in their ancient fold 
Slain by the bloody Piedmontese, that rolled 
Mother with infant down the rocks. Their moans 
The vales redoubled to the hills, and they 
To heaven. Their martyred blood and ashes sow 
O’er all the Italian fields, where still doth sway 
The triple tyrant; that from these may grow 
A hundredfold, who, having learnt thy way, 
Early may fly the Babylonian woe. 
Shakespeare replaced rime by assonance in the song at the 
end of Twelfth Night. 
When that I was and a tiny little boy, 
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain, 
A foolish thing was but a toy, 
For the rain it raineth every day. 
George Eliot in The Spanish Gypsy attempted to re- 
produce the quality of Spanish poetry in the song from which 
the following stanzas are quoted. 
Maiden, crowned with glossy blackness 
Lithe as panther forest-roaming, 
Long-armed naiad, when she dances, 
On a stream of ether floating— 
Bright, O bright Fedalma! 
Pure as rain-tear on a rose-leaf, 
Cloud high-born in noonday spotless, 
Sudden perfect as the dew-bead, 
Gem of earth and sky begotten— 
Bright, O bright Fedalma.
-P-A-G-E-96
88 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
Onomatopeia.—The beauty of assonance depends upon 
very easily determined factors. There are certain vowel and 
consonant sounds which are always associated with certain 
effects. Notice in Milton’s sonnet how many o’s there are 
and how beautifully they reinforce the tone of the entire 
poem. There are beautiful sounds in English, there are 
harsh sounds in English, so that assonance may contribute to 
harmony or discord. For the student of literature the im- 
portant fact is that the use of all these various qualities 
depends upon a knowledge of the resources of the language 
and a skilful, creative instinct in their appropriate and proper 
use. At their best, assonance and alliteration contribute to 
the onomatopceia by means of which the sense of a passage is 
enforced by the sound. The poetry of every nation has 
exhibited this remarkable combination. Naturally as most 
poets have endeavored to produce beautiful poems, there 
are more instances of onomatopeeia to produce this effect 
than the opposite, but some poets have dared to use ono- 
matopceia to serve the opposite purpose. Milton did this in 
L’ Allegro when he wrote the line, “’Mongst horrid shapes and 
shrieks and sights unholy.”’ Tennyson was not striving for | 
ugliness but metallic flash when he made the wedding song in 
Arthur’s court repeat so frequently, ‘‘Clang battle-axe and 
clash brand, let the King reign.” (See the poem, page 64.) It 
is the easiest thing in the world to burlesque the uses of sound 
in verse. Nothing shows better the terrible effectiveness of 
these qualities misdirected than the speech of Bottom: 
The raging rocks 
And shivering shocks 
Shall break the locks 
Of prison gates; 
And Phibbus’ car 
Shall shine from far 
And make and mar 
The foolish Fates.
-P-A-G-E-97
  
THE FORM OF POETRY 89 
Teach the stanza form with the poem.—lIn the first year 
of high school, pupils should be expected to know the forms 
of stanzas in poems they study. The emphasis should be 
placed in such terms upon the contents, but the form should 
not be entirely neglected. The stanzas of the simpler poems 
suited to these first analyses are likely to be as simple as the 
material. There is no reason why a child capable of under- 
standing Lochinvar or The Wreck of the Hesperus should not 
be able to describe the stanza form. In the tenth year, the 
correct names of the stanzas encountered should be mastered. 
The couplet and the triplet are too apparently logically 
named to require any explanation. The quatrain introduces 
the possibility of various rime schemes. Every different one 
should be commented upon as it is met. Early ballads and 
later imitations are the easiest to write because four lines can. 
be produced upon a single pair of rimes—abcb. Next in 
skill required are the forms abab and aabb. Easy to write 
but not frequently used are the forms abbb and aaba, al- 
though mature readers have met this latter form in The 
Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. The form usually called the 
In Memoriam quatrain, abba, had been used by many 
poets before Tennyson made it so well known, but his power 
and effect have practically identified the unusual form with 
his great elegy. Its irregular sequence—abba—sounds 
peculiar to most ears; the expected rime for the first line does 
not come at the end of the third line, instead there is heard 
the rime of the second, giving the effect of an inclosed 
couplet. Then, when the first line’s ending has almost 
passed from memory it is recalled to the consciousness by the 
concluding word of the fourth line. Some readers never quite 
accept the form as satisfying or beautiful. As we are accus- 
tomed to rimes more pat upon the tongue, this enclosed scheme 
sounds bizarre or outlandish. Yet it is one of the most ar- 
tistic departures from the usual among all verse forms. 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  
  90 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
As soon as the stanza passes beyond the quatrain the 
varieties become so varied and so infrequent that, except 
to know the number of lines, there is no need of forcing a 
high school pupil to learn all their names. Exceptions may 
be made of the double quatrain and the Spenserian stanza. 
This latter is important, not because pupils will read The 
Faerie Queene, but because they may dip into The Cotter’s 
Saturday Night, Adonais, Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage, perhaps 
other poems in its form, and because these modern imitations 
are sure to be mentioned in any discussion of the romantic 
revival in poetry as indicating one of its elements—the 
return to the poetic forms of Elizabethan times. 
Pupils of the tenth year—if they read many—can distin- 
guish between the two sonnet forms, Italian and English. 
They should not be forced to memorize the two different 
rime schemes, abba, abba, cdedcd and abab, cdcd, efef, gg, but 
they should be encouraged to write down the rime sequences 
of the great sonnets which they read. Upon the knowledge 
gained in this manner, later study of the intricate form can 
be based in other years. If poetry is properly studied in 
high schools, no one form will be “finished” in any one 
term, but will be met term after term, always as the vehicle 
for more mature thoughts, wider views, higher ideals, more 
intricate reasoning. Wordsworth’s sonnet On Westminster 
Bridge should be read early, his philosophical one, “The 
world is too much with us,” is better suited to seniors. 
The Cricket and the Grasshopper can be ‘understood by a 
tenth year pupil; Ozymandias may not be quite clear to even 
a senior. The most attractive manner of presenting the 
significance of this form is to read and discuss the half-dozen 
famous sonnets on the sonnet, for all of these emphasize the 
dignity, the worth, the nobility of the form. To underline 
all the remarks concerning the form itself, a teacher cannot 
do anything better than to repeat a sonnet written by the  
-P-A-G-E-99
THE FORM OF POETRY 91 
Spanish contemporary of Shakespeare, the prolific dramatist, 
Lope de Vega. 
To write a sonnet doth Juana press me; 
I’ve never found me in such stress and pain; 
A sonnet numbers fourteen lines ’tis plain, 
And three are gone ere I can say, God bless me! 
I thought that spinning rimes might sore oppress me, 
Yet here I’m midway in the last quatrain 
And if the foremost tercet I can gain, 
The quatrains need not any more distress me. 
To the first tercet I have got at last, 
And travel through it with such right good will, 
That with this line I’ve finished it, I ween. 
I’m in the second now and see how fast 
The thirteenth line comes tripping from my quill; 
Hurrah, ’tis done. Count if there be fourteen. 
Teach forms of recent verse.—The main current of 
worthy poetry will adequately prepare for the recent produc- 
tions in free verse, specimens of which deserve consideration 
in high school curricula. The teacher of English will dis- 
cover that many pupils have read quite a number of these 
so-called modern forms. Not to enter upon any discussion 
of the derivative sources of these, but to confine these remarks 
to the teaching of poetry, it may be repeated that an excellent 
approach to them may be made from the irregular verse of 
Matthew Arnold and Walt Whitman. The poems of the 
first of these are the more beautiful, therefore perhaps, a 
little further removed from the latest practices. Pupils will 
not find it difficult to pass from Philomela, Consolation, The 
Future to the rhapsodic utterances of the radical American. 
The teacher should choose carefully among the poems of 
Whitman in order that the pupils’ sensibilities are not 
shocked, and that they do not secure a first and ineradicable
-P-A-G-E-100
  92 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
impression of his “barbaric yawp.” As has been urged 
earlier in this discussion, there should be induced in the 
pupils’ minds a recognition of some fitting correspondence, 
some artistic relation between the contents and the form, 
for the very appearance of formlessness is a structural form. 
With the disappearance of rime, the irregular and varied 
meters, the absence of alliteration and assonance as delicate 
beautifiers, the sedulous avoidance of so-called poetic phrase- 
ology, there is an intensification of the few characteristics 
which remain. Rhythm becomes more and more important, 
as the insistence of free verse writers and appreciators upon 
cadences proves, and onomatopceia of a rugged, virile sort 
surges through the lines and sections. Poetic diction of one 
kind may be banished by these poets of the younger genera- 
tion, even as Wordsworth tried to purge verse of it in 1798, 
and Whitman in 1865, but it is replaced by words and phrases 
chosen in obedience to other principles variously denominated 
as symbolism, imagism, spectricism, common speech, and 
concentration. No pupil should be allowed to pass from 
high school without having had his attention directed in- 
formatively and sympathetically to the great body of recent 
and contemporary verse of all forms. One of the most 
hopeful signs of the cultured and intellectual progress of the 
race is the recent revival of interest in poetry. Good teaching 
will lead young persons to an active participation in that 
poetic renaissance. 
Teach the form of the ballad.—As it was stated in the 
discussion concerning prose fiction that story-telling belongs 
earliest in high school years, so it may be repeated here that 
in general, poetry dealing with events and stories belongs 
earliest. This does not mean, of course, that no narrative 
verse should be included in the later years, but it does mean 
that since teachers are desirous of inducing pupils to read 
and like verse, they should begin with those forms which
-P-A-G-E-101
THE FORM OF POETRY 93 
naturally attract and hold youthful attention. Coupled 
with study of narrative verse there should be reading, 
memorization, and reciting of beautiful lyric forms, of which 
more a little later. 
The youngest child in high school can be taught to recog- 
nize ballads. The curriculum of English study in the early 
years is adequately supplied with examples. Fortunately 
also, recent books of verse contain excellent specimens of 
good stories told metrically. Almost from the first acquaint- 
ance the child may be asked to distinguish between early, 
genuine ballads and later imitations produced under the 
influence of an interest in the past. Some teachers hesitate 
to place under younger pupils’ eyes the weird spelling of 
genuine old English ballads because the spelling of school 
children is never a secure habit, and because young persons 
have the mistaken belief that whatever they see in print 
must be correct. There is the risk of imitating the unusual 
forms in spelling, yet most instructors believe that the 
danger is more fancied than real, and that the gain of early 
association with stirring stories in appealing verse offsets all 
risks. There is no doubt that the material impresses the 
youthful imagination. So much that is applicable to all 
poetry can be imparted by means of these forms that the 
attempt is usually made. In addition to stimulating a 
knowledge of the form and a liking for narrative verse, the 
ballad serves as a quickening force of the imagination and a 
suggestion for composition in both prose and verse. More 
recent ballads are no less productive of both mental and 
material results. Certainly no teacher will declare that 
ballad structure is too complex for even the seventh year 
pupil, whether the stanza be the usual old septenary split 
into lines of four and three feet, riming abcb, or whether it be 
more complicated by stricter rime, abab, and perhaps internal 
rimes. In whatever grade the ballad form is taught in con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  
94 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
nection with the material, it serves as a point of departure 
for understanding of other forms, At once there comes to 
the mind the opportunity to discuss the tales in Longfellow’s 
stories related at the Wayside Inn, or in a later year to pass to 
the tales by Chaucer, or Tennyson, or Byron, or Browning, 
or Mr. Masefield, or Mr. Noyes. 
Teach other forms of narrative verse—With some knowl- 
edge of ballad and tale, pupils see immediately the structural 
form of the metrical romance, whether it be written by Long- 
fellow or Scott. Social satire is not appreciated by younger 
pupils, frequently not by mature readers. This method of 
criticism requires in its readers a high degree of mental de- 
tachment, a culture of intellectual sophistication not easy 
to attain. A large number of reasonably estimable persons 
cannot understand, much less appreciate social satire. A 
teacher who is unsympathetic or critical, should hesitate, 
therefore, to teach any verse in the form of the mock heroic. 
He had better let pupils read for themselves—unless he can 
present them properly—such creations as The Rape of the 
Lock and Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage. The material of the 
epic is easy to teach; plots are not difficult to remember and 
to recite; but the form of the epic is not easy to make clear. 
Most pupils meet the epic itself in some translation of Homer. 
Many schools prefer The Iliad, others The Odyssey; some use 
verse translations, others prose; a few read complete versions, 
most are content with a few selected books. Do teachers 
make plain to their classes the structure of The Iliad as 
shown by the answer to this question: What is the material 
of the poem? Will not most pupils reply ‘“‘The Trojan War” ? 
As soon as an instructor’s attention is called to this, he will 
be able to improve his teaching at once. The structure of 
this epic is not based on the Trojan War, which had been in 
progress nine years before the poem opens and continued 
after the poem ends. Structurally, The Iliad is quite limited
-P-A-G-E-103
THE FORM OF POETRY 95 
in its material, limited to the wrath of Achilles. Homer 
states this quite plainly. In arrangement, The Odyssey is not 
so simple, yet any ninth year pupil should be able to carry 
its general outline in his head, fitting in details where they 
belong. The artist’s conscious manipulation of his form 
becomes apparent at first glimpse. There is the frame—as 
it may be termed—of the main action, the anxiety at Ithaca 
with its effect upon wife and son, and suitors. The story of 
the adventures of Odysseus does not begin at the beginning— 
another indication of conscious arranging—but late in his 
wanderings. From this place on the plan is rather simple, the 
only interruption being the considerable portion of his earlier 
misfortunes related by Odysseus at the court of King Alcin- 
ous. The form of all epics is not as easily mastered as that of 
the instances here given, but those read, studied, and dis- 
cussed in school are not more complicated than these two. 
The forms of epic stories—such as Sohrab and Rustum and 
Balder Dead—are even more simple and therefore more 
easily held in the mind. 
Teach the forms of lyric poetry.— Requiring usually more 
skill in teaching, yet not in form beyond understanding, is 
the other great body of verse, the subjective. Only the sim- 
plest of the various kinds of lyric poems should be analyzed 
as forms until appreciation has been as highly developed as is 
possible. To illustrate this: it is a waste of time and energy 
for whatever results can be obtained to study such an ode as 
Wordsworth’s masterpiece in the tenth year of high school. 
Teachers may claim that they can read this poem and that 
classes will listen. This is true, but pupils at this stage are 
not ready to comprehend the startling theme upon which the 
poem is based. If they cannot grasp that, the material, no 
matter how much the beauty of its expression may impress 
them, is beyond both understanding and appreciation. 
There are other so-called odes which will fit into that year 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  96 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
much more appropriately. There are enough songs in 
literature to begin with—songs of all kinds, from the ordinary 
love lyric through the patriotic utterance to the hymn. 
Pupils will readily grasp the relation of length to emotion, of 
structure to feeling, of form to mood, and of sound to music. 
The elegy because of its occasion and feeling should be an 
easy kind to teach; yet because of the matchless expression 
and allusiveness of the best elegies, it is not an easy kind of 
lyric verse to make memorable to high school pupils. Part 
of the difficulty is due no doubt to the reticence of youth in 
all matters of deep feeling. Most of them are not willing even 
to act like Launcelot Gobbo and exclaim, ‘Tears, exhibit 
my tongue.” The best beginning in the elegy may be made 
very humbly with An Elegy on Poor Maisie by Burns. The 
usual introduction, however, is by studying An Elegy in a 
Country Churchyard. The obvious portions will be easily 
mastered, the philosophy needs only a little explanation, the 
imaginary epitaph at the close concludes the poem by a 
recognizable section. This tombstone inscription, however, 
may be a stumbling-block rather than a stepping-stone, 
unless its relation to the preceding quatrains is made per- 
fectly clear. This inscription was not on any stone in Stoke- 
Pogis Churchyard. Gray says plainly that if he is missed 
from his usual haunts a searcher should come to this grave- 
yard where he will find upon the tombstone this epitaph. 
This will become clearer if the teacher explains that this 
so-called elegy was not composed because some friend had 
died. It really is not in the strict sense an elegy, but a 
meditative poem upon death. High school courses do not 
include many elegies, yet as great poets have written great 
elegies, there should be offered some opportunity to judge 
this kind of poetry. Milton’s Lycidas repays all the study 
necessary to master it, if only to indicate how the art of 
poetry can make congruous the juxtaposition of pagan
-P-A-G-E-105
  
THE FORM OF POETRY 97 
mythology and Christian teaching. Tennyson’s In Memo- 
riam demands knowledge of a different sort. In it the Poet- 
Laureate poetically expressed the disturbing and moulding 
scientific pronouncements of the nineteenth century. Shelley, 
Arnold, Whitman, and Emerson wrote beautiful elegies 
which further justify the inclusion of such productions 
as a distinct kind of poetry to be studied. 
As has already been indicated, the ode is a kind of poetry \ 
requiring a rather developed power of philosophic interpreta- \ \

tion. There are many odes occasional in theme, which may“ 
be studied in early years, but the greatest belong as late 4s 
possible. Refinements upon difference of structure seem 
hardly necessary. If pupils know a little of the original 
Greek arrangement, perhaps the mere mention of the terms 
strophe, antistrophe, and epode, and the name Pindar, will 
suffice. It is wise, in order to anticipate possible misunder- 
standing of titles, to group all odes as regular and irregular 
in form. 
Give little attention to intricate forms.—Pupils of all 
grades may be interested in intricate verse forms. A wise 
teacher will be watchful to prevent such attention to form 
from overshadowing the attention paid to material and 
expression. Never will he allow mechanical analysis to 
replace knowledge of poetry. Delightful excursions may be 
made into realms not often opened to high school pupils. 
Many of them are introduced to Chaucer of The Canterbury 
Tales and are made aware of his humor in descriptive details 
but are never led to read the poem which awakens in every 
one such a sympathetic response, The Complaint to His Purse. 
After this has been—why not memorized?—it is amusing to 
read Lack of Stedfastness and Against Woman/Unconstant. 
Long before Chaucer is reached, however, some of the un- 
usual forms may be presented. Their finish, their cleverness, 
their brilliance will captivate, especially when these qualities
-P-A-G-E-106
  98 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
of style and workmanship are linked with humorous material 
or trifling treatment. The time has passed when apology 
has to be offered for genuine humor in the classroom. To 
serve the purposes of contrast and variety with the usual 
forms of verse, it has already been suggested that much 
leaven from contemporary poets be introduced. In addition, 
many unusual foreign forms may be considered. Some 
remarks may be made upon their form, but the teacher will 
defeat the entire purpose of the use of this material if he in- 
sists that pupils learn these sequences and restrictions of 
rhythms, meters, rimes, refrains, and repetitions. 
The Japanese hokku is worthy of notice for its descriptive 
imagery. Better still, because they sound so brilliant, are 
the complicated French forms. Not all are worth consider- 
ing, for some of them do not reproduce their effects in our 
language. ‘The villanelle just succeeds; it is best if scoffing, 
ironical, or broadly humorous. The rondel and rondeau are 
best when they express daintiness, social sophistication, 
polish, cleverness, and fancy. No pupil should finish high 
school without hearing a few triolets—perhaps writing a few 
on school topics. They are not difficult to attempt, but 
they are supremely difficult to achieve.

The ballade must not be confused by pupils with the ballad. 
In the past few years there have appeared in print many 
delicately humorous and ironical specimens of this form. 
Several volumes of collected and selected verse contain 
excellent illustrations which may be used in every year to 
lighten the impression of the seriousness of most poetry. 
Complicated structure and restricted limits enhance the 
effect upon youthful readers or auditors. To make the form 
plain to them, copies of ballades should be placed under their 
eyes, or a stanza and the envoi should be written upon the 
board. Swinburne’s Ballade of Burdens may be read to the 
class finally to indicate how well-known are many of the 
themes and repeated lines in famous poems of this form. 
Of course the most famous ballade ever produced should be 
read in its equally celebrated translation.

Teach the methods of treating material——Almost any 
one of the preceding kinds of poetry may be written according 
to a definite mood. This method of treatment does not 
determine the form, nor is it an inherent characteristic of it, 
yet it is so closely a concomitant of the form that it may be 
added at this place. Poets—and therefore their created 
poems—are predominantly marked by one of these methods 
of treatment at separate periods or in single poems—pastoral, 
romantic, or realistic. There are instances in which the
-P-A-G-E-109
THE FORM OF POETRY 101 
manner of treatment results from a combination of two of 
these. Pupils can grasp these from the beginning of their 
study of poetry. The treatment of Snow-Bound is clearly 
realistic. May it be considered pastoral? Is Evangeline 
prevailingly romantic or pastoral? Which of the words shall 
be applied to Gray’s Elegy, to L’Allegro, to We Are Seven, 
to The Highwayman, to Dauber, to The Man with the Hoe? 
The mood of every poem may be related by the pupils to the 
period in which it was written, to influences in the career of 
the poet, but the rise and fall of these as fashions in literary 
history may be pointed out by the teacher or recognized by 
the pupils. To take advantage again of every opportunity 
to prove to the class that school study of verse is the reflection 
of outside interests, the teacher should show that while 
realism is the prevailing element in contemporary verse, 
romantic and pastoral feelings are not dead. If Mr. Mase- 
field is the prototype of realism, Mr. Noyes and Miss Lowell 
may stand as the singers of romance, while Miss Teasdale 
keeps alive the pastoral. 
Teach that form is subordinate to content.—Teachers who 
are not able to master for themselves and impart to others 
the essence of poetry will always take refuge in a show of 
definite knowledge based on recognition and analysis of mere 
form. In no sense is the form the poetry. A pupil can per- 
form the most amazing feats in remembering rime schemes, 
in scanning irregular stanzas, in defining kinds of sonnets, in 
repeating long passages, yet remain untouched by the primal 
beauty, unmoved by the glorious thrill, unresponsive to the 
imaginative stimulation, rigidly immobile to the transform- 
ing message of sublime poetry, exactly as a child can analyze 
and manipulate involved sentences without ever correcting 
the inaccuracies in his own speech. Form is not to be dis- 
regarded in the simplest verse; the eye must see its structure, 
the ear must hear its rhythm, meter, and rime, but behind
-P-A-G-E-110
  
102 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
these externals, beyond this apparent visual entity, there is 
the essence of the poetry which must flash from the printed 
page and the delivered words through the eye and ear into 
the deepest consciousness of the pupil. It is no exaggeration 
to assert that a child should be changed by intimacy with 
The Vision of Sir Launfal, though mature minds should be 
able to realize why that composition ranks low in the scale 
of poetic achievement. Study of Sohrab and Rustum, 
Balder Dead, and The Story of a Round House should so 
impress the poignant pathos of these masterpieces upon 
the sensitive feelings that all life should be a larger, fuller, 
more noble experience. Milton’s sonnet on his blindness 
should never fade from memory, nor should “the poetry 
of earth is never dead.” Nature should be more beautiful 
because poets have shown pupils what unceasing delights it 
provides. Even cities may be seen with newly opened eyes 
after one has read Written on Westminster Bridge, In Lady 
Street, and The Barrel Organ. Poets have made autumn 
and winter as glorious as spring and summer. Shelley’s 
poem will change the aspect of the clouds, and Wordsworth’s 
lines have made both solitary violet and single star mean 
more to their beholder. Red poppies mean more to the 
reader of poetry than to the ignorant person. Trees are more 
eautiful when we realize who alone can make them. 
It is upon the contents, the meaning, then, that the em- 
/ phasis must be placed in all teaching of poetry.

CHAPTER V 
DRAMA 
The appeal of the dramatic form.—Next to the highest 
form of lyric poetry, drama is the most difficult kind of 
literature to teach well in high school. Many a teacher 
believes he is presenting the form effectively because the 
class seems to attack it with enthusiasm, to enjoy the pas- 
sages read, and to be able to answer a few leading questions 
almost accurately. Yet if he will conscientiously scrutinize 
his work and its results he may be forced to admit that he is 
accepting a show of knowledge and appreciation for the 
things themselves, that for the results he secures he consumes 
too much time and energy, and that so far as permanent 
patronage of good plays is concerned, intentions are never 
carried into action, that later discussions show an ineradicable 
confusion of dramatic art with screen photographs. For- 
tunately for all teachers of English the very essence of 
dramatic presentation appeals to pupils. It appeals not 
only to young persons; observation will report as keen en- 
thusiasm in any group or organization from city club to 
church over the prospect of performing a play. Young 
persons are a little more naive in their outbursts of delight 
and more mobile in assuming réles, but not because of 
youth are they more interested in dramatics. They are 
more ready to translate into action the inherent dramatic 
sense possessed in varying degrees by all persons. 
The difficulty of teaching drama.—The difficulty of 
teaching drama—as differentiated from merely reading it— 
lies first of all in its highly specialized form. A page of a 
103
-P-A-G-E-112
104 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
printed play has a totally different appearance from that of 
every other form of literature. It is easy to say that dialogue 
occurs in prose fiction, but the absence from the page of the 
familiar marks, phrases, arrangements, and explanations, 
confuses the high school pupil who meets a play for the first 
time. You can test yourself for the reverse of this by looking | 
at a few of the printed plays by Sir James M. Barrie, in 
which preliminary casts of characters are omitted, stage 
directions are printed in ordinary type, quotation marks are 
used, and speeches are not labeled with the names of char- 
acters. Until you become accustomed to this hybrid form— 
neither prose fiction nor drama—you are likely to be ill at 
ease as you read. 
The second difficulty lies in the restriction of time and 
place, although a few minutes’ discussion will open the way 
for fuller understanding of these limits. 
The third difficulty is dependent upon the retirement of 
the author from the action. This seems so obvious to mature 
and trained readers that they are likely to overlook the ad- 
justments necessary for the pupil who in fiction has been 
told such things as what a character thought, what he in- 
tended to do, what he dreamed, how he felt, what impression 
a remark made upon him, what even his appearance was, 
and how he behaved under circumstances in which he said 
nothing. Notice that these remarks when applied to a novel 
are rightly in the past tense; when applied to a play they - 
should be in the present tense. The play must live in the 
present before our eyes. Until it does, the reader, the 
teacher, the pupil is not grasping the drama. Unless the 
pupil does see the action actually going on before his mind’s 
eye, all teaching no matter how carefully prepared and 
energetically conducted is a flat failure. Mr. William - 
Gillette, the finished American actor, expressed this dif- 
ficulty better than any one else when he wrote that the
-P-A-G-E-113
  
DRAMA 105 
printed book is not the play—it contains merely the direc- 
tions for a play. Until the characters live, move, speak, act, 
feel, there is no play, exactly as there is no music if the 
printed sheets merely lie upon the music rack. Only the 
musician’s hands and the singer’s voice can produce from 
those black and white directions the living music. There 
comes into being a play only when the teacher’s guidance 
and the pupils’ imaginations create the real drama from the 
directions provided upon the pages. 
The greatest difficulty produces the greatest benefit.— 
This leads to the statement of the next element of difficulty, 
although its recognition and solution produce the greatest. 
single benefit derived from the study and reading of plays— 
the awakening of the imagination. Countless mature persons 
of more than average intelligence do not care to read plays; 
many of them frankly declare they cannot get much from 
the form. They do not know how to make their imagina- 
tions function properly to receive the delight of a dramatic 
masterpiece. They are shutting themselves off from an entire 
section of great literature, for as the theatrical production of 
the world is controlled now, they will have few opportunities 
to see upon the stage the most worthy dramas extant and 
those being written. The responsibility of the teacher, 
therefore, grows with the need and opportunity for the 
proper presentation of dramatic material to all his classes. 
Base teaching upon knowledge of the stage.—So the last 
difficulty becomes apparent. Plays can be studied only 
superficially when teacher and pupils know little or nothing 
, about the stage, its traditions, methods of production, 
schools of acting, differences of interpretation; yet without 
some knowledge of all these, how can a play be studied as 
drama? Let me cite a simple illustration. A boy had been 
asked to read a few one-act plays in order that a class might 
select one to present. In his report he described a clever 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  106 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
trifle, Altruism by Carl Ettinger, but pronounced it im- 
possible for consideration because the scene showed the 
quais of the Seine and he knew no way to have real water on 
their school stage. The principle of the explanation made to 
him about stage water underlies the explanation necessary 
to understanding Macbeth. How do the witches disappear? 
How are the phantoms in the cauldron managed? How is 
this cauldron made to disappear? How can Banquo’s 
ghost reach the seat at the banquet table, then slip away? 
Seemingly the least puzzling play will suggest such questions. 
How does Puck enter and exit? How large are the fairies 
in A Midsummer Night’s Dream? How is the ass head 
removed from Bottom? In The Tempest how does Caliban 
act? What is Ariel’s appearance? How can a sinking ship 
be represented on the stage? How many readers and students 
have a clear idea of the crucial acting moment in Hamlet— 
the changing of the foils? One teacher frankly said to me 
that she supposed there was rapid fencing, a great deal of 
confusion, ‘‘and then it was done.” She failed to realize that 
sound and fury are never so effective on the stage as the 
reverse; she overlooked entirely the need of making plain 
and portentous to the spectators that Hamlet and Laertes 
are changing their foils. She had never seen and felt (she 
should have imagined it) the thrill that passes over an au- 
dience in the slight pause before the fencing is resumed. 
No less crowded with instances of this difficulty are later and 
contemporary dramas, from She Stoops to Conquer to Abraham 
Lincoln. No teacher must lean too far to the other side and 
become so involved in stagecraft that the teaching of the 
drama suffers. Many a book purporting to discuss drama is 
no more than a description of methods of production. Com- 
plaints are voiced that university courses announced as 
dealing with the plays of Shakespeare become lectures upon 
the architecture of the Elizabethan playhouses. Only the 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
DRAMA 107 
essential facts of these topics required to elucidate the plays 
themselves should be introduced into high school classrooms. 
Recognition of difficulties necessary to good teaching.— 
These difficulties are listed here because a recognition of 
them is the first step in the process of adequate teaching. 
The second step towards the best teaching is the preparation 
by the instructor to meet them and solve or remove them. 
If his college training, subsequent reading and study of books, 
and attendance at the theater, have been of the proper sort, 
he is alr.ost adequately equipped to begin the classroom 
work. If he has not been fortunate enough to have been 
adequately prepared by all these agencies, he can set about 
making up for their lack. 
Teacher more important than editorial material.—A 
good teacher will be able to counteract the influences of a 
badly-edited text. If he is free to choose the texts he will 
use he is fortunate. If he is bound by contracts with pub- 
lishers, prescriptions of superiors not specialists in study 
material, if cheapness is the first requisite of book purchases, 
he will have to be all the more strongly fortified with knowl- 
edge and judgment. Let him beware of texts which are 
loaded—in both senses—with such notes as the following 
ones. In As You Like It a dying deer watched by Jaques is 
described by a follower of the Duke. The passage has no 
importance at all except to lead up to an analysis of the 
courtier’s character. Yet note the value of this footnote for 
students! 
Drayton in the thirteenth song of his Poly-Olbion has a fine 
description of a deer-hunt, which he winds up thus: 
He who the mourner is to his own dying 
corse, 
Upon the ruthless earth his precious 
tears lets fall. 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  
  108 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
And in a note upon the passage he adds, “The hart weepeth at his 
dying: his tears are held precious in medicine.” 
Many editions of plays are notoriously overburdened 
with editorial lore unsuited to readers even of college grade. 
Rosalind speaks of the quotidian of love, and although a 
dictionary would explain the word, there is a note, which 
does not stop when it is finished but is made twice as long 
by adding definitions of tertian and quartan. Another passage 
of the same play is elucidated by this crystal-clear exposition 
for the inquiring mind: “This is a phrase of frequent occur- 
rence in old writers, and seems to have been a common 
hysteron-proteron for to live and die.” There are six more 
lines, but this sentence will suffice to show the style and in- 
formation. In The Merchant of Venice Launcelot Gobbo’s 
delightful foolery over his palm is weighted down by a 
paragraph eight lines long. In Act V, Lorenzo’s beautiful 
lines upon music, which speak so plainly for themselves, 
are ballasted by a paragraph nineteen lines long from Browne’s 
Religio Medici. One edition of A Midsummer Night’s Dream | 
rests content with two hundred nine notes; another needs 
almost twice as many—three hundred ninety-three. In 
the first, one note is four lines long, in the second, the note on 
the same detail covers twenty lines. 
Skill in questioning necessary.—As the teacher must be 
on his guard against the incorrect kind of note in study of 
drama, he must also be alert to detect the misleading ques- 
tion. A question on an irrelevant footnote is a mistake, a 
purely etymological explanation is likewise an error. Many 
questions ranging into the ethical and philosophical are 
potential boomerangs. The standard illustration of this 
kind of wrong question is this: Would it have been better if 
Cordelia had humored her unbalanced old father and flattered 
Lear a little in the first act? This ethical question has a bear-  
-P-A-G-E-117
DRAMA 109 
ing on real life, but none at all upon Shakespeare’s play. 
Its reductio ad absurdum consequence becomes apparent in 
an instant. Had Cordelia fibbed a little to please a doting old 
man, there would have been no tragedy. A similar question 
may test the keenness of students of Macbeth, but its answer 
must square with the facts of the play. Were the Witches. 
figments of Macbeth’s own wicked thoughts which his 
desire for the crown made so real that subconsciously he: 
projected them and thought he saw them as living creatures? 
Such an explanation makes an intriguing psychological 
problem, and lets us raise Shakespeare to our own advanced 
analytical powers, but one sentence of common-sensed 
knowledge reduces this ingenious interpretation to baseless 
‘speculation. Banquo saw and heard these witches as well as 
Macbeth, and certainly he had no wicked desires to project. 
Misdirected ingenuity can worm anything from Shakespeare’s. 
plays and put anything into them. The teacher must know 
the dramas as they were written for actual stage performance, 
not as ethical treatises on myths. They may be, of course, 
discussed as views of real life. No one can study a really 
great drama without accepting it as a picture of actuality. 
Preliminary preparation of the teacher.—About a week 
before the study of a play is to begin, the teacher should read 
the complete play through, not in an annotated school 
edition, but in a regular book. He should master the entire 
drama, as a literary production intended for the stage. This 
preliminary reading should be done no matter how well the 
teacher believes he knows the play. Immediately upon its 
completion he should go back to the beginning and carefully 
study the first unit, act or scene, in the light of all the infor- 
mation contained in the Variorum Shakespeare edited by 
Horace Howard Furness. This intensive study need not be 
completed before the class begins its consideration, but the 
teacher should be well in advance of his charges. With a
-P-A-G-E-118
  110 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
clear idea of what there is to know about the play, a definite 
idea of the helps needed by the pupils, a clearly outlined 
series of objects to be secured, he should be able to direct 
their attention, awaken their interests, enlarge their sym- 
pathies, and draw out their opinions by wisely selecting the 
additional material to explain and supplement the text. To 
illustrate this let me cite King Lear again. The initial 
situation of the play cannot be bettered. But since the 
teacher knows that another conclusion has been tried, why 
should he not invite discussions of Shakespeare’s last scenes? 
This is the beginning of really sensible literary criticism 
affording the teacher the opportunity to enforce what pupils 
will dimly perceive for themselves—that the only logical 
artistic ending for the play is the one Shakespeare devised. 
Such ideas will leap from classes whose intellects are kept 
alive by the appeal of dramatic issues. The teacher’s task is | 
to prepare himself so well that he will be able to train the 
intermittent flashes into consistent thinking. A pupil may 
be the first to declare that Macbeth is a drama on the com- 
mandment, “Thou shalt not kill,” but the teacher must not 
be surprised by that true comment. In fact, if the minds of 
pupils are not likely to evolve that thought for themselves, 
the teacher must try to plant the seed which will produce it, 
whether pupils believe it indigenous or recognize it as trans- 
planted. 
General plans.—No single person can anticipate exactly 
the purpose to be served by the study of each play, but slight 
hints can be listed. There should be little Greek philology in 
explaining words, such as antipodes in A Midsummer Night's 
Dream. When in the same play the nine men’s morris is 
met, nothing more is required than the concise statement 
that this was an outdoors game for which holes were dug in 
the turf. Julius Caesar should be taught as drama, not as 
Roman history. Henry V is a glorious pxan of patriotism
-P-A-G-E-119
DRAMA ll 
and should be felt as such, not as English history. It is not 
helpful to go into the intricacies of gunsmithing to make 
clear what is meant by tickle o’ the sere in Hamlet. The 
equivalent easy to set off or to go off at half cock should suffice. 
The significance of the Danish prince’s ejaculation, “No 
more,” in his greatest soliloquy should be discussed until an 
accepted meaning is agreed upon. The various tones and 
inflections with which Lady Macbeth says “We fail” should 
be made clear to both instructor and class. Some pupil is 
certain to discover the contradiction in Act I of As You Like 
Zt concerning the heights of the cousins, for in one place 
Celia is described as the taller, in another, Rosalind. There 
should be provided hearings of the music closely associated 
with the plays; the Mendelssohn settings to A Midsummer 
Night’s Dream, the old tunes to the songs in Twelfth Night, 
the dances for Henry VIII. Practically all Shakespearean 
music is now easily obtainable on records. 
In early grades, those in which the lighter comedies such 
as A Midsummer Night's Dream and As You Like It are 
studied, it is better not to assign the biography of the drama- 
tist before the play is read. Curiosity and interest are sure 
to be awakened by either of these dramas. When the 
teacher judges that pupils desire to know something about 
the dramatist, a reference to an interesting account should 
be given, and reports heard, with comments by the class. 
Experience in the theater with any Shakespeare play should 
be welcomed as an addition to biographical information. 
Pictures and sketches for stage settings, while they are not 
to be mistakenly marked as representing proficiency in 
literary interpretation, should be welcomed and shown. 
Only an undiscriminating teacher will accept a clipping from 
a magazine or a drawing in lieu of a regular recitation in 
English, but every teacher should foster the interest. which 
enlists activity in other branches of skill and knowledge.
-P-A-G-E-120
112 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
Drawing is never literature, attendance at a different play is 
not mastery of the one under consideration, yet all of 
these adjuncts will aid in multiplying contacts among 
the classroom duties, other school departments, and the 
world outside. No pupil should be given a passing grade in 
the study of drama merely because he makes in the wood- 
working shop a small model of an Elizabethan theater. If 
he is a wise child, he will be able to make a better showing ix 
the regular recitations because he knows how to make the 
model. | 
Whatever knowledge of Shakespeare’s life and times the 
pupil absorbs from the first play he reads will be reviewed 
and amplified with each successive drama. As most courses 
are now arranged, each term or year at least provides an 
additional play, so that the pupils’ knowledge is cumulative. 
Every teacher should demand a modicum of correct recollec- 
tion of the plays already mastered to serve as a foundation 
upon which to place the later more mature tragedies. If a 
comedy has been studied, Julius Caesar may be begun in an 
entirely different manner from that used with a class which 
is meeting Shakespeare for the first time. 
Beginning the play in class.—There is always a delicious 
air of noyelty on the day when a new book is about to be 
started. (The study of a play should be begun in class. 
Pupils’ curiosity should be satisfied first concerning the 
title, in so far as this can be done in advance.) This should be 
done with every play, modern and contemporary as well as 
with Elizabethan ones. The School for Scandal, She Stoops 
to Conquer, The Good Natured Man, The Piper, Milestones, 
all these will be easier for the undramatically trained if some 
explanation precedes reading. Next in place to the title is 
the cast of characters. Not all the entries are worth atten- 
tion, but the leading ones must be noted. This is the time to 
teach correct pronunciation of many of the proper names. 
 
-P-A-G-E-121
  
  DRAMA , die 
It is also the time for a few words on relationships of the 
leading persons. It may be the time to remark upon the few 
women in Shakespeare’s dramas and comment on the reason, 
The entries of the place or places of the action will prepare 
for the play. In other words, this preliminary matter 
should be used in class exactly as a program is used in a 
theater. When the setting of the first scene is read, the 
teacher should ask pupils to describe it in detail. Until 
visualization is fairly definite the reading of the conversation 
should not begin. Modifications will be made as the action 
suggests them, but never should the study depart from the 
avowed purpose of making the play spring from the printed 
page into actual form and action. Characters should be 
described, although in this exercise, the picture may not be 
particularized upon the first entrance of\the person. Details 
of the appearance of persons should be gathered as they 
occur throughout the action. In some instances the author 
leaves no room for conjecture. Cassius is described fully. 
Rosalind at the end of Act I tells us exactly how she will 
dress and act in the next scene. The supreme importance of 
the few stage directions should be made plain. Then the 
class should begin to read the lines. Let all the pupils read 
in turn the speeches as they occur. The teacher should 
insert any explanations and comments without interrupting 
the reading. In this exercise the same character’s speeches 
will be read by many different pupils, thus affording oppor- 
tunities for the pupils to offer interpretations and to observe 
differences. If the first speeches by the Witches are not 
weird enough, an improvement may be made by the next 
trio to whom they fall. Thus at once elemental degrees and 
effects of dramatic interpretation are induced and dis- 
played. During the first period there should be no recogniz- 
able recitation. This period should be devoted to teaching, 
or directed study, or supervised work, or whatever one 
   
-P-A-G-E-122
  114 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
chooses to call it. At the end of this period a certain definite 
assignment, say Act I, should be scheduled for the next 
recitation. 
The second class period.—At this time, with books closed, 
the pupils should tell interestingly and correctly and pro- 
portionally the events of the story so far. Then should 
ensue skilful questioning by the teacher to amplify the 
knowledge already exhibited. Some details will have to be 
explained, some minimized, others enlarged, the significance 
of some pointed out, the incompleteness of others. Such 
general discussion—for from it, since all have studied the 
' same material, none should be omitted—will lead inevitably 
and naturally to mention of suspense, contrast, and rise of 
interest. 
Teach plot development.—At once the teacher, even in 
the lowest grade, can draw attention to the difference between 
the exposition and the beginning of the action. In every 
play this can be made perfectly clear. Pupils will be able to 
find it under proper guidance. The exposition in a play, as in 
a story, is everything which the spectator or the reader must 
know in order to understand the story. The story or plot 
begins when out of that exposition develops some incident 
which will evidently produce consequences. In Romeo and 
Juliet the houses of Montague and Capulet are at feud. 
The Duke decrees that he will banish any person guilty of 
fomenting any further strife. All this is exposition. If 
nothing occurs to disturb the status quo, there will be no play. 
But young Romeo declares he will attend the masked ball 
at the house of his family’s enemy. The exposition has been 
passed, the plot has begun to develop. In The Merchant of 
Venice, Bassanio needs money to woo Portia, but his friend 
Antonio has none ready. He will borrow—but from whom 
and upon what terms? When he agrees to sign the bond 
suggested by Shylock, the plot begins. Pupils will see this Pa   
 
-P-A-G-E-123
DRAMA 115 
change in material because dramatists are careful not to 
cloud such an important point. It is always likely that the 
inexperienced or the narrowly-read teacher will fall back 
upon the old standby in drama study of forcing the play into 
the Procrustean model prescribed by Freytag and his mechan- 
ical followers. To many teachers, the knowledge of a play 
depends entirely upon a diagram of rising broken lines with 
jagged edges, each peak of which is a crisis, while distributed 
along the graph are correctly (that is, arbitrarily) placed 
such tags as climax, tragic suspense, catastrophe, falling 
action, happy ending. It is quite true that these terms 
should be used in discussing dramas, but the statement that 
all plays can be analyzed according to a predetermined 
diagram is false. The attempt to force modern, original 
plots into such frames will result disastrously for the analyt- 
ical study, and not contribute much to appreciation. Broad | 
differences among classes of plays should be laid down, as 
for instance, in tragedy there is the triumph of a great prin- 
ciple, a general law, an eternal truth over the will or power 
of an individual; while in comedy there is the reverse; and in 
tragi-comedy the plot begins and continues as though it were 
to be a tragedy, then at some point it suddenly reverses its in- 
tention and concludes happily. Realistic modernism does not 
mark its issues and conclusions so clearly, so pupils must 
be prepared to meet what is to them unsatisfying, the unde- 
terminate ending. 
Aids to study of drama.—The teacher should be con- 
tinually collecting illustrative material to display at this 
time. There is published a large colored reproduction of the 
interior of an Elizabethan theater which will vivify the form 
of Shakespeare’s dramas. Every picture, design, photograph, 
which in the slightest degree will arouse interest or quicken 
the perceptions should be utilized—such as Johannes de 
Witte’s drawing of the Swan Theater, a photograph of 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  116 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
the Harvard or the Leland Stanford reconstruction of an 
Elizabethan playhouse, photographs of the original produc- 
tion in America of the morality play Everyman, designs 
for stage settings, photograph of the Memorial Theater at 
Stratford-on-Avon, Sargent’s painting of Miss Ellen Terry 
as Lady Macbeth, Byam Shaw’s colored plates, the illustra- 
tions in the plays published by Hodder and Stoughton. 
After a beginning has been made by the instructor, he 
should enlist the codperation of the class in supplying 
material for the bulletin board. 
Pupils should be urged to bring in illustrative material of 
all kinds. The amount of supplementary work of this kind 
which pupils will do is amazing. For every contribution the 
pupil should supply a commentary to the class. 
Care should be exercised that the material displayed will 
aid the pupils. Many Shakespearean illustrations, such as 
early nineteenth century engravings, appear uncouth and 
grotesque to young persons. Pictures, for instance, of 
David Garrick as Romeo, yet wearing eighteenth century 
skirted coat and kneebreeches will not help student apprecia- 
tion of an Elizabethan play. 
Teach the relation of blank verse to drama.—As so many 
literary plays are in blank verse some attention must be 
accorded that form as a means of spoken delivery. The 
perfect adjustment of the length of the line to physiological 
powers should be made clear; it will be intensely inter- 
esting if explained. Its introduction into England by publica- 
tion in 1557 (have pupils report’ on the Earl of Surrey 
and Tottel’s Miscellany), its instantaneous acceptance by 
dramatists writing for professional performers (pupil report 
on Marlowe’s mighty line), its development before Shake- 
speare, should be touched upon. Its perfect suitableness 
to all kinds of stage speeches should be made plain by 
some such fanciful incident as an actor’s objecting to a 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
DRAMA 117 
speech in long lines because they exhausted his breath, or 
complaining that he could not make a speech sound solemn 
enough because the lines were so short that they sounded 
choppy. A few random illustrations from the play being 
studied will arouse observation of the pauses and variety of 
emphasis in lines. A teacher will be able to rivet the 
attention upon Shakespeare’s own opinion of blank verse by 
quoting the lines from As You Like It in which the bitter 
Jaques expresses his opinions of this kind of speech. Orlando 
trills out, “Good day and happiness, fair Rosalind.” And 
Jaques comments, “Nay, then, God b’ wi’ you, and you 
talk in blank verse!” Part of what has been said concerning 
the study of the form of poetry can best be taught in connec- 
tion with poetic drama. The appreciation of verse in a 
Shakespeare play need not be introduced too early in the 
reading, but it should not be delayed too long, as its applica- 
tion to understanding and admiring the genius of the drama- 
tist is pertinent to all parts of the play. 
Assign definite portions for class consideration.—After 
the study has begun, the pupils should be made responsible 
for the preparation of a certain portion for every recitation. 
The early recitations upon this outside study may be con- 
fined to questions upon the text, but soon such mastery of 
material may be taken for granted and questions and dis- 
cussions will pass to related but less obvious topics. Here 
will enter the reports on the stage settings, the stage group- 
ings, the meanings of the printed stage directions, the action 
suggested by the lines themselves where author’s directions 
are lacking, the manner of delivering speeches, the signifi- 
eance of voice and gesture in connection with words, or 
apart from them, the revelation or concealment of character, 
the things lines mean in addition to what they say, the 
effect upon the audience. For as soon as the reception of the 
speeches and the emotional responses of the class justify it,
-P-A-G-E-126
  118 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
the assignments and method should be based on the assump- 
tion that it has become an audience. To this end all the 
foregoing study has been intentionally directed. As soon as 
this attitude has been adopted by the pupils, they should 
become the interpreters of the play. Characters should be 
assigned, and pupils should assume positions before their 
auditors to interpret the réles they depict. Every pupil 
in the class should be used in this method of studying 
a play. Educationally there is reason for letting a pupil 
present the réle for which he is temperamentally and physi- 
cally fitted. But there is just as much reason, some educa- 
tors believe there is more, for inducing exactly the opposite. 
The modest, retiring boy should play the warrior’s réle. The 
undemonstrative girl should be Rosalind for a half-hour. 
The serious student should act Touchstone. The forward 
miss should be relegated to the quietness of Hippolyta’s 
few appearances. Every teacher who tries this device once 
will be amazed at the transformations it works for good, 
besides inculcating a salutary sense of dramatic character- 
ization—the power to submerge one’s real nature under the 
appearance of another. 
The time to be devoted to any play, Elizabethan, eight- 
eenth century, or modern, will be determined by the arrange- 
ment of the course and the purpose of the study. Many 
plays—Twelfth Night, Much Ado about Nothing, She Stoops to 
Conquer, Milestones, The Piper, Justice, The Blue Bird— 
may be finished in a short time, most of the reading being 
done outside school. Others—Macbeth, Hamlet, Abraham 
Lincoln—are worthy of fuller study. As the class nears 
the end, scenes may be read rapidly and summarized in a 
few words, as the dialogue between Hamlet and Osric, in 
which the only plot value is the acceptance of the terms of the 
duel. The satire on court fashions of the day in England is 
interesting but not essential to a first study of the drama.
-P-A-G-E-127
    
DRAMA 119 
By this time the pupils will have formed definite pictures 
of the persons, they will have become familiar with poetic 
idioms, they will have mastered the theme of the story, so 
that more and more material may be covered, if time presses. 
Present portions of dramas.—Surely the ideal of all 
such study is the widening and deepening of the pupils’ 
acquaintance with great drama. To do this, a sincere pro- 
duction of the play may be the best device. Few schools, 
however, can hope to realize such an ambition. Yet teachers 
need not despair. Pupils have imaginations to piece out 
imperfections. The study of every play may be summarized 
in this manner. Soon after the play is under regular dis- 
cussion, the teacher should announce to the class that the 
last two recitations will be devoted to a review of the entire 
drama. Pupils are to choose portions, assign réles among 
themselves, memorize, rehearse as they choose outside 
class time, and be prepared to produce parts of the play. 
There will always be some unsociable ones unidentified with 
any group. These stragglers will tell the teacher that all the 
sections are arranged, that all the réles are taken. Anticipat- 
ing such petitioners for grace, the teacher should be prepared 
with definite assignments from the play. There are the long 
speeches of Jaques, of the characters in the woods of Athens, 
the choruses in Henry V, the soliloquies, the interspersed 
songs, the prologue and epilogue in She Stoops to Conquer and 
Abraham Lincoln;—there is no reason for the omission of a 
single pupil. If the class as a large committee plans this 
work, scenes may be quite wisely chosen and parts intelli- 
gently distributed. This should be pupil activity, apart 
from the teacher’s announcement. On the day of presenta- 
tion, the teacher should be furnished with a list of excerpts 
with the names of characters and performers, so that the 
action of each group may follow the plot order. There will 
be gaps, but as all the pupils have just studied the play,
-P-A-G-E-128
  120 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
they will fill these in quickly. Nothing will surpass this 
genuine student project as a device for developing codpera- 
tion and stimulating enthusiasm. 
What pupils receive from studying drama.— 
I have a lasting appreciation of the playwright—the Elizabethan 
play-loving age—the unrivaled poetry in Shakespearean plays, 
which will stand the tests of all ages—and lastly the business and 
production of plays on the Shakespearean stage and also on our 
modern stage. I have clear mental pictures of characters depicted 
in the different plays which I have studied. 
Of all the work we had in seven English this term I liked the 
recitations delivered from Shakespeare’s plays. I not only liked 
them but I think I benefited by them more than any of the other 
work. 
I enjoyed the recitations because it was very amusing to see 
what my classmates could do and some of them took their parts so 
well that it was very surprising. I liked the practising about as 
well as the performance in the room. It really seemed a pleasure 
rather than a study. The greatest pleasure of all was at the end 
of my part when I felt I had really done better than I had thought 
I was capable of doing. 
I likewise received about as much benefit from it as I did pleasure. 
I was chiefly benefited by having to memorize the lines because I 
was really not very good at memory work. The recitations also gave 
me more confidence in myself. It was my first experience at acting 
and of course I learned much from it. As the old saying goes, 
“Experience is the bestteacher.” Inacting these parts from Shake- 
speare it caused me to use my imagination as to how my part should 
be acted. I really got a general review of Shakespeare’s plays 
because I had to read over all of them in order to find a part that was 
suitable. This paper refers to the first day on which we acted our 
parts. 
It is very agreeable and delightful to give sections from Shake- 
speare’s plays provided the work is well learned. I can think of  
-P-A-G-E-129
  DRAMA 121 
only one thing that is more agreeable, and that is to be one of the 
audience while these are being given by classmates. 
It is an awful yet fascinating thrill to be kept in suspense while 
waiting for your turn to take the part of your favorite character in 
one of Shakespeare’s plays. 
What a feeling of relief it is to complete successfully your lines. 
If you otherwise complete them, and the reproaches of your teacher 
are hurled upon you, how you thank your stars you are yet small 
enough to crawl into your desk, and die the death. 
How interesting it is to behold male characters played by “petite” 
girls who threaten to break each other’s neck, or to listen to Portia’s 
soliloquy on mercy delivered by a deep-voiced boy. 
I obtained more enjoyment out of this, than any other work in 
English. 
The study of the play of Macbeth has been very interesting to 
me. When I saw the play performed, many facts and stage effects 
which had been discussed in class were brought out. In class we 
discussed the disappearance of the witches, and claimed that it 
would be more effective if they would vanish suddenly as through 
a trap door, but Mantell’s company just had them leave by the 
back of the stage. They should have made Banquo’s ghost appear 
more mysteriously instead of merely coming from behind a screen 
and sitting down in Macbeth’s place. To me these details were 
very interesting. I saw Macbeth performed not only as a spectator, 
but as a critic, because of the above discussions that were taken up 
in class. 
To me tragedy is more interesting than comedy. Therefore I 
liked Macbeth better than any other play that we have studied. I 
found the tragedy of Macbeth quite full of historical facts con- 
cerning Scotland at that time. 
Teaching in elective courses in drama.—The methods 
here outlined concerning the study of a play may be applied 
in general to any play extant, whether it be ancient, Eliza- 
bethan, or recent, long or short, verse or prose. An enlight-
-P-A-G-E-130
  122 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
ened extension of the curriculum in recent years has permitted 
additions of two kinds to the drama previously studied. 
Frequently in large high schools in the eleventh and twelfth 
years, term or year courses in the study of the drama, 
usually elective, have been offered. Practice of teaching, 
ends sought, material used, and results obtained vary with 
nearly every school, but from reports, the seemingly mis- 
cellaneous effects may be grouped in two main divisions— 
those which study the drama in literary form through periods 
from early Greece to modern little theater, and those which 
emphasize the production aspect of plays, including voice 
training, gestures, speaking, oral interpretation, ete. The 
first of these leans towards the literary-history type of 
course, the second towards acting. If legitimately educating 
in the correct sense of the word, both are eminently valuable 
in the school. If the first becomes a too rapid, super- 
ficial survey in which citations of names replace intimate 
acquaintance with masterpieces, it is not being properly 
presented. If the second becomes a mere feeder for showing- 
off before school and public audiences, it is likely to be- 
come a pernicious influence in the organization. Educa- 
tional dramatics must not be confused with training for the 
Jstage. 
Teaching non-Shakespearean drama.—The second addi- 
tion to the usual kind of drama studied is an enriching of the 
material read by admitting to the classroom plays of more 
modern composition and of more novel form and content 
than the classics. Countless schools which tolerated Shake- 
speare have found that Goldsmith and Sheridan will not 
corrupt morals or send youthful admirers to stage careers. 
With the revival of play writing in all languages, has come a 
recognition by educators of the value of the inherent dramatic 
impulse of all persons. If recent plays are studied as repre- 
senting the body of dramatic literature from which the world 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
DRAMA 123 
will select and elect the masterpieces, they deserve some 
attention from teachers of English. Most of them do not 
deserve, and will not invite as careful study, as much time, 
as the acknowledged triumphs of ancient Greece, Elizabethan 
England, and seventeenth century France, but because they 
require less adroit approach, less careful analysis, less sensi- 
tive response, they are all the more admirably suited for 
supplementary or collateral or outside reading, as it is vari- 
ously called. 
Communities far removed from large cities can hardly hope 
to see productions of worthy recent and contemporary 
dramas unless the rapidly spreading community and ama- 
teur dramatics wave becomes properly ballasted and _per- 
petuated. Thousands of educated persons in the United 
States will be forced to satisfy their desire for drama by 
reading it in book form. That the habit of reading plays is 
increasing is proved by a study of publishers’ trade lists. 
Firms which a few years ago printed none, today offer a 
dozen or score of volumes. Most recently they have pub- 
lished collections of short plays for school, some of them with 
critical or study suggestions, others bare of adventitious aids 
making their appeal as reading or producing material solely. 
Already lovers of real drama are raising their voices in warn- 
ing against the risks of allowing teachers uninterested in 
this great art or untrained in its traditions and conventions 
or inept in presenting its beauties to deal with this form. 
Many instructors will appreciate their deficiencies and will 
as a result either fit themselves, or will deal with the aspects 
in which they are least hazy, the plot, structure, character- 
ization, effects, delaying the consideration of phases un- 
mastered, such as stage production, lighting, acting, settings. 
It is an excellent rule in attempting to teach the drama to 
teach only what one knows, not what one guesses. 
Adapt material to the pupils. —Teachers must appreciate  
-P-A-G-E-132
  124 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
the fact that what appeals to the sophisticated background 
of the children of a large city may pass quite over the heads of 
pupils in rural communities. This difference is as patent in 
response to dramatic material as it is in response to poetic 
details—teachers who have moved about know the varying 
knowledge concerning such stock verse topics as the tide, 
the curfew, anchors, sap running, Sunday observances. Not 
less marked are the variations in appeal of dramatic material. 
Fortunately for the teaching of drama, the greatest recent 
plays justify the demands made upon both class and teacher. 
The greatest of all dramas exhibit universal elements which 
will make their effects felt if they are not neutralized by 
poor preparation or antagonistic teaching. Any department 
of English which wishes to spend time in reading two good 
modern plays each semester will not experience much 
difficulty in making selections. 
Dramatize other forms of literature.—There is another 
phase of the study of dramatics which has attracted teachers 
recently because they have seen in it an effective method of 
awakening interest, stimulating activity, developing imagina- 
tion, producing impressions, and requiring thought and 
application. This is dramatization. Like most special 
methods in education, it has been hailed as the panacea of 
all educational ills if applied to all the visible sore spots. 
Grammar has been dramatized by having pupils assume 
the réles of the parts of speech. A boy pops up from his seat 
every time a noun is referred to, or discussed, etc., etc. This 
is not, however, the idea underlying dramatization to be 
stressed at this place. Dramatization as a study of dramatic 
form and process is suggestive of the creation of drama from 
material already existing in another form, or from original 
material. All narrative literature contains portions close 
to drama, frequently quite similar to what might be written 
as stage dialogue and action. Quite as frequently, that which 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
DRAMA 125 
appears in the poem or story to be quite like drama proves 
upon trial by delivery to fall perfectly flat. Students of 
dramatic technique know quite accurately why this appear- 
ance is so often deceptive, but educationally the best results 
are to be obtained from this second kind of at first disap- 
pointing material. The skill, the thought, the ingenuity 
of pupils is enlisted in selecting, in rephrasing, in rearranging, 
in amplifying, and in emphasizing passages chosen from 
narrative productions. 
Activities involved in dramatizing.—This kind of legiti- 
mate dramatization links with practically every other phase 
of English. To select intelligently the passages for dramatic 
treatment requires absolute knowledge of their contents and 
critical judgment of their suitableness. The transformation 
of usual narrative into dramatic scene enlists powers of 
composition into which there enters more than a facility 
for scribbling. Hearing in the mind speeches which portray 
character in addition to reflecting feeling and advancing the 
action, brings into the foreground a sense of the actual 
values of words and phrases. These two processes induce 
exercise in composition of the proper sort. Any so-called 
dramatization which merely repeats the ready-made conver- 
sation of an author is not dramatization—it is merely oral 
delivery of what has been written as prose or verse narrative. 
Some literary masterpieces do contain passages which may be 
recited as lines in a scene with no changes, but these are not 
many. They do not rise rapidly enough; if interesting, they 
do not advance the plot; they do not complete a unit of 
action; they consume too long a time; they do not create 
strong feelings of suspense. 
Steps in dramatizing.—In planning exercises in pupil 
dramatizations, teachers should select from narratives those 
sections which are closest to regular dramatic structure. 
Association with a few of these will show pupils what should  
-P-A-G-E-134
  126 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
be present in any dramatic excerpt. Later, less inherently 
correct portions should be chosen and rewritten to conform 
to the canons of play structure. It is not unfair to expect 
pupils to attempt original exercises in play form. There is 
no reason why they should not build a plot, arrange the parts, 
provide he action, write the speeches, memorize the lines, 
and present the play. Teachers who have introduced these 
enlivening methods of composition practice into their classes 
report that the old apathy vanishes, that the dullest glow 
with the fire of their puny originality, that effort has to be 
suppressed, and embryonic dramatists forced to attend to 
other less fascinating but more enduring results in the study 
of English.

CHAPTER VI 
ESSAYS AND SPEECHES 
ESSAYS 
Essays distributed throughout the years.—When teachers 
of English admitted that it was unnatural to separate com- 
position into four forms of discourse for specialized practice, 
they claimed that logically, specimens of general writing 
should be read or studied in every grade in order to familiar- 
ize the pupil with the multiform aspect of produced litera- 
ture. The rearrangement of courses of study to include 
specimens of drama at various places, instead of concentrat- 
ing all in the senior year, has already been considered. Like- 
wise, no one term is now given over to poetry alone, or to 
fiction, or to orations. Literature is always a combination 
of many styles and kinds of writing. The simplest book for 
boys and girls exhibits various types of discourse. Any one 
who writes is likely to introduce more than mere narration or 
description. The significance of this for the study of essays 
is quite plain. An entire term spent upon no other form 
would prove extremely monotonous to both teacher and 
pupils, no matter how much variety within the form could 
be secured. 
Interesting appeals made by imaginative fiction and 
beautiful poetry would be lacking. Second, as essays are 
comparatively short, pupils would receive an impression of 
miscellaneousness, which is not the best impression to bear 
away from a half-year’s study. Larger units are better for 
growing minds. The shortness of an essay contributes to 
127
-P-A-G-E-136
‘128 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
the impression a pupil forms naturally of its lack of impor- 
tance. Essays have never bulked very large in amount in 
any period of history when compared with other forms of 
literary production. In compliance with the proportion to 
be observed, they must not abrogate to themselves too great 
importance. The mind which is held by essays and in- 
fluenced by their instructions is likely to be the mature mind. 
Even their brevity is in the opinion of youth not an induce- 
ment for reading them. 
Approaches to the essay.—As a means of preparation 
for mature reading and thought, as well as of instruction and 
pleasure now, some essays should be included in practically 
every term of high school English. Because the sources of 
pleasure are not apparent to the pupils, because pupils are 
not avid for reading the prime purpose of which is instruc- 
tion, and because the perusal of this form requires thought 
and reflection, essays present delicate problems for the 
teacher who hopes and intends to make them of value to his 
pupils. The results are so surprisingly good in many in- 
stances that there is solace for those who see now only the 
annoyances and prejudices. With most high school pupils 
the approach and the testing will make this study either the 
comforting success it deserves to be, or the mediocre ac- 
complishment which barely escapes dismal failure. At one 
time the approach to the essay as a form of discourse was 
through emphasis upon exposition. The pedagogical method 
is still to regard all essays as examples of expository writing, 
in spite of the disturbing number of unplaced exceptions to 
this general rule. In all periods of English literary history, 
fascinating and famous essays were produced which elude 
the restricting confines of the definition of exposition. No 
reader in his right mind will declare that the De Coverley 
papers are expository; of course, they are narrative. Much 
of Macaulay’s vaunted writing is only incidentally exposi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
ESSAYS AND SPEECHES 129 
tory; in the main it is biographical and historical narration. 
Beginners will be less abashed if they are not required to 
formulate distinctions first, but are shown how to put them- 
selves under the influence of the author, how to retain what 
he says, how to judge what he tells, and how to describe his 
manner of writing. These aims may be applied to any essay 
ever published, from Bacon’s Of Studies, through Lamb’s 
Dream Children, to Mr. Heywood Broun’s The Fifty-first 
Dragon. 
Cooperation with other departments.—The much-desired 
codperation of other departments will also provide’ methods 
of approach and testing, for essays dealing with scientific, 
industrial, historical, biographical, and current information 
should have been made familiar to the pupils in classes in 
which such material is used to supplement the regular text- 
books. The comprehensiveness of essay material spreads 
before the teacher of English an embarrassment of riches 
from which his care for literary excellence should enable him 
to choose only those which reach a literary standard. Accuracy 
and definiteness of information are not the only standards 
of judgment, for these two qualities are most marked in 
patent descriptions and contract specifications. The warning 
implied in this sentence should be emphasized, for in their 
endeavor to enliven and modernize reading for English classes 
some not too well read or literary-trained teachers would 
like to include productions not much higher in treatment 
and style than those just cited. i 
Another warning may not be out of place here. One of the 
worst ways to “teach essays” is to hand pupils copies of 
Bacon’s Essays or the Essays of Elia or Sesame and Lilies 
with the direction, “Read this through during next week; 
then be prepared to report in class on the contents.” The 
teacher who does such a thing has no reason to complain of 
unappreciative readers. He has made no attempt to do any

teaching. He is able after such reading merely to test pupils’ 
reaction to strange books. He has provided no educating 
process; he has offered no directions for study; he should 
expect no development. Volumes of essays by a single 
author are not often arranged in the best order for pupils. 
Select suitable essays.—Unless the pupils are using a 
book in which the essays have been carefully selected to suit 
their age and previous training, the teacher must select what 
will best serve as a beginning. To produce results he had 
better not say, ‘Read any essay in this volume which strikes 
your fancy.” This direction should be the assignment to 
conclude the study and reading of essays. Every pupil in 
the class should begin by reading the same essay. In The 
Essays of Elia it may well be A Dissertation on Roast Pig. 
Skilful questioning to produce comments by the readers 
will show them how to retain and judge, what to think, what 
to enjoy. The phrase “what to think” is used advisedly; 
there are many “thoughts” offered by pupils in such ex- 
ercises over which no time should be wasted in discussion. 
For instance, the child who has not seen that Lamb is de- 
lightfully fooling should not be allowed to argue for his 
astonishing error—he should be set right in a single state- 
ment. To enforce this with another example: the child who 
does not see the point of the joke in “there is much to be 
said on both sides” in the De Coverley papers, and the pupil 
who wrongly believes that Sir Roger did make love speeches 
to the widow should not be encouraged to explain their 
misreading. They are wrong; their errors should be explained 
in a few sentences. Building on the delight the pupils find 
in their first acquaintance with Elia, the teacher may assign 
two other essays—shall we say April Fool’s Day and Dream 
Children? Will these not make a good pair—one continuing 
the whimsical humor of A Dissertation, yet refining it, the 
«ther introducing a different feeling, one of pathos? A third
-P-A-G-E-139
ESSAYS AND SPEECHES 131 
assignment still may keep the class covering the same 
material. The next direction may stipulate one essay and 
suggest in addition a group from which one or two may be 
selected by individual choice. The discussion of this lesson 
should be devoted almost entirely to the personal selections. 
The remainder of the assignments may be simply a certain 
number of essays not previously read. This method will 
produce results because it provides a device for progressive 
training in understanding and appreciating an author. It 
passes from prescribed reading to chosen reading. It pro- 
vides at first standards which are directly and immediately 
applied to an author. It relieves the insistence that all 
persons like the same things. It permits individuality to 
serve itself and to display its results. It reproduces the dis- 
cussions by adults concerning their reading, for men and 
women proffer and invite advice concerning literature. It 
demonstrates to the teacher the growth of literary apprecia- 
tion in every pupil. The same method may be applied to 
Bacon’s Essays, to Carlyle’s Heroes and Hero Worship, to 
collections of the essays of Stevenson, Burroughs, Arnold, 
Benson, Crothers, and Chesterton. 
Special forms of essays.—Single essays, which because 
of length, of significance, of uniqueness, are studied as single 
units, cannot be placed as suggested in the preceding para- 
graphs. It is interesting to notice that many of these, though 
they may be considered essays, were written with quite 
definite purposes in mind. Many of the essays of Macaulay 
were written as book reviews. This knowledge may induce 
a little more respect in a boy towards the book reviews or 
reading reports he is required to prepare in English. It will 
also add to the understanding of both form and material. 
It will give a different basis for judgment. Macaulay’s 
Addison is plainly to be judged by different standards from 
those applied to one of The Gentle Reader series. From
-P-A-G-E-140
  
132 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
Macaulay the pupil may be led to book reviews of his own 
times. He will be all the more interested in the essay on 
Lincoln by Karl Schurz whenhe learns that it is a book review 
of a biography of the president. An aspect of uniqueness is 
displayed in a different group of personal utterances which 
are more strictly lectures than essays. This division is a 
large and miscellaneous one, some of the members of which 
are well known in schools, nearly all of which should be. It 
includes Thackeray’s English Humorists, Ruskin’s Sesame 
and Lilies, Emerson’s The American Scholar, Palmer’s 
Self-Cultivation in English, Newman’s The Idea of a Univer- 
sity, and several others equally suited to high school years. 
In this special form, the essay is closely related to the speech. 
These essays are decidedly more closely reasoned, more 
logically developed than the familiar type of Addison, 
Steele, Lamb, DeQuincey, Stevenson, and contributors to 
modern magazines. Many of them are “meatier” in sub- 
stance. Conceived with a definite end in view, designed to 
instruct, or convert, or sway, or influence a large audience by 
means of a single hearing, they proceed by methods best 
adapted to these ends. Their themes are more plainly 
stated than those of the rambling, personal compositions 
designed for quiet and sympathetic perusal in the comfort 
of a study. They seem to take less for granted, they assume 
less concurrence in the minds of the listeners. Ruskin, for 
instance, goes systematically to work to expose his theories, he 
labels his steps, he numbers his reasons, he shows his reason- 
ing, he announces his plan in advance, and furnishes sum- 
maries at convenient places. The same orderly develop- 
ment is perfectly plain in Self-Cultivation in English, where 
the entire progression unfolds step by step as the reader 
listens. 
Teach the intention of the essayist.—The difference in 
intention among various kinds of essays determined their
-P-A-G-E-141
  
ESSAYS AND SPEECHES 133 
‘form and treatment. All these elements should affect the 
manner of teaching. The teacher should know the intention 
of the writer, then have pupils become familiar with the 
particular essay through the method which best serves the 
author’s purpose. Should Lamb be studied for the accumula- 
tion of knowledge? Hardly. Should the essays of Lamb 
be studied at all? Did their author not feel quite repaid if 
readers of The London Magazine enjoyed the lucubrations of 
Elia? Shall a teacher not rest content when he has shown 
how to enjoy these unique expressions of a strange personality 
and has led pupils to be delighted over them? Does not this 
aim apply to a great deal of essay reading? An observance of 
this does not mean willy-nilly hurrying over pages. Young 
persons must be taught—that is, shown and exercised in the 
procedure—how best to appreciate a great many literary 
productions. A teacher, by careful reading himself, should 
determine beforehand the classes in which essay material 
and treatment belong, and consistently base work with that 
matter and that manner upon the intentions which animated 
the author in selecting them. 
Teaching the informative essay.—Informative essays 
should be discussed in a different manner. Having been 
written with the intention of conveying information, they 
should be justified today by the value of that information 
toareader. To this informational value there may be added 
as many excellences as literature may bear, but primarily 
the essay remains great for the quality which stamped it at 
first—its thought value. Is it Macaulay’s style alone which 
justifies keeping his book reviews—Addison, Milton—in the 
schools where they are studied? If all the essayist’s facts 
concerning his literary figures were incorrect, if all his judicial 
pronouncements were false, if all his reasoned conclusions 
were unsound, would his famous style induce teachers to 
plead for the retention of his compositions? A pupil who has
-P-A-G-E-142
    134 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
spent a few days studying Macaulay’s essay on Milton 
should know many things about the poet, he should have 
learned how literary criticism is evolved, he should have seen 
the figure of a brave champion against a background of 
political turmoil and social licentiousness. He should have 
imbibed some of the principles of planning an essay. The 
pupil who has studied the Life of Johnson should have led 
his mind to contemplate all these elements. More plainly in 
the study of Johnson than in the study of Milton, the pupil 
should have received a spiritual contact with an attractive 
personality—not the author’s, as is the result of reading 
Addison, Steele, Irving, and Lamb, but the subject’s—the 
best known but least read of all the eighteenth century 
authors. 
Supplement the essay material.—Literary and historical 
essays may be enriched in a manner not profitable for the 
familiar essays. When a boy has read one man’s whimsi- 
cal discussion of the lack of a tuneful ear, he is not fired 
with the desire to read more about the absence of musical taste, 
Familiar essays do not lead to supplementary reading, al- 
though they do lead to continued reading. By this is meant 
that if a pupil falls under the sway of Lamb, he may desire to 
read more of Lamb’s writings because he is interested in 
Lamb. Such essays are excellent incitements of the reading 
habit. Quite different is the usual effect of the informative 
essay. Only rarely will a pupil, having been attracted by 
one of Macaulay’s literary essays follow it by the pictures of 
Warren Hastings and Lord Clive; or the reverse—interest 
in these Indian essays does not send a pupil off to the library 
for Macaulay’s Madam d’Arblay. There are details in the 
literary essays which literally beg for supplementary reading. 
A skilful teacher with a flair for literature can induce a sur- 
prising amount of supplementary reading outside school 
while the essay is occupying time and attention in the class.
-P-A-G-E-143
  ESSAYS AND SPEECHES 135 
If adroitly planned in advance, detail after detail mentioned 
by the critic, poem cited by title, adventure slightly men- 
tioned, can be amplified by a report, until the entire class is 
not only studying the prescribed essay, but reading and 
thinking about everything it suggests. The exercise which 
began asthe study of a single essay becomes the core of a 
comprehensive survey of a period of history, of a widening 
acquaintance with an author’s works, of a consideration of 
an empire’s growth, of the evidences of our nation’s intellect- 
ual independence from Europe, of the development of the 
human mind by utilization of its linguistic and literary sense, 
of the great scientific movement of the nineteenth century. 
These claims may sound too general. How do they apply to 
definite essays or essayists? 
Examples of supplementary material.—Consider the tastes 
and aptitudes of pupils, then provide related reading for 
them by grouping essays about a theme or topic. Have 
them base their judgments and make their reports upon 
comparative considerations of portions of essays or entire 
productions. If a boy shows an interest in nature study, or 
semi-scientific observation of the universe, he may be en- 
riched by some acquaintance with such masterpieces as the 
following, although he will likely remark that some of the 
selections are too long to be called essays. 
John Burroughs, Birds and Bees, Locusts and Wild Honey, Wake 
Robin, Winter Sunshine; Maurice Maeterlinck, Field Flowers, News 
of the Spring, Old Fashioned Flowers; Henry D. Thoreau, A Week on 
the Concord and Merrimac Rivers, Walden, The Maine Woods, 
Cape Cod; Henry Van Dyke, Little Rivers, Fisherman’s Luck; 
Gilbert White, The Natural History of Selborne; William eepey 
Jungle Peace. 
A quiet girl who enjoys the subtler charms of literature may 
be given the following list:
-P-A-G-E-144
    186 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
Samuel M. Crothers, The Gentle Reader; F. Callaway, Charm 
and Courtesy in Letter Writing; O. W. Holmes, The Autocrat of the 
Breakfast Table; Frederic Harrison, The Choice of Books; Jacob 
Riis, How the Other Half Lives; E. VY. Lucas, The Gentlest Art; 
John Ruskin, Sesame and Lilies; Agnes Repplier, In Our Convent 
Days; R. L. Stevenson, Familiar Studies of Men and Books, Vir- 
ginibus Puerisque; Charles Wagner, The Simple Life. 
Those who are avid for actual or imaginative travel should 
be told of: 
Oliver Goldsmith, The Citizen of the World; Lafcadio Hearn, 
Out of the East; R. L. Stevenson, Inland Voyage, Travels with a 
Donkey; John Muir, Travels in Alaska; H. D. Thoreau; Stewart 
Edward White, Camp and Trail; Grace G. Seton, A Woman 
Tenderfoot; Richard Burton, From El Medinah to Mecca; A. M. 
Rihbany, A Far Journey; J. Flint, Tramping with Tramps; J. Me- 
Kenzie, Black Sheep. 
If the pupil’s interest centers on animal life, there is an 
embarrassment of riches, ranging from quiet observation to 
thrilling adventure in such books as these: 
Rudyard Kipling, The Jungle Books; Ernest Thompson Seton, 
Wild Animals I Have Known; C. G. D. Roberts, The Kindred of the 
Wild; Ellen Velvin, Behind the Scenes with Wild Animals; Frank 
Bostock, The Training of Wild Animals; W. J. Long, Beasts of the 
Field; W. H. Gibson, Sharp Eyes; Sir John Lubbock, Ants, Bees, 
and Wasps; G. W. and E. Peckham, Spiders; H. J. Fabre, Social Life 
tn the Insect World; A. R. Dugmore, The Romance of the Beaver. 
Will a teacher continue to be a good teacher if he pretends 
to study Carlyle’s Essay on Burns without teaching a great 
deal about Burns? If this essay is read merely to show the 
critical and stylistic power of Carlyle, it is being wrongly 
used. No teacher should allow his pupils to rest content 
with reading and remembering correctly the cardinal qualities 
attributed by Carlyle to the poems. Some of the episodes of
-P-A-G-E-145
ESSAYS AND SPEECHES 137 
the poet’s life need not be emphasized, but his reputation 
as poet will be all the more amazing if pupils are able to 
amplify many of the sentences of the critic. This essay 
should be made the text of an extensive and intensive study 
of the poetry of Robert Burns. 
Around Ruskin’s Sesame and Lilies a large number of 
problems, projects, reports, readings, debates, and discus- 
sions should be grouped. In this instance the material is 
less likely to be confined to literary topics, therefore a re- 
freshing sense of variety will be injected. Are all Ruskin’s 
charges against his age still true today? Has our nation paid 
too little tribute to science? How—when—why? A general 
discussion or debate should spring from this. Are all his 
statements concerning books true? Is his famous criticism 
of the heroes of Shakespeare’s dramas justified? Some 
pupils should read and report upon passages in Mrs. Jame- 
son’s Heroines of Shakespeare. Has his opinion concerning 
the education of girls an old-fashioned sound to our ears? 
Direct pupils to such books as Tarbell, The Business of Being 
A Woman; Van Vorst, The Woman Who Toils; Schreiner, 
Woman and Labor. Did his preachings do anything for 
social reform? Was the man himself successful? Read 
selections from the correspondence with Charles Eliot 
Norton. Was he greater as artist, reformer, litterateur? 
Correlate one of these with the art department. Unless 
teachers do this kind of work with the essays of Ruskin, 
they will find it difficult to justify their retention in the high 
school curriculum. The topics suggested here, and others 
growing naturally from them are not beyond the powers of 
tenth and eleventh year high school pupils. 
Our “‘intellectual declaration of independence” is usually 
placed in the eleventh or twelfth year. Held in solution in 
this noble address on The American Scholar are suggestions 
of a score of investigations and reports. The first is an  
-P-A-G-E-146
  188 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
explanation of part of the title—-What is the Phi Beta 
Kappa Society? Why are scholars so venerated? What 
are the purposes of colleges? What is the thinking man? 
“The English dramatic poets have Shakespearized now for 
two hundred years.” Relative values of power, money, 
learning? Has our national life fulfilled Emerson’s hopes? 
Much more closely related to the development of the 
pupil, therefore more valuable as inducing him to self- 
scrutiny, is Self-Cultivation in English. Merely reading and 
understanding this address is not adequate treatment. It 
is full of provocative statements—provocative not of differ- 
ence of opinion and contention, but provocative of amplifica- 
tion, of illustration, of incident, of citation of names and 
titles. Of much the same kind, but requiring a higher degree 
of thought and literary response are the essays of Matthew 
Arnold, which, however, if studied should be studied in 
exactly this same connotative manner. 
Include scientific material.—History, criticism, literature, 
are not the only material of essays which are worth enriching. 
Masters of scientific thought and observers of beautiful 
nature have recorded their opinions and experiences for our 
study. The two groups blend into each other, so the names 
may be placed here in one list:— Davy, Farraday, Tyndall, 
White, Darwin, Muir, Huxley, Osler, Thoreau, Hearn, 
Fabre, Hudson, Mills, Maeterlinck, Lodge, Serviss, Bur- 
toughs, Van Dyke. Unless the teacher is open-minded 
towards the enthusiasms of the scientifically and nature- 
minded members of his class, he may dampen their naive 
enthusiasm and turn the promise of an interested participa- 
tion into the bore of a tedious stretch of reading. He had 
better admit to himself—even to the class—the sense of his 
own inferiority in scientific equipment compared with many 
of them. He need not suffer in prestige or dignity, he may 
‘still remain in nominal control of the conduct of the class
-P-A-G-E-147
ESSAYS AND SPEECHES 139 
work, while in reality the well-informed pupils are conducting 
affairs themselves. Or he may frankly turn over the pro- 
cedure to the pupils, allowing them for once to instruct him 
in the method of mastering the contents of a scientific 
treatise. Many high school boys know more incidents to 
illustrate the essays of John Burroughs than do many in- 
structors. Some of Fabre’s studies of insects are better 
understood by school minors than by school majors. The 
physics of Farraday and the botany of Darwin awaken 
responses in pupils which teachers miss completely. In a 
junior high school in the densely congested district of a large 
city a young negress told more about bird-lore than a mature 
teacher could muster in a week. Such exercises growing 
from the study of essays pass into oral or written composi- 
tion, but they should be mentioned here as indicating an- 
other side of the valuable work the essay in schools will 
produce. 
Teach recent and contemporary essays.—In prose 
narrative, in poetry, and in drama, the teacher may be dis- 
posed to dwell in the realm of the conservatively standard. 
He cannot do this if he knows how to treat the essay. In 
composition it is too multiform, in appearance too frequent, 
in conversation mention of it is too insistent, in the life of the 
day its importance is too well recognized for him to escape it. 
If he be wise, he will not try to close his eyes to the revival 
of interest in the essay in recent years. There is no need to 
trace the causes which have made men and women turn to 
the essay for information and entertainment. The patent 
fact is that they have been reading it and heeding it more 
and more. Every current magazine contains essays, many 
of them of excellent quality. We are too close to their 
‘production, too much swayed, by the pedagogical prejudice 
that whatever is new is suspect, to recognize clearly the 
masterpieces and to place the compositions in gradations. 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  140 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
Several collections of contemporary essays have recently 
been published. Teachers of English can help their pupils 
to read the better ones, to judge them wisely, and to compare 
them with the acknowledged best of the past. A sign of the 
changing attitude in school tactics is displayed by the re- 
ceptiveness of the teachers of English to literature in the 
making. Essays are excellent material in which to experi- 
ment, for they are so short that not too much time is con- 
sumed in testing the value of recent ones. Shorter, less 
formal ones afford the best models for pupil attempts in 
imitation and emulation, but here the study passes over into 
the practice of composition. 
If any teacher still questions the fitness of reading recent 
and contemporary essays, let him recall that the form has 
been dignified by the attention of presidents of the United 
States. Theodore Roosevelt wrote essays in A Booklover’s 
Holiday, Mr. Taft in Powers of the President and Fruits of 
Victory, and Mr. Wilson in On Being Human and When a 
Man Comes to Himself. 
SPEECHES 
Essentials underlying the study of speeches.—In con- 
sidering speeches as material for study in high schools, the 
[first essential is a clear recognition of exactly what a speech 
| is, what called it into being, what its purpose was, how nearly 
/ successfully it attained its object. The speech—much more 
| than any other production in words—is an effort born of 
occasion and designed to serve a specific end. The restric- 
tions of occasional verse are as nothing when compared to 
those of every speech. The reason for their composition is the 
reason for their passing. Success means the accomplishment 
of their objects. Like the molds used to produce beautiful 
shapes, they cease to serve any purpose once the object of
-P-A-G-E-149
ESSAYS AND SPEECHES 141 
art has been shaped. In one sense speeches are more utilita- 
rian than the most informative essay ever penned. They are 
more specific in purpose, for their ends are single. They 
aim to be immediate in their results, as they are transitory 
in their forms. When the speaker has concluded, the speech, 
unless it has been put into writing or retained in listeners’ 
memories, ceases to exist. Its effect may remain for ever, 
but its words—winged words, as the old Greeks called them— 
have disappeared. A speech is unlike any other form of dis- 
course in this respect. Its claim to recognition depends upon 
its delivery, upon its speaker, upon its audience, upon its 
reception, upon the action it induces. Doubtless the world 
has allowed more great speeches to vanish than it has pre- 
served. Judged from its purpose the speech—no matter how 
grandly planned, how effectively phrased, how movingly 
spoken—which fails to secure the result it attempts to 
evoke, is a failure. Its inherent qualities may induce the 
world to overlook the disappointment of the speaker and to 
declare his utterance a masterpiece worthy of preservation, 
yet the bald fact remains, the speech tried to do something 
and failed. Qualities of style, of noble thinking, of cogent 
reasoning, of valuable information may make the printed 
speech worth reading later. It is this recorded speech, of 
course, that is studied in schools as literature. A definite 
recognition of the differences between the original speech 
and the printed record of it will be the first aid to the teacher 
who attempts to present this form to pupils. 
Show how style in speeches has changed.—A second fact 
concerning speech-making should be clear in the teacher’s 
and pupils’ minds. Style in speeches has changed markedly. 
The modern political economist would not dare to model his 
sentences after those of Milton. The careful public speaker 
now takes advantage of the training of his audiences, or if he 
senselessly throws his ideas into the phrases of Patrick Henry 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
  142 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
and Edward Everett he will meet only derision and inatten- 
tion from intelligent listeners. Success with the less intelli- 
gent, quite easy to win at all periods of the world’s history, 
will do him little good. At any rate, his utterances will not 
be read in schools. The teacher of the rather few recorded 
speeches worthy of time and study in school should be con- 
scious of the levels of appeal possible in public speaking, for 
upon a separation of material will depend real teaching or 
mere imitation. Classical influence has disappeared from 
modern life. No longer do so-called orators boom about the 
land appealing to the unworthy instincts and mob prejudices 
of vacillating crowds. The modern speech is frequently a 
well-organized essay, carefully prepared in structure and 
facts even if its manner and phrasing be left to the instanta- 
neous composition of the minute, carefully adjusted to the 
group it is intended to convince rather than sway, and de- 
livered directly to their intellects rather than to their emo- 
tions. Teachers must never forget these changed conditions 
of speech-making, for in the present and the proximate future 
will the pupils of today exercise their talents in public speak- 
ing. This phase of the study of speeches will have to be 
discussed again under the heading The Ability to Speak 
(Chapter X), but it must be cited here as an essential princi- 
ple. While the manner of public address has changed, there 
has been no diminution of its importance or decrease in its 
amount. Therefore, every progressive high school retains 
in its curriculum study of the masterpieces which have been 
preserved, and has introduced, or is introducing courses 
devoted to actual practice in this valuable training for the 
conduct of all life’s activities. 
Teach from the pupils’ point of view.—As a preliminary 
to the teaching of a single speech or several, the teacher 
should familiarize himself with the periods of history from 
early Greece until today in which public speaking has been
-P-A-G-E-151
  ESSAYS AND SPEECHES 143 
powerful and orators renowned. Then he should begin the 
plans for the teaching of the speech. At this point he must 
transfer interest from his own point of view to that of his 
pupils. He may be sick unto death of “Give me liberty or 
give me death,” of “government of the people, by the people, 
for the people,” of “union and liberty, one and indivisible, 
now and forever,” of “live or die, survive or perish,” but he 
must remember that such phrases are comparatively novel 
to the pupils. One of the difficulties in teaching triteness in 
rhetoric and composition is that to the youth of fifteen the 
phrases tabooed by the book are not trite, not nearly so 
trite as some of the unenforced and disregarded admonitions 
of the instructor himself. 
Teach five things about a speech.—An understanding 
of a speech is dependent upon the knowledge of five Pia 
about it: 1. Purpose. 2. Occasion. 3. Audience. 4. Mate- 
rial. 5. Style. These are arranged in the order of thet } 
discussion and difficulty for pupils. 
1. Purpose.—Every speech should have a purpose. The 
man who talks merely to kill time—either in familiar dis- 
- eourse or in the United States Senate—should be suppressed 
or disregarded. Every speech studied in school has a pur- 
pose. Let the teacher determine that in his own mind, so 
that he may help pupils to discover it for themselves. Good 
speeches make their purposes clear at once. Only muddied 
minds and “‘spell-binders” cloud their intentions by garbled 
verbiage. The purpose of each speech should be agreed upon 
by the class and expressed in a declarative sentence. This 
will serve to test the bearing of all parts upon the avowed 
purpose. The statement corresponds to the theme of the 
essay or the student composition. The class should enumer- 
ate a list of possible purposes which might inspire speeches in 
current affairs. 
2. Occasion.—Closely related to th» purpose is the occasion
-P-A-G-E-152
  144 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
of the speech. What circumstances, what events, what 
date produced the speech? In some instances the occasion 
determines the theme; at other times the theme determines 
the occasion. To study Lincoln’s Second Inaugural Address 
with no knowledge of the date and circumstances renders 
the entire proceeding futile. It negatives the effort. It 
reduces to meaningless words the pregnant declaration, 
“Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might 
cease with, or even before, the conflict itself should cease.” 
Ignorance of the occasion renders useless the attempt to 
study The Bunker Hill Oration, The Cooper Union Speech, 
The Speech on Conciliation with the American Colonies, The 
Address to the American Federation of Labor in 1917. The 
speakers themselves usually make perfectly clear to their 
audiences the significance of the occasion, but we must 
remember that a class of boys and girls in a high school in 
1922 is not the counterpart of the massed assemblage of 
proud New Englanders who in 1825 grouped themselves 
around the veterans of the Revolutionary War and the 
venerable Lafayette to hear Daniel Webster, or of the spell- 
bound New Yorkers who so amazedly heard Abraham 
Lincoln in 1860, or of the inattentive commoners who in 1775 
did not listen to the Irish pronunciation of Edmund Burke, 
or the workingmen who in Buffalo listened to Mr. Wilson 
explaining to them their part in the Great World War. 
It is therefore incumbent upon the teacher that he recon- 
struct for his pupils, or have them reconstruct, the scene 
which framed the occasion. In their imaginations they must 
experience the delivery of the speech. Only in this manner 
can the speech be made to spring from the printed page into 
moving life. 
8. Audience.—Part of the occasion is the audience. The 
persons who listen to a speech are also determining factors of 
its purpose. Material must be adapted to the audience.
-P-A-G-E-153
ESSAYS AND SPEECHES 145 
Abraham Lincoln spoke very differently to the audience in 
New York in 1860 from the way he had addressed middle 
western groups gathered at country fairs. Webster did not 
speak in the Senate as he did at Bunker Hill. No specimen 
of a speech in court is likely to be studied in school, yet it will 
be well if the class determines exactly who form the audience 
of this kind of speech. All the persons in the courtroom? 
The judge? Another kind of popular school exercise intro- 
duces another novel audience—the real audience of the 
speeches in debate. ‘To instill a permanent sense of who 
constitute the only audience for debaters is almost beyond 
the abilities of teachers of speech. Student debaters will 
almost always be carried away by the appeal to the entire 
audience, instead of talking only for the few judges. In- 
different or hostile audiences must be won to attention before 
they can be instructed or convinced. Traces of the means 
used to accomplish this change must be weighed in speeches 
studied. Webster, when a young man, noticed that in spite 
of his speeches, an opposing lawyer won most of the verdicts, 
so he changed his manner to affect his audience. 
4. Material—tThe fourth element of a speech is its material. 
This comprises all the facts, inferences, premises, deductions, 
conclusions, the warnings, the history, the information, 
introduced by the speaker to induce the audience to carry out 
his purpose. The mastery of this portion of a speech forms 
the bulk of school study of this type. The conclusions of 
the address were the most important part of the delivered 
speech, for if the reasoning by which these were reached 
was sound, the listener could accept them unconditionally. 
But in class, the study of a speech should do more than 
merely impress its conclusions upon the pupils, it should 
show them how to reason by the same methods from facts in 
their own experience and knowledge to conclusions as logic- 
ally inevitable. This aim of the study justifies the time
-P-A-G-E-154
    
146 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
spent upon understanding the material, analyzing it in the 
light of reason, weighing the proofs and explanations ac- 
companying it, following its progression from step to step as 
one follows a demonstration in mathematics. There are 
teachers to whom the close logic of a well planned speech is 
as distasteful as a geometrical proof. Such teachers, lacking 
a sense of the beauty of reasoning and thought relationships, 
should not be required to teach speeches. But their assertion 
that speeches should not be studied in school because they 
do not like them is as undeserving of consideration as would 
be the corresponding reason advanced by educators for their 
inclusion—that they like them. The second prime reason 
for this study lies in the close application required for the 
mastery of the material. An essay may be compactly built 
and severely logical; it is more likely not to be. Good 
speeches display the essence of clear thinking and definite 
statement. They are correctives to the habits of loose se- 
quences young persons are disposed to offer in composition, 
both spoken and written. They present models by which 
pupils may profit. Combined with their logical thought is a 
plan of broad simplicity so that their structure is not difficult 
to carry in the mind. The process by which speakers deter- 
mine their material can be made plain to pupils by asking 
them how closely related to the theme is a given section. 
Could its place have been supplied by anything better? 
Could it have been omitted? With what effect? Webster in 
The Bunker Hill Oration might have omitted the section 
dealing with the South American republics. Why did he 
include it? The best way to master a speech is to make an. 
outline of it. In its early stages, the entries may be decided 
upon by the class working as a whole. Then entries made 
outside class may be placed upon the board and discussed 
until the principles of selection and phrasing are deduced. 
Later portions may be read rapidly, and only those discussed
-P-A-G-E-155
  ESSAYS AND SPEECHES 147 
over which differences of opinion or contradictions arise. 
From the practice in determining the outline, the pupils 
should be able to reconstruct the material of the entire speech. 
One of the chief advantages derived from making an outline 
is that even to start making one, a pupil must clearly under- 
stand what he is trying to represent. A great deal of what is 
ealled study in school fails to grasp definite meanings from 
paragraphs. Unless a pupil understands what he is reading 
he will not be able to prepare an outline, for the difference 
between leading ideas and supporting ones will mean nothing 
to him. Outlines serve for reviews and examinations. At 
the end of the term they should be collected and not returned. 
Each class should really make new ones, not copy approved 
analyses. When a fairly long speech has been completed, it 
may be allotted among the pupils, who in sequence cover its 
material by addressing the class using their own words. This 
continuous recitation is also an excellent method of review. 
No speech is mastered until its material is known. 
5. Style-—More difficult for pupils than the knowledge of 
material is analysis and appreciation of style. This is as 
true of the style of a speech as it is of the style of an essay. 
The difficulty is not so much that pupils may not see, hear, 
and feel differences of style, but that they do not read enough 
varieties for purpose of comparison, and that they have never 
been shown how to make their impressions of style tangible 
and clear. Methods of clarifying these impressions will be 
discussed later in Chapter VIII, dealing with judgment, 
appreciation, criticism, style. 
Show the simple structure of speeches.—Pupils should 
be led to see that the main divisions of the body of the 
longest speech are really very few and easily separated from 
the remainder. The best speakers, knowing that they must 
fix their contentions in the minds of their listeners in a single 
delivery, are careful not to rear structures too complicated.
-P-A-G-E-156
  148 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
When the speech has been intensively studied, if it warrants 
intensive study, the teacher should help pupils to reconstruct 
in their minds the main divisions under which the subordinate 
parts may be grouped until the limit of detailed knowledge 
required by the teacher has been reached. This rapid sum- 
marizing will produce a knowledge of the speech as an entity, 
a fact easily overlooked when class discussion spreads over 
several recitations. 
No speech, however short, is beyond analysis. If correctly 
subordinated to the purpose of teaching the speech, not the 
resultant separations, the method justifies itself. The 
shortest, greatest speech—The Gettysburg Address—may 
be thought of as in two sections. This division is illuminating 
as showing how well its author’s mind worked. It centers 
attention on the discriminating mind of the man who in so 
few words could say so much. The plan of Patrick Henry’s 
Speech in the Virginia Convention can be carried in a nutshell 
if subjected to the same kind of scrutiny. The two Inaugurals 
of Lincoln are only slightly more intricate. Outlines of both 
should be carried for years by persons who mastered them 
in the tenth year. Webster’s speeches are only longer, not 
more intricate. The same may be said of Lincoln’s The 
Cooper Union Speech and Mr. Wilson’s address on the 
Berlin-to-Bagdad Railway. Most of the speeches from 
political campaigns, appeals for votes in Congress, debates 
such as the Lincoln-Douglas series, present difficulties for 
high school pupils, not primarily because the structure is 
complicated, but because since they were born of times when 
feeling ran high and interest in their topics was general, every 
listener was familiar with conditions they tried to change or 
preserve. The material of the speeches was fixed by the 
occasion and the audiences. Today interest in their proposi- 
tions has waned and feeling has cooled. There is not much 
knowledge among high school pupils concerning the ad-
-P-A-G-E-157
  
ESSAYS AND SPEECHES 149 
mission of Nebraska as a state, yet acquaintance with the 
details leading up to the struggle over the constitution of 
that state is necessary to an understanding of one of Lincoln’s 
famous speeches. The widely-studied Conciliation Speech is 
associated with similar objections, but its defenders maintain 
that practically all a pupil has to have is a bowing acquaint- 
ance with Colonial conditions, as Burke furnishes most of the 
other facts in the speech itself. The structure of this speech 
is not as complicated as it appears at first sight. The main 
divisions are not many, because some of them repeat earlier 
sections. Thus, all the facts concerning the Colonies are 
considered twice;—once, as the facts upon which to base the 
answer to the second question, ‘““what the nature of that 
concession should be;” a second time as reasons why it is 
impossible, or if possible, impracticable to change the temper 
and character of the Colonies by removing the causes. Burke 
was exceedingly careful to aid one’s memory by anticipatory 
lists, then by numbered enumeration, then by a rapid 
summary. He does this in dealing with the six causes for 
the fierce love of liberty which has sprung up in America. 
Two of these aids he employs to list his six main resolutions. 
Only once does he interrupt the steady advance of his reason- 
ing to digress, and then the digression is one only in appear- 
ance, for having proven how wealthy the Colonies are, he 
knows that opposing speakers will use that fact to declare 
that therefore it will be wise to retain this prosperous section 
of the Empire by fighting for it. Those four reasons against 
the use of force are introduced so appropriately that no 
pupil who has learned them will ever forget them. 
Contributing to other departments.—So frequently pleas 
for codperation between two departments have meant that 
some other group shall help the teachers of English, that it is 
a pleasure to record here that in the study of speeches the 
department of English should be able and willing to help  
-P-A-G-E-158
  
  150 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
the departments of history and social sciences. The reading 
of the teacher of English is likely to be within the limits of 
so-called pure literature. Only occasionally does he browse 
among other books. Teachers of other subjects could doubt- 
less put under his eyes speeches dealing with their work 
which he might well have his pupils read and discuss for the- 
English class. These specimens of the use made today of 
addresses before large audiences may not reach the literary 
level he may insist upon in compositions worthy of lasting 
respect, but they will serve to stimulate more attention 
among his pupils for a form which they must not be allowed 
to regard as dead. No collection of speeches made for classes 
in English can include recent enough examples. He should 
welcome this living supplementary material, which will 
compensate for its lack of style and significance by its air of 
reality and its timeliness. 
Pass from studying speeches to delivering speeches.— 
The study of speeches may be a part of the regular course in 
English, with specimens graded and allotted to separate 
terms, or it may be the concentrated work of a term or of a 
year. It may be an elective course of the eleventh or twelfth 
year. With all the things it may be, there is one thing it 
should not be. It should not be devoted solely to the study 
of the speech as discourse recorded in print. From this as a 
beginning and utilizing it as the basis, the teacher should 
develop in the pupils the ability to make speeches. School 
life and outside life offer hundreds of occasions for which 
pupils may prepare speeches. There are thousands of topics 
upon which they wish to speak. Rarely do they need more 
than some training and the slightest encouragement. This 
result of the study of speeches is the most beneficial and 
lasting of all.

CHAPTER VII 
READING 
Reading a fundamental of most subjects.—Reading in 
the proper manner is an essential not only of the course in 
English, but of all other courses in high school. There are 
careless readers in the mathematics rooms, in the physics 
laboratories, and in the assembly halls. Recognition of this 
fact has led to the active codperation of other departments 
in the improvement of reading. History, for instance, is 
being taught in such a way as to induce a taste and ability 
for the reading of historical writing. There are so many 
careless readers outside school that if the teachers believe in 
reproducing in classes the conditions of actual life they may 
fold their hands and say complacently, ““What’s the use of 
trying to train pupils to read intelligently? Few grown 
persons do.” Another group will assert in reply that the 
reason for this is that the present adults were not trained 
properly when they were young. In either case high school 
teachers of English cannot shift the responsibility of train- 
ing in reading, although if our school systems are regulated 
properly they should never have to teach the rudiments of 
reading. 
Teach readers to understand.—The first requisite of 
reading is understanding, and understanding depends 
directly upon knowing what the words mean. It is true that 
mature persons read rapidly, that they glance, that they 
skip, but they are mature and therefore different from pupils, 
and secondly, they frequently find themselves mistaken in 
impressions they have seized thus rapidly. Here again, the 
151
-P-A-G-E-160
152 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
instructor must keep in mind continually the differences 
between the pupils’ learning to read and their reading. 
Intensive reading.—By the time pupils enter high school 
they should be adequately prepared for intensive reading. 
This is the most profitable method of teaching reading to 
persons of some intelligence. The teacher must be skilful 
in determining just how long and how exacting the exercise 
shall be. Naturally, in exhaustiveness, it should increase 
with the age of the pupils, although conversely, if over the 
entire high school course the process is followed consistently, 
the upper classes will have been led to read intensively for 
themselves, thereby reducing the time and attention needed 
for it in actual instruction. The results of intensive reading 
are two—adequate knowledge of the material, increased 
power in reading everything. Instructors and more generally 
administrators who judge by quantity as well as quality, 
wonder whether the result justifies the time and energy. 
These are likely to have their eyes fixed only on the first 
result, seldom apprehending or measuring the second, 
which is likely to be the more valuable of the two, even if 
intangible. Teachers who have pupils during a term or a 
year can see and mark the increase in the second, intangible 
result. They know that intensive reading should be applied’ 
to certain prose selections and to nearly all poems. Since 
poetry will always be in the courses in English, it is incum- 
bent that it be properly taught. It should be impossible for 
a single pupil to reach the tenth year and be able to declare, 
“T never knew that poetry meant anything.” 
Upon what intensive reading depends.—Intensive read- 
ing is simply that reading which results in comprehending 
fully the meaning and intention of the writer. ‘Could any- 
thing be simpler? In its application it involves no great dis- 
play of erudition, no amazing remoteness of preference, no 
intricate refining of definition, no juggling with words. It
-P-A-G-E-161
  
READING 153 
may depend upon so simple a thing as grammar. “While 
follow eyes the steady keel.” The class must dwell upon 
this line long enough to see grammatical relationship, not be 
satisfied with a “general impression.” 
The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power, 
And all that beauty, all that wealth e’er gave, 
Awaits alike the inevitable hour; 
The paths of glory lead but to the grave. 
The first three lines become clear only when the class 
discovers the subject of awaits. The pupil will likely read 
the third line without being impressed by the seeming in- 
congruity of the words. The teacher’s questions must 
produce the recognition and the correct explanation. Count- 
less passages in poems need only the simplest grammatical 
analysis in order that their meaning become lucid. 
Frequently the application of intensive reading depends 
upon unusual, archaic, even obsolete meanings of words. 
Quite as often interpretation depends upon knowledge— 
supposed by the poet or prose writer to be common—which 
the pupils’ limited experience or reading has not yet illumi- 
nated for them. This knowledge must be supplied by the 
notes, by some member of the class, or by the teacher. Are 
the impressions intended by the words tide and curfew as 
vivid as teachers assume? Quite as likely the common 
knowledge is restricted, and unless an intelligent note is 
appended, the pupil secures only a hazy impression, unless 
the instructor can help him. Mr. Kipling wrote a short 
poem describing the yearning for England felt by fugitives 
from the law who gaze upon British vessels in South American 
ports. The last two lines are: 
How stands the old Lord Warden, s 
Are Dover Cliffs still white?
-P-A-G-E-162
  154 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
The Lord Warden is not, as might be supposed, an officer 
of the law, but the famous hotel on the heights to the west 
of Dover. It is quite possible that the import of a poem be 
lost unless a pupil knows that the Statue of Liberty is at 
the entrance to New York harbor. Unless a certain amount 
of geography and history antedate them, references to the 
Golden Gate, Golden Horn, the Fountain of Youth, Pillars 
of Hercules, are meaningless to young readers. The difficulty 
indicated here is not confined to so-called “classic” material. 
Ask any class in high school to tell what this title suggests 
to them: General William Booth Enters into Heaven. Inten- 
sive reading will elicit explanations of entire phrases. Old 
Tronsides is a simple enough poem at first glance, yet there 
are a few things which must be added for pupil understand- 
ing. Its title must be explained. The circumstances of its 
conception are essential. No child who is not furnished with 
these two essentials will be able to understand what the 
poem means. Unless readers know exactly what meteors 
are, one line will be flat and unemphatic. It is not sufficient 
to translate harpies of the shore by the word commerce. This 
misses entirely the intention of Holmes to point the contrast 
between harpies of the shore and the eagle of the sea. It over- 
looks the opportunity to increase the vocabulary. A single 
sentence of explanation will make this line vivid in meaning, 
suggestive in metaphorical identification, emphatic by con- 
trast, and worth recalling in the future. A similar method 
can be applied profitably to an unlimited number of words 
and phrases which occur in reading matter. The teacher 
who passes over the word Siren in Homer without asking 
or showing why the word is applied to a beautiful woman and 
a noise-producing apparatus is not teaching reading profit- 
ably. 
Develop intensive reading into re-creative reading.— 
There is no need of indicating here all the phases or steps
-P-A-G-E-163
READING 155 
by which intensive reading develops the only kind of reading 
worth anything in appreciating literature. This may be 
called re-creative reading. Just as in oral reading, the eye 
should not be kept fixed closely upon what is being read, but 
should travel in advance to punctuation marks, or should 
take in the audience, so in the best silent reading the mind 
should read a great deal more than the mere words upon the 
page. The homely advice is to read between the lines. 
Every teacher must be able to do this; every teacher must 
do it in preparation for class work; every teacher should be 
able to show pupils how to do it for themselves. If selections 
for study are graded properly the effect of this kind of reading 
will be cumulative. More frequently necessary for poetry, 
it may be requisitioned for prose of certain types by a few 
authors. Let us apply the method to a specimen of each 
form, in order that the teacher may see the aims to be applied 
in class reading. 
Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting; 
The Soul that rises with us, our life’s Star, 
Hath had elsewhere its setting 
And cometh from afar; 
Not in entire forgetfulness, 
And not in utter nakedness, 
But trailing clouds of glory do we come 
From God, who is our home. 
Heaven lies about us in our infancy! 
Shades of the prison-house begin to close 
Upon the growing Boy, 
But he beholds the light and whence it flows, 
He sees it in his joy; 
The Youth, who daily farther from the east 
Must travel, still is Nature’s priest, 
And by the vision splendid 
Is on his way attended; 
At length the Man perceives it die away 
And fade into the light of common day. 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  156 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
Before reading this section of Wordsworth’s Ode on Intima- 
tions of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood, 
the reader (he should be reading intensively and re-crea- 
tively) must know the underlying theme of the entire poeem— 
that the soul has existed before its coming into this world. 
This interpretation of immortality—consistent though it 
is—impresses many as a totally novel conception. According 
to this idea, the first line of this section should impress one 
as describing the exact opposite of birth. Here are phrases 
ordinarily applied only to death. To read this line requires 
that the mind operate around and beyond the words them- 
selves. Why is life a sleep and a forgetting, if we conceive 
life as a continuous development and rise? Notice the 
simplicity and directness of the statement of this philosophic 
teaching. The words are perfectly plain, yet the idea is 
almost beyond the comprehension of some persons. Some 
remnants of consciousness of that previous existence cling 
to the infant who comes trailing clouds of glory. Life has 
been compared to countless things, but why here to a prison- 
house? This figure of speech serves its purpose in a few 
lines and is dropped. The youth sees the light, even as he 
travels from the East. This last word must connote a host 
of recollections to the reader. There may surge across his 
brain all he has known in book and picture of ancient nations, 
or any of the significant details he associates with the Orient 
—the Star in the East, the visit of the Magi, seers, sages, and 
prophets of the East, strange religions, Christianity, results 
of the Crusades, classic languages, brilliant and picturesque 
peoples, the mathematics of Arabia, the alchemy of Egypt. 
Nor should he miss the tinge of pessimism in the last line, a 
touch developed in succeeding portions by details depicting 
life which should be compared with a passage in the poem on 
Tintern Abbey and with Hamlet’s enumeration of life’s ills. 
A person who reads as comprehensively as this has re-created 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
READING 157 
the imaginative thrill of the poet as he wrote. This ode, if 
studied in high school belongs in the last year. Most senior 
classes will be able to supply the knowledge underlying the 
preceding connotations. Unless the poem is treated properly, 
it should not be attempted at all. 
Because most prose lacks the compactness, the allusive- 
ness, the connotative phraseology of poetry, not all material 
in this form need be read so intensively. This would be the 
judgment of mature persons. When we remember, however, 
that pupils of sixteen and eighteen are not yet mature, we: 
shall have to readjust this statement. To them, more prose 
than we are likely to realize without careful scrutiny presents 
the need for intensive reading. To preserve somewhat the 
same difference between material and mind the extract. 
chosen is a passage from Carlyle’s Sartor Resartus, one of the 
noblest books ever penned. 
“T look down into all that wasp-nest or bee-hive,” have we heard 
him say, “‘and witness their wax-laying and honey-making, and 
poison-brewing, and choking by sulphur. From the Palace esplan- 
ade where music plays while Serene Highness is pleased to eat his 
victuals, down to the low lane, where in her door-sill the aged widow, 
knitting for a thin livelihood, sits to feel the afternoon sun, I see it 
all; for, except the Schlosskirche weathercock, no biped stands so 
high. Couriers arrive bestrapped and bebooted, bearing Joy and 
Sorrow bagged-up in pouches of leather: there, topladen, and with 
four swift horses, rolls-in the country Baron and his household; 
here, on timber-leg, the lamed Soldier hops painfully along, begging 
alms: a thousand carriages, and wains, and cars, come tumbling-in 
with Food, with young Rusticity, and other Raw Produce, inanimate 
or animate, and go tumbling out again with Produce manufactured. 
That living flood, pouring through these streets, of all qualities and 
ages, knowest thou whence it is coming, whither it is going? Aus der 
Ewigkeit, zu der Ewigkeit hin: From Eternity, onwards to Eternity! 
These are Apparitions: what else? Are they not Souls rendered 
visible: in Bodies, that took shape and will lose it, melting into air? 
Their solid Pavement is a Picture of the Sense; they walk on the  
-P-A-G-E-166
158 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
  bosom of Nothing, blank Time is behind them and before them. 
Or fanciest thou, the red and yellow Clothes-screen yonder, with 
spurs on its heels and feather in its crown, is but of Today, without 
a Yesterday or a Tomorrow; and had not rather its Ancestor alive 
when Hengst and Horsa overran thy Island? Friend, thou seest 
here a living link in that Tissue of History, which inweaves all 
Being: watch well, or it will be past thee, and seen no more.” 
“Ach, mein Lieber!’’ said he once, at midnight, when he had 
returned from the Coffee-house in rather earnest talk, ‘it is a true 
sublimity to dwell here. These fringes of lamplight, struggling up 
through smoke and thousandfold exhalation, some fathoms into the 
ancient reign of Night, what thinks Bodtes of them, as he leads his 
Hunting-Dogs over the Zenith in their leash of sidereal fire? That 
stifled hum of Midnight, when Traffic has lain down to rest; and 
the chariot-wheels of Vanity, still rolling here and there through 
distant streets, are bearing her to Halls roofed-in, and lighted to 
the due pitch for her; and only Vice and Misery, to prowl or to moan 
like nightbirds, are abroad: that hum, I say, like the stertorous, 
unquiet slumber of sick Life, is heard in Heaven! Oh, under that 
hideous coverlet of vapors, and putrefactions, and unimaginable 
gases, what a Fermenting-vat lies simmering and hid! The joyful 
and the sorrowing are there; men are dying there, men are being 
born; men are praying—on the other side of a brick partition, men 
are cursing; and around them all is the vast, void Night. The 
proud Grandee still lingers in his perfumed saloons, or reposes 
within damask curtains; Wretchedness cowers into truckle-beds, or 
shivers hunger-stricken into its lair of straw: in obscure cellars, 
Rouge-et-Noir languidly emits its voice-of-destiny to haggard 
hungry Villains; while Councillors of State sit plotting, and playing 
their high chess-game, whereof the pawns are Men. The Lover 
whispers his mistress that the coach is ready; and she, full of hope 
and fear, glides down, to fly with him over the borders: the Thief, 
still more silently, sets-to his pick-locks and crowbars, or lurks in 
wait till the watchmen first snore in their boxes. Gay mansions, 
with supper-rooms and dancing-rooms, are full of light and music 
and high-swelling hearts; but, in the Condemned Cells, the pulse of 
life beats tremulous and faint, and bloodshot eyes look out through 
the darkness, which is around and within, for the light of a stern 
last morning. Six men are to be hanged on the morrow: comes no 
hammering from the Rabenstein?—their gallows must even now 
be a’ building. Upwards of five-hundred-thousand two-legged
-P-A-G-E-167
READING 159 
animals without feathers lie round us, in horizontal positions; their 
heads all in nightcaps, and full of the foolishest dreams. Riot cries 
aloud, and staggers and swaggers in his rank dens of shame; and 
the Mother, with streaming hair, kneels over her pallid dying infant, 
whose cracked lips only her tears now moisten.—All these heaped 
and huddled together, with nothing but a little carpentry and 
masonry between them;—crammed in, like salted fish in their 
barrel ;—or weltering, shall I say, like an Egyptian pitcher of tamed 
vipers, each struggling to get its head above the others: such work 
goes on under that smoke-counterpane!—But I, mein Werther, sit 
above it all; I am alone with the Stars.” 
This marvelous passage is based upon the extremely simple 
plan of decided contrast in balanced pairs. The first meta- 
phors of life are not complimentary, of course, but they must 
be grasped as setting the tone of the imaginative description 
which follows. There is a touch of sardonic humor in the 
sage’s linking of himself as a biped with the church weather- 
cock. This re-creates in the reader Carlyle’s mood when he 
wrote. Serious is the thought behind the first sentence in 
German; it sums up all of life—From Eternity, onwards to 
Eternity! Then close upon, comes the kernel of Carlyle’s 
clothes philosophy, the theme of the entire discussion, an 
idea familiar to that earlier keen and bitter philosopher, 
Dean Swift, a philosophy all of us accept as perfectly true. 
These bodies are merely screens to cover the souls. The 
' mention of Hengst and Horsa should carry the mind back 
to the conquest of Britain, but it should do more, it should 
emphasize the truth that all history, all life is continuous. 
The world knows no breaks in its existence—change always, 
but no termination. Political criticism lies beneath the 
contrast of Rouge-et-Noir in obscure cellars with diplomatic 
chess-games, whereof the pawns are men. Back to the biped 
comparison the mind darts at the descriptions of the sleeping 
thousands, but the cruel humor of this detail is softened im- 
mediately by a master-stroke of pathos. If the reader
-P-A-G-E-168
160 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
knows Goethe’s Sorrows of Werther and Thackeray’s delicious 
verse upon the book, or recalls the sentimentalizing into 
which the Romantic Revival degenerated on the continent, 
he will respond to the last reference, and understand the 
significance of the last word—the eternal calming influence 
of the stars. 
How to use edited texts.—Old-fashioned editors used to 
supply every bit of information considered necessary for 
intensive reading and then added lists of questions to bring 
out the supplied notes. Modern editors give only what 
cannot be easily secured by the pupils themselves, and then 
show how to elicit more from personal experience, general 
information, deduction, or induction. In every case the 
teacher must decide when to inform directly instead of 
employing one of these devices which may consume too 
much time. Frequently the teacher can help most by 
supplying the definition of a word rather than having a — 
helter-skelter fluttering of leaves in a score of dictionaries, no 
two of which give definitions which fit the use under consider- 
ation. This can usually be obviated by definite directions 
in advance if the assignment is prepared outside class. A 
further direction concerning intensive reading should be 
observed. No explanation or idea suggested by any part of 
a selection so read should be allowed to remain in vacuo. 
As the thought was initiated by the poem or the sentence, it — 
must return to its source. In considering Milton’s L’Allegro 
such a question as ‘“What is meant by Jonson’s learned 
sock?” is unfinished. There should be the additional direc- 
tion, “Show how and why it is used in the poem.” The 
endeavor to correlate everything worth considering with the 
unit being explained will improve the reading of all pupils. 
Yet teachers haltingly translate the couplet with which Poe 
concludes The Purloined Letter without making the slightest 
reference to its appropriateness to the story. If to the
-P-A-G-E-169
READING 161 
teacher it means nothing, then he also does not know how tc 
read. If he says merely that in effect it means “checkmate,” 
he has done something. Let pupils be taught from the first 
high school year in this manner and we shall have no more 
seniors puzzled with the last stanza of The Ode to a Grecian 
Urn because they think “O Attic shape” has some relation 
with a garret. Intensive reading will make them think 
about what they know, and by recognizing the limits of that 
area, they will be’ conscious of taking an uncertain step 
into the unknown. Such insistence on understanding does 
not preclude intelligent guessing—a source of quite complete 
satisfaction in pupils. 
Teacher training in re-creative reading.—If a teacher is 
not skilled in re-creative or intensive reading, he can develop 
his mind and imagination in several ways. In a cheap or 
old copy of some selection worth knowing well, preferably 
on a page with wide margins, jot down every idea, or explana- 
tion, or cross reference, which comes into your mind as you 
read. Mark words and phrases, add dates, names, anything 
you please, until the book represents all your mental re- 
actions. Then re-read it, glancing at your notes. After this, 
the mere sight of these printed lines and paragraphs will 
bring to your mind simultaneously the items you first added 
in writing. In some instances pupils may be told to perform 
an analogous task. A fair test of a teacher’s ability is to 
hand him an unannotated text and ask him to prepare it 
for class teaching, adding such questions, aims, and results 
as he considers pertinent to a specified grade. 
Strive for rapid, retentive reading.—Intensive or re- 
creative reading has been dwelt upon at this length because 
teachers must consider teaching pupils in this manner. It 
does not preclude rapid reading, in fact it should foster it. 
We are a nation of scurrying, and what is worse, careless, and 
what is worst, inaccurate readers. The untrained woman 
4 i 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
  162 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
who lets her weekly quota of five novels be selected by the 
sixteen-year-old attendant of the lending library in a city 
department store reads rapidly. It might be better if she 
read not at all. Rapidity without accuracy, without result, 
without thought, is wellnigh worthless. However, accuracy 
need not be sacrificed as speed is increased, within reasonable 
limits. In the large majority of cases, as scientific studies of 
correlation between rate and comprehension indicate, the 
person taught how to gather the thought from the page 
becomes a rapid as well as a retentive reader.1 
Have many books read rapidly.—Not all literature 
deserves to be considered so carefully as has been indicated 
here. No sane teacher will plead that Huckleberry Finn or 
Kim or Lorna Doone or The Story of a Round House requires 
or merits that kind of attention. There must be a large 
amount of silent reading, and since this needs no teacher to 
guide it—once it has been assigned—it should be done almost 
entirely out of school. Pupils can sit with books open before 
them, and while the teacher is watching, they can make 
their eyes follow the lines down the page, they can even turn 
to gaze at the next, and as a result of inattention, get abso- 
lutely nothing from the print. Mature readers do the same 
thing. How often have you turned back the pages of a book 
because you suddenly realized you have been seeing only 
words, words, words? Silent reading in class to be worth 
anything must be checked and tested immediately, not the 
next day. If no report is asked until the following recitation, 
the pupil has the chance to read outside what he should 
have read in school. This indicates total waste of the time 
spent in the classroom, except as practice, which he can get 
as economically outside. Whenever numbers of words

covered by a class in a specified time are recorded, there 
should be a test of comprehension and retention. If the 
pupil who records five hundred twelve words knows less of 
what he has looked at than the one who covers three hundred 
forty-four words, then the latter is the better reader, and the 
teacher should make that plain to the class. Immediately 
the teacher’s task splits into two: he must penalize five 
hundred twelve words for lack of understanding, and reward 
three hundred forty-four words for bursts of speed.t 
Kinds of outside reading—Reading done outside school 
may be classified as supplementary, collateral, and reference. 
All three phases are valuable as contributions to courses in 
English. In some schools one of these is emphasized at the 
expense of the other two; in some institutions one of them 
may be disregarded entirely. 
How to conduct supplementary reading.—Supplementary 
reading is exactly what the term implies—reading to supple- 
ment the intensive reading which forms the backbone of 
the course. What the supplementary reading shall be, 
therefore, depends entirely upon what selections have been 
chosen for study. There is not much supplemental value in 
reading A Perfect Tribute while the class is studying Macau- 
lay’s Life of Johnson, or in reading Kim while studying 
The Idylls of the King. The method of arranging supple- 
mentary reading matter is a duplication of the practice of 
mature readers. We constantly arrange our books in supple- 
mental order. Librarians know of this and base purchases 
upon anticipated demands. The class studying Silas Marner 
is just at the point to read at least The Mill on the Floss, 
perhaps Adam Bede, frequently Romola. That one studying 
Henry Esmond should read Vanity Fair, perhaps The Vir- 
ginians. If six of Poe’s short stories are studied in class, why 
1For list of tests and measurements, see page 360.
-P-A-G-E-172
  
164 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN sree HIGH SCHOOL 
should not some ten be read outside? If some of Haw- 
thorne’s, why not more outside; why not The House of the 
Seven Gables? Quite as valuable as supplementary reading by 
the same author is supplementary reading arranged by topic. 
A single illustration will indicate this plan. When the class 
reads A Tale of Two Cities, induce familiarity with such 
additional books as Martineau, The Peasant and the Prince, 
Belloc, Sidelights of the French ee Dumas, The 
Count of Monte Cristo, Abbott, Marie Antoinette, Bynner, 
The Little King, Carlyle; The French Revolution, Lamartine, 
The History of the Girondists, Parker, The Aristocrat, Rolland, — 
Danton. When Macaulay’s Life of Johnson, what should 
supplement it? More Macaulay? Certainly more Johnson. 
Rasselas is not beyond eleventh year pupils—if read rapidly 
and discussed interestingly. From Goldsmith’s poems en- 
thusiasm will be enkindled by She Stoops to Conquer and 
The Vicar of Wakefield. Only four Idylls are specified by 
the college entrance requirements, but is it a loss to know 
more? Are not parts of Tales of a Traveler and The Alhambra 
worth adding to parts of The Sketch Book? If A Tale of Two 
Two Cities fills class time, why not show the other qualities 
of Dickens in other novels? Will not the right teaching of 
Ivanhoe or Quentin Durward make a few other romances by 
Scott interesting? A great play may be supplemented in 
various ways. Henry V describes the death of Falstaff. The 
pupils will enjoy reading the dramas in which he appears— 
Henry IV and The Merry Wives of Windsor. Supplementary 
reading to Carlyle’s Hssay on Burns should be reading of the 
poems of Burns, limited only by time. 
Make supplementary reading assignments definite.— 
Assignments in supplementary reading should be definite. 
If the book is a novel of some four hundred pages, the plan 
may be to finish it in three weeks, with one report each week. 
On which day of the week this shall be made will depend 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
READING : 165 
upon local conditions. In view of the fact that this kind of 
reading should be done in leisure time, Monday is a good day 
for the reports on supplementary reading, but the assignment 
should always be made a full week in advance. On the first 
day the pupils should be introduced to the book. Discussion 
should be general in order to pique curiosity or interest. Any 
information concerning book and author should be welcomed. 
Comments of previous readers will be quoted, if the teacher 
has fostered the proper relation with this class. Only the 
smallest amount of judicious advice should be advanced by 
the teacher, and that should be uncontrovertible. The 
world has judged the author and the book, libraries circulate 
it, and publishers sell it by thousands. It is one of the 
commonplaces of general knowledge. For next week read 
the first one hundred pages, or so many chapters. Get as 
much from it as you can. There is no need to bring the book 
to class. That is all the assignment should contain. There 
should be no dictated list of questions for which pupils must 
seek answers. They are to read and retain. Most of them 
will enjoy. Many will read far beyond the assignment. 
Reward them, and when they finish the book let them read 
another, rewarding them with extra credit if they have read 
profitably. Do not let the most avid ones overdo the reading 
in amount. If complaints come from other departments be 
as politic as you can, but in secret chuckle for the evening up 
for English usually neglected because problems in mathemat- 
ics had to be solved and a map for history had to be drawn. 
Hearing the first reports on supplementary reading.— 
The first report on this reading may be oral, and should cover 
the last details in the assignment in order to impress a feeling 
of responsibility. Frankly admit that-pupils may have to 
refuse pleasures and invitations in order to do this reading. 
Let the first discussion be informal, but elicit as much 
knowledge and judgment as possible. Do not waste time
-P-A-G-E-174
166 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
following leads which go nowhere and the opinions which are 
obviously mistaken. Draw out hesitating comparisons of 
scenes, incidents, characters, books, likes, and thrills. Mark 
recitations made on this first day. Assign about one hundred 
fifty page: for the next Monday. On this day the report 
may be written in class. There are two kinds of papers 
which may be assigned. A series of definite questions may be 
placed on the board for answers, or a group of topics may be 
listed upon which pupils write a connected composition. If 
the entire period is not spent in writing, several of the papers 
may be read to the class, each inducing short comments by 
other pupils. It is perfectly legitimate to ask definite ques- 
tions. A large number of questions, say twenty, the answers 
to which are definite facts stated in few words, may be given 
to the class. Only exact answers should be written by pupils. 
Papers should be exchanged and marked. As the teacher 
calls the names the grades are given. This test of reading 
consumes a very short time. Upon it the teacher may base 
any kind of recitation he desires. Any one who has read 
Vanity Fair should know the incidents of the ball, and who 
bought the piano. Papers upon topics should be subjected 
to marking for inaccuracy as well. 
Relative merits of oral and written reports.—The values 
of the oral and the written report are plain to every teacher. 
Their drawbacks are as patent. In oral discussions real life 
is reflected. Pupils teach pupils, and are stimulated by 
actual performances. Retort, criticism, approval, dissent 
are fostered by general discussions. They train in self- 
reliance. Leadership may be developed, but its disadvan- 
tages must be counteracted. Personal opinions when based 
upon thoughtful reading, are a part of worthy class work. 
The costae is socialized. The drawbacks to oral discus- 
sion are these: They consume a great deal of time. Many 
pupils are omitted in such an exercise. Some are silent or 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
READING 167 
timid or undisputatious, and may contribute nothing. The 
lazy may content himself with saying, “I think the same as 
Miss Blank,” or “‘My opinion has already been expressed.” 
A teacher may get a veracious opinion by having pupils 
write for five minutes upon a single restricted topic at the 
beginning of the period. Written compositions should not 
merely reproduce the material of the book. Incidents 
supplementary to the text may be imagined by the pupil. 
The Gay Dombeys illustrates this kind of composition in 
published fiction. Jules Le Maitre wrote two volumes 
entitled Hn Marge des Vieux Livres. 
The final report.—The final report on the book should 
prove that pupils have finished it. Unless the task is ac- 
complished, distribute penalties without tender-heartedness, 
The lessons of promptness, responsibility, obedience, are as 
essential in classes of English as they are in chemistry 
laboratories and machine shops, where disregard of them 
may result in serious consequences. 
Teachers must know the books.—The chief drawback 
to the general use of such a scheme of supplementary reading 
as here outlined is that under it teachers must know the books 
they are supposed to teach. Questionnaires have proved 
that teachers do not spend their leisure hours filling the 
gaps in their education by reading as they should. Unless a 
beginner has had those courses in literature which best 
prepare him for high school teaching he is likely not to have 
become familiar with all standard works.! Not all teachers 
of English can do what one in a large city school did. 
A boy blustered up to the desk and demanded why his 
report on a book had been marked zero. “Because you 
did not read the book,”’ explained the instructor. The boy 
was about to lie, when the teacher to spare him explained, 
1See Abbott, Allan. Preparation for Teaching Literature. The 
English Journal. February, 1922.
-P-A-G-E-176
  
168 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
tapping the paper, “The story doesn’t end that way.” “But 
the ‘movie’ does,” asserted the boy. “I am not giving a 
course in ‘movie’ attendance. Unless you prove to me that 
you have read that book you will not pass from this grade.” 
Induce the reading habit.—There has recently come into 
prominence among instructors of English an opinion con- 
cerning reading which shifts emphasis from reading certain 
best books to creating the desire for reading as a habit. 
Books suggested in this kind of reading—which may be 
designated as collateral or general or cursory reading—are 
as varied in kind, content, length, and value as may be 
imagined. In inducing this kind of reading the paramount 
idea is to get done some reading of as worthy a kind as is 
possible. In choosing books, attention has been given mainly 
to interest for the pupil of the specified grade, yet many of 
the volumes included in lists seem to fit just as well in earlier 
or later years. In fact, the chief difficulty of following these 
reading lists is feeling sure that pupils actually go through 
different books each semester. Unless teachers are extremely 
careful one book may do service for one pupil over a few 
terms, and a well prepared written book review may meet 
the ears or eyes of many different teachers in the same or 
subsequent terms. Variations in quality and kind are illus- 
trated by these pairs chosen from one list for tenth year: 
The Lady of the Decoration and The Moonstone, The Four 
Million and The Conquest of Mexico. These are from the 
eleventh year list: Cranford and Don Quixote, Soldiers of 
Fortune and John Halifax, Gentleman. Greater diversity is 
shown in the twelfth year list: North of Boston and Paradise 
Lost, Barrie’s Margaret Ogilvie and Lodge’s Life of Washing- 
ton, Self-Cultivation in English and Heroes and Hero Worship. 
For the ninth year there are seventy-six titles, for the tenth 
sixty-three, for the eleventh one hundred thirty-five (but 
many are plays and speeches), for the twelfth one hundred
-P-A-G-E-177
  
  READING 169 
eighteen (but many are poems or essays). With the possi- 
bility of the selection of any one of those books during each 
year, the teacher must either ruin his health or eyesight or 
frankly admit that he has not read them all. How good a 
judge will he be of the reports on the books he has not read? 
He can be little more than a judge of the composition in the 
paper or the speech, and this falls far short of being a judge 
of the value derived from the reading. 
Conducting reading chosen from a long list.—The ideal 
manner of conducting reading from so large a suggestive list 
would be for the teacher to have read recently every book the 
title of which is included. Next to that he must have read 
all of them at some time. Lacking this adequate acquaint- 
ance he must know something of their kind and contents. 
He must not infer that The Story of a Round House is a rail- 
road story, although he may believe this because the shelter 
for locomotives is called a round-house. He must not fondly 
imagine that The Sky Pilot is an aviation story, nor that 
Men of Iron is an industrial treatise. If his reading in the 
books offered for choices is limited, he may by advice and 
conference lead pupils to read those which he knows, but if 
the list is shown to them, he can hardly defeat the principle 
of free election by prescribing. In assigning works from a 
restricted group, he should place upon the board a list of 
about a dozen titles, and then give some interesting informa- 
tion about each, so that a pupil may have a slight basis for 
intelligent choice. Let him refrain from saying too much 
about comparative length. One boy looked at such a list. 
It included many titles of which he had never heard, but a 
little discreet questioning at the library led him to choose the 
shortest, Rasselas. As he was a tenth year pupil he soon 
repented his attempt to escape easily, for a page of that re- 
quired as much effort as ten pages of a rapidly-moving 
romance. Of course, he was repaid in the long run, but no  
-P-A-G-E-178
  170 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
teacher could have convinced him of it. Instructions for 
reading these books can be of only the most general nature. 
A novel and a book of short stories, a biography and a 
volume of essays, must be read differently, judged by totally 
different standards, and reported on in quite different 
manners., Librarians of one city in which part of the reading 
in the school system is conducted after this-plan, report to 
me that teachers have instructed pupils rather well in the 
reading and reporting of fiction, partly because the regular 
course offers study of fiction, partly because fiction is easy 
to read and judge. The result is that practically none of the 
non-fiction volumes are requested. This results in exagger- 
ated demands for fiction, and leaves on the shelves the other 
volumes purchased by the library authorities. Worse than 
both these, the neglect produces blanks in the reading ability 
of high school pupils. 
Marking outside reading.—While it does not enter into 
the problem of teaching, the manner of marking reading 
and evaluating marks under a wide miscellaneous list is an 
important matter of classroom procedure and school manage- 
ment. Shall all books read by pupils be considered equiva- 
lents? Shall length alone determine credits? Shall diffi- 
gulty? But will not the “difficult” of one grade be far above 
the “easiest”’ of the next higher grade? What educative, 
developing intention is served by this kind of reading? Are 
there not books the reading of which should never receive 
credit in school? Where shall the line be drawn? Who 
shall decide? 
A combination of the two kinds of reading—supplementary 
and cursory—is the best plan for every high school term. 
In the supplementary section the instructor has the better 
opportunity to teach. In the cursory phase he may become 
better and better equipped to perform the same office, less 
and less an assigner of tasks and a recorder of grades for oral
-P-A-G-E-179
  
READING 171 
and written compositions. The teacher should make per- 
fectly clear what each pupil should get from his reading, 
show him how to get it, then mark his achievement. Such a 
scheme permits the catholicity which will develop literary 
taste. It provides for standard books and contemporary 
publications. It welcomes the absorbing as well as the in- 
formative. It provides all varieties of poetry, drama, ro- 
mance, novel, short story; speech, essay, biography, and 
history. 
Talk to pupils about your own reading.—In such a case 
as this of extra reading—as many pupils regard it—en- 
thusiasm becomes a potent force in provoking imitation. If 
the teacher has a fondness for books let him show it. Every 
reader has stories to tell of delightful adventures among 
books. Adults are prone to read the books they hear dis- 
cussed; why not pupils? The fact is that boys and girls will. 
If a forceful speaker in an auditorium assembly praises 
Burton’s Journey from El Medinah to Mecca, there will be 
demands that day for it. The quiet, informal, short “talks” 
by respected teachers have more influence than we dare to 
hope. If this quality of ‘“bookishness” can be made to 
illustrate the volumes suggested for outside reading, the 
teacher has an approach not to be disregarded. If this kind 
of teacher will dictate short lists of books for summer read- 
ing—he cannot require such work—and learns later that a 
few have been read, he need not despair of his influence. 
The uses of reference reading.—A third kind of reading 
is reference reading. This can be done well only when there 
is a good library in the school or nearit. The practice of such 
reading is not so pleasurable as that of other kinds, or so 
productive of information which will serve in later life, but as 
training for all time it is unequaled. Projects and problems 
and investigations entail this kind of reading. It must 
always start with a purpose—Mr. Arnold Bennett in How
-P-A-G-E-180
  172 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
to Live on Twenty-four Hours a Day suggests that his reader 
try to learn all he can about the moths that flutter about the 
street lamp. Purposes in school should be more closely 
related to pupil interests and more practically defined. 
The kind of project suggested by Mr. Bennett shows the 
chief purpose of reference reading—the gathering of informa- 
tion. This led to the statement of a few lines back that it is 
not so literary as other kinds of reading. The place of enter- 
tainment is filled by the purpose to be served by the reading. 
Every teacher can construct his own projects, problems, and 
investigations. They must change from term to term, from 
class to class, even from season to season. The methods to 
be followed by the teacher must vary with every purpose, 
but the general lines can be indicated. 
Make bibliographies.—A bibliography must be formed. 
Pupils may prepare this. If not already informed, they 
must be instructed in library arrangements. They must 
be shown how to use card catalogs, tables of contents, and 
indexes. No one—man, woman, boy, or girl—can do much 
reference reading without taking notes. The proper ways of 
doing this must be taught thoroughly. The skill functions in 
every school activity and aids in life long after school lessons 
are forgotten. So far all the reading discussed in this chapter 
has been continuous. In reference work, reading is usually 
disconnected and fragmentary. It is difficult for pupils to 
assimilate material read in this detached way. They lose the 
connection and feel the lack of relationship. They should be 
practised first in small assignments until they see how the 
reassembling of their notes establishes new relationships 
and suggests different contexts. Pupils must be shown how 
to seize the heart of a paragraph at first glance, how to run 
the eye rapidly over the facts stated concerning the topic 
under investigation, how to determine instantaneously the 
value of a passage, then to drop the search there, or to read
-P-A-G-E-181
READING 173 
carefully as long as the material aids the investigation. 
Practise this as silent reading in class. Preliminary reference 
to dictionaries, encyclopedias, compendiums, and similar 
books will aid greatly. 
Use groups or committees in reference reading.—Many 
details of the gathering of material from reference reading 
can be carried out in groups or committees of pupils. In- 
dividuals can discuss the value and the pertinence of notes 
submitted by members, decide to discard parts and to seek 
further along specific lines suggested by findings already 
presented. The preparation of the final outline or table of 
contents or plan of procedure may be entrusted to groups 
or the class as a whole. At no time in reference reading 
should pupils lose sight of the purpose and end of the activity. 
For this reason the operations should not be allowed to 
extend over too long a period. Short, definite exercises with 
presentations of definite results are better than a long- 
drawn-out series of miscellaneous parts. The result may be 
almost anything—the publication of a school paper or 
magazine, the production of an original play, a report on the 
superstitions connected with the numbers three and seven, 
the writing and publishing of a small book (in connection. 
with the art and printing departments), the writing of a 
volume explaining the work of the term (an excellent exer- 
cise in exposition), a series of reports on the character of 
Falstaff (the class organized as a Shakespeare Club), a series. 
of informative speeches (illustrated) on the locality in 
literature, an Answers to Correspondents department, a 
commemorative day program, the industrial opportunities 
and achievements of the section, Puritans in the United 
States, nature study, contributions of foreigners to life in our 
country. It is evident at once that the result of reference 
reading must be judged as written or spoken composition. 
Some credit may be given for the ease, celerity, and cer- 
   
-P-A-G-E-182
  
174 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
tainty with which the exercise is carried out, but the value 
in the English classroom must be subordinated always and 
only to the purposes of teaching English. Teachers must be 
on their guard continually against a transfer of merit and a 
substitution of values. Dexterity in pasting pictures and 
clippings in a scrap-book must never be accepted as ability in 
English, nor must ingenuity in constructing a model of a 
Greek theater from a cheese box be credited as knowledge 
of classic drama. A boy may spend hours in the carpenter 
shop building a small Elizabethan theater, but refuse to read 
Ivanhoe. Shall he be promoted in literature because of skill 
in joinery? A girl will draw a set of illustrations for The 
Idylls of the King, but be unable to explain the three reports 
of Arthur’s birth. She makes high grades in the art depart- 
ment; should her skill be marked in a field where it has no 
decided bearing, for drawing is not a part of English? A boy 
who letters beautifully, puts together—by copying—a chart 
of historical facts behind A Tale of Two Cities, yet cannot in 
class relate one of those facts behind the story. Shall his 
printing be accepted in lieu of knowledge of the book? Shall 
the girl, all of whose ideas are exact reproductions, but whose 
penmanship is copperplate script, be marked higher than the 
boy, whose brain works independently, but whose hand- 
writing is scrawly? Are pupils to be judged by their fitness 
to become automatic entry-clerks and bookkeepers whose 
perfect Spencerian handwriting no one ever reads, or are 
they to be rated upon ability? Have teachers who are 
disposed to judge compositions in this manner ever seen 
the handwriting of Dickens, Flaubert, Stevenson, Lamb, 
DeQuincey, Tennyson, or any of a thousand other real 
“writers”? 
To obtain the best response in this kind of reference read- 
ing, it is of prime importance to have brought before the 
class as frequently as possible, reports or exhibitions of
-P-A-G-E-183
  READING 175 
progress, and statements of plans for future activity. Finally 
when all the reading, gathering and sifting of material, out- 
lining, etc., have been finished it is essential for the success of 
the entire project that results be displayed to the class. 
Pupils enjoy the sense of a fait accompli quite as much as 
grown persons do; they wish to judge the finished product, 
whether it be a manuscript book, an acted play, or a series 
of speeches. 
Reference reading in other departments.—One of the 
adventitious merits of reference reading is the value the 
practice has in other departments. Teachers of all informa- 
tive subjects have to resort to it at intervals, unless they are 
content to teach what is printed between the covers of the 
regular textbook. In many instances the English department 
benefits by earlier instruction imparted in some other; in just 
as many the English department aids others. Fortunate is 
the school in which most of the instruction can be under- 
taken by trained librarians in an adequate library in the 
building. 
Teach literature rather than history of literature.—Time 
was when both English and American literature were taught 
as history. In nearly every high school that practice has 
passed, and though so-called histories of literature are used, 
the emphasis has been transferred from the history of litera- 
ture to the knowledge of books in relation to their times. 
The history becomes the background for The Canterbury 
Tales, The Rape of the Lock, The Biglow Papers, Leaves of 
Grass, The Farewell Address, and In Flanders Fields. Read- 
ing of literature becomes the paramount aim. Much knowl- 
edge of national progress is desirable; in adults who make any 
pretense to education, it is necessary. The contemporary 
records of that development are the basis for its interpreta- 
tion. Literature which illuminates its age, in later years 
requires a knowledge of that age for its appreciation. Dry-
-P-A-G-E-184
  176 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
as-dust facts and dates per se have wisely been weeded out 
from high school study of literature. Textbooks have im- 
proved, yet the most recent ones include sentences like this 
one: “Thomas Otway attended Westminster School and 
Christ Church, Oxford,” which contains facts of no signifi- 
cance to either high school pupil or university student. 
Every one will agree that this kind of facts, with no bearing 
upon literature, should not be taught. In swinging away 
from this sort of exaggerated detail, however, the teacher 
must be judicious in not reaching the other extreme. The 
instructor who in discussing the early development of our 
language casually mentions the Roman occupation of 
Britain and puts it only five centuries wide of the correct 
dates, is hardly a counsellor worth following in determining 
topics for English study. The greatest figures of literature 
deserve historical placing; their productions gain by being 
located. The New England group of poets would be in- 
explicable in any other time and place. Addison, Steele, 
Pope, Burns, Franklin, and Mr. Shaw, to cite a few at random, 
are so inextricably parts of their periods that they cannot be 
read apart from those years. College graduate students 
have overdone the tracing of influences, but teachers must 
recall that high school boys and girls do not know of the 
comparative disrepute into which this easy method of pre- 
paring a thesis has fallen. To them the indications of in- 
fluence are novel elements in literature. Explain or direct 
pupils to discover how Dickens succeeded in producing a 
real plot in A Tale of Two Cities, and note the interested 
reception of the remarks, especially if the class has read 
David Copperfield or Nicholas Nickleby. 
Place specimens in their periods.—The teaching of 
literature in this sequential manner should be as late in the 
course as is possible, so that the pupil will have met many 
masterpieces, all of which he can now place in the historical
-P-A-G-E-185
READING 177 
development. He will already be in possession of a large 
amount of unrelated information, which the teaching of 
literature should now assemble and arrange properly for him. 
To the historical development should be added as much more 
illustrative reading, intensive and supplementary, as time 
will permit. American literature is quite well treated in the 
tenth year, usually during the second term. By that time 
pupils should have met practically every author of note. By 
means of some connected story of the beginnings, develop- 
ment, and present continuation of American literature they 
should be enabled to place all the specimens they have 
read. They should do more; many of the poems let us say, 
of Longfellow, they met in the seventh and eighth years. 
There are other poems of Longfellow which they can now 
appreciate and should know. This is true of every American 
writer. Emerson the poet they know in some short lyrics. 
They should now read Emerson the thinking poet and 
essayist. There is no need to detail further this method of 
teaching American literature. It becomes in the best mean- 
ing of the phrase, a course in literature. 
What not to teach.—Specimens of English literature are 
added throughout most high school courses until the last year. 
It is here, therefore, that a study of the periodic development 
of that national writing may best be placed. As indicated for 
American literature, knowledge of biographical and_biblio- 
- graphical facts should not be required. If they appear in the 
textbooks, teach pupils how to avoid them, how to read them 
without noticing, how to see them without being disturbed, 
how to recite without thinking of them. Swinburne’s 
“mother was the daughter of the Earl of Ashburnham.” 
That fact has no significance for American pupils; nor does 
the author use it in any explanation or account of the poems. 
A few pages of another history of literature yield these 
meaningless geographical names: Lutterworth, Keswick,
-P-A-G-E-186
  
178 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
Enfield, Edmonton, Holly Lodge, Dumfriesshire, Annan, 
Brantwood, Coniston, Somersby, Solent. How many 
teachers can locate them or explain their relation to any 
author or literary production? 
Read some literature in seqence.—If the course extends 
through an entire year, pupils of the twelfth year should 
study some text showing the historical development. They 
should read a translation of part of Beowulf outside class; 
Prologue to the Canterbury Tales in class, one tale outside; 
many old ballads; Everyman; Elizabethan sonnets and 
lyrics; Dr. Faustus; three or more Shakespeare plays, some 
’ intensively, others rapidly; a few essays by Bacon; study 
some of Milton’s minor poems, read two books of Paradise 
Lost; read rapidly several essays by Steele and Addison; read 
The Rape of the Lock; study and read poems by Gray, Blake, 
Burns, Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats, Byron; study parts of 
In Memoriam and at least Rabbi Ben Ezra, read as much 
more by Tennyson and Browning as possible; and add many 
later poets and essayists. In connection with this course, a 
great amount of written and oral composition can be pro- 
duced as will be outlined in the chapter on ability to write. 
Show how reading functions in later life.—All phases of 
reading activity in adult life may be grouped under one of 
the classes discussed in this chapter;—intensive reading, 
supplementary reading, collateral or general reading (fre- 
quently informative, more usually entertaining), reference 
reading. A strong point can be made in their practice in 
school by showing how widely every phase actually functions 
in life outside the classroom.

CHAPTER VIII 
JUDGMENT, APPRECIATION, CRITICISM, STYLE 
So much space has been devoted in this book to methods 
and aims of teaching the contents of literary selections 
because that teaching is the fundamental portion of the 
course. Too long have practices—where started and when 
most prevalent is not the question—allowed children to 
read without understanding, to pronounce without hearing, 
recite without thinking, to listen without absorbing. The 
importance of teaching pupils how to read cannot be over- 
estimated, for the skill operates in every department of 
school work, and in life long after they have passed from 
supervision. Any method which enables teachers to secure 
better and more lasting results with less waste of time and 
decreased expenditure of energy should be welcomed. This 
is one of the first tasks of teaching today; it is an issue which 
must be faced squarely and solved promptly. All of us 
believe, however, that in every class there is the opportunity 
as there are the invitation and the necessity of going further 
in the study of literature, of adding to ability in reading, 
which furnishes exact knowledge, responses to literary pro- 
duction which will perpetuate the reading habit; or if not 
perpetuate it, at least make it more attractive whenever it is 
exercised. Let us make of our high school pupils good readers 
first, then add to them everything else within our power 
and their capabilities. 
Necessity for training powers of judgment.—lIt is ob- 
viously possible that a pupil may read acceptably, that is 
understand the work in some sense, yet exercise no judgment. 
179
-P-A-G-E-188
  
  180 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
For a long period in both his family and school relationships, 
in the choice of books as well as in questions of conduct and 
the employment of his time, judgments are made for him. 
For a period educational theory was disposed to relinquish 
the right of elders to judge for children in any matters, but 
the extreme of that enthusiasm seems to have been passed. 
Adults of the United States do not arrogate to themselves 
the power of control over children displayed by such races 
as the French. Ina land where parents have feared to decide 
for children, it is only natural that schools have hesitated to 
do more than advise and suggest. 
Teachers of English, because they expect to train the 
mind at fourteen to serve when the body is twenty-five, have 
always endeavored to educe or implant principles of correct 
judgment in literature. Their optimism is the sublimest 
faith in the value of good works. Their severest disap- 
pointment comes when they meet former promising pupils 
at the age of twenty-five, to discover that while their bodies 
and actions have matured, their brains are still, in literary 
judgment and taste, only eighteen years old. The single 
comfort is the reflection that had nothing been done in high 
school, the brains might have remained only fourteen years 
old. 
Encourage expressions of judgment.—In every grade 
of high school the teacher must strive to produce some — 
degree of judgment in pupils’ minds. If the judgment re- 
mains only in the mind, the teacher will never know what it 
is. He must therefore draw from the pupils expressions of 
these judgments. When these are given, he must elicit the 
facts and reasonings upon which they are based. In this 
manner he must train in the elemental principles of criticism, 
which are fundamental to the most recondite study as well. 
Last of all, he may endeavor, if he be a genuine teacher, to 
induce in pupils a liking for the best. This last is the cultiva-  
-P-A-G-E-189
JUDGMENT, APPRECIATION, ETC. 181 
tion of taste—the desire for the best. Accomplishment will 
often fall far short of the last aim in high school, yet no 
teacher will fail to attempt it. 
Show pupils upon what judgment is based.—A few 
influential critics of art are impressionistic. They appear to 
judge and criticize by the exercise of an uncanny sixth sense. 
This is merely apparent. Years of training and exercise have 
developed their powers of discrimination until they operate 
simultaneously, and before one realizes that time enough has 
elapsed for absorption, the critic has analyzed, judged, eval- 
uated, criticised, and pronounced the effects. As it was 
explained that there is a difference between learning to read 
and reading, so there is a vast difference between learning 
how to judge and later exercising the accomplishment. It is 
conceivable that children of inquiring minds might read 
The Chambered Nautilus and by dint of determination and 
search learn what it is about, and even get an inkling of 
what the last stanza means. It is also conceivable that a 
child might not find for himself what a nautilus is, and fail 
entirely to get any idea from the conclusion. The teacher 
must show how to assimilate, then how to judge. 
Have pupils judge by comparison.—The best method 
for presenting the simple phases of judgment is by comparison 
with reality itself or with other productions. If the pupil’s 
life has provided no experiences and no observation to serve 
as a basis for comparison, that method is unavailable. It is 
likely to be a precarious one in any instance, especially in 
classes so heterogeneous as those in our cities. Attempts to 
judge all details in books by reference to real life result in 
embarrassing dilemmas. It is safer and surer in the early 
years to depend upon comparison among literary produc- 
tions. The high school teacher must know the basis for the 
pupils’ judgment. This means that he must know the 
literature the pupil has studied, so that he may determine
-P-A-G-E-190
  
182 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
whether the pupil’s judgment is rightly conceived or not. 
The wise teacher, at the beginning of the term, will be con- 
tent to register the opinion of the pupils concerning the 
selection read as a whole. Judgment may then be made, 
should be made, of its various parts. Let us be more con- 
crete. Suppose the first work in the term is the reading of 
The Gold Bug. As the pupils have read nothing else by Poe, 
they can naturally deliver no judgment of the value of this 
story among his works. If they have read no worthy stories 
of mysteries and solutions, they cannot decide whether this 
is good, bad, or indifferent. In reality, these conditions 
seldom, if ever obtain, and pupils will offer definite judgments 
if they are invited to do so. The teacher intent upon in- 
stilling principles of judgment may disregard these and 
concentrate upon the one story. Short as it is, it offers 
enough variety in its parts. The easiest method is to progress 
from ‘Did you like the story?” to “Why did you like it?” 
Some may not care forit. Do not be irritated, express regret 
mildly, but find out immediately or soon whether those who 
do not like it, really read and understood it. If not, mark 
them down relentlessly. Avoidance of regular tasks should 
be penalized at once; training in English is not dependent 
upon “T shall if I choose.” Pupils must overcome the igno- 
rance upon which lack of judgment is based. If pupils study 
and know the material assigned, do not force compliance 
with your own and the world’s verdict. Do not be ironical or 
sarcastic. Respect an honest opinion—but assure yourself 
that it is honest. Next, ask which portion of the story tha 
pupils liked best. Invite the reasons, suggesting continually 
that the basis for the opinion is in the story itself. Welcome 
the slightest glimmer of an idea, such as a dim recognition 
of the humorous purpose of Jupiter, of the literary trick of 
creating suspense by having him mistake the eye of the 
skull, of the use of the dog, of the placing of the end of the
-P-A-G-E-191
JUDGMENT, APPRECIATION, ETC. 183 
       
    
   
   
   
   
   dventure in the middle of the story, of the careful explana- 
ion of the deciphering of the parchment, of the remarkable 
dvance planning by Poe the story exhibits, of the essential 
implicity of the basic idea upon which the tale is built. 
ave pupils amplify every statement they make. Let the 
im be explanation rather than proof. If the teacher keep 
las far as possible outside the discussion, there will be no need 
f resorting to artificial means to socialize this recitation in 
tthe best sense of the verb. When a second story by Poe has 
been mastered, the production of judgment becomes both more 
simple and more complex; more simple because a broader 
basis is provided, more complex because of the multiplication 
of details and because the second story may be of a totally 
different type. The Purloined Letter and A Descent into the 
Maelstrom should be helped by The Gold Bug, but dexterity 
will be required to utilize judgment of these in weighing 
The Pit and the Pendulum, The Tell-Tale Heart, The Masque 
of the Red Death, etc. With the addition of a second author, 
say Hawthorne, the judgment must range over a wider field 
before it decides, but as the form is likely to be the same, one 
element remains stable. Now is provided the opportunity 
for a delicate piece of criticism based on judgment. Had Poe 
used the material developed by Hawthorne, upon which 
details would he have dwelt, and how might he have treated 
them? Even if The House of the Seven Gables is placed much 
later than Poe in the course, do not fail to ask this question 
when pupils study it. Apply it in different form to all authors 
of both prose and verse. 
This method of forming judgment and evolving criticism 
from comparisons among the parts of a single work may be 
applied to any literary production. It is obviously well suited 
to the study of any play. No one has any intellectual right 
tolike all parts of A Midsummer Night's Dream equally well. 
“If he thinks he does, his mind must be stimulated to tenta-
-P-A-G-E-192
    184 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOO. 
tive discriminations. Novels and romances should be treat 
in this manner before they are compared as entities wit! 
the books of other authors. After two years of this kind o! 
training in fostering judgment, ask pupils to read through 
book which they considered excellent before they entered hig! 
school, one of the books ‘‘aimed” at boys and girls twelv 
years old. 
Judge poetry by comparison.—When applied to poetry, 
this method of comparison reinforces all the aims cited foi 
studying this form. It can be applied as effectively to 
poem as toa short story. No class should be allowed to stud; 
Shelley’s To a Skylark without being asked to state whic 
of the four matchless comparisons—like a poet hidden, lik 
a high-born maiden, like a glow-worm golden, like a ros 
embowered—it considers most beautiful. Seldom will th 
third be chosen, because the appearance of a glow-wor 
lies outside their observation. If it is selected, the teacher| 
should learn if the pupil is confusing a fire-fly with a glow- 
worm. What color is the rose? Then to open their eyes to} 
a different basis for judgment in poetry, ask which of these 
four stanzas is most beautiful in sound. If pupils feel this 
beauty of sound, the teacher should spend a short time in 
pointing out the reasons for it, its dependence upon the 
presence of many vowels and certain consonants. In teach- 
ing this aspect of literary expression the teacher must be’ 
careful not to pursue his analysis too far. What he suggests 
is more valuable than what he settles. His aim should be to 
plant a seed to the nurturing of which he may return att 
times, for if he deposits it properly, it will grow. Not im- 
mediately will it sprout above ground and bloom; a teacher 
of American boys and girls is foolish if he expects hot-house 
luxuriance of such a delicate shoot. 
Accept differences of opinion.—So far judgment may be 
induced and elicited without the certainty of much genuine
-P-A-G-E-193
  JUDGMENT, APPRECIATION, ETC. 185 
appreciation. Practically every course of study in English 
states as an aim the development of appreciation of the best 
literature. It may be a good thing that the sentence is not 
any more definite than this, for the determination of “the 
best” is a task in which mighty names militate against one 
another, in which no absolute agreement can ever be reached. 
Appreciation of literature passes into the realms of philosophy 
and esthetics. 
Now, who shall arbitrate? 
Ten men love what I hate, 
Shun what I follow, slight what I receive; 
Ten, who in ears and eyes 
Match me; we all surmise, 
They this thing, and I that: whom shall my soul believe? 
Is it really necessary that all educated persons like the 
same thing? Does the word appreciation mean that? It 
certainly does not in the correct interpretation. The world’s 
suffrage has agreed that a certain group of books is worthy 
of laudation. These form the basis of most English instruc- 
tion. Teachers with little independence of judgment and 
ingrowing inertia fall back upon them with safety and repeat 
the usual banalities ad nauseam. Dare to assert to such 
conservatives that the attempt to keep Lowell’s reputation 
alive as a genuine poet has failed and that consequently his 
poems should be dropped from the course, and you will 
leave them gasping at such heresy. Insist that Ruskin’s 
preachments were failures, that his day has waned, that 
highly colored prose will not continue to dazzle when ideas 
have proved uninteresting, that having looked at the dreary 
Turner canvases stored in the British Museum you know 
that Ruskin’s hero could paint nothing except atmosphere, 
make them think about the ridiculous preciousness of his 
titles, and you will be branded as an agnostic. Ask them 
whether Tolstoi was justified in his comments on King Lear,  
-P-A-G-E-194
  186 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
whether Mr. G. Bernard Shaw was correct in speak- 
ing as he did of As You Like It, whether Mr. St. John 
Ervine was logical in his analysis of the charm of The 
Merchant of Venice, and they will regard you as an arch- 
enemy. 
Justify your own judgments.—It would be an excellent 
thing for the better teaching of literature throughout the 
United States if every teacher had to explain to an assembly 
of his peers and superiors his own appreciation—that is, his 
sincere intellectual and artistic response to the productions 
he teaches. Does he judge the feelings and opinions of 
pupils as he should like that assemblage to judge his? Fear- 
ing discovery of insincerity would he not speak truthfully of 
his concealed opinion of Bacon’s Essays? Would he relish 
being forced to accept the dictum of this group that he must 
like what he least enjoys? 
Form definite judgments about recent literature.—To 
many teachers with little inherent taste for beautiful litera~ 
ture, and scant training in the enjoyment of reading intellec- 
tually and esthetically, the introduction of less renowned and 
more modern selections into the classroom has been a dis- 
turbing change. In two senses, they “do not know what to 
think.” In one respect the widening of the course to embrace 
the recent, the unfamiliar has been a detriment to these 
teachers. They feel at sea; how can they pilot others when 
they have so little knowledge of the expanse? In another 
sense—let us hope to a larger degree—this enrichment has 
been a help to them. After a time they have found their true 
position, they have swept the horizon, made their observa- 
tions, charted their course, and are moving carefully but 
surely across the vast space. Because of the necessity of 
readjusting their responses to novel and bizarre provocatives, 
they have developed themselves and therefore they have 
become better teachers. The narrow-minded, hide-bound,
-P-A-G-E-195
  
JUDGMENT, APPRECIATION, ETC. 187 
groove plodder must be startled into mobility and flexibility 
if education is to be continually enlivened. 
Practise self-scrutiny.—The beginning, continuance, 
and completion of appreciation of literature by learners is 
self-scrutiny. That instructors may know how to watch 
this process deepening and widening in their pupils, they 
should subject themselves to it at all times. Lacking the 
assembly of peers’ and superiors already described, the 
individual teacher must enact its reception of his opinions 
and unflinchingly announce its judgments upon his literary 
acumen. Do any of the recent books suggested for school 
use substitute raciness for style, flamboyance for color, 
nervous excitement for incident, maudlin sentimentalism 
for feeling, surprise for suspense, and glamour for sincerity? 
Is the voluntary reading of teachers of English as high in 
level as that they insist upon for others? 
The teacher, then, should scrutinize himself. Why should 
he not—as he has his pupils do—write reports on his own 
reading? Writing is suggested, because the teacher has 
enough exercise in expressing appreciation in conversations, 
and because written composition requires better organization, 
keener thinking, and more careful phrasing. If the teacher 
has a distant friend to whom he can talk on paper, his long- 
distance conversation will have a motive, the kind of motive 
for which in the classroom so many curious expedients are 
devised. In a course in the teaching of English in the high 
schools there was assigned a report on the topic, “My own 
lack of appreciation.” One student found certain lacks in 
his responses to fiction, poetry, and drama. To him fiction 
was not the recourse, the refreshment, it is to many persons. 
He wondered if his interest were not too near-sighted. He 
could not read the serial story, because he failed to live in a 
continuous imaginative world. He did not enjoy Mr. 
Kipling’s prose because this author is kaleidoscopic, whereas  
-P-A-G-E-196
    188 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
his taste is monochrome. Yet he did enjoy Mr. Kipling’s 
verse, showing that he had more interest in audacity and 
virility of conception than in imagery or literary beauty. He 
could thrill at a few lines of In Memoriam, but could not read 
the entire poem. His powers of concentration were soon 
exhausted. He had to force himself to read verse at stated 
intervals. Even then he felt like a person standing at the 
gate of a beautiful but unknown country, and catching 
glimpses of what the initiated enjoy constantly. The failure 
to appreciate drama was attributed mainly to lack of oppor- 
tunity to see plays. It is almost axiomatic that the teacher 
who knows as much about genuine appreciation as these 
statements indicate should become an excellent teacher of 
literature, because of his sympathetic understanding of the 
point of view of pupils. 
The aim of appreciation.—The real teacher must con- 
tinually remind himself that while he may desire to make all 
pupils appreciate literature as he does, this wish is absolutely 
impossible of accomplishment, even granting its soundness. 
Appreciation means the determination of true values. In 
the final appraisement all educated persons should decide 
upon the absolute value of a work of art, but in practice such 
a unanimous decision can never be reached. A return which 
can be seen will come each term if the pupils at the end of a 
period of instruction care for better reading matter—in 
the main—than they did at the beginning. The editor of 
the literary supplement of a great Eastern paper explained 
once, that the policy of the section was his hope that some 
readers would be led from Miss Marie Corelli, perhaps to 
Mr. Hall Caine, from this latter to Mr. Maurice Hewlett, 
and so to better writers of fiction. This principle may be 
transferred directly to training appreciation in high school 
pupils. 
Elements which induce appreciation.—The first element
-P-A-G-E-197
  JUDGMENT, APPRECIATION, ETC. 189 
in helping the teacher to do this must have been instilled in 
him long before he began to teach. He should have had his, 
reading suggested to him when he was a child. Lacking the 
assistance of intellectual surroundings, he may have had his 
responsiveness to literary charm awakened by some school 
teacher. The frequency of this alone would justify the work 
of certain teachers, the inclusion of certain books, the em- 
ployment of certain leisurely methods of instruction beyond 
measurement by scientific scales. A more definite element 
for inculcating appreciation is the major in English in the 
college course of the future teacher. It is an astounding 
revelation to discover how many teachers attempting to 
cover the enormous field of English instruction began with 
this lack of an essential part of their equipment. Many of 
them fail in intent with the De Coverley papers because they 
present them to classes in a cold, detached manner; others 
fail to plumb the thesis of the modern treatment in such a 
form as Maeterlinck’s The Blue Bird because they have 
never grasped the satiric force behind Gulliver’s Travels; 
some leave only an impression of meaningless wordiness 
because they have never grasped the pantheistic interpreta- 
tion embodied in his poetry by Wordsworth; or they have 
read so superficially that they cannot participate in the 
power of Milton, the sensuousness of Shelley and Poe, the 
doubt of Matthew Arnold, the probing of Browning; or they 
have so confused literature with dull interpretation of it— 
in both school and epllege—that they are totally unable to 
relish the delights of Lewis Carroll, Mark Twain, Sir James 
M. Barrie, and Mr. G. Bernard Shaw. 
The first essential towards successful teaching of apprecia- 
tion of literature is that the person shall have read fruitfully 
a large amount of the best. The second essential is that he 
still read widely but discriminatingly. It may be unfor- 
‘tunate that the teacher of English has to know so much more
-P-A-G-E-198
  190 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
than is contained between the covers of a single textbook, 
but he must, and if he chooses this subject, he must count 
the cost beforehand, or meet the requirements as they arise. 
He is merely evading if he believes that he knows Tess of the 
D'Urbervilles because he saw it in a motion picture. He is 
blindly deceiving himself if he accepts screen versions of 
Mark Twain’s A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court, 
and The Three Musketeers, or views the degraded Male and 
Female as the equivalent of Barrie’s The Admirable Crichton. 
The proper attitude was displayed by the pupils of a large 
city high school, who after they had read A Tale of Two 
Cities were shown the screen version. Their protests were 
vehement. ‘It was no more like the book! Only one trial 
was shown, when the story has two! It wasn’t like what I 
imagined at all.” This suggestion that he read discriminat- 
ingly does not preclude knowledge of contemporary writing. 
The teacher need not follow Emerson’s advice to wait until a 
book is a year old. A proper ratio may be preserved by 
reading for every recent one a good old book. Notice the 
noun to which the adjective relates. Many narrowly-read 
teachers erroneously believe that all old books are dull and 
long. They frankly express astonishment that More’s 
Utopia, Milton’s Paradise Lost, Swift’s Battle of the Books, 
Irving’s Tales of a Traveler, Burney’s Evelina, Bacon’s Essays, 
Walton’s Complete Angler, Carlyle’s Sartor Resartus, and 
Sidney’s Defense of Poetry are of manageable length and of 
intense interest. If a beginning teacher follow this rule, to 
read a standard old book to balance every recent ephemeral 
one, he will be able after about ten years to reduce the 
attention accorded to recognized material, and venture into 
uncharted lands. By this time, he will be reading fewer and 
fewer volumes in a foreign language, if he has continued this 
reading since college, gaining more leisure for general litera- 
ture. Time gained in this manner may suffice for acquaint-
-P-A-G-E-199
  
JUDGMENT, APPRECIATION, ETC. 191 
ance with periodicals. Though these two phases of reading 
may seem distant from classroom methods, they are not. 
Pupils will accept with consideration the advice, hints, 
criticism, commendations, and recommendations delivered 
by a teacher whose reading has impressed them by its inher- 
ent value and comprehensive inclusiveness. 
Talk interestingly about reading.—The teacher must be 
able to communicate interest about reading. This does not 
mean communicate merely the material. It means to arouse 
in another mind interest in a book. Remarks designed to do 
this reflect in school the practices of acquaintances and 
friends in life, as well as the organized service of libraries and 
magazines. The teacher should be or become a vivid, rapid 
summarizer of long plots, a skilful reproducer of salient 
details, a proposer of tantalizing situations. Without serious- 
ly diverting attention from the topic under scrutiny, he 
should be able to suggest further reading for comparison. 
If a pupil declares she likes a recent essay on sleep because of 
the dialogue with the pillow, the teacher may introduce the 
word whimsical, and rapidly suggest other uses of such a 
treatment in the same form;—Franklin’s dialogue with his 
gout, Hawthorne’s A Rill from the Town Pump, Daudet’s 
inimitable dialogue between the Don Quixote and the Sancho 
Panza sides of the hero of Tartarin of Tarascon, and even 
wind up with any other uses of the device he may know, such 
as that by which reflection is vivified by writing, ‘I said to 
Myself,” and ‘Myself replied.” 
From all that has preceded it is easy to infer what is the 
chief method of inducing appreciation in adolescents. This 
is the display of enthusiasm. This trait of a teacher is not 
only contagious and stimulating, it is a model for pupils. 
A candid observer must admit the instantaneous effect upon 
a class when a teacher begins to talk interestingly of some 
reading he has done. Professor William Lyon Phelps il- 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
  192 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
lustrated a political point in an address to two thousand 
high school pupils by referring to Julius Caesar. That after- 
noon every copy of the play was taken from the school 
library, boys being more. anxious to secure it than girls. A 
teacher’s enthusiastic praise of The Vicar of Wakefield made 
it easy to assign the reading of it to every one of eighty- 
eight pupils in three sections of an eleventh year class, and 
have them finish it in a week for a written test. After a tenth 
year class had read The Vicar, She Stoops to Conquer was 
urged as an extra volume. Every pupil in two sections read 
it, memorized portions, delivered them, and asked to be 
allowed to present informally the entire play. Unfortunately, 
time did not permit the carrying out of their wish. Many of 
them read in addition The Good Natured Man, and The 
School for Scandal. One teacher, by challenging comments 
concerning the studied Silas Marner and the prescribed 
supplementary reading, The Mill on the Floss, induces 
hundreds of eleventh year pupils every year to read in 
addition Adam Bede and Romola. Another man by his 
enthusiasm over Henry Esmond secures liking for The 
Virginians and Vanity Fair. While some teachers are able 
to do this, others confuse The Virginians with The Virginian 
by Mr. Owen Wister. Some in a test on their reading 
answered that Becky Sharp was a New England housewife.! 
Testing appreciation.—Some of the tests which may be 
applied after all methods have been employed will indicate 
their efficacy in securing results. A few may be applied 
almost at once to the literature studied; others will bring re- 
sponses only after months, some indeed only after years. 
Some measure of the sense of appreciation will be exhibited 
in the heat and enthusiasm projected into class discussions 
over questions raised by the text, suggested by the teacher,

or brought up by class recitation, very often, strangely 
enough, by some pupil’s mistaken interpretation of a passage, 
a reference, or a hint. Another indication easily recognized 
by sensitive teachers is the attention displayed during the 
reading of a passage. To feel this unerringly, the instructor 
should have a keen audience sense, he should notice the 
change in attitude. The desire of pupils to read far in ad- 
vance of the assignment, to finish the book quickly, the 
request for more by the same writer or similar productions, 
are instantaneous indications that appreciation has been 
stimulated. Written compositions may test response, but 
in them the pupil is hampered by a lack of critical habits; 
it is difficult for high school boys and girls to explain at 
length why they like what they read. The spoken remark, 
because it is shorter, may be more truthfully representative. 
Sometimes the pupil’s reading aloud may show his sense of 
appreciation, but this is not always a safe guide. The youth 
will not willingly allow his feelings to carry him off his guard. 
He may like to hear his teacher read Sohrab and Rustum 
pathetically, or The Raven mournfully, or The Cloud beauti- 
fully, but he prefers to make his face stolid and his tone gruff, 
no matter what he may be experiencing within. 
The teacher who deduces from all kinds of indications that 
pupils have some glimmering of discriminating appreciation 
should review in his mind the exact methods by which he 
strove to arouse it, the time it first appeared, the circum- 
stance or incident which brought it forth. If a device, or a 
series of steps, a plan, a surprise, a startling accusation, or an 
astounding exaggeration produced the first expression of it, the 
same detail or a better one of the same kind may be used the 
following term. Let us repeat here the suggestions made in 
Chapter III for evoking an interest in the poetry of Browning. 
If one have the class read through The Pied Piper of Hamelin 
a receptive disposition is apparent at once. If the pupils

coming down the stairs. On the landing they pause while 
the host draws aside a curtain, and then begins to speak, 
“There’s my last Duchess painted on the wall as though she 
were alive.’”’ The pupils will see the picture as the reading 
progresses. Let the instructor add just a sentence here and 
there. ‘We do not know what happened to her. Browning 
merely says, ‘Then all smiles stopped together.’” A little 
later, “‘Here they rise, and the guest naturally hesitates, to: 
let the Duke pass down first. But the fine gentleman’s 
courtesy is never forgotten: ‘Nay, we’ll go together down, 
Sir.’” After this poem has sunk into their consciousness, 
say a few words about Fra Lippo Lippi, only a few, then let 
them read the poem. By this time, they will have no preju- 
dice against the intellectual poet. It may be safe to study 
with them Rabbi Ben Ezra, but not without a preliminary 
discussion. Speakers in school assemblies have told them 
that their school days are the happiest period of their lives. 
Do they really believe that? Do they not expect to be 
happier after graduation? After college? In business? In 
their life careers? Are older persons always sad? Is there 
not a pleasure of old age equal to that of youth, even if dis- 
similar from it? What did L’Allegro and Il Penseroso show 
them? Practically, do not all persons anticipate increasing 
satisfaction? Why cling to life so tenaciously, then? Did 
Gray express this in his Elegy: “Nor cast one lingering, 
longing look behind”? Should an old man, vigorous in 
intellect, strong in the recollection of a life well spent, con- 
scious of power within his soul, creep about the world, a

puling wailer, or should he assert the inherent glory of the end 
that crowns the course? Make them see the venerable 
preacher proclaiming his doctrine, his grateful acceptance of 
all the world has offered him, his manly use for betterment 
of all that came to him, his human tolerance of differing 
opinions, relate the guiding principles to the lives and minds 
of the pupils, and though they may be confused by the youth 
seeking flowers, and the potter’s product, they will never 
forget the doctrines underlying the stanzas in which are en- 
shrined the phrases: “Strive and hold cheap the strain; Learn, 
nor account the pang; dare, never grudge the throe!”— 
“What I aspired to be, And was not, comforts me.’”— 
“The Future I may face now I have proved the Past.”— 
“Now, who shall arbitrate? Ten men love what I 
hate.” 
The next step follows naturally. The three greatest 
things in this world are life, love, and death. What would 
this poet think of death? Prospice and the Epilogue to 
Asolando may require for complete understanding a sentence 
or two, but for appreciation they need only to be compared 
with Crossing the Bar. Which poem does each individual 
reader prefer? Here, as in a hundred instances of teaching, 
the instructor had better keep his preference to himself. 
The chief individualities in a classroom are those of the 
pupils. 
Use definite plans.—To some teachers such a careful 
planning may seem artificial. They are mistaken; planning 
for such important influences is not artificial, but artistic. 
The teacher who does not know how to apply the principle 
just illustrated to sequences, who “just takes things as they 
come along” will remain an unproductive teacher. In many 
respects, teaching is as creative a process as writing, depend- 
ent for effect upon the most skilful adaptation of means and 
methods to the end desired. That end, in literary apprecia- 
     
-P-A-G-E-204
  196 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
tion, is the implanting of an infallible taste for great literature, 
that kind of taste which Carlyle accurately described. 
“Taste, if it mean anything but a paltry connoisseurship, 
must mean a general susceptibility to truth and nobleness; a 
sense to discern, and a heart to love and reverence all 
beauty, order, goodness, wheresoever or in whatsoever forms 
and accompaniments they are to be seen.” 
Difficulties underlying recognition of style—If teachers 
were asked what single literary quality they find most diffi- 
cult to teach, they would likely answer “style.” The young 
mind can be forced to repeat the sentences in histories of 
literature, in introductions to masterpieces, in footnotes to 
selections, in comments by teachers, but the ability to see 
qualities of style and to explain them is not an easy accom- 
plishment, not only for high school pupils, but for adult 
readers as well. To the difficulty inherent in the undeveloped 
mind must be added the frequent inability of the instructor 
to recognize elements of style, lack of critical analytical 
power to separate them into elements and _ prevalences, 
ignorance of expository progressions to make others see 
them, and failure to devise or adopt workable devices to be 
applied by beginners of the fascinating investigations. 
Practically every pupil furnishes an excellent starting point 
for critical knowledge of style which may be developed into 
appreciation. If no pupil makes the remark the teacher may 
relate it. Let him say, “‘Hasn’t some friend of yours ever 
recommended a story to you? Hasn’t he tried to give you an 
idea of the material? When he has seen by your face that he 
is not arousing enthusiasm in your mind, he has frequently 
ended by declaring, ‘Well, you see, it isn’t the story itself, 
but the way it’s written’; hasn’t he?” Every pupil in the 
class will nod or flash corroboration of the experience. That, 
then, is the teacher’s opportunity of broaching the question: 
Exactly what is meant by this phrase, “the way it is writ-
-P-A-G-E-205
JUDGMENT, APPRECIATION, ETC. 197 
ten”? Patently, the topic should not be discussed unless 
| the findings can be applied to some specimen under considera- 
tion. Beginning study should be confined strictly to the 
characteristics easily discerned. The salient marks should 
be identified with that selection and that author to remain 
for all time concomitant responses to the mention of the 
title and the man. It is better for a graduate at the name 
of Samuel Johnson to recall his definition of network: “ Any- 
thing reticulated or decussated, at equal distances, with 
interstices between the intersections,” than to think of 
nothing; at the name of Lyly to repeat, “The first sip of 
love is pleasant, the second perilous, the third pestilent,” 
than to know absolutely nothing of euphuism; at the name 
of Edgar Allan Poe to hear the sonority of The Raven and 
Annabel Lee, than to hear nothing; at the name of Alexander 
Pope to linger over the antitheses and anti-climaxes of his 
sparkling heroic couplets than to remain blank; at the name 
of Charles Dickens to quote exaggerations and repeated 
phrases; at the name of Samuel T. Coleridge to murmur the 
archaic expressions of The Ancient Mariner; and at the name 
of Washington Irving to chuckle over some preposterous 
exaggeration delivered with an air of perfect seriousness. 
While many editors of masterpieces for class use have added 
comments and directions of real value to both pupil and 
teacher, many others expect young readers to grasp the 
significance as well as the meaning of such statements as the 
following: “The Rape of the Lock is the most exquisite speci- 
men of filigree work ever invented.’”—“For vividness of 
color, beauty of figure, and witchery of melody it would be 
hard if not impossible to find any lines to equal this.”— 
“ach has a liquid melody of diction unsurpassed in litera- 
ture, and there is a nervous strength of expression that 
makes every sentence a picture.”’-—“‘ Where is there another 
poem comparable to it in exquisitely chiseled imagery, in 
     
-P-A-G-E-206
198 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
white-heat struck out phrases, in elegance of diction, and 
softness of numbers?” 
Unless the teacher teach what these mean and show the 
pupils how to verify them in study, they are as empty sound 
signifying nothing. 
Teach simply the elements of style.—So far as it is taught 
to high school pupils, style is a matter of words, sentences, 
paragraphs, and general treatment. To keep his own faculty 
at its keenest, the teacher should be able to seize upon 
and describe or analyze any marked trait, detailed or gen- 
eral, in all his reading. Should he meet something strange, 
he should display it to his class as a monstrosity; should he 
find something telling, he should exhibit it as a model. He 
will never be unprovided. In a reputable literary journal an 
article concluded thus: “Yet a little time and wider horizons 
opening out before them will range local ills and immediate 
cankers in the softening perspective of social history.” An 
inquiring reader wrote to the editor, “First, what the devil 
. immediate canker? Second, how does one range a 
nker (immediate or other) in a softening perspective?” 
He also pertinently asked about this passage in an alleged 
poem: 
ois. one bitter seed 
Leavens its entrails with despair 
“How does one leaven an entrail?” Another specimen of 
style dependent upon words is this from a novel by a widely- 
read author: 
But, such is the insecurity of human organisms and institutions, 
in less than two minutes he grew aware of a strange sensation within 
him, which sensation he ultimately diagnosed as hunger. 
In plain terms, the man realized that he was hungry. Would 
not pupils enjoy discussing this kind of style? 
 
-P-A-G-E-207
JUDGMENT, APPRECIATION, ETC. 199 
Less obvious, therefore offering more food for thought, is 
> this longer passage by a present-day novelist: 
He felt a sheer force, a downward drawing of an immense abyss 
beneath him. As he looked afar he saw a black basin of timbered 
country, the darkest and wildest he had ever gazed upon, a hundred 
miles of blue distance across to an unflung mountain range, hazy 
purple against the sky. . . . For leagues and leagues a colossal 
red and yellow wall, a rampart, a mountain-faced cliff, seemed to 
zigzag westward. Grand and bold were the promontories reaching 
out over the void. Patches of azure-blue sky flashed between the 
trees. The great white clouds sailed along with her, and shafts of 
golden sunlight, flecked with gleams of falling pine needles, shone 
down through the canopy overhead. 
Are these any more than merely ornamental words and high- 
sounding phrases? Do they mean much? 
Sentence length may become a characteristic of style. 
The following monstrosity actually appears in a printed 
book. 
But eloquence in the description of this great cathedral is resorted 
to in Notre Dame de Paris in all Victor Hugo’s affluent vocabulary 
whose literary genius is much remembered in this city by endowing 
a great street with his name and headingit with a fine statue of him- 
self in studious pose after his quitting of the world on the eve of the 
last century, where it is said the demonstration of the peoples of 
Francein the burial of this French romantic novelist in the Pantheon, 
the big church here, where as I visited, I was attracted by the exqui- 
site adornment of 22 Corinthian columns, 81 feet high, on the date of 
May 31, 1885, at the extreme age of 83 years, surpassed even that of 
Napoleon when his remains were brought home from St. Helena. 
Sentences of similar length, although entirely different in 
meaning and value, may be culled from Milton’s prose works, 
and Victor Hugo’s Les Misérables. 
When sentence length is not the marked characteristic, 
sentence structure may be. There is a pattern of construc- 
tion in the Psalms and Proverbs and other portions of The  
-P-A-G-E-208
  200 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
Bible which stamps them as plainly as a color would. There 
is the careful finish of euphuism which is unmistakable to 
one who has read any group of several pages. There is the 
balanced aphoristic style of Johnson. There is the periodic 
ponderosity of Macaulay. There is the curving, spiral 
labyrinth of Henry James. There is the staccato effect of 
modern realists. There is the ejaculatory repetition of the 
more recent younger school of fictionists. 
Pupils will never be required to recognize and explain the 
effects of all the varieties listed in the preceding paragraph, 
but the well-equipped teacher of English should be able to 
comment on many others less easily labeled in a cursory 
glance. 
What shall pupils be expected to recognize?—What 
elements of style should be brought to the attention of the 
high school pupil? How much recognition should be re- 
quired? How should this aspect of expression be presented? 
It is very easy for the editor of a “school classic” to state 
in his introduction that ‘‘no reader can fail to sense the 
wonderful style of the author, suggestive of the glorious 
hues of the colorful autumn,” but experience shows that 
few high school pupils notice any such quality in the books 
of Hawthorne. A history of English literature asserts rather 
appropriately that Pope’s couplets are distinguished by 
epigrammatic force and brilliance of phrase. Ask your 
senior classes to explain that and to find a dozen illustrations 
in The Iliad or The Rape of the Lock. As the De Coverley 
papers are usually read in the tenth year, it would be inter- 
esting to ask pupils to corroborate the opinion of Samuel 
Johnson that he who wishes to attain ‘‘an English style, 
familiar but not coarse, and elegant but not ostentatious, 
must give his days and nights to the volumes of Addison.” 
Teach that stylistic features depend upon frequency.— 
In its first steps the study of style is based upon so humble
-P-A-G-E-209
    
JUDGMENT, APPRECIATION, ETC. 201 
a practice as counting. We know that Chaucer’s poems 
contain a large number of French words because we can 
count them. We know that Mr. Woodrow Wilson uses 
adjectives with a nice recognition of their meaning because 
we can count the frequency of their appropriate use. We 
know—to go to a different phase of style—that much of the 
prose of George Meredith may be read as free verse because 
scores of passages have been culled, counted, and printed. 
We know that Matthew Arnold’s similes are used as those of 
Homer were because their ratio to the bulk of his verse has 
been estimated. We know that Pope had little imagination 
because an examination of his verse shows few examples. 
We know that its place was filled by fancy because of the 
numerous instances the poems afford. We know that 
Carlyle’s sentences are obstreperous because so many of 
them have interrupted our rapid reading of his books. We 
say that Lincoln’s style was based upon The Bible because 
we know the many phrases which remind us of it—when we 
recognize them. Essays in which nearly all the paragraphs 
are longer than three-quarters of a page will impress a pupil 
as being written in extremely long paragraphs. The novel 
in which most of the sentences are beyond the usual length 
he has been meeting will be marked in his mind by long 
sentences. A preponderence of unfamiliar words will lead 
him to decide that the vocabulary is a difficult one. A 
dozen references on a page to classic deities will justify his 
conclusion that the author refers too often to mythological 
details. A chapter by Mr. William Beebe or Henri Fabre 
will be described as scientific. The speeches of a clown in a 
Shakespeare play may remain in his mind marked by the 
humorous misuse of large words, exactly as this character- 
istic misuse is the ‘‘style” of Mrs. Malaprop. The apprecia- 
tion of style, of course, rises far above such crude classifica- 
tions, but pupils cannot rise very far above them, at least, 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
    
202 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
not at first. If a teacher leads them to accept the obvious 
marks of style and to make these part of their reading and 
judging equipment, he will have succeeded in a difficult task. 
Discuss the style as the material is read.—Attention 
should always be concentrated upon the material being 
studied. Never should questions of style be discussed apart 
from the printed page. A rhetoric may define loose and 
periodic sentences perfectly, but for realization of style based 
upon either or both they should be discussed when Macaulay — 
is being studied. In like manner a text book may list archaic 
words;—pupils will forget nearly everything stated concern- 
ing them. Pupils, however, who are shown how the style of 
Ivanhoe and The Rime of the Ancient Mariner is enhanced by 
them, will never forget either the term archaic or the effect 
of the sound of the words themselves. Pupils in the tenth 
year should be taught the word archaic and required to use it. 
It is manifestly impossible to list the measures for every 
quality of style likely to be met. It is possible, however, to 
tabulate suggestions for determining most of the features to 
recognize.

CHAPTER IX 
ABILITY TO WRITE 
The inclusion of written composition.—If it were within 
the province of this book to decide upon the various aspects 
of English to be included in the curriculum, a careful weigh- 
ing of the claims for and against the teaching of composition 
would have to be inserted, for there has been a shifting of 
emphasis during several years until now the teaching and 
practice of writing have to be justified. The importance of 
spoken English has been more and more widely recognized. 
In spite of all the attacks made upon it, the practice of com- 
position has remained one of the cardinal facts of instruction 
in English. The telephone, the telegram, the night letter, 
the dictaphone, have reduced its monopoly in the social and 
business world. A pupil in a commercial school sees clearly 
that the person who composes the material of a letter seldom 
actually writes it, he dictates it to a stenographer. This 
separation of the dual operations of composing has induced 
many a pupil whose ambition soars no higher than to be- 
come an office assistant or private secretary to declare that 
he need know nothing more about writing than spelling and 
punctuating. If he looks forward to other positions he may 
escape entirely the typing and need only compose orally, 
leaving to some one else the details of arrangement, spelling, 
and punctuating. 
Some results of written composition.—In Mr. Chauncey 
Depew’s volume of reminiscences he quotes James G. Blaine 
as saying to him, “I am in very low spirits today: I have 
read over the first volume of my Twenty Years in Congress, 
204
-P-A-G-E-213
  ABILITY TO WRITE 205 
which is just going to the printer, and destroyed it. I dic- 
tated the whole of it, but I find that accuracy and elegance 
can only be had at the end of a pen. I shall rewrite the 
memoirs in ink.” 
Through the New York City Post Office pass some 
14,300,000 pieces of mail every day. A fair amount of writing 
is stilldone. The chief who has to dictate will not be a poorer 
executive if he knows how writing should be accom- 
plished; the merest typist will be no less valuable if she 
knows the essential characteristics of good English. Many 
an office assistant has silently corrected and improved her 
superior’s phrases, often saving him from criticism in the 
minds of correspondents. 
The ability to write develops accuracy of expression. It 
is an aid in acquiring ability to read. It helps to strengthen 
judgment and sharpen appreciation. Of our three vocabu- 
laries—writing, speaking, reading—it increases the smallest— 
the one used in writing. It corroborates judgment by 
placing opinions in the cold, defined form of black letters 
upon white paper. It makes a permanent record, the 
significance of which tempers statement as one grows in 
years and experience with men. 
Should teachers be able to write well?—As an essential 
which will improve the teaching of composition, the in- 
structor’s ability to write comes first. That teacher who 
puts in a letter to a school superintendent this expression 
punctuated as a sentence, “Am sorry to leave as the work 
is very interesting,” will not make a reliable critic of pupils’ 
efforts. The applicant for a position in the department of 
English whose first letter shows violations of the ordinary 
formal conventions awakens no interest in her fitness. The 
man who asks, “What sort of a place is the one you offer?” 
may have had some experience, but he has little skill in 
writing correctly. All of these specimens are copied from
-P-A-G-E-214
  206 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
letters written by teachers in those most important of all 
compositions, applications for positions. If you read many 
textbooks or pedagogical articles you will easily recall 
violations of ease, grace, emphasis, unity, clearness, even 
correctness, in the compositions of teachers. Complete 
escape from teaching composition is not afforded by the 
separation of writing from the study of literature. In schools 
where this division is effective for terms, the ratio of the two 
kinds of work has been found to be as three to two, so ina 
fair allotment, based on the usual five classes a day, a teacher 
is likely to be assigned two classes in literature and three in 
composition. 
The pupil learns to write by writing.—The first general 
direction which need be set forth is that a pupil learns to 
write by writing. Writing is not a science—though old- 
fashioned textbooks seemed to consider it so—but an art, a 
delightfully fascinating one to most young persons, if its 
power is presented to them properly. The “properly” is 
exemplified by the value of linking composition with social- 
ized relations and purposeful projects. It should—notice, 
should as an ideal, not must as a command—spring from 
the desire for expression, because the writer has something 
to say. Every pupil of high school age has something to say, 
though he may not be aware of it, in fact, may even deny it. 
If inducement and inner urge fail to produce composition, set 
tasks and definite orders must be imposed. Not often will 
they be required if the teacher is able to show pupils how to 
know their own accumulations of interesting topics. Compo- 
sition based on such material cannot be divided strictly into 
the four forms of discourse so long rigidly defined and molded. 
Saner procedure allows beginners to concentrate on trying 
to write what they want to convey to a reader, rather than 
on a single form. Writing worth reading is a combination 
of the so-called forms, which after all, are merely adapta-
-P-A-G-E-215
  ABILITY TO WRITE 207 
tions of means to definite ends. Desire to express ideas, 
intention to be clear and accurate, orderly progression, 
arrangement of parts, recognition of success or failure in 
attempt are to be striven for at first rather than separation 
of description from narration and exposition. 
Show pupils that they have “something to write about.”— 
The first, reiterated, and last objection made by pupils con- 
cerning composition is that they have nothing about which 
to write. A competent teacher will explain to them and 
convince them that they have. He may do this in some such 
manner as this: ‘‘Do you mean to tell me that this class of 
boys and girls in the tenth year of school, with some fifteen 
years of life behind them, with eyes and ears open, have 
nothing interesting about which to write? I can’t believe 
that! You are merely not conscious of the enormity of your 
assertion. You've just returned to school after a long sum- 
mer vacation (or a Christmas vacation, or a break at the end 
of a term), and you’ve experienced nothing, seen nothing, 
done nothing, heard nothing, read nothing, thought of 
nothing, worth telling? Preposterous! If I should leave 
the room, what would all of you do as soon as I had vanished? 
Chatter your heads off! Yet by your own statements, you 
have nothing worth telling. Oh, yes; you have a great deal 
of material. You’ve merely not decided upon a topic from 
all the numerous possibilities.” Pupils do not resent being 
told this kind of truth about themselves, but they do resent 
any disposition of condescension towards them, any tendency | 
on the part of a teacher to “talk down to their level.” The.) 
instructor who analyzes their attitude as the preceding 
remarks do, will win their attention first, their respect 
second, their willingness to profit by his understanding 
third, and some codperation finally. Another effective 
device is to describe the predicament in which Sir Philip 
Sidney found himself when he sat down to write the poems of 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
  208 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
his Astrophel and Stella to induce his sweetheart to believe 
that he loved her. He sought fit words, he turned over 
other men’s pages, he bit his truant pen, he beat his head, 
until his Muse gave him this sensible advice, “Fool!” said 
my Muse, “look in thy heart, and write.” And omitting 
the first word of that line, this is the advice which teachers 
should give to every class beginning the term’s work, ‘“ Look 
in your own hearts, your own minds, your own lives, ex- 
periences, ideals, opinions, and reading to find the material 
to use in school compositions.” ‘ 
Not often will the teacher make the assignment so in- 
definite that pupils will be able to complain, yet once a term, 
say, such personal choice of topic may serve an excellent 
purpose, as will be discussed later. The principle is perfectly 
clear, the teacher should know that pupils have within 
themselves countless ideas worth expressing. 
Show pupils how ‘“‘to tell the truth.””—The next general 
direction concerning compositions is that pupils when they 
write tell the truth. This statement does not refer to literal 
truth, but to truth of expression. (The teacher should 
sharpen his wits on Oscar Wilde’s The Decay of Lying.) 
Pupils should be shown that such phrases as kind of pink 
are not the truth. The pupil should search for the exact 
term. The expression sort of tired says nothing definite. 
I went home. Half-way there I was stopped. This contradicts 
itself. So do the following extracts, which are not, however, 
from pupil compositions, but from New York newspapers. 
Entragues wrote only in the morning, but often extended his 
work of the forenoon into the afternoon.   
His published books include four volumes of verse, four vol- 
umes of literary appreciation and criticism, two unpublished dramas, 
and a number of published and unpublished short stories, articles 
and poems. The most important of these poems are found in the 
present volume.

Everybody must present their ticket is incorrect because 
logically impossible. How could a single individual present 
their ticket? I come home yesterday and told my mother is 
wrong because it does not tell the truth; come does not 
express what the writer means either in time or direction. 
This rule can be used to induce thought by the pupil who 
declares, “I know it, but I can’t say it.” The word know 
is flatly contradicted by the remainder of the sentence. In 
composition the rule is a remarkable aid to pupils, because it 
puts before them the best solution of so much of their 
trouble in securing effects. Once made part of the equipment 
of self-criticism, this rule straightens out sequence of tenses, 
relations of pronouns, proportion of parts, and evidence of 
emphasis. It corrects slovenly thinking. It will illuminate 
small matters of articulation and coherence. I got on the 
trolley car and so I paid my fare. Why and so; is the relation 
consequential or merely sequential? 
The attempt to tell the truth will induce completeness as 
well as clearness. This is illustrated by sections from two 
letters written by adults, both of whom would have been 
amazed at discovering how they had failed to tell what 
they had intended. 
Something dreadful happened this morning. Dan accidently 
shot himself while cleaning his guns in his gun-room. It was about 
9A.M. His brother immediately went out and has been there ever 
since. The afternoon paper gives the best account of the accident. 
I don’t know how anybody is. I will hurry out to see. 
The writer of this letter fondly believed that he had been 
accurate, clear, and complete. Yet the family which received 
it knew practically nothing. Was Dan dead? Did he die 
instantly? Which afternoon paper? Why did the writer 
not send a newspaper clipping with the account? Who is 
meant by “anybody”? It might include all the members of 
   
-P-A-G-E-218
    210 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
Dan’s family. This note is not accurate, not clear, not 
complete. The writer was told so very plainly in an im- 
mediate telegram. 
The next illustration is worse because it was written by a 
person in authority in the office of a well-known periodical: 
It does not deal with a matter of fatal import, but it is 
indicative of a worse trait—the reliance upon reputed 
business jargon, which in its stereotyped triteness means 
practically nothing. If you had mailed a check for payment 
of a subscription, and then received this letter, would you 
know exactly what was wrong with your check? 
Dear Sir: 
We are in receipt of your check returned from our bank unpaid— 
notation attached—‘‘Guarantee amount.” 
This check is numbered 12, dated June 15, 1921 and made payable 
to “The Magazine” for $1.80 drawn on the Blank Bank of Chicago. 
We realize how readily this might have been occasioned by an 
oversight on your part and feel confident that you will send us a new 
check or Money Order to take up this amount. 
Thanking you in anticipation of your immediate attention to 
return of your remittance, we remain 
Very truly yours, 
Accounting Department 
Two more letters were necessary before the signer of the 
check was enlightened. He had written in one blank space 
on the check the correct amount, one dollar eighty cents, but 
in the other blank, habit had led him to jot down seventy- 
five, instead of eighty. Over these figures he had written 
the correct amount. Naturally, he then forgot this slight 
change. Does anything in the accounting department’s 
letter explain why the New York bank hesitated to cash the 
check? Such exhibits do not mean, of course, that teachers of 
English shall relinquish their efforts to have pupils write 
better. They should not complacently shrug their shoulders 
in despair of ever improving adolescents in a world in which
-P-A-G-E-219
  ABILITY TO WRITE 211 
adults show so little accuracy; they must manfully resolve 
that so far as they are able, no youth from their classes shall 
ever write so badly when he arrives at years of discretion. 
In addition to this, teachers must not be overcome by the 
evident worldly prosperity of users of slovenly English, or 
the appearance of errors and carelessness in print. The 
teacher to whom a pupil exultantly quotes a newspaper 
article must know enough to declare quietly that not every- 
thing in print is correct. Many a father who wears stylish 
clothes, and receives more than the superintendent of schools, 
knows less about correct English than a good teacher in the 
grammar grades. 
Pass from “what to write” to “how to write it.”—It is 
quite apparent that this striving for truth in composition 
does not preclude hyperbole for effect. Its chief aim is to 
induce accurate thinking. Nor does the attempt to tell 
the truth require that the writer tell the whole truth, nor 
that he tell the truth at the beginning of his composition; 
facts may be reserved and kept in abeyance in order later to 
produce an artistic climax or telling conclusion. If the 
teacher realizes that. the best word, the most appropriate, 
the most accurate, is above the pupil, it is his duty not to 
penalize the pupil for not knowing it, but to teach it to him. 
To illustrate; a seventh year pupil in an otherwise good 
sentence used ammonia instead of pneumonia. Later in 
high school he might have been reprimanded for such an 
error. The seventh year teacher wisely taught him and the 
class the correct word. Pupils should be held responsible 
for words and sentence constructions with which they should 
be familiar. 
Pupils in the seventh, eighth, and ninth years should be 
trained to write clear, direct sentences with some variety of 
length and structure. A fair facility and accuracy may be 
secured, should be secured, by the end of the ninth year.
-P-A-G-E-220
  212 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
By insisting on preparation before the paper is written, and 
careful revision after it is finished, the time between the 
ninth and twelfth years should implant all the elements of 
good composition. Quantity will be increased; but quality 
must be improved. The teacher should illustrate this at 
frequent intervals by citing that the sentences in the primary 
readers are absolutely correct in grammatical form and 
perfectly clear in meaning. But what high school pupil 
would rest content with attainment of such form and con- 
tent? From hearing two papers, pupils will judge that one in 
which there may be a few corrections indicated is better than 
another in which no actual error is apparent. They will 
then be ready to appreciate the rhetorical qualities of good 
writing. Considerations of not what to write but how to write it 
will engross their minds while they prepare and while they 
write. They will accord hearty approval to the manipulator 
of meaningful words, to the constructor of strong phrases, to 
the reacher after unusual comparisons, to. the recaller of 
old-time associations, to the keen observer. They will even 
praise a daring though unsuccessful attempt. The presence 
in every class of a few pupils who write well can be used to 
raise the entire average; for the teacher can point out adroitly 
that these excellent papers are produced by their classmates, 
pupils no further advanced in school than the rest of them. 
Papers held over from previous classes of the same grade will 
often awaken dormant resolves to meet the requirements of 
that grade: While papers must be judged by something else 
than length, this quantitive measure must be applied. 
Facility in short flights must be steadied for amplified effort. 
Worthy thinking must be exercised for longer periods than 
the five minutes required for putting down fifty words on 
paper. The “flash” must be trained into calm productive 
energy. Pupils in the twelfth grade should write three or four 
times as many words as those of the ninth year. 
 
-P-A-G-E-221
ABILITY TO WRITE 213 
Teach the pupil to choose a theme.—It is rather un- 
fortunate that in so many schools and colleges the finished 
composition is called a theme, because that word in regular 
parlance has a well-defined meaning which lends itself so 
well to teaching pupils how to choose something definite for 
_ their exercises. Teachers are not always careful in the terms 
they use in trying to induce the proper attitude towards 
writing, for many of them speak of the subject of a paper 
when they mean the title. Early in the course, and con- 
stantly reviewed, there should be a separation of the three 
words, subject, theme, and title, with discussion, and several 
illustrations. Let the teacher who does not make these dis- 
tinctions clear announce “‘an adventure” as the assignment in 
composition, and he will be handed nearly thirty composi- 
tions with that expression wrongly used as the title. Pupils 
who do this—they are legion—simply do not know the distine- 
tion hinted at above. The subject of the paper is the general 
topic upon which something is written; the theme is the par- 
ticular aim of that single paper, which may be stated as a de- 
clarative sentence; the title may be practically anything the 
author chooses. Sometimes the title is the theme in full or 
shortened form. Practically never can it be the subject; no 
school composition can exhaust the possible treatment of the 
subject. The title may be totally different from the theme. 
Thirty pupils may write upon the Panama Canal, but there 
may be thirty different themes: the French failure, Roose- 
velt’s seizure of the zone, the construction of the locks, 
Culebra Cut, landslides, the commercial value, tolls for 
American vessels, fortification, sanitation marvels, a voyage 
through the canal, effect on the Mississippi Valley, etc. Ina 
literary review there is this illustration of the three things: a 
woman has written a biography of her husband, the theme of 
the volume is his enthusiasm and success in inducing Jews 
to leave cities and engage in agricultural pursuits, the title 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
  214 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
is Adventures in Idealism. A volume of Ruskin’s lectures 
deals with themes grouped around the reading of good books 
and the best education for girls. Two of them are entitled, 
Of Kings’ Treasures and Of Queens’ Gardens; the book itself 
is entitled Sesame and Lilies. Samuel Johnson wrote about 
the search for happiness; the theme is that happiness must 
come from within one’s own nature; the title is the name of 
the chief character, Rasselas. Until pupils are taught the 
value of themes, well-defined in their minds, for their school 
compositions, teachers will have endless trouble in securing 
sense of content, attempt at progression, and some semblance 
of form. Let the pupil say to himself, “Exactly what am I. 
going to do in this composition?” and the teacher will not 
have to ask bewilderedly, ‘What is the point you’re trying 
to make in that paper?” A train of thought can only move 
surely and safely when it intends to reach some destin- 
ation. 
Determine composition length by number of words.— 
Papers should be assigned in length by giving the number of 
words to be written, not by mentioning the number of pages. | 
Handwriting is a variable attribute. Mere length and over 
wordiness are not to be accepted upon their single value; but 
every teacher has written across the bottom of some com- 
position, “Too short.” There is too great a difference be- 
tween the pupil who writes only sixty words while another in 
the same time writes two hundred. One person on a sheet 
of paper wrote the following forty-eight words. 
Constant flux, renewal, and re-creation, these are the conditions 
of life. To repeat and repeat is senile; to be static is death. This 
has all been said so often that it is about qualified to be classed as 
senile. And yet it must be said, for the propensity

Constant flux, renewal, and re-creation, these are the conditions 
of life. To repeat and repeat is senile; to be static is death. This 
has all been said so often that it is almost qualified to be classed as 
senile. And yet it must be said, for the propensity of human nature 
is to seek finality—to reach for a point which is utmost, though up 
to now science and knowledge have not penetrated to such a point. 
We have looked for it in the theater, but neither is it to be found 
there. 
Those of us who can remember the days when Henry Irving 
imported exact replicas of the pillars of an Italian cathedral to 
embellish the church scene in Much Ado about Nothing, or who 
marveled at the window copies from the palace in Verona to enhance 
the realism of a balcony scene, may have felt that the acme had been 
reached. 
Pupils who groan over the exactions in composition may 
be asked to count the number of words in a page of reading 
matter of usual format, or in the column of a newspaper. 
They will have a little more respect for the mere manual 
dexterity required to write the daily account of ball games, 
the editorials, the news stories, etc. They usually become 
keenly curious about the length of magazine articles and 
short stories. The teacher who exercises them in narrative 
may draw their attention to the fact that as they seldom 
write papers longer than two thousand words they never 
really produce short stories. Their efforts are incidents, 
resolved situations, and general outlines for short stories. 
Have manuscript prepared properly.—As the writing 
world has practically agreed upon the forms in which manu- 
script shall be prepared, a single school system should decide 
upon a form and then adhere to it strictly, for the sake of 
saving the time and attention of pupils. Toa large extent, 
details of form will be decided by the regulations printed in 
the basal textbooks studied in that system. Manuscripts 
should never be rolled. If not handed in flat, they should be 
folded. Uniform paper should be used, but if pupils type
-P-A-G-E-224
  216 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
their compositions, a different kind will have to be accepted. 
It should, however, be of nearly the same size as that used 
by the longhand writers. Typed sheets will have adequate 
margins at both right and left. Longhand papers should 
have one at the left. Whether there should be one at the right 
is a moot topic. It is a convenient place for writing marks 
and corrections, as to reach it the hand does not have to 
travel across the writing, a motion which interferes with 
rapid reading. On the other hand, pupils cannot avoid the 
straggling uneven appearance at the end of lines. It is sim- 
pler to let them continue until they fill each line. Hyphens 
should be eschewed, especially when division leaves a short 
syllable standing alone. It is safe to say that wherever there 
is room for a hyphen there is space for two letters of a word. 
If at the end of a line only the first two letters of attempt 
can be written, it is better to write nothing, but to place the 
entire word on the next line. The first line of every para- 
graph should be indented. Tell pupils that if they disregard 
that rule, they do not know “the first thing about writing.” 
In all written work pupils should be required to indent the 
first line, even in writing a single sentence on the board. 
Teachers often disregard this rule when they write upon the 
blackboards, then wonder why their pupils indent para- 
graphs as though by chance. The teachers’ work should be 
a model. Individual office rules of certain magazines should 
not obtain in school writing. Thus, simplified spelling has 
been relinquished everywhere except in a few periodicals such 
as The Literary Digest. For a time The Century Magazine 
had a peculiar form of quotation marks on a line with the 
body of the letters. They were short angular parentheses, 
as high as the body of small letters. In another periodical 
single quotation marks are used in places where double sets 
should be used. Books printed by this house show changes 
and inconsistencies. Early issues intended for schools
-P-A-G-E-225
ABILITY TO WRITE 217 
followed the magazine in using single quotations; later 
printings of these same volumes show double quotation 
marks in conformity with general practice. Its books also. 
show this variation. In the text, titles of books are inclosed 
in double quotation marks, in the foot-notes, titles are 
printed in italics, which in manuscript are indicated by 
underlining once. In the magazine, however, titles in both 
text and foot-notes are in italics. Both systems are correct, 
but the teacher of composition will do well to induce pupils 
to follow one. The more sensible way seems to be to indicate. 
titles by underlining, reserving quotation marks to set off 
quotations. A few sentences written on the board comment- 
ing on a novel or play in which a character’s name and the 
title are the same will make this clear: Hamlet, David 
Copperfield, Silas Marner, etc. Every paper should bear the 
title and name of the writer, preferably at the top of the first 
page. All pages should be numbered. Pupils should be 
shown how to correct and improve their own papers after they 
have been written. Marks of transposition should be allowed. 
An entire paragraph may be placed in its proper position 
by leading lines and arrows. Tell pupils to draw a line 
through words they do not wish to have read. Never place 
parentheses around passages to be omitted. Parentheses are 
legitimate punctuation marks. What they inclose is to be 
read. Besides being more expeditious, it is neater to cross 
words out than to smudge over with a dirty eraser. Papers 
should be neat. Penmanship should be legible; beyond this 
requirement the department of English has no province. 
Beauty of Spencerian script has no direct relation to excel- 
lence in composition. As the writer cannot always see his 
own errors, pupils may exchange papers for examination and 
even conference. Sets of compositions written early in the 
term may be kept for later comparison. 
Instructions for marking titles of pupil compositions. 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
218 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
vary—some text-books say underline once, some twice, some 
thrice; some give no direction. If the printers’ rule is fol- 
lowed, there should be three lines, as titles are printed in 
capitals, indicated in manuscript by underlining three times. 
Capitalization of the words is correctly indicated in rhetorics 
and composition textbooks. 
Show pupils why outlines should be made.—Most pupils 
dislike to make outlines. If a teacher insists that a paper to 
be written at home be accompanied by its outline, he can be 
reasonably sure that the composition will be written first 
and the outline made from it. Ask your class to tell you 
whether they have ever done this. There are three reasons 
for this reversal of the process taught as the correct one. 
In schools the first outlines are usually prepared in class from 
already finished products. The preparation of an outline 
becomes associated in the pupil’s mind with an analytic 
instead of with a synthetic process. The second reason is 
that the preparation of an outline requires the mental 
operations which all pupils shun and avoid whenever possible. 
They hold an ineradicable aversion to thinking. The third 
reason is an easily understood one. In the pupil’s summing 
up of school values, the outline seems never to receive any 
credit. The composition only is marked. The outline, on 
which he spent the greater amount of time, is seldom asked 
for by the teacher. Why should a pupil prepare entries upon 
sheets destined for the waste basket? This attitude is not 
an unnatural one among young persons. The teacher may 
explain at length that the outline does appear and is marked 
in the final composition; pupils will listen respectfully but 
hold their own opinion still. If the teacher can show them 
the value of an outline as a help, he will have accomplished 
wonders for the dual arts of speech and writing. 
One of the best methods of enlisting respect for outlines 
is by their use in speech making. Another device is te begin 
    
~
-P-A-G-E-227
  
ABILITY TO WRITE 219 
making outlines early and frequently in the school course, 
so that there is ingrained in the pupils’ consciousness the 
belief that they are constructive exercises rather than 
duplications. These helpful outlines should be simple, clear, 
and suggestive, free from the eager puzzic-pursuit character- 
istic of these elaborately balanced designs tortured from 
literary masterpieces over weeks and months of hair-splitting 
discussions. Procrustean formalism has driven active teach- 
ers to cry out against this reductio ad absurdum method of 
dealing with literature. Yet even when they publish their 
views, they admit that some sort of anticipatory plan is 
better than unregulated verbiage. It is impossible to argue 
away Milton’s plan for the never-written tragedy dealing 
with the fall of man, Franklin’s list of topics to be treated in 
his autobiography, Lincoln’s notes on a scrap of paper before 
his speech at Gettysburg, or his more impressive brief of a 
speech in court. 
No contract.—Not professional services.—Unreasonable charge. 
—Money retained by Def’t not given to Pl’ff.—Revolutionary 
War.—Describe Valley Forge privations.—PI’ff’s husband.— 
Soldier leaving for army.—Skin Def’t.—Close. 
Show pupils how outlines should be made.—Pupils should 
be shown how actually to make a good outline. It should 
be admitted that a worked-over plan is not a thing of beauty 
or a model of neatness. Some of the best specimens of out- 
lines are not copy-book exercises. The prime requisite is 
that the author know where he is going, next he should 
decide upon his starting point, then fill in the road between 
the two. Entries, jotted down in any form, should be 
placed at wide intervals upon a large sheet of paper. Logical 
order is not of first moment in this step; the aim is to get into 
writing the thoughts upon the theme. As these first entries 
are considered, many will be crossed out, not a few will be
-P-A-G-E-228
220 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
combined, several will be rearranged. The order may be 
indicated by numbering, or by drawing brackets, paren- 
theses, or loops, and lines and arrows to show where entire 
sections belong. Asterisks, daggers, all sorts of symbols, 
recognized as standard or invented for the special occasion, 
may be utilized. The intention is not to produce a textbook 
skeleton, but a practical guide to clear writing. If the 
teacher will make one of these interlined, crowded, revised, 
expanded, contracted, and vivid outlines upon the full ex- 
panse of the blackboard, he will be able to teach pupils how 
the finished form is produced. The aims of a good outline 
are reflections of the purposes of the finished composition: 
unity and consecutiveness in treatment, proportion of parts, 
avoidance of repetition, ease of grasp of the entire material 
because of easily recognized and remembered construction. 
If an adequate outline has been prepared, composition 
busies itself with modes of expression, the material has 
already been weighed and approved. 
Provide practice in beginnings and endings.—The most 
difficult parts of compositions for amateurs are the begin- 
nings and endings. Composition textbooks should explain 
the difference between a beginning and an introduction, 
between an ending and a conclusion. Such information 
should be tested in the writing of beginnings and endings of 
all sorts. As the beginning of an article tries to do definite 
things, it is rather easy to devise exercises to place the 
themes of articles before readers. Several should be written 
and criticized. Especially good ones should be commended. 
Other pupils will catch their spirit and form. Conclusions 
are not so easily provided for, but it is always possible to 
have the pupils write most of a composition outside class, 
for which the ending may be written later. The beginning 
and ending may be coupled by having the body briefly 
related or indicated in outline. Conclusions from printed
-P-A-G-E-229
  
ABILITY TO WRITE 221 
articles of similar nature may be read to them. To test 
ingenuity, the class may finish a story or article read up to a 
certain point. 
First learn how well pupils write.——The first duty of a 
teacher at the beginning of every term is to learn how well 
his classes can write.! He should explain this necessity to 
them, because if they write well he will be able to adapt 
composition to their ability. If they write poorly, he will 
know in what respects they need help and practice, how much 
more attention he and they must give to developing skill, 
for unless a certain standard is reached by the end of the 
term he will not be justified in marking many with a passing 
grade. He may remind them of the phases they mastered 
during the preceding term, the details they must have 
studied, the facility they must have attained in order to be 
promoted. At this time he need not be much more explicit. 
Then he should make his first assignment for a composition 
in some such remarks as the following ones. 
Tomorrow, I shall have you write during thirty-five minutes on 
any topic you choose. The remainder of the period you should 
devote to re-reading and correcting your composition. 
Choose your theme before you come to class. Consider several. 
Decide upon the beginning, development, ending, the method of 
treatment. The pupil not ready to begin writing as soon as the 
class has assembled will show that he has not prepared. Do not 
write the composition at home, then copy it in class. You will be 
allowed to use an outline, if you care to make one. Make the paper 
interesting to persons who do not know you. There should be no 
questions concerning this assignment. 
Kinds of material pupils choose.—The experienced 
teacher will know from past sets of papers the kinds of topics 
pupils choose for these first themes. A beginning teacher 
will learn from these first sets. A group of nearly seven

Base composition upon pupil interests.—These tabula- 
tions indicate two facts upon which may be based some 
remarks concerning the topics of pupils’ papers. Notice that 
personal experiences, personal interests are the topics to 
which writers turn in greatest number. Here, then, is the 
first step in two phases of writing, the arousing of interest 
through natural selections, and the fostering of self-expres- 
sion. With the personal experience of the young writer, the 
teacher may begin his cultivation of fluency and accuracy. 
Let him be perfectly frank in agreeing with the pupil that he
-P-A-G-E-231
ABILITY TO WRITE 223, 
should be able to choose from his own interests some of the 
best possible themes for school compositions. If pupils, 
though they have proved that these topics are their first 
choices, still seem to doubt the advisability of looking into 
themselves for suggestions, the teacher may call their atten- 
tion to the vast body of helpful and pleasing literature upon 
exactly similar themes, ranging from Franklin’s Autobiography 
to Miss Helen Keller’s Story of My Life. Or if these appear 
too literary to inspire much confidence in mock-modest 
adolescents, refer to articles appearing in periodicals. The 
pseudo-modesty of the hypocrite world was reflected at ' 
one time in an oft-repeated direction that a person should 
not talk of himself, and that a letter should not begin with 
the pronoun I. In spite of all the instances which prove its 
opposite, there are hundreds of teachers, evidently, who 
continue to repeat that falsity. Pupils entering high school 
maintain stoutly that they have been given that advice. 
Attempt to conform to it is responsible for countless incom- 
plete sentences in pupil letters, and doubtless, in many 
business epistles. This opinion persists in spite of the 
real desire which actuates every letter writer. You wish to 
receive a letter from a friend because you wish to hear from 
him. You do not care especially for a letter which relates 
merely the doings of the town. You ask opinions of corre- 
spondents because you value the thoughts of those persons. 
Familiar letters are best when they reveal the individuals 
behind them; and business letters of the best kind are 
valuable because they depart from the trite formalized jargon 
of the typewriting manuals. Deplore the fact as a social 
lack if you must, but recognize it as a means of approach in 
teaching composition—human beings are interested in 
themselves. In a discussion of various kinds of thinking 
in The Mind in the Making, Mr. James Harvey Robinson 
declares: ‘‘There is nothing else anything like so interesting
-P-A-G-E-232
  224 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
to ourselves as ourselves.” Beginning with such an exercise 
as here suggested, a skilful teacher can make composition 
‘exercises serve two ends in the educative process, the more 
remote being the more important; the approach to ability 
to write and the training of a personality by worthy means 
towards a noble ideal. An explanation of all the possible 
detailed devices contributing to these two ends would cover 
too much space, but let us illustrate with one. Pupils like 
to write attempts at humor. Sad attempts they are. They 
depend on freakish spelling imitated from newspapers and 
magazines, slovenly punctuation, smartness, meaningless 
slang; in material they are slap-stick, crude, thoughtless. 
How easy it is, if a class has produced a single humorous 
paper of a better kind, to point the difference by reading it 
and a few others for contrast. No citations and no emphasis 
are needed to show that genuine humor is refined, and that 
its expression is graceful. 
Base compositions upon pupils’ mental and imaginative 
experiences.—The course in composition may begin as here 
suggested, and at frequent intervals draw from the abundant 
resources of the pupil’s own nature. His stock of suitable 
themes is not limited to physical experiences—mental ones 
are often better. It is thus easy to pass to personal experi- 
ences in imaginative writing—retrospective, contemporary, 
and anticipatory. Textbooks provide adequate suggestions 
for this kind of work. Another field may be reached by 
asking for experiences among books. This leads to the 
informal report on some book read, to the informative ac- 
count of a volume the pupil desires to recommend, to the 
opinion of a book suggested or prescribed by teacher or 
course of study, to critical essays on certain phases of read- 
ing, portions of volumes, characters, style—in fact, any 
topic connected in the closest or remotest manner with 
literature. These compositions should spring from the
-P-A-G-E-233
  ABILITY TO WRITE 225 
literature included in the course of study. The reading and 
study of every grade should provide abundant material for 
themes. Variety is assured because no two literary units 
follow the same paths or progress in the same manner. 
Further variety over a range of years is assured by the 
widening of the horizon and the deepening of feeling. A 
pupil in the ninth year having read Ivanhoe might be asked 
to compare its two chief female characters, a pupil in the 
eleventh year having finished Vanity Fair might be assigned 
a composition in exactly the same terms, but the results— 
because of subject matter and age of the writers—would 
be markedly different. Two selections read in the same 
grade will provide the same differences. What details 
in Poe’s stories impressed you most? What details in 
O. Henry’s stories? 
Provide practice in two general kinds of composition.— 
As a basic plan, in a single term, compositions should be 
grouped into two main divisions: those related to the litera- 
ture of that term, and all others. “Gpper class pupils and 
college students can be held to an entire term of exposition, 
argumentation, narration, or description, but lower class 
high school pupils should not be drilled so continuously and 
consistently in any one form. Beginners should not be forced 
to separate their written discourse from a related form, as 
though a single sentence of description would contaminate a 
paragraph of narration, or a spot of exposition would wilt a 
growth of argument. 
Provide some composition dependent upon reproduction. 
—TIn the approximate half related to books read and studied, 
some attention should be given to written reproduction. 
Any criticism of this form of composition should be directed 
not against its use but against its abuse. Younger pupils do 
not dislike such exercise. Its value is apparent at once; 
the power to summarize, to compress, to represent in minia-
-P-A-G-E-234
  226 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
ture, and to retell is an accomplishment of decided practical 
value in real life (journalism, teaching, preaching, law, 
lecturing, business) and a marked accomplishment in social 
intercourse. Inept teachers of cramped intellectual range 
and stunted human sympathy have brought the practice into 
disrepute by using it as the only kind of composition exercise. 
In original papers the pupil may say anything he pleases, 
4 provided he keep within the bounds of probability and con- 
sistency. /-In papers dependent upon some phase of repro- 
duction the pupil must know the facts of the literary master- 
piece. Quite as valuable as an exercise in expression, such 
writing provides training in retention of substance, in 
accuracy of thought, in soundness of judgment.” As the class 
becomes more skilful in absorbing and retaining the material 
of its reading, reproductive portions of compositions may be 
discarded, to be replaced by compliance with more exacting 
demands enlisting critical judgment. By the end of the 
ninth year a pupil should be able to cite what he likes and 
then explain why he likes it. His reasons will be the reasons 
of a child, of course, but they can spring from adequate 
knowledge, be logically arranged, clearly expressed, properly 
arranged, and sensibly punctuated. 
Make composition supplement study of literature.— 
In the plan broadly outlined in the preceding paragraphs, 
there is no intention that the two kinds of writing shall be 
regularly alternated or evenly balanced. There are certain 
terms in high school in which emphasis is placed upon a 
certain form of discourse. With the study of the essay 
there should be much expository writing. The interests of 
pupils will furnish enough personal sides; literary criticism 
will spring from class study and reading. In the term in 
which speeches are placed, argumentative material should 
be written (even if the delivery be oral) based on outside 
interests in current topics, local and larger movements, and
-P-A-G-E-235
ABILITY TO WRITE 227 
on the issues aroused by the addresses analyzed in class. 
When narration is stressed there will be an embarrassment 
of riches. The wild flights of unballasted imagination may 
be charted by the combination of originality with fact. Read 
or relate to the pupils a story up to a certain point. Let 
them write the conclusion. Suggest unwritten portions of 
books they are reading. Let them write later adventures of 
characters who pass from stories. Let them write sequels. 
Let them amplify sentences or short paragraphs. Let them 
supply probable and possible explanations behind short 
newspaper articles. Read to them Bonnie George Campbell 
and let them account for his disappearance, either in prose or 
verse, or first in prose, then in verse. Lest you consider such 
devices unsuited to actual writing, recall that Longfellow 
constructed Evangeline from a story related to him and 
Hawthorne. There are justifications in the realm of litera- 
ture for all the preceding. How frequently has The Mystery 
of Edwin Drood been finished? Mr. Kipling wrote two 
endings to The Light That Failed. Miss Zona Gale wrote 
several last acts to her play, Miss Lulu Bett. Sir Harry 
Johnston has written long novels around characters from 
Mrs. Warren’s Profession by Mr. G. Bernard Shaw, and from 
Our Mutual Friend and Dombey and Son by Dickens. 
Utilize dramatization in composition.—One of the most 
productive of school projects uses this kind of creative 
writing based upon material already existent. Dramatiza- 
tion of literary selections may incorporate long passages of 
conversation “‘lifted” from the author’s pages, but seldom 
will the dramatized version carry much of the material as 
originally composed. Under the guidance of a teacher who 
knows the technique of dramatics, these exercises may grow 
into valuable projects of large scope and deep significance. 
Adaptation is capable of bringing into operation a dozen 
phases of composition, from the consideration of a large mass
-P-A-G-E-236
228 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
of discourse to the final revision of spoken lines, from which 
phrases may be deleted, because, as pupils should learn, a 
person can indicate much by the way he speaks or acts, and 
so needs fewer words. 
Utilize cooperation and projects in composition.—Com- 
binations of socialized and project units may be devised to 
enlist varied or continued composition. Analysis of a single 
topic into a score of themes will provide a definite task for 
every pupil. A large committee, say the entire class, may 
outline the project and assign or allot sections. Other 
committees may decide upon questions of length, inclusion, 
mutually exclusive boundaries, duplications, illustrations, 
references, tables of contents, indexes, etc. Such work need 
not be limited to earlier classes in which younger pupils are 
more amenable to the required organization than are older 
ones in later years. The resultant compositions may reach 
the dignity of a printed pamphlet or book, or become a 
typed work of reference in the school library. Historical, 
biographical, local, and racial subjects are always successful 
in arousing enthusiastic and productive effort in these forms 
of codperative writing. Literary aspects are not so easy to 
originate, yet pupils of a tenth year class, studying exposi- 
tion, considered all the different aspects of English covered 
in that term, chose small units or phases of the material, 
constructed outlines, wrote a section explaining that form 
of the semester’s work, read it to the class, then corrected, 
and finally made a clean copy for binding. The volume 
covered the books studied intensively, each item of supple- 
mentary reading, memorization, delivery of poems, current 
topics, making of outlines, oral composition, extemporaneous 
speeches before the class, composition, rhetoric, methods of 
study, methods of teaching, the preparation of this treatise 
itself, a table of contents, and an index. It grew to nearly 
two hundred manuscript pages, and became the guide of all 
 
-P-A-G-E-237
ABILITY TO WRITE 229 
teachers of that half-year in that school. One section of a 
senior class agreed to read connectedly around a topic from 
Shakespeare. The pupils were assigned Falstaff. Material 
was divided among them; some read biography, and history, 
and stage memoirs; others read Henry IV, Henry V, and 
Merry Wives of Windsor. One long composition in several 
different chirographies was handed to the instructor. An 
interesting volume on the best books read during the semester 
can easily be produced during the last three weeks of the 
school term. The importance of these specified topics is that 
they are closely related to the informative and literary con- 
tents of the course, much more so than history topics (which 
may be more properly treated in that department), nature 
and scientific topics (which may vivify the science classes), 
and pictures (which belong surely to the art room). Com- 
position will always have to take all knowledge for its prov- 
ince; it will never be able to relinquish its counterparts of 
Professor Teufelsdréckh’s encyclopedic mastery of “things 
in general” to become a narrowly specialized subject. 
Have pupils write for a body of readers.—Writing for 
readers is more patently a socialized procedure than it is a 
project. The change of motive is observable as soon as 
pupils realize that they are no longer writing for the distantly 
placed and severely critical teacher, or the engulfing waste 
basket, but for a reading public of their peers. Anything has 
been good enough for the marking machine, but boys and 
girls demur at reading their papers to their classmates except 
under pressure or encouragement. Interest in the paper of a 
classmate read aloud by the teacher awakens the questioning 
eyes, the whispers, and the pointed fingers of, ‘Who wrote 
it?” so that the curiosity had better be satisfied if the com- 
position is to be appreciated. Teacher’s praise is taken with 
a studied indifference or embarrassment; pupil approval is a 
genuine compliment. Pupil comment and help may be
-P-A-G-E-238
  230 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
obtained by the exchange of compositions with the direction 
that the reader may point out errors or chances for improve- 
ment if he sees them. If the reading public may be enlarged 
to include the entire student body the gain is immense. 
There is nothing else which displays careless writing, awk- 
ward sentences, and insufficient punctuation as does the 
cold outline of type. Compositions which stand this test 
without suffering are encouragements to youthful authors 
and models to others. If a regular class is responsible for 
the school paper, these warnings are made poignant by the 
teacher immediately; if a special class in journalism produces 
the paper, the stipulations for accuracy and form are even 
more rigidly enforced. If usual class compositions cannot be 
put into print, the next best test is to have several typed. 
In the close proximity of the words, inelegancies which the 
more spread out handwriting never shows leap into promi- 
nence before the author’s eyes. These inelegancies include 
needless repetitions, overlapping sentences, absence of clear 
punctuation, short detached sentences, abrupt endings, 
ambiguous phrases, and mystifying emphasis. 
Teach pupils to write good letters.—The most. easily 
motivated form of composition is in letter writing. This 
exercise, in all grades, may be a highly animated one or a 
deadly bore. Every person experiences stretches when he 
wilfully and wofully refuses to write letters, after which will 
come a desire to chat with friends, and an entire morning or 
evening will be spent delightfully at the desk. In school, the 
teacher must endeavor to re-create that desire to communi- 
cate with some one. Here again is the place to encourage the 
use of the perpendicular pronoun. It is not for nothing that 
every person spells his name for himself with a capital 
letter. (Your name for yourself is not the name you write 
upon a check; you call yourself, ‘‘I”’.) In one class a teacher 
announced that she had intended to have the pupils write
-P-A-G-E-239
ABILITY TO WRITE 231 
to the member of the Board of City Aldermen. Only one in 
the group of thirty knew his name. What could ninth year 
pupils have to say to a busy politician? This thought must 
have entered her head, for she continued that she had 
changed her plan, and would ask them to write to some 
friend. In an instant the class had been transformed. Here 
was something they could do, something they wanted to do. 
The teacher improved her assignment, they were to choose 
real persons, and then they could explain the use of the 
paper upon which they were writing by telling that the letter 
was being written in school, or they might copy it, and mail 
it. One boy—pupils are always literal minded—asked if he 
might write to his brother who was out of town. A girl 
asked if she might write to a relative in England. So prolific 
did the correspondents become that the papers, unfinished at 
the end of the period, were taken home, to be returned the 
next day completed. A good letter is really nothing more 
than a familiar personal essay. Why not make it the natural 
approach to this form of composition? Let the pupil carry 
over to the essay the conception that he is merely talking on 
paper to an interested sympathetic listener, exactly as he 
does in a letter. The essay need not be any more formal, any 
more dressed-up than the good letter. Let it be stated con- 
versely, the good letter need not be any less carefully written 
than the essay, its grammar need not be less correct, its 
sentences need not be less complete, its phrases need not be 
more slovenly, its punctuation more careless, its paragraphs 
more rare, its periods more difficult to distinguish from 
dashes. Should not the teacher when he receives an espe- 
cially interesting letter read parts of it to his classes? He 
will by this prove to them that what he expects them to do is 
not merely a scholastic requirement, that it guides men and 
women in actual correspondence. Letters on folded sheets 
of paper will make better impressions than “model” letters
-P-A-G-E-240
  232 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
read from printed collections. A letter is a letter—not a 
passage in a bound book. Published letters always seem 
unreal unless the reader forgets their present form; and often 
published correspondence of great personages seems beyond 
the range of school boys and girls. 
Have pupils attempt to write short stories—The two 
steps in composition just detailed are intended to bridge the 
gap between school and actuality. This gap may be spanned 
at other places by the proper presentation of the writing of 
short stories. General indulgence in magazines has familiar- 
ized pupils with the form as a product of absorbing interest. 
Attention to the form has been won before the teacher pre- 
sents it as an exercise in composition. As good short stories 
depend for interest upon both plot and expression, and the 
latter cannot be indulged in until the first has been decided, 
the teacher will have to discuss plot and structure before 
actual writing can begin. “The easiest method is to show 
how a plot may be constructed backwards. Have pupils 
consciously plan in that manner.!~Let them know where 
they are going before they start. , Have the outlines so con- 
structed discussed either in class or in conference.tvA varia- 
tion in planning may be tried by having pupils suggest an 
initial situation or incident and the conclusion, and outline 
the links in the development between the two. The follow- 
ing are pupils’ plans. 
Marie Alice Simpson of Muskogee has recently arrived at her 
aunt’s mansion in New York. Her ultra-modern cousin Guinivere 
has with great superiority informed her that in New York a girl need 
merely select the man whom she wishes—and he is hers. 
James Harvy McAllister, Ph. D., president of all sorts of clubs,

There are discussions concerning the wedding. 
The analogous exercise of reading or telling a story up to a 
certain point, then having the pupils finish it has already been 
described. If any one of the devices here set forth is listed in 
the textbook, the teacher will be wise to use that specific 
one only once. He should make out a long list of equivalents 
for successive classes, or he should omit that single device in 
successive terms. 
With what attitude shall composition be read?—A 
beginner learns to write by writing; he improves by eliminat- 
ing his errors and duplicating his excellences, and by assuring 
himself in his methods of securing effects. This is a truism, 
of course; the pedagogical problem is in the application of 
these facts to classroom practice. How shall the pupil 
eliminate his errors? How shall he recognize his excellences? 
How shall he know which methods secure effects? First of 
all and most important the teacher must be able to detect 
them instantaneously. He must himself have served a 
rigorous apprenticeship in writing. He must never hesitate 
concerning errors. He must fix upon the awkward expression 
unerringly. He must know instantly what may be bettered. 
If a pupil writes, ‘Perhaps you wish to paint color and sun- 
light. They are inseparable and Color is as much a fact as 
drawing a value, and the color-sense can be developed,”’ he 
must be able in a few rapid strokes to show where the trouble 
lies and start the author on the right track for correcting such
-P-A-G-E-242
  234 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
expression. He must have eyesight to stand the strain of 
reading some hundred compositions each week, for the once 
paraded direction that papers need only be written, not 
necessarily read by the instructor, does not produce con- 
scientious teaching. He must be able to mark quickly and 
accurately. He must be able to grade according to his own 
standards, those of the school, or some stabilized scale.* 
Quite as important as these, he must be able to scent the 
germs of improvement, the flashes of excellence, the indica- 
tions of increased power, of wider grasp, of keener thought, 
for all of which he must show appreciation in order that they 
may reappear and grow into habit or instinct. He must 
know how the effect has been secured, when the pupil may 
have stumbled upon it, and he must show the fortunate 
youth how to repeat it. 
Best results will be forthcoming in compositions as in ali 
kinds of school work when the interest of the pupils is aroused, 
when their codperation is successfully enlisted, when the 
irksomeness of drudgery is removed, when pleasant purpose- 
ful intention replaces the fulfilling of an imposed task. But 
the millenium is not yet. Work of pupils in school, like work 
in the great world, must be judged, appraised, and marked. 
Reading and marking compositions.—The chief annoy- 
ance in reading papers is the time required. This dis- 
advantage is felt mainly by those who are so slow in reading 
that they waste both time and energy in covering a task 
for which half the period and effort should suffice. Teachers 
should train themselves to be rapid readers; it is part of their 
equipment. Care at the beginning of each term will famil- 
iarize their eyes with the various handwritings, knowledge 
of pupils will guide them in their search for errors and 
excellences, sureness of touch, and quickness in placing the 
symbols of correction and criticism will reduce the sense of 
1¥For Tests, Scales, Measurements, see page 360.  
-P-A-G-E-243
  ABILITY TO WRITE 235 
labor. If a teacher meets the following sentence at the be- 
ginning of a paragraph, but does not recognize at once the six 
things to mark in it, he will always be complaining about the 
deadly grind of marking compositions. 
The three essential facts about the British 
are, Courage, Fairness and Silence. 
The first line of every paragraph should be indented; 
there should be no comma after are; there should be no 
capitals in courage, fairness, silence; there should be a comma 
before and. Such facts concerning writing can be made as 
definite as the facts in history, algebra, geography, and 
physics. The teacher should insist on accuracy in all such 
details as a concomitant of fluency, not as something apart 
from it, to be added later according to laws of chance. Who 
was it declared that pupils punctuate as though they scat- 
tered the marks over the paper from a salt shaker? One 
pupil who used too many commas was advised that when he 
was in doubt he should refrain. He stoutly maintained to his 
next instructor that he had been told never to insert a comma. 
Punctuation is not, in the main, a result of idiosyneracy, but 
a logical system based on common sense. Its aspects can be 
divided by degrees of difficulty into essentials for each term; 
what is more encouraging, they can be mastered. Once 
decided, they should be maintained and met. Papers may 
be rated according to any of the many scales for determining 
the levels reached by classes. In intervals of the checking up 
of these scorings, teachers will have to use systems of marking 
papers in order to show how compositions may be improved. 
The standardized scale is a measure of attainment, not a 
pedagogic device. Markings, to be of help to the teacher in 
instructive processes and an aid to the pupil in self-develop- 
ment, must be devised to serve these ends not mediately 
but immediately. 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  236 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
Why proofreaders’ marks are not entirely satisfactory.— 
Nearly all textbooks of composition print proofreaders’ 
marks, and teachers frequently use them in correcting 
papers. Only a few, however, of these highly specialized 
symbols serve the two purposes of marking. Proofreaders’ 
marks have a quite definite aim—the production of perfect 
copy for a correcting typesetter. They do not touch style 
or rhetorical effectiveness. The difference between this 
purpose and the purposes of classroom markings is apparent 
at once. Teachers’ marks seldom aim to make the copy 
correct; they aim to show the pupil how to make it correct, 
how to avoid a similar error in future, and how to improve 
his composition in all respects. Proofreaders’ marks are 
applied to printed sheets; teachers’ marks to longhand 
manuscript, not even typoscript. If a word is misspelled, 
the proofreader spells it correctly. This may be exactly the 
wrong method to induce a boy to learn to spell. If a punctua- 
tion mark is omitted, the proofreader inserts the correct one. 
This may be exactly the wrong thing to do to teach a hasty 
girl to pay some attention to the sense of what she writes. 
A proofreader never merely calls attention to an error, he 
corrects it. A teacher usually should not correct an error; 
he should call attention to it. When the proofreader knows 
how the text should read, he revises it without adding a query 
sign; when a teacher knows that the text may be improved, 
he usually merely adds his query, expecting the pupil to 
apply an underlying principle of writing, coherence, or clear- 
ness, to make the correction himself. If every high school 
pupil were destined to write for print, he should learn how 
to correct proof; as he indulges in composition for the 
mental response he should be practised in some other scheme. 
Do not duplicate marks.—Teachers often mark by 
underlining within the line itself the presence of error, then 
indicate in the left hand margin the kind of error. A short
-P-A-G-E-245
  ABILITY TO WRITE 237 
line is intended to show exactly where the error occurs, the 
abbreviation in the margin is to make the pupil think. 
While this system is quite widely used, there are two objec- 
tions to it, both of which are justifications for assertions that 
marking compositions consumes too much time. The first 
objection is that as the margin is on the left side of the paper, 
the hand bearing the pencil crosses the writing, thereby 
hiding the material on the lines and preventing the eye from 
reading farther as the mark is being made. A teacher should 
not be forced to pause in reading while the mark is being put 
down. The attempt to secure margins on the right hand 
side of the page is never very successful. The second objec- 
tion to this system, the one which further indicates the 
time taken in applying it, is that every error is marked twice. 
Under the misspelled word a line is drawn, in the margin 
the letter S is written; under a space a line is drawn, in the 
margin the letter P is placed; under a sentence a line is 
drawn, or around it brackets are placed, in the margin U 
is written; under a word a line is drawn, in the margin the 
abbreviation C is written. Errors in capitalization are 
indicated twice. The marginal space of the line may con- 
tain three or four symbols referring to errors within the 
writing on that single line. 
A suggested scheme of marks.—The most expeditious 
scheme is one which requires the indication of an error only 
once, which is clear to the pupil, which is easily mastered by 
both teacher and writer, which suggests corrections in some 
instances and definitely shows them in others. All the 
marks should be capable of rapid transcription on the 
material itself, so that the place of application may not be 
misunderstood, and also so that there shall be no awkward 
interruption of reading. Abbreviations from other systems 
may be adopted, or an entirely new set devised. All the 
teachers in one system should use the same mark for the
-P-A-G-E-246
  
238 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOI. 
same thing. Marks made in colored ink or pencil are notice- 
able under a rapid glance. Pencil marks on writing in ink, 
and the opposite, are easy to detect. Even pencil marks on 
writing in pencil, and ink on ink are easily seen as they do 
not correspond in form and position with the pupil’s writing. 
Pupil errors fall into a few easily recognized groups. 
Capitalization: draw a short slanting line through the 
incorrect form. If the written letter is a small one, this 
indicates that it should be a capital. If it is a capital, it 
should be a small letter. There is no mistaking this mark. 
Misspelling: Draw a line around a misspelled word. 
This does not obscure any of the letters as the pupil wrote 
them. If the word represents a good attempt but is one 
beyond the pupil’s ability, draw the line, but indicate the 
correct spelling. 
Diction: If a better word or phrase can be used for the one 
written, draw a line under it. For instance, the pupil wrote 
shows up; draw a line under the phrase to induce the pupil 
to think of exposes, displays, and exhibits. 
Clearness: If a word or phrase is not clear, or is in- 
correctly used (both result in the same kind of confusion) 
draw a line under it and place a question mark after the 
term. 
Paragraphs: Paragraph and indentation errors should 
be marked by , {J ? and No 4. 
Punctuation: Places where punctuation marks and 
apostrophes are absent, or where they are wrongly used 
should be inclosed in circles. This marking shows the exact 
condition in which the pupil left the space; it allows no 
chance for objection because some colored mark by the 
teacher has obscured the pupil’s script. It does not supply 
the punctuation, but makes the pupil see the error and the 
reason for the correction. 
As the foregoing are the most frequent errors made by
-P-A-G-E-247
  ABILITY TO WRITE 239 
pupils the marks are simple, distinct, and easily made. Less 
frequent errors may be marked less summarily. 
Transpositions may be correctly marked by the straight 
lines: | | | or for series by small figures 3, 1, 2s 
over terms, phrases, or clauses. Entire sentences and para- 
graphs may be moved by leading lines and arrows. Matter 
which should be omitted should have a line drawn through 
it. Gaps between sentences and paragraphs may be labeled 
with the term “Break?” 
If all these marks do not produce unity and coherence, 
write abbreviations of these words across the faulty pas- 
sages. If a pupil repeats a word or phrase several times on a 
page, draw lines around it each time, then connect these 
ellipses. The point to be gathered will be quite clear to the 
writer. Use the same device for similar sounds or con- 
structions. 
Write good and excellent across worthy portions, so that 
the pupil will see exactly what is best, and so you can find 
these passages quickly if you wish to read them or comment 
on them to the class. Add notes and general comments at 
the end of the paper, so that the pupils will have to look 
that far to find them. They may then notice all the marks 
before they reach the end. Make these comments definite 
and pointed. The following are copied from compositions 
returned to pupils by several different teachers.

Your title is Out of Luck; the conclusion tells of good fortune. 
Your synopsis of the story is excellent. Your criticisms are not 
quite so good. 
Discriminate among errors.—Always be lenient towards 
the error which results from a good attempt; be increasingly 
severe towards the repeated error which results from careless- 
ness. The pupil who writes Grigg for the music composer’s 
name deserves credit; the name should be corrected and 
nothing taken from the grade. The pupil who always mis- 
spells separate should be shown no quarter. An examination 
was returned to a senior with this at the top, 85—30 =55. 
She asked for an explanation, as the instructor foresaw she 
would. He said, “Not a single paragraph shows indentation, 
therefore your grade is below passing.” From then on, the 
first lines of her paragraphs were indented an inch. Leniency 
becomes a fault in some aspects of teaching. 
Return compositions with helpful comments.—Salutary 
lessons may be taught as well as time saved by refusing to 
read through papers which patently are below standard or 
which do not follow assignments or otherwise do not fill 
requirements. If the theme assigned is the pleasure of 
reading novels, and the second paragraph plunges into a 
discussion of poetry, the instructor should add a note, 
“You have departed from the theme; I read no further.” 
Another provocative comment is, “This paper is below the 
level of this grade. I did not read further than this.” A set 
of papers should be read not as soon as possible after being 
written, but as late as possible before being returned to the 
pupils. This late reading makes the comments by the teacher 
much more pertinent because they are based on a vivid 
recollection of details. If the day of return is a day for 
writing again, immediate help will accrue from both com-

ments and marks. Pupils should be led to ask explanations 
of the marks rather than of the grade. The correct answer 
to the usual question, ‘Why did I get a six on my paper?” 
is, “That is what the composition is worth.” The pupil 
who inquires, “If I had made these two paragraphs one, 
wouldn’t it have been too long?” invites constructive 
criticism. 
James G. Blaine was right, “Accuracy and elegance can 
only be had at the end of a pen.” But every teacher of 
English knows that this truth was uttered a long time ago 
by a greater man, for Francis Bacon declared that “writing 
maketh an exact man.”

CHAPTER X 
ABILITY TO SPEAK 
Increasing importance of speech.—The implications and 
direct asserations made in several of the statements at the 
beginning of the preceding chapter on ability to write may 
be carried over to this consideration of the ability to speak. 
The world at large has developed a new consciousness of the 
power of the spoken word in both detailed business relation- 
ships and broad social movements. Short telephone mes- 
sages, quiet tense discussions across tables in boards of 
directors’ meetings, and speeches before tens of thousands 
are being increasingly judged by standards of worth of in- 
formation and meaning of the message. There are still 
outmoded specimens and backwoods eruptions of empty 
oratorical bombast and deceiving spread-eagleism of which 
really educated persons should take no notice or of which 
they should feel ashamed. The halls of the highest legis- 
lative assemblies are not free from reprehensible exhibitions, 
but educators who in the phrase of George Meredith are 
“plowing to make a better world” should treat them with 
silence or the unobtrusive condemnation which they deserve. 
Life changes rapidly; educational subjects and methods must 
change with it; thus schools must provide for developing 
ability to speak. 
Teachers should speak well——The teacher who must 
adjust himself to this portion of his work should first scruti- 
nize his own speech. Do teachers speak easily and convinc- 
ingly before audiences, their own classes, for instance? Why 
is it that at conventions of teachers, contributions dealing 
243
-P-A-G-E-252
  244 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
with instruction in speaking are likely to be papers read? 
Why are after-dinner addresses such bores that a highly 
diverting comedy is able to produce its most hilarious effect 
by depicting a banquet? Is the charge that children’s voices 
are rendered loud and harsh by demands of inattentive 
teachers to “Speak louder” founded on facts? Many a 
teacher should modulate his voice into something more 
pleasant than the schoolroom tone. If a great deal of 
education depends on imitation, we can only hope that 
where voices are concerned, pupils will be immune from 
some of their mentors. Neither sex has a monopoly of the 
raucousness of the so-called American voice. 
Specimens of careless errors.—As every teacher should 
scrutinize his speech to improve its tone and pitch, so should 
he examine it for personal errors and inaccuracies. Teachers 
who drill on agreement of antecedent and pronoun, who 
would never make the error in writing, ask, “Did anyone 
copy this in their notebook?” Teachers who insist that 
pupils avoid like between two verbs insert it in their own 
remarks. The a is almost as usual in what kind of person 
from the lips of teachers as from those of pupils. Ié don’t 
seems to disturb very few school administrators and teachers, 
when they say it themselves. Yet these persons are not 
likely to reproduce these expressions when they write. 
Faults of pronunciation are legion among teachers of English 
supposed to be models to learners; not uncertainties regarding 
new or unusual words such as apotheosis, cantonment, psy- 
chiatrist, psychiatric, xylophone, but mispronunciations of 
such words as joust, livelong, bade, satyr, archipelago. A study 
of teachers’ phraseology and vocabulary would offer in- 
tensely interesting material for a basis of a study of the style 
of oral composition in classrooms. Self-improvement is the 
first duty of the teacher of speech. 
It is perfectly possible, however, that a person develop a
-P-A-G-E-253
ABILITY TO SPEAK 245 
beautiful voice, stabilize his pronunciation, increase his 
vocabulary, and in spite of all remain a poor speaker with 
resultant hesitation and even fear because of lack of practice. 
Even when this has been provided the end is not reached, for 
to be a good speaker, the persort “must have something to 
say worth hearing. It were better for both adult and pupil 
to realize that silence is better than meaningless speech. 
Special teacher.—Whether the school shall engage a 
special teacher for training in speech depends upon too many 
factors to be discussed here. More systems which cannot 
consider such an arrangement should remember that the 
school aim of speech training is not to develop specialists in 
oratory or elocution, but ordinary citizens who should possess 
some facility and power in using their native or acquired 
tongue. We do not expect them by the time they are grad- 
uated to surpass in ability their teachers, or to express it 
conversely, we expect every high school teacher to remain 
the superior of his pupils in power and attainment. 
Every teacher of English should be a teacher of speech.— 
While a certain term or year may in high school be utilized 
for particular emphasis upon speech and practice in speaking, 
every English class should provide for instruction and 
exercise. These dual aspects should be offered from the 
time pupils enter school until they leave. At first, emphasis 
should be placed upon practice rather than instruction, later 
the definite but never too rigidly formal instruction may be 
increased in amount. The first and repeated approach 
through all exercises should be natural. As was suggested 
in the exercise of composition, the natural thing to do in 
inducing pupils to speak is to arouse in them the desire to 
tell something to others. The desire, while it should be 
aroused, is not enough to enable either pupil or adult to 
speak well, not even clearly. Ask a cook how she makes a 
particular dessert. Will she not say, “I can’t tell you
-P-A-G-E-254
  
  246 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
exactly, but come into the kitchen next Saturday and 
I'll show you”? Ability to perform and knowledge alone 
do not equip persons for effective speech. A teacher of 
backward boys aroused in them the desire to communicate 
information by saying that a visitor was a Frenchman who 
could understand English but did not know the form of a 
baseball field. The explanations were far below the urge to 
speak. One boy said the field was a kind of triangle, he 
even drew it on the board; another had no idea of why it was 
ealled a diamond; a third did not know the length of the 
base lines. If you still doubt whether expression is remote 
from knowledge of processes, ask a boy to explain clearly why 
a pitched ball curves, exactly how to use a certain stroke in 
swimming, or ask a girl to explain how to hemstitch. Has 
not the necessity of speaking before a class done more to train 
facility in teachers than all the antecedent advice they 
received? 
Beginning exercises in speech.—The foregoing indicates 
that in school prime consideration shall be given to the 
matter of speeches rather than the manner of speaking. In 
beginning exercises every offering by a pupil, every attempt, 
should be accepted. In it should be sought and found the 
germinal element from which all later growth is to spring. 
It may be difficult to find, but the teacher must search for it, 
comment upon it, commend it, and arrange for its reappear- 
ance. Self-reliance must be allowed to take root before its 
branches are too closely cut back. If oral composition moves 
along with written, each may be impressed to help the other. 
The pupil may rapidly epitomize his paper for his classmates, 
sometimes before he writes it, sometimes later. ‘Talking 
through a theme” is an inestimable help in clarifying one’s 
own ideas. This is the sane basis of the pronouncement 
that all written compositions should be prepared first as 
oral ones, then written down after having been spoken. This
-P-A-G-E-255
  
ABILITY TO SPEAK 247 
practice of both forms of expression should be insisted upon 
in all cases. The interest of young persons is likely to wane 
if too long a time is spent upon a single unit. We know this 
is true in studying a literary selection; it is almost as true 
(not quite, because creative participation strengthens and 
prolongs enthusiasm) of pupil productions. 
Lengthen topical recitations into oral compositions.— 
Topical recitations may be easily turned into oral composi- 
tions, especially when they are reports upon narrative 
material which has been read or studied. Instead of the 
teacher’s constructing a series’ of questions in regular se- 
quence with which to quiz the class on five chapters of 
Ivanhoe, why should he not ask one girl to begin the relation 
of the events of that section, stopping her at a logical division, 
and asking another pupil to continue? Exactly as was 
outlined for written compositions, this kind of composition 
may be reduced in amount as soon as it has served its main 
purpose of making pupils realize that they must understand 
and retain what they read and showing how they may do 
this, and be replaced by critical and comparative comments 
based upon that knowledge. Properly prepared for and 
skilfully manipulated, this kind of class exercise will soon 
become informal class discussion, reproducing faithfully 
ithe literary and other discussions of real life. Then the 
spontaneously provided socialized recitation becomes a 
living thing, not a device elaborately but secretly planned 
iby the teacher. Up through the tenth year, such exercises 
hould be kept as informal as possible. The crystallization 
f natural evidences of sides, or differences of opinions always 
nds to formalize what should be kept as general and 
spontaneous or at least as unrestricted as possible. Debates 
the seventh and eighth years are weak imitations in name 
mly, being nothing like the regulated debate of mature years 
d formalized procedure. Expressions of personal opinion 
     
                                             
    
  
-P-A-G-E-256
248 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
or slight unassimilated reading is all they can be, is all they 
should be allowed to become. Grown-up men and women 
are puzzled by the intricacies of Robert’s Rules of Order; 
why allow children to be tortured by its hair-splitting steps 
of procedure? No wonder children are misled by such 
phrases as “laying a motion on the table” when chairmen 
of committees, having heard the ayes, say “All opposed, 
give the same sign,’”’ which is arrant nonsense, of course. 
Have speeches spring from both literature and pupils’ 
interests.—Through the various terms, then, there should 
be a division of topics for oral delivery between those spring- 
ing from the pupils’ personal interests, and those growing 
from the literature of the course. In both kinds, the first 
emphasis, as has already been stated, should be upon the 
speaker’s knowledge of the material being presented. Re- 
sumés of articles in current periodicals are likely to be“ spotty ” 
because pupils know no more of miscellaneous contemporary 
events than they do of past history. One girl hopelessly 
confused the political parties of modern France because she 
did not have enough historical background or critical appara- 
tus to make the magazine article clear to herself. A boy 
reporting on pearl buttons said that the discs were stamped 
from mussels found in the lower Mississippi. When ques- 
tioned about the word mussel, he explained it as the fleshy 
part of a fish. He had no knowledge of the hard shell or the 
finished article. Another boy attempting to reproduce a 
sports periodical article on game fishing showed that he did 
not know that a piscatorial fly is a manufactured article with 
no similarity to the summer house pest. All these and count- 
less others had fulfilled the requirement of choosing some 
rehashed article in the weekly and retelling it to others less 
interested than they because the entire class had probably 
read the same article or passed over it in their search through 
that same issue. The belief that pupils are interested in
-P-A-G-E-257
  
ABILITY TO SPEAK 249 
current events and know everything about them is not borne 
out by tests given at frequent intervals. Even so idolized a 
sport as baseball does not make lasting and accurate im- 
pressions upon their consciousness. For some, current 
events may serve as the beginnings of speeches before the 
class, yet while one boy will be anxious to talk about base 
stealing, another may prefer to explain a diver’s armor, or an 
old almanac clock; one girl may wish to recite from an ac- 
count of women elected to Congress while another would 
prefer to talk about her pet canaries. If of all these, those 
not dependent upon the magazine prove the most interesting, 
all the more credit is due those pupils, and all the better 
guide is proffered the teacher for succeeding exercises. 
Base the length of speeches upon outlines.—How long 
shall pupils be expected to talk? Any time less than two 
minutes seems too short in which to say anything worth 
hearing. First attempts should not be forced merely to fill 
time. Later appearances should be longer. Again, as in 
written composition, adequate preparation must be stressed. 
An outline is almost essential, whether it be kept on a paper 
to be consulted or in the brain to be followed. It is not an 
unproductive device to have the pupil write his outline upon 
the board. If it is to be for the speaker’s use only it may be 
written upon the rear board, so that he may refer to it as he 
faces the class. If it is to serve as a guide to the class for 
comments concerning his mastery of its entries and his ease 
in following its suggestions, it should be where the class may 
follow it easily, while the speaker may not see it. This 
practice has the corroboration of many college instructors 
who distribute before each term or class period a syllabus of 
the lecture or discussion. Certain institutions are marked by 
strict adherence to the rule of two sheets for every class 
hour, one the outline of the instruction, the second a bibliog- 
raphy. If first year pupils are shown not how ito lengthen 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
250 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
their speeches, but to improve them within limits of four 
minutes, seniors should be able to say much within ten or 
twelve minutes. They should be required to prove that they 
can. 
Use tact and delicacy in making corrections.—If speaking 
in the earlier terms in high school has been naturally devel- 
oped there will be less lost motion at the beginning of each 
term due to the strangeness of new teachers and classmates. 
When once ease of manner has been won, self-consciousness 
reduced, some fluency of speech developed, there should 
begin more strict insistence upon correction of details. At 
just this point the delicacy and tact of the teacher must be 
most in evidence. Children are not so resentful of correction 
of their speech as are adults (many of whom need it quite 
as much) but they are sensitive and easily discouraged. The 
best attitude for the teacher to show is one of sympathetic 
frankness without any great display of apology or disappoint- 
ment. He should know or learn quickly which criticisms 
may safely come from the pupils and which must be delivered 
by him. In allowing pupils’ comments he must prevent 
criticism from becoming fault finding, he must not allow it 
to deteriorate into discussion, or charge and retort, he must 
not permit it to get so far away from the point that no one 
remembers the original remark. He must not allow it to be 
hypercritical. Why shouldn’t a speaker say that a poet 
“dashed off a lyric”, a remark which a “nice” teacher’s pet 
jubilantly impaled in one class? 
When shall corrections be made?—The question, 
“When shall the correction of an error be made?” has pro- 
voked much discussion by educators, some maintaining that 
never while the pupil is speaking should he be required to 
listen to a correction or to include one. Certainly if a pupil 
(or a public speaker before a paying audience) does not make 
himself heard, there is little sense in informing him of it
-P-A-G-E-259
  
ABILITY TO SPEAK 251 
after he has finished, when a slight hint might have induced 
him to make his words carry. Supporters of the practice of 
waiting until the speech is finished ask how mature speakers 
would like to be interrupted, and corrected, at intervals, 
evidently forgetting that in real life that is exactly what 
occurs daily, and that one of the marks of an effective speaker 
is that in spite of iaterruptions and corrections he can con- 
tinue with his remarks to his intended conclusion. In all 
business and social intercourse speakers are continually 
corrected. It is true, the correction in a class should not 
be too obtrusive or sudden or explosive, nor should it be 
forced upon a pupil who displays uneasiness and fear. 
Offered as help towards improvement it will be welcomed. 
It should never descend into hectoring or badgering. It 
should cover only details which may be righted by a short 
direction. Frequently no spoken direction will be needed, 
a sign or look will suffice. In some rooms, when a speaker 
cannot be heard distinctly, pupils quietly stand, without in 
the slightest degree disconcerting the mumbling speaker. 
This seems a huge sign for what could be secured as well by a 
smaller one. If the pupils raised their hands, or placed them 
behind their ears, the same message could be conveyed to 
their mate. Pupils who put their hands behind them, in 
spite of the teacher’s explanation that only small children 
and old men do so, may be induced to let their arms hang 
naturally if the teacher at the rear of the room, unseen by 
the other pupils, holds out his hands awkwardly. If the 
pupil says, zt don’t, a mild doesn’t will lead him to go back to 
correct. The list of errors thus promptly corrected and 
assimilated by the speech habit of the pupil is a long one, 
covering all the grosser errors of speech. That practically 
all of them—from mispronounced inquiry to ungrammatical 
et—are heard by pupils from mature companions is an 
additional reason for attacking them as soon as they emerge.
-P-A-G-E-260
  
252 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
Later the other errors, not easily corrected during delivery, 
should be covered briefly. The cardinal rule is that what 
was good shall be definitely cited to serve as the incentive to 
self-improvement and as the basis for further training by 
the teacher. General criticism of this nature will touch 
others than the recent speaker. Care must be exercised that 
criticisms do not cover too much time. They must be 
definite, direct, and corrective. All criticisms and corrections 
should be aimed at the next appearance of the pupil. He 
will desire to put into his next speech the results of the 
preceding discussion. Pupils who prepared to speak desire to 
have their chance. Practice is more valuable to the pupil 
than sitting still listening. 
Keeping records of speeches.—Whether it take the place 
of oral criticism or be used to reinforce it, the follow- 
ing device is a help. The teacher should have several 
long narrow slips of paper, say two inches by eight. He 
should explain that he will make notes upon them, but a 
pupil must not be disturbed if he sees something being jotted 
down, for commendable details will be noted as well as 
defects. After a little manipulation the teacher will have no 
trouble in making these slips accurate records. At the top 
he should write the date, pupil’s name, and topic of the 
remarks in shortened form. Dividing the space below into 
three sections he should note in the first section, details to be 
corrected, in the second, points concerning material requiring 
any kind of comment, and in the third, things to be com- 
mended. If time prevents talking from these notes to the 
class, pupils may be allowed to see their slips. It is wisest to 
have them returned to the instructor, who keeps them during 
the entire term. At the end, some pupil sorts them by name, 
and then each package represents the record for the speeches 
of a single pupil, showing his range of topics, the frequency 
of his appearances, his errors, his interests, his creditable
-P-A-G-E-261
  
ABILITY TO SPEAK 253 
qualities, and most important of all, his improvement during 
that period. From such a record, much better than from a 
series of numerical grades or recollected impressions, the 
teacher can give a fair rating for the term. After the marks 
have been recorded, all the slips may be handed to the pupils. 
Suggested special course.—During the first two years or 
more in high school, training in speech may be more or less 
miscellaneous in content and exercises, because so much that 
is already in the entire curriculum may be submitted in its 
practice. The scientific boy will inject physics material, the 
mechanical boy an engineering project, the artistic girl an 
account of an art museum exhibition, the home-making girl a 
discussion of food calories, the future secretary a description 
of a dictaphone; a teacher should not be astonished if the 
mildest looking girl in the room recount her experience in an 
Indian Ocean typhoon. Through all the heterogeneity runs 
the vivifying purpose of training in fluency of speech and ease 
of manner. It becomes apparent, however, that at some 
point in the progress, there should be provided more closely 
articulated sequence, a restriction of methods of arrangement 
and delivery to those best adapted to quite effective speaking. 
Either term of the third or fourth year seems to be available 
for a half-year’s progressive and intensive work in public 
speaking. There is danger in delaying this course until the 
fourth year, for so few high schools require a fourth year of 
English that many pupils who most need its rigorous training 
would escape it. Those who most need such a course do 
not always elect it. Yet hundreds of schools do offer public 
speaking as a one term elective in the fourth year. The 
slightly better plan is to offer it as an elective in the third 
year, counting it as an equivalent of the more usual term 
work of English. Pupils not preparing to enter college would 
be quite safe in electing it, and if the course were properly 
balanced in content, even those preparing for college might
-P-A-G-E-262
  254 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
be allowed to offer it as part of the three required credits in 
English. Speeches by Burke, Lincoln, Washington, Macau- 
lay, Roosevelt, Mr. Wilson, are studied at some place in the 
course, (as discussed in Chapter VI). If they were concen- 
trated in one term, and around them were planned a con- 
tinuous course in public speaking, including some debating, 
each phase would contribute to the other. Pupils should 
realize that the speaker must be continually filling his mind 
with background and comparison, therefore the course in 
public speaking should require as much supplementary, 
cursory, and reference reading as any other unit in the 
curriculum. Some colleges have expressed their readiness to 
accept such a course as this as a part of the requirements in 
English for entrance to the Freshman class. 
Content of a one-term or one-year course.—Such a one- 
term or one-year course should include a consideration of 
the importance of speech in both school and later life, and 
the help derived from speech in business and social relation- 
ships and in mental development. The first speeches should 
be elementary criticisms of speeches recently heard by the 
pupils. These early exercises should be mainly for the pur- 
pose of removing awkwardness and hesitation. As these 
first exercises progress, there should be some attention to 
style, kinds and lengths of sentences, to kinds and value of 
words which constitute the spoken vocabularies of pupils. 
Then the study should touch the construction of speeches. 
Examples of introductions should show their purposes, so 
that later pupils aiming at similar purposes may reflect these 
models. Pupils, having chosen topics, should narrow them 
to particular themes, adapt them to the purpose of the 
speech and the interests of the class, determine method of 
introducing their themes, and present their original intro- 
ductions before the class. Conclusions should be studied in 
the same manner except that original conclusions cannot be
-P-A-G-E-263
    ABILITY TO SPEAK 255 
delivered until later, with finished short speeches. Not the 
least valuable portion of such study would come from learning 
how to secure material from observation, interview, and 
reading. Short speeches should present material so secured. 
The next step is planning the speech by selecting, dis- 
carding, and arranging material. As in written compositions, 
the first step is the rough draft in which the entries are 
manipulated until there emerges the final outline or brief. 
Then should follow many exercises of speaking from the 
brief or from memory of the brief. Well constructed ad- 
dresses may be based on exposition, with its many various 
methods of dealing with different material. Arrived at 
argument, the pupils should be trained first in the single 
speech, to practise methods of reasoning and proving. These 
methods of reasoning may be based on a study of short 
excerpts from models, chosen always because of their applica- 
tion to pupils’ material. Methods of refutation may be 
introduced by general discussions which bring out different 
views, and therefore prepare for debate. These at first 
should be rather informal as the class splits into sides. As 
much time as possible may be spent in more formal debates. 
At all appropriate times there should be speeches on special 
occasions: nominating speech, speech of presentation, accept- 
ance, commemoration, congratulation, political speeches, 
after-dinner speeches. It should always be borne in mind 
that pupils are to be graded not only upon their final ability, 
but upon the rate and degree of their improvement during 
the term or year. 
Utilize all class material for speech training.—If the 
curriculum does not provide a special teacher of speech who 
has pupils once a week in a given term, or a unified term’s 
work in speaking, every teacher of English should become a 
developer of good speech. The inertia due to lack of interest 
cannot be excused as a similar feeling towards written com-
-P-A-G-E-264
  256 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
position may be explained. Seldom expressed, but doubtless 
in the minds of many who consider composition practice as 
dreary drudgery is this answer to the repeated declaration 
that teachers should be able to write well: “Not at all; we 
have no desire to be known as authors; we shall continue to 
train pupils to write well, but there is absolutely no need of 
our doing what we pretend to teach.” So far as speech is 
concerned there is no teacher who would dare to assert, 
“T have no desire to be known as a speaker of good English. 
I shall continue to teach reading, poetry, speaking, dramat- 
ics, although I can never produce a remark or deliver a 
speech which any one will listen to and remember.’ The 
composition ability of the classroom teacher seldom passes 
under the examining eyes of administrators, but his speech 
is open to examination at the shortest casual meeting. There 
is no hardship imposed in insisting that teachers of English 
shall be able to use their speech easily, correctly, gracefully, 
and interestingly. Desire for the same power may be planted 
in the minds of pupils. While better results will be secured 
when definite recognition is granted to this power, not a 
little may be accomplished in the regular course of study. 
The teacher need only be keenly desirous of seeing improve- 
ment, patient in his processes, and ingenious in devising 
schemes for oral exercises covering the allotment which must 
be completed. Resourcefulness will turn the slightest hint 
into a large opportunity. If the pupils are doing a rote 
task, as memorizing poems, of course its test should be 
the reproduction of the words, but will it not be feasible to 
omit some of the recitations and have pupils give in their 
own words as an explanation to the class what the poet said 
in the stanzas? Poems are not less interesting because of 
vivid paraphrase and comment. Should it not be impossible 
for a tenth year pupil to declare that until that term he had 
never believed that poetry meant anything? This exercise

need not be restricted to verse. To be able to transmit to an 
audience the gist of literary material is a valuable accomplish- 
ment. 
Analogous to this is the practice of having the pupil 
memorize and deliver his own composition. As a device for 
uniting composition and oral practice, this may have some 
merits, but experience with it has not been productive of 
anticipated results. Pupils read their own compositions 
better than they recite them. There seems to be an evapora- 
tion of enthusiasm and spontaneity between writing and 
speaking; the freshness is worn off; the paper has become 
trite and ordinary to its author, association has dulled 
approval, and familiarity has unfortunately, perhaps justly, 
bred contempt. There is the same difference between this 
kind of presentation and spontaneous speaking as between 
reading and conversation. You know how a person’s tone 
and manner change when he passes from telling you about 
some article in the newspaper to reading a selection from it. 
It takes some dramatic power to inject life and naturalness 
into the delivery of a written paper, and this kind of dramatic 
attempt is so likely to be unnatural and uncomfortable to a 
youth that the halting results of simultaneous thinking are 
more to be desired than the finished artificiality of memorized 
dulness. 
Have pupils speak from notes.—Except for those pass- 
ages composed by great literary masters in prose and verse, 
where the form has made the thought lasting, there is some 
better method than memorizing. This introduces the third 
general kind of training that any such course should include. 
This is talking from notes or an outline. The habit of some 
of the most effective speakers enforces this practice. Even if 
every publicspeaker did dispense with all aids to accuracy, pu- 
pils should still be allowed to use them, for they are merely 
speakers in the making. In practical life this manipulation 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
258 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
of the framework of discourse saves time and effort for 
business man and clergyman, and for the lawyer who must 
talk from his typed or printed brief, or the suggested brief of 
his case. 
Lead pupils to think as they speak.—These three already 
listed—memorization of passages worth memorizing, repeat- 
‘ing of one’s own composition, speaking from notes and out- 
lines—are but stepping-stones to higher things. No teacher 
who is interested in this phase of English training will be 
satisfied until he has induced his pupils to think as they speak. 
This is the only oral composition worth being called by the 
name. In producing this ability, in stimulating this power, 
in awakening this latent accomplishment, teachers will have 
done the best thing permitted them. Unless the pupil 
becomes a great author, who will read what he writes? No 
great number, unless he develop advertising writing. Of 
what real value is any knowledge unless it can be communi- 
cated? A man may have locked within himself enough 
history and political science to explain any situation in which 
our nation may be, but of what value is that knowledge, 
what satisfaction can it be to its possessor, unless he gener- 
ously or proudly communicates it to the rest of his benighted 
fellow-citizens and, more than that, communicates it so 
interestingly and forcefully that they accept it as true? 
Is the claim stated extravagantly when it is said that in 
this aspect of teaching all education and all training are 
focused? Is there any phase of life, business, professional, 
or social, that minimizes spoken communication? 
Utilize portions of surveys for speech exercises.— 
Pupils who become fairly adept at speaking from minds 
stored with interesting information and opinions should 
never be allowed to neglect the skill once attained. In the 
later terms it may appear difficult to adapt to the ends 
previously sought the matter of, say, a survey of English
-P-A-G-E-267
  ABILITY TO SPEAK 259 
literature. Yet even this at first sight unpromising history 
may be enlivened by exercises in speaking based on pupils’ 
interests. The possibility first occurred in classes in which 
seniors were reciting the facts of the beginnings of the modern 
English novel. It dawned upon the teacher that practically 
none of these pupils would ever read a novel by Richardson 
or Smollett; it would be safe to predict that nearly all who 
would receive degrees from college would evade even a 
masterpiece by Fielding. It was easy to give a rapid test on 
the facts concerning the rise of the new form in fiction, after 
which on a day’s notice the pupils spoke on some of the fol- 
lowing topics: 
Beginning of the novel 
The best novel I ever read 
The worst 
The most instructive 
The most exaggerating 
Novel reading is a waste of time 
Novel reading is not a waste of time 
Novels of adventure, plot, character 
American novels 
French, Spanish, Italian, Russian novels 
Recent novels 
Dramatized novels 
Novels of local interest 
When the class arrived at the next section of literary de- 
velopment which bore few points of contact with their 
lives original speeches were substituted for the recitations 
on The Edinburgh Review, The Quarterly, and Blackwood’s. 
The speeches produced at this time justified the experiment, 
so it was continued whenever occasion offered, and in later 
years it was begun even earlier with always better results. 
The magazine topics led interest and curiosity into many 
fascinating fields, from which were brought back knowledge 
as well as diversion.

As the nineteenth century is so rich in poetry, pupils had 
read much of it before they met the history and criticism 
of itin the textbook. The speeches delivered on the following
-P-A-G-E-269
ABILITY TO SPEAK 261 
topics were, therefore, retrospective in treatment. One 
refreshing thing about the remarks was their frankness. 
One boy maintained quite well his interpretation of the first 
topic, which he discussed according to the theme that so far 
as he was concerned, poetry need not exist at all. 
Why poetry exists 
Poetry worth reading 
Poetry is not worth reading 
The first poem I cared for 
Poetry should be studied 
Poetry should not be studied 
Modern poetry 
Free verse 
The present interest in poetry 
Great poems 
Kinds of poetry 
Poetry of nature, of action, of feeling 
Attempts to write poetry 
Some of the results of this group of topics are extremely 
interesting. Three boys recounted how they had met in 
early life The Lady of the Lake, The Children’s Hour, and 
Hiawatha. The playmate of a girl had died just before she 
was taught Thanatopsis. Its lines comforted her at night. 
The sound of the words and the lulling effect of the rhythm 
rather than the words had first made a girl care for The Raven. 
Kipling and Service were most popular with the boys, but 
one girl paid high tribute to Kipling. One boy declared that 
The Charge of the Light Brigade had overcome his prejudice 
to verse. Even Chaucer was praised. One girl divided her 
early enthusiasm between Tennyson and Moore. One pupil 
singled out Tam O’ Shanter, one Idylls of the King, one 
Crossing the Bar, one parts of In Memoriam, one Lucille, one 
The Ode on a Grecian Urn, and three the Iliad and the 
Odyssey. The best feature of all these speeches was that 
although they were on topics closely or remotely connected
-P-A-G-E-270
  
262 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
with literature, pupils felt no necessity of saying what the 
instructor expected them to say. They had not recently 
studied these selections with him, he had not assigned them 
as material for study or review; pupils made their own free 
choices. Nor had there been a period of learning what some 
editor thought about the masterpieces. Pupils had been 
induced, perhaps forced, to do some thinking about their 
own reading, their own impressions, their own opinions. 
Judged from the level of adult intelligence many of the 
remarks were disappointingly obvious and trite, but they had 
the saving graces of genuineness and reasoning. The taste 
of seventeen is hardly likely to be the esthetic taste of forty. 
The pupil who praised Lucille could not be expected to know 
that it is a pet abomination of persons with taste; she did not 
convert her teacher, but she did impress him with the honesty 
of effort which made her speak so well. Judged by qualita- 
tive standards the remarks were not brilliant; judged by 
sympathetic interest as attainments and promises, they were 
enlightening and gratifying. 
Have the English classes furnish speakers for the school. 
—No department of English should be satisfied with itself 
until it can furnish at short notice any number of boy and 
girl speakers to deliver to the student body messages, an- 
nouncements, plans, proposals which emanate from either 
the pupils’ actions or the principal’s suggestions. Student 
rallies for championship games need not be prevailingly 
changes rung upon the two phrases of “put pep behind your 
team” and “get out there and root.” Such trumped-up 
cameraderie from an auditorium stage should defeat its own 
purpose. When it comes from the lips of teacher or adminis- 
trator it is recognized and appraised at once by pupils as a 
deliberate attempt to talk down to them. When it comes 
from lips of a pupil chosen to address them, they may not be 
able to analyze their feeling concerning it, they may not be} 
 
-P-A-G-E-271
ABILITY TO SPEAK 263 
able to explain how it might have been done better, but let 
them hear the better specimen and they will recognize the 
difference instantly. Teachers of English will not be develop- 
ing ability to speak unless they aid in reducing the one kind 
and in fostering the other. 
Strive for codperation within the department.—The 
preceding sentence suggests the strongest force in producing 
commendable speech—co6peration. In every English class- 
room, from the first term of high school until the last, every 
teacher should consistently strive for improvement. Other 
departments may help, but the problem is primarily that of 
the teachers of English. There is little improvement, however, 
if one teacher is insistent upon clear tones, correct pronuncia- 
tions, complete sentences, connected discourse in recitations, 
while the next accepts an Indian grunt in answer to a ques- 
tion. Keeping even pace with the development in written 
composition and the familiarity with literature, should be 
carefully planned, progressively exacting provisions for train- 
ing in speech.

CHAPTER XI 
AUXILIARIES AND CORRELATIONS 
Influence of the teacher outside the classroom.—The 
amount of time and energy spent by loyal teachers of English 
throughout the United States in supplementing the regular 
work of the classroom is simply incalculable. Primarily, of 
course, a teacher should be judged by his success in classroom 
instruction, but English topics are so frequently intangible 
and difficult of evaluation that countless examples may be 
cited of teachers whose classroom success depends upon 
influence or activity outside the room’s four walls. Many an 
instructor has secured astonishing results in written com- 
position because pupils have known that editors and pub- 
lishers have been willing to purchase what he has written. 
Another instructor has induced a love of drama as a literary 
form because she could elucidate it from her observations of 
good plays in all parts of America and Europe. Another 
secures a devoted following in journalism because he has 
written good copy at high pressure. 
Several universities have recognized this powerful in- 
fluence aside from classroom instruction and have added to 
their personnel authors of assured distinction whose duties 
are undefined but whose opportunities are boundless. High 
schools can hardly hope to imitate this growing practice, but 
they can at least attempt to reduce the number of class 
periods required of those whose peculiar aptitudes and 
powers are utilized in extra-curricular activities. Many high 
schools assign five or six classes each day to the teacher of 
English and expect him to present several plays during a 
264 ,
-P-A-G-E-273
  AUXILIARIES AND CORRELATIONS 265 
year. They add to the regular school day the oversight of a 
fortnightly school newspaper, which entails not only the 
planning that has to be done in odd times such as the long 
stretches of sleepless nights, but the reading and correcting of 
thousands of words of manuscript every week. The distribu- 
tion and assignments of such extra duties are matters of 
management and administration. Teachers of English are 
so alive to the classroom reflection of this kind of participa- 
tion that they willingly—frequently too willingly—assume 
responsibilities because of real and fancied opportunities. In 
systems where it is apparent or believed that advancement 
depends upon these outside aids, there is no difficulty in 
having them performed. 
Providing extra time for classes.—The best aid to im- 
provement in English is more attention to English. Many 
junior high schools in the first half of the seventh year 
prescribe ten periods a week. The only regret is that this 
allotment is not more nearly the regulation and that it is not 
followed in succeeding grades. Extra time may be secured if 
a foreign language is offered. Those who do not elect it may 
be given extra classes in English. This is not exactly an 
elective, but it does furnish opportunity for excellent in- 
struction. The teachers of these sections should be allowed 
as much freedom as equipment makes possible, and given as 
much aid as intelligent supervision can secure in time, so 
that interesting experiments and productive devices may 
be inaugurated. Work in such classes may parallel the 
regular course, deepening it or enriching it, or it may strike 
off into untried paths and unread sections. Its progress and 
_ its results should be carefully preserved and discussed, for 
out of these should come improvements to be incorporated 
in the regular course of study. The lower grades with their. 
flexibility and experimental status in departmentalization 
offer better chances for such additions than do the later
-P-A-G-E-274
  266 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
years, yet even here all work need not be stereotyped. A 
course of study in the following chapter provides that in the 
tenth and eleventh years commercial pupils shall follow a 
different course from the regular one. Might not a pupil 
take both? Some schools reénforce the regular grades by 
specialized attention to voice training, speaking exercises, 
debating, journalism, drama. An excellent device for pupils 
whose work is dropping below or behind is to invite them to 
attend a second class of the same grade so that they cover 
the work or certain phases of it twice. In this case invitation 
is better than compulsion, for it puts responsibility upon the 
pupil, and makes him decide for himself the comparative 
value of novelty of interest and acquisition of power and 
knowledge. The pupil may say to the advising teacher, 
“Sit twice a day through a recitation on exposition? I 
guess not.”” The teacher may reply, “As you choose. I’m 
suggesting this not to make the work more interesting, but 
to help you master the material of this term’s work. It 
should also show you how to study better next term and so 
remove risks from your English grades. Not all the work will 
be repetition, but you may attend the class or not, as you 
choose.” When presented thus, many more pupils than you 
anticipate will respond, although never enough to reduce all 
probable failures to zero. 
The library.—There is no disputing the assertion that 
the greatest auxiliary the department of English has is the 
library. Whether the collection of books be housed in the 
school building or in a separate structure on the school 
grounds where it may serve the community as well, or across 
the street, or just around the corner, it may contribute in 
countless ways. In a surprising number of instances city 
libraries of the present have developed from early collections 
begun by boards of education. In every instance of this or 
separate institution, they have met almost adequately every
-P-A-G-E-275
  AUXILIARIES AND CORRELATIONS 267 
demand made upon them by school needs. ‘Almost ade- 
quately,” for it seems never possible to have quite enough 
copies of certain books required by teachers of English. If 
the September request for sixty copies of Tom Brown’s School 
Days is met, the February request is certain to be for ninety. 
Supply and administration are determined by local cendi- 
tions, but some systems which are well arranged can be out- 
lined. 
The library should be in the building or on the school 
grounds. It should be administered by a professional 
librarian and trained assistants, not by teachers during their 
free periods and before and after school. Whether the books 
shall be purchased by the board of education or the library 
directors is a moot question. The librarians declare that 
certain books are school books primarily and should be 
bought with school funds. Likewise other books are used 
only by pupils; as they have no wide circulation among 
adults they should be bought with school funds. On the 
other hand, school administrators contend that a book’s a 
book, and that the six thousand volumes which serve ninety- 
_ three thousand users a year in one high school constitute as 
real a library as a separately housed collection. They add 
that schools are permanent institutions, the books they use 
in large numbers are likely to be used as continuously as 
best selling fiction, so that the library need not fear the 
accumulation of waste paper. It is as serviceable, they 
reason, to have three hundred copies of Vanity Fair dis- 
tributed among five high schools as to buy one hundred 
twelve copies of Main Street and one hundred eleven copies 
of Riders of the Purple Sage. A compromise works very well. 
Distinctly classroom material purchased by the board of 
education, is administered by the library employees in exactly 
the same manner as other kinds of books placed on the 
shelves by the library board. 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
  268 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
Trained librarians should instruct classes.—Professional 
librarians in schools should be available for classroom 
instruction in the use of the library, the care of books, the 
handling of books, classification, preparation of lists, etc. 
Departments of English and library staffs have codperated in 
preparing topics to be covered in various terms, as the use 
of current periodicals in a term devoted to public speaking. 
Their codperative assistance goes farthest in developing 
habits of general and continued reading, for these can carry 
over the influence from the school branch library to the 
separately housed branches or the main library. In the 
compilation of lists and the assembling of exhibits the library 
workers provide practical helps for teachers of English. 
Literary societies.—At the sight of the term “literary 
societies” teachers will recall the Friday afternoon programs 
of their childhood, or accounts from their elders, as in Mr. 
Hamlin Garland’s A Son of the Middle Border. The scope 
and purposes of these longlived voluntary organizations 
have changed with the passing years, but their lineal descend- 
ants still flourish with features directly traceable to their 
progenitors. As the so-called literary society—boys’ or 
girls’ or mixed—is frequently less literary than anything else 
it may be, many teachers of English hesitate or refuse to 
sponsor its activities. Its old-fashioned declamations and 
prize speaking contests smack of a bygone age. In spite of 
all the ridicule of its rhetorical bombast, its strained effects, 
its jejune pronouncements, its smug dignity, it has been and 
may still be made a help to English instruction, even when 
the organization is sponsored by a teacher of physics or 
commercial law. Many of the practices and levels of these 
societies have been censured. Their speech making ideals 
have not always been the worthiest, nor have their formal- 
ized debates progressed much beyond sporting contests 
regulated by hidebound restrictions, yet they are capable
-P-A-G-E-277
  AUXILIARIES AND CORRELATIONS 269 
of being developed into powerful agencies for good in school 
affairs and interesting supplements to the English classes. 
Under stimulation from alert, forceful adult direction, de- 
clamations may be replaced by original speeches, inflated 
oratory may be trained into appeal to intellect, and debate 
for points may come closer to William Penn’s ideal: “In all 
debates let truth be thy aim, not victory, or an unjust 
interest, an endeavor to gain, rather than to expose thy 
antagonist.” 
It has been said that some of the best student speaking in 
the world is heard in the clubs of English universities where 
something worth listening to said in a convincing manner 
wins respect rather than a close adherence to the restrictions 
of rebuttal speeches. The literary society may profitably be 
transformed into a discussion club. If it seems that such a 
loosening of stipulations relinquishes all the advantages, the 
explanation of the newer ideals lies in the common sense of 
the sponsor and the level of intelligent contributions.} The 
meetings may have all the advantages of debate without the 
deadening formalism; there may be more novelty and inter- 
est, more fluency and spontaneity injected into exercises. 
For general discussion upon any theme or topic there may be 
just as careful preparation as for debate, while there may be 
more chance for rapid thinking and strategic rearrangement 
of ideas upon the’field.| Every phase of this may be directly 
supplemental to classroom English. The effect may not be 
apparent in strictly literary phases of the study. The boy 
who does not care for poetry may still not like it, but his 
extemporaneous speeches should make him more able to 
reason out his reactions and explain them more fully and 
accurately—not a small accomplishment for a high school 
boy. 
Such exercises may contribute to more phases of school 
life than the English classes. The principal of the school
-P-A-G-E-278
  270 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
may need five pupils to present a series of suggestions to the 
entire student body. Why should he not feel able to ask this 
organization to assume responsibility for this, allot the 
speakers who will cover the themes adequately, and impress 
them upon their fellow pupils? He should be relieved of the 
embarrassment of hearing dignified topics driven home by 
such perorations as, ‘‘ Now, fellows, this is our job. It’s jest 
up to us to put this thing over, so let’s put our shoulder to 
the wheel and go over the top a hundred percent strong. Are 
you for it? Well, then don’t lay down on the job.” These 
remarks are not effective from the mouths of high school boys 
and girls. 
Besides the many opportunities afforded by school needs, 
there are sure to be public contests for honors and prizes. 
Fewer and fewer of these are for set speeches, more and more 
are dependent upon general knowledge of a broad topic 
turned in some definite direction. In schools where a few of 
these contests have been inaugurated, pupil comments show 
that the large audiences are developing critical sense of the 
right kind. If one of the general topics is agriculture, and the 
boy who prepares in it is assigned the theme, “‘The develop- 
ment of agriculture by means of irrigation,” but confines 
his remarks to a description of farming before irrigation was 
introduced, his hearers will clearly recognize that he does not 
touch his purpose. Every teacher of English can seize upon 
specimens from which to point salutary lessons. 
If you are fortunate enough to be asked to help organize 
a literary society you will be able to formulate its policies and 
aims from the beginning. If you inherit one, you will have to 
proceed slowly and tactfully to change what should be 
modified and to eradicate what should not be continued. 
If the inauguration of a society is the result of a suggestion 
from teacher or principal, the future sponsor should have a 
clearly defined plan to present enthusiastically to the volun-
-P-A-G-E-279
  
AUXILIARIES AND CORRELATIONS 271 
teer members. If the pupils themselves ask for the society, 
the teacher should learn their ideas of its activities. The 
first principle should be one of democracy—any pupil desir- 
ing to belong and able to contribute should be eligible. There 
should be no aspect of “secret society” about member- 
ship. 
The society’s activity should be planned for a term or 
a year. It must offer participation and interest to all mem- 
bers. Successive programs of speeches, declamations, 
debates have this advantage—that they do enlist lively 
participation. They may follow a closely related sequence: 
affairs of the locality, its system of government as illustrated 
in life, its industrial opportunities and records, its history 
over a specified period, etc.; or they may vary with seasonal 
fitness: after Labor Day, topics of industrial interest; during 
the fall, sports, health, exercise, athletics; in November, 
topics based upon the origin and significance of Thanksgiving 
Day; later, those springing from Christmas and the turn of 
the year; even humor and jollity may be utilized; birthdays 
of Columbus, Lincoln, Washington; mid-year examinations; 
Memorial Day; Independence Day. Such a plan should not 
be repeated in successive years. A period of general history 
or local history may be distributed in the same manner. A 
group of leading men may be discussed. This plan may be 
made “literary” by choosing writers, perhaps according to 
birthdays, or sequence in history, or relation in works, or 
participation in a movement. A more nearly literary im- 
pulse may be added by basing the activities upon a form, as 
the short story, the one-act play. This latter will allow even 
more novelty than the former, as specimens may be presented 
by the members. 
When the sponsor and the officers have arranged the plan, 
details should be entrusted to committees. Whenever needs 
and opportunities arise, the organization should be the agent
-P-A-G-E-280
  272 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
for memorable contributions to general school activities on 
such occasions as Shakespeare’s birth date. 
The great advantage of an organization of this kind is 
that its interests and performances are likely to be so varied 
that practically any pupil in school may become a participant. 
Writers’ clubs.—Fewer in number, perhaps because less 
“showy” in effect and requiring more manual labor in pro- 
duction, are writers’ clubs. Many girls’ literary societies dip 
into composition, frequently as demanded by critiques of 
programs or books, or to fulfil an assignment made by the 
president or the program committee to present to the mem- 
bership an original short story. A sponsor who foresees a 
long series of years with such a society may lay down a cycle 
of activities so that there may be profitable progression for 
the members and interest and variety for him. In this 
fortunate circumstance, individuality and originality are 
displayed. The following are recorded experiences: a study 
of the short story, The Best Short Stories of 1918, nineteenth 
century English poetry, history in United States fiction, 
St. Louis in literature, Philadelphia and vicinity in literature, 
translations from French and Spanish (the two foreign 
languages of this school), plays of Shakespeare not studied 
in class, the little theater movement. Manuscripts prepared 
by members of a writers’ club should be read aloud at meet- 
ings. Writing under these circumstances for a limited group 
has its drawbacks. At first the small number is sufficient 
for pupil purposes, but soon there mounts the rational 
ambition that one’s compositions shall be read by others. 
If the sponsor of the writing group can find an outlet for 
some of the manuscripts, he will have another great aid at 
his disposal for supplementing the English course. Public 
programs furnish some opportunities, but after all, composi- 
tion presupposes readers. Student writers serving apprentice- 
ship under masters (as Maupassant under Flaubert) hope
-P-A-G-E-281
  
AUXILIARIES AND CORRELATIONS 273 
that at some time their writings will appear in black type 
upon white pages. 
Writers’ clubs should be composed of pupils showing 
special aptitude as producers of interesting material. More 
than in the usual literary society will difference of ability 
be marked, yet if the sponsor can evolve a plan under which 
each pupil will be induced to do the kind of writing for which 
he is best suited, this appearance of inequality may be re- 
duced to the minimum. If the club can use a school publica- 
tion as an outlet, the tasks set by the adviser or program 
committee are almost definitely prescribed. If not, the chief 
difficulty will be in securing sustained motives for production. 
The following are suggestions: Develop the writing of 
verses both serious and humorous. Begin with couplets, 
pass to quatrains, then to double quatrains, then invite 
lyrics or ballads. Have parodies and burlesques written. 
As models read several specimens from the well-known 
anthologies: Lyra Elegantiarum by Locker-Lampson, Amer- 
ican Familiar Verse by Brander Matthews, A Book of Light 
Verse by R. M. Leonard, Vers de Société Anthology by Car- 
olyn Wells, The Little Book of Society Verse by Fuess and 
Stearns, A Little Book of Light Verse by Anthony C. Deane. 
Base assignments upon the practice of newspaper offices. 
Plan for short stories. An element of dignity may be secured 
for such a form of narration if some of the more imaginative 
pupils produce a series of related stories which form either a 
group of short stories, or a fairly long story of intimately 
related plot incidents. 
All the work produced in such a club must be read to the 
entire membership in open meetings. Unless this is done, 
interest will lag and effort will cease. 
School publications.—The best outlet in any school for 
student writing is in a local publication, either school mag- 
azine or newspaper. The continuous interest of these publica-
-P-A-G-E-282
  
274 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
tions to pupils is a source of never-ending wonder to mature 
observers. Notwithstanding the appearance in the daily 
newspaper of the report of the interscholastic games, the 
athletes and their friends are as interested in the pupil paper’s 
reports as though they were the first to appear. The school 
magazine, appearing monthly with a special graduation issue 
devoted to the outgoing seniors seems to be gradually re- 
linquishing its hold on pupil affection and having its place 
taken by the more frequent, less dignified journalistic sheet. 
‘The magazine may be the product of a select club, an elective 
group, a special class, or a staff appointed by the faculty. 
In its pages should appear the best original and critical 
compositions of the entire school. Especially fortunate are 
those members of the English classes who, while they are in 
the first or second years are asked to write, or whose work is 
submitted to the editors, for nothing fixes the precepts 
of accurate and interesting writing so well as the rigidity and 
frigidity of clear type. The pages of a school periodical 
should welcome the best the school can produce, whether it 
be the outcome of assigned classroom exercises or the original- 
ity of some free-lance. In school life, pupils seem to have 
the most carefree, happy-go-lucky, humorous times of their 
lives, yet seldom is there humor in a school paper which equals 
the pupils’ response to supposedly humorous happenings in 
class periods. Real humor and comedy are not early ac- 
complishments, yet surely teachers should be able to develop 
some writers of short verses and humorous articles so that 
editors need not depend upon paste, scissors, and exchanges. 
More exacting in writing because produced at shorter 
notice, but less formal because less critical and literary is the 
newspaper, usually weekly or fortnightly. The organizations 
which produce these are as various as the schools in which 
they appear. They may come from regularly organized 
classes in journalism of one term or a year, or from clubs, or 
 
-P-A-G-E-283
  AUXILIARIES AND CORRELATIONS 275 
from appointed staff and reporters. In every case they are 
likely to be modeled upon precepts from college classes in 
journalism in which instructors and sponsors studied, upon 
newspapers for which these teachers have worked, or upon 
some representative daily of the city. Contributions to 
papers should put into practice the teachings of the class- 
room. The style sheet of the staff should agree with the 
textbook of the teachers. Nearly every newspaper has its 
own regulations, but these special rules a beginner will learn 
when he starts to work for his livelihood. The dangers of 
the rapid composition imposed by going to press are not too 
serious for-pupils to meet. Once understood, they contribute 
directly to advance in thinking, in arrangement, in clearness 
and accuracy of statement. These details are the basis of 
the advantages of writing for school newspapers. Perhaps 
the teacher of English will have to despair of reforming the 
sports page, which is always an imitation of the supposed racy 
cleverness of the highly esteemed sporting experts, but he 
may be able to indicate that Yep! repeated five times on 
the front page is not humorous, but slovenly. As a model 
and as an incentive for excellence in written composition 
the school newspaper is a decided aid to the teacher of Eng- 
lish. 
* Just when the services of the faculty adviser shall stop 
is a delicate question. Shall he merely instruct in the writing 
of heads, or shall he act as a professional editor, and when 
headlines are not as good as possible, discard the pupil’s 
attempt and substitute something of his own? Shall he do 
the same thing with copy? In other words, shall the paper 
be really a pupil product, or the evidence of the instructor’s 
trained skill? Either procedure has its supporting reasons, 
for the better work of the sponsor may be defended as the 
model for amateurs; while the crude attempt of the pupil 
may be the greatest satisfaction to him and the surest incen- 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
  276 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
tive to others. The group—class or organization—engaged 
in school journalism need not spend all its time in hasty 
writing. A great amount of study and investigation will 
supplement regular English instruction. The vocational 
value of such training and practice is a stimulus to good 
work in all phases of written composition. 
Magazine clubs.—Discussion clubs already described 
are likely to lean to the settling of all current problems which 
arise. More literary than these may be the purpose of a 
magazine club. The pupils belonging to it may elect to read 
several magazines, report upon them, or to confine their 
attention to a few. Methods of treatment, kinds of reports, 
results, aims, are too various to outline, but an alert teacher 
under whom such a group might meet could easily provide 
projects of variety and value. As this is being written a great 
deal of discussion is appearing in magazines concerning the 
American novel, with such related topics as romanticism 
and realism, sectional literature, log-rolling and back- 
scratching, methods of treatment, philosophies of life, 
rampant young intellectuals, and plodding old fogies. Would 
not some of these provide material for investigations and 
reports in a magazine club? This attention to contemporary 
affairs—literary, social, international—should provide lively 
contrasts for the more staid and significant provisions of the 
course in English. 
Material included in magazines is always a reflection of 
public interest. A magazine club might follow the fluctuat- 
ing waves of popular concern as reflected in periodicals during 
ayear. The influence of the teachings of Ghandi would have 
served admirably for general discussions based on articles in 
several magazines. This interest was followed by the ex- 
planations of the acute phases of civil war in Ireland. Next 
eame the accounts and prophecies concerning the strikes in 
the United States. The use of all such material in a magazine
-P-A-G-E-285
  
AUXILIARIES AND CORRELATIONS 277 
club may be timely, for monthly and weekly periodicals 
are almost like daily newspapers in contemporaneousness. 
Although magazine clubs will tend always to become 
discussion clubs of current events, they may be drawn into 
the consideration of real literature because so many acknowl- 
edged masters allow their books to appear first in serial 
form. There is always the danger, of course, that stories 
prepared for adult readers will be unsuited to discussion by 
high school pupils. 
Finally, magazine verse should be read and discussed. 
This attention will reinforce the precepts of the classroom and 
show pupils that poetry did not cease to be written at about 
the time the last class textbook was published. 
Dramatics.—Teachers in one large city high school who 
were asked what outside activity aided classroom instruction 
in English most were almost unanimous in citing the dramatic 
club. The reason for this is unquestionably the personality 
of its sponsor, her closeness to semi-professional dramatics, 
and a tradition of excellent productions in the past history of 
that school. It is an astonishing phenomenon that coincident 
with greater difficulty of seeing worthy acted drama, parallel 
with the consistent attendance at motion pictures, young 
persons should be throwing themselves whole heartedly into 
dramatic activities. Schools throughout the nation are 
reflecting a healthy participation in play production, a 
resurgence of dramatic interpretation, ascribed by many to 
the so-called little theater movement, by others to the 
attempt to interest localities in community projects. Schools 
are presenting better plays than ever before. They are 
demanding and reaching levels of acting, impressiveness of 
stage illusion, beauty of scenery, lighting, and costuming 
never dreamed of before. Educationally, these aspects of 
artistic endeavor have a wholesome effect upon both partici- 
pants and spectators. They may be utilized by the art, 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
  278 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
domestic science, and manual training departments, but here 
we are interested in their correlation with the English instruc- 
tion. 
It is a fact worth considering that nearly every master of 
literature in every period and nationality has been a drama- 
tist. The exceptions are few. The glory of Greek literature 
is largely dramatic. The most brilliant period in France 
bequeathed the plays of three writers. Elizabethan drama 
surpassed any other period of English literature. Yet schools 
have appeared to be hesitant in recognizing the literature of 
all these epochs for what it essentially is—drama to be 
acted. The plays of Shakespeare have been used for every 
purpose under the sun except to stimulate the emotions by 
means of character delineation and acted plot. Schools may 
now be slowly accomplishing a marked transformation of 
sentiment toward this high form of literary power. So far, 
classroom study of dramatic literature conforms to the usual 
practice of looking at the words upon a page, the mere direc- 
tions of a play, as Mr. William Gillette has keenly remarked. 
Dramatic clubs, no matter how crude their attempts may 
be, are bound to work changes. Pupils who still read plays 
will be helped by having seen some stage performances to 
vivify the characters and visualize the action. Conservatives 
may warn against the creation of exaggerated ego, yet this 
danger is not so great if the faculty director is as well devel- 
oped a personality as he should be before he is entrusted with 
the task of training pupil performers. Fortunately for his 
duties, he may reduce the arrogant to subdued réles, he may 
develop in a youth the ability to do the thing for which he is 
not temperamentally best fitted, he may be able to inspire 
confidence in the timid and hesitant. The faculty adviser of 
a dramatic organization may conduct his group in purely 
educational dramatics, being more interested in the results of 
the training than in finished performances before audiences.
-P-A-G-E-287
  AUXILIARIES AND CORRELATIONS 279 
Or he may follow the other procedure of aiming at the produc- 
tion of good plays, well acted and mounted before appreciative 
audiences. Undoubtedly this second purpose will always be 
the more popular with pupils. He may also wisely combine 
the two, making the first subsidiary to the second, or insisting 
that the second grow naturally from the first. In such a 
plan he has his fullest opportunity for permanent good. 
If a club is to study plays during a year its membership 
should include artists, designers, directors, as well as per- 
formers. Because of their manageable length, one-act plays 
will be chosen first by the teacher sponsoring the activities. 
Later, scenes from longer plays may be studied, cast, re- 
hearsed, and acted. If the membership justifies it, one short 
play should be entrusted to say three different pupil direc- 
tors and presented by three different casts. From these may 
be chosen a composite cast which may have the opportunity 
of acting before the student body or a part of it. The same 
device may be followed with a Shakespeare play or a modern 
drama. 
Once a term or once a year this society may offer a public 
performance. This is one of the best methods a high school 
can use for raising money. The unfortunate thing is that 
too frequently the money raised is devoted to buying uni- 
forms for a team or is added to a general fund in which it 
loses its identity entirely and from which it may be extracted 
to supply bushes for a hedge or a rug for the visitors’ room. 
These are worthy objects, of course, but rather distant from 
the department of English which is usually directly respon- 
sible for the drawing power of the performance. 
A different method of providing the school or class play 
may be followed. The director in this case must be an 
excellent judge of the potential capabilities of pupils. Having 
considered the senior class, he may decide upon the play to 
present. He will know also his stage equipment. If stage
-P-A-G-E-288
  280 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
space is small and scenery cumbersome to change, he will 
decide on a play requiring only one set. He may select his 
cast by ‘“try-outs” or appoint the performers. The organized 
class in regular meeting must give him authority to contract 
indebtedness which it will discharge. When the play is 
ready for view, it is presented at a dress rehearsal in the 
afternoon before the pupils of the school. In this way, all 
the pupils receive the benefit of worthy drama well acted. 
The evening performance is for those persons to whom the 
senior class has given tickets. If the class wishes to offer two 
performances, well and good, but not too many should be 
attempted because acting demands energy and young persons 
should be giving their best to the regular work of the school 
sessions. 
The best thing about such invitation performances is that 
all discussions of profits are eliminated. There are no after- 
remarks as to which class made the most money; the remarks 
are centered upon the play and its presentation. This 
method obviates the elaborate ticket-selling campaigns, with 
all their intricate accounting, the raucous advertising, the 
charges of extravagance in expenses. It does necessitate 
care and economy in planning, it induces astounding results 
of artistry upon scant means, it surrounds the enterprise 
with a gracious air of courtesy and entertainment to younger 
classes and invited guests. 
Pupils of lower grades who desire participation in drama- 
tization may be allowed to indulge their wishes, but many 
educators divert their enthusiasm to a modification of acting. 
Puppets and marionettes are the usual result of this manifes- 
tation. The dramatizations should be made by the pupils 
from literary masterpieces. In such projects, there are 
countless opportunities for originality and close correlation 
with classroom material. Likewise, there is always the 
need for assistance from other departments. Here thi    
   
         
   
                 
   
       
    
  
-P-A-G-E-289
AUXILIARIES AND CORRELATIONS 281 
teacher of English should have the generous coédperation of 
the art department to design sets and costumes, of the 
manual training department to build the stage and equip- 
ment, of the science department to install the lighting, and 
of the typing classes to prepare the scripts. Material entirely 
beyond the physical range of live performers may be at- 
tempted and projected by the “dolls.” Any person who has 
seen Thackeray’s The Rose and the Ring done by marionettes 
knows this. The Three Bears has been made convincing even 
by grade school children. 
Among the many devices evolved for the celebration of 
Better Speech Week none has meant more to the pupils 
themselves than some dramatic presentation of the moral 
lessons connoted by good speech. We have learned that 
the old morality plays were the proper forms for showing 
persons why they must be good. 
Pictures.—Every English department should have hun- 
dreds of pictures to illustrate the countless details of the 
material it asks pupils to read and study, Can a dictionary 
definition make a fourteen-year-old Russian boy see a cross- 
bow as quickly as a drawing? Can a pupil see in his mind’s 
eye a visor until he has seen with his physical eye a helmet? 
Is this not all the more necessary at the present time as he 
will have seen the trench hat of the Great War with which 
the knightly helmet and visor have no connection? Can a 
girl see any one in a gondola unless she has seen a picture of 
this strange craft? Examples might be listed to cover pages. 
Notice, however, that these are examples of detailed objects, 
not pictures of scenes and situations from literature. There 
is bound to come the time when the conscientious teacher 
will have to ask himself, “Shall I make the pupil see what. 
some artist has drawn, or shall I force him to stimulate his 
own imagination?” Has so-called visual education justified 
all the claims made forit? Can it be applied indiscriminately
-P-A-G-E-290
  282 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
to the study of literature as to the study of commercial geog- 
raphy or natural science? A pupil studying Silas Marner 
will be helped by seeing a picture of a hand loom, but does he 
need a picture of Nancy being helped from her horse by 
Godfrey, or Silas among the startled villagers at the Rain- 
bow? Pictures which particularize period costumes are 
decided helps in study and reading, but is not the pupil’s 
mental picture of the jolting Ichabod Crane as good as a pen 
and ink illustrator’s—may it not be better because it is his 
own? Views of localities, of scenery, of cities, of buildings 
are always helpful, though not infrequently quite unneces- 
sary. Lorna Doone is as powerful without exact geography 
as with it. For real appreciation of The Lady of the Lake 
there is no absolute need of a student map. 
What shall be the attitude of the department of English 
to motion pictures? Let the discussions in newspapers and 
magazines, the pronouncements of opponents and propon- 
ents of boards of censors, the remarks of patrons of com- 
mercial exhibitions answer. No matter what artistic effect 
is produced upon the screen, it is a different thing from what 
is embodied in the book. One is picture, the other is type. 
One depends on plastic forms, the other on successions of 
words. One shows, the other evokes. One is seen, the other 
is assimilated. One is make-believe, the other is reality. Few 
literary masterpieces seem to survive the process of filming 
without suffering a change into something new and strange. 
Of the possibilities of the motion picture as a supplement to 
other studies there is no question here. But is a literary 
masterpiece still a literary masterpiece after its medium has 
been changed from letters (words written or spoken) to 
feverishly shifting pictures? 
Assistance from other departments.—In one of the 
courses of study reproduced in the next chapter is the pro- 
vision that a paper prepared for the science department is to
-P-A-G-E-291
  AUXILIARIES AND CORRELATIONS 283 
be marked as an English composition. This is an admirable 
arrangement. An ideal one would result from the stipulation 
that every instructor in the school should always mark every 
paper as an exercise in English composition. The report of 
the English Departmental Commission (1921) on The 
Teaching of English in England reiterates frequently that 
every master should be a teacher of English because he is 
perforce a teacher in English. In some high schools there 
IS~the closest codperation between the departments of 
English and science. The instructors of English read papers 
on mosquitoes, chalk, clams, earthworms, radio outfits, 
wireless receiving, alternating currents, and dyestuffs. The 
pupils, knowing this, do not find repellant the assigned 
reading in Burroughs, Darwin, Huxley, Beebe, Fabre, 
Maeterlinck. Papers prepared for a different department 
need not be added burdens; they merely in certain weeks are 
accepted in place of usual compositions written for Eng- 
lish. \ 
A teacher of history might withhold from a boy a mark for 
an examination until the paper had been rewritten to be 
approved by his instructor in English. When the art teacher 
desires original drawings why should he not invite the pupils 
to select some line from a poem or play, some incident from 
a story in the regular English course to serve as the subject 
for illustration? Recently a high school girl explained quite 
interestingly why she had chosen to base a drawing upon 
“Camelot, a city of shadowy palaces,’”’ and a boy explained 
that he had discarded a line from Macbeth because he could 
get no color into a drawing of the three witches. A few 
questions made him wonder whether he could not really 
put yellows, greens, perhaps others into such an illustration. 
These pictures are not to be judged as were other illustrations 
in a preceding paragraph. Pupils’ drawings are the results 
of their imaginative interpretation of the author’s inten-
-P-A-G-E-292
  284 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
tions; they are not passive acceptances of another person’s 
graphic vision. 
Judge supplemental aids at their real value.—It is hardly 
necessary to repeat here the caution against accepting the 
supplemental aid as an equivalent for ability and knowledge 
in English. Plans drawn in the drafting room, models con- 
structed in the woodworking shop may aid the class in 
understanding the study in the English classroom, but the 
teacher, likely to be generous-hearted, should guard against a 
confusion of his task with that of the teacher of drawing or 
joinery. Literature is a form of expression, drawing is a 
form of expression, therefore, says the kind-hearted in- 
structor, drawing is literature, and a map shows mastery of 
English or understanding of a poem. This is neither logical 
nor psychological. A better instructional method results 
from a different kind of interdepartmental understanding. 
The pupil who draws well needs less time to fulfil more than 
adequately all the requirements of the art department. That 
leaves him time for extra effort in English assignments. The 
mathematically inclined boy finishes a half-hour’s set of 
problems in fifteen minutes; he then has an extra quarter- 
hour to revise a hurriedly finished outline for an oral com- 
position. 
“T have taken all knowledge for my province.”—All the 
foregoing are the easily accessible, small aids and coérdina- 
tions upon which the teacher of English may rely. But 
there are larger, more fascinating auxiliaries and correlations 
which he must be eager and alert to use. These are in every 
phase of life about him. The entire universe is ready for his 
use. If Bacon said, ‘I have taken all knowledge for my 
province,” he was merely anticipating by three centuries the 
modern teacher of English. He may impress his charges 
with his exact knowledge of colonial New England, but it 
will be unfortunate if they believe he lives only in that
-P-A-G-E-293
AUXILIARIES AND CORRELATIONS 285 
period. A teacher may be carried away with enthusiasm 
for illuminated medieval manuscripts, but she had better let 
her classes know that she reads recent productions. If a 
class is studying Milton and a daily paper cites him as a 
champion of individual liberty, the teacher should show the 
editorial to the pupils and say a word about Areopagitica. 
When a volume on Young Boswell appears in 1922, every 
class studying Johnson, Burke, Goldsmith, Macaulay, should 
be apprised of it. If Poe’s cottage at Fordham is mentioned 
in the magazines, every pupil in the United States who has 
read one of his poems or stories should have its power re- 
called to his mind. If a cartoon depicts a political candidate 
between Scylla and Charybdis every upper class should 
review in two minutes the narrow escapes of Odysseus. 
Encourage pupils to report on things in print which have been 
clear to them because of study or reading in an English class. 
Have short exercises of “That reminds me” of some detail 
learned in English. Contemporaneous mental alertness will 
enliven school periods and impress facts. Pupils will respond, 
and teachers’ capacities will widen. The years produce 
changes in all school subjects. Geometricians used to be 
content with saying that two triangles are equal when two 
sides and the included angle of one are equal to two sides 
and the included angle of the other. Now they say that two 
triangles are congruent when these conditions obtain. Teach- 
ers of typing must not insist toaay that a comma be placed at 
the end of every line in the address upon the envelope or in 
the business letter. Nor should teachers of English fail to 
take account of changes in the world about them as in the 
immediate material of their daily tasks. There are cultured 
persons outside the ranks of the teaching profession, there 
are good magazines besides the pedagogical reviews, there 
are theaters to patronize, books to read, topics to discuss, 
views to weigh, and judgments to modify. In so humble  
-P-A-G-E-294
  286 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
a matter as pronunciation there have been changes. Every 
agency and activity of life which can aid classroom instruc- 
tion—and practically every thing in life can be utilized— 
should be seized by the teacher of English to enliven his 
instruction and corroborate his precepts.

  CHAPTER XII 
COURSES OF STUDY 
The following pages contain partial reproductions of 
courses of study from high schools in various parts of the 
United States. Their entries illustrate certain details or 
principles directly related to the teaching of English. While 
some of them will serve as suggestive guides for the compila- 
tion of a course of study, they should be supplemented by 
many others for comparative study, and should be investi- 
gated for practicability and results. 
SPECIMEN ONE 
7B and 7A 
Oral and Written English 
ORAL COMPOSITION 
Drill on: 1. Connected talking in good, clear sentences. 2. Clear 
enunciation and natural tones. Read Sheridan’s discussion of the 
school-room voice. 3. Correct English. 4. Building up a vocab- 
ulary. 
For variety, the class may be organized into a club with one of 
the pupils presiding. The compositions may be given as one- 
minute talks. 
WRITTEN COMPOSITION 
Have written composition limited to a single paragraph, consist- 
ing of from five to seven sentences. Emphasize the “single-phase” 
idea. Work for sentence betterment. a. Variety in beginning 
sentences (first semester). b. Combining, expanding, and con- 
tracting sentences (second semester). ¢. Complex sentences 
(second semester).

Letter Writing 
(First Semester) 
Friendly Letters. Formal and Informal Invitations. 
(Second Semester) 
Business letters. (a) Application for a position. (b) Ordering 
goods. (c) Bills, checks, ete. 
Write on the blackboard directions for arrangement of letters. 
Discuss topic of letter in class. Make rough copy. Correct, put 
into proper form and copy. Have pupils read the best letters aloud, 
and class criticize them. Read and discuss model letters. 
Study letters written by well-known authors to children, espe- 
cially those by Roosevelt, Dickens, Phillips Brooks, Washington 
Irving. 
Outlines 
Drill on the outline as a help in composition. An outline may be 
made with several subtopics. Each pupil may be given one topic 
on which to write a paragraph. In this way the lesson may be 
codperative, and a class book written. 
Technical Grammar 
Some of the technical grammar that has always been taught has 
been eliminated, because it is of no practical use to the child. 
“Grammar that is not used is useless.” The work in grammar for 
this grade has been made as simple as possible, but these simple 
requirements must be mastered. Avoid all difficult and complicated 
sentences. The children should be able to identify all parts of 
speech. 
Study of Literature 
Poetry 
The pupils should have a thorough appreciation of five poems 
each semester, and should be able to recite from memory at least 
two of those studied. If desired, a part of the reading period may be 
devoted to this work. 
(First Semester) 
1. Columbus. 2. To a Waterfowl. 3. The Courtship of Miles

Alice of Old Vincennes. Austin, Colonial Stories. Cooper, The 
Spy, The Pilot. 
Home Reading 
Encourage home reading by the pupils. See that each pupil 
is supplied with a list of recommended books for this grade. These 
are printed on cards the size of a bookmark, and can be obtained 
from the principal of your building. 
Reading in Class 
I. Formal reading. Have pupils read aloud for the mechanics 
of reading. 
II. Reading for appreciation. Secure interest and enjoyment. 
Teacher herself should do a part of the reading, as an example for 
pupils. Certain stories to be read entirely by the teacher. Silent

reading, followed by discussion. In reading long stories, assign 
parts to be read at home. 
8B and 8A 
Oral and Written English 
ORAL COMPOSITION 
Emphasis should be placed on oral composition. ‘We talk 
more than we write.” Since oral composition is a preparation for 
written composition, oral discussion should precede the written. 
The debate. 
WRITTEN COMPOSITION 
Continue the work of the seventh grade in sentence betterment 
and improvement in choice of words. Encourage the use of a variety 
of connectives in order to avoid monotony and give smoothness to 
the paragraph. Use of the dictionary. Letter writing. Copying 
and dictation. 
Grammar 
The course in English grammar as outlined below contains the 
minimum essentials which must be mastered. In the elementary 
grades, only those technical facts are considered which assist in 
the development of sentence structure. As planned, the analysis 
of sentences and the more advanced phases of grammar are to be 
taken up in the ninth grade. 
Uses of nouns or pronouns not considered by sixth or seventh 
grades. 
Study of Literature 
Poetry. 
Pupils should have an appreciation of five poems each semester, 
and be able to recite from memory at least two of those studied. If 
desired, a part of the reading time may be devoted to this work.

Composition and Grammar 
ORAL COMPOSITION AND DISCUSSION 
At the option of the teacher, this work may be based on current 
topics presented in The Literary Digest. Topics such as recreations, 
nature, work of the world, peoples and places, historical tales, 
civic activities, literature, and art, afford a wide range of interests 
from which to select topics for discussions. The oral composition 
may be offered daily for ten minutes or weekly for fifty minutes. 
Reports may be formal or informal. 
WRITTEN COMPOSITION 
One composition assigned by the science teacher will be graded 
by the science teacher from the viewpoint of subject matter and 
by the English teacher with regard to rhetorical and grammatical

A rather unusual arrangement obtains in the following 
course, in which quite definite indications of amounts of 
work and time are set down. In the first two years all the 
literature studied is reserved for the second ten weeks of each 
term. Teachers who believe that the opening days of each 
new grade should be made attractive to pupils under an 
unknown instructor will have objections to offer to such a 
plan. On the other hand, if difficult technical study and 
drill are to be covered, should they not be attacked when both 
leader and class are fresh? Again, the accurate information 
and practice secured in this first half may be made to func- 
tion continually during the study of literature. Likewise, if 
ten weeks are not enough to instill these principles the time 
may be lengthened, for it is easier to telescope the time 
allotted to reading. Such a division provides for the separa- 
tion of composition and literature without making the unit 
of time so long as an entire term. While provisions for the 
preceding are concrete, the paragraph on home reading is 
extremely general.

A graduate of the high school should meet the following require- 
ments: 
A. He should have ability: 
1. To write original compositions whether they be nar- 
ration, description, exposition, or simple argument— 
that are logically planned and so developed as to be 
conspicuous for unity and coherence. The spelling 
and grammar should be correct and the punctuation 
adequate. 
2. To plan coherently and give fluently a five-minute
-P-A-G-E-313
  
COURSES OF STUDY 305 
talk on some practical subject on which he has had 
time to think. 
8. To write any common type of business or social letter 
with technical accuracy and with simplicity and 
directness. 
4, To find and organize material for an original composi- 
tion of 1000 words, upon business, political, histor- 
ical, literary, or scientific subjects. 
5. To read aloud, at sight, with intelligence and clear 
enunciation anything from a newspaper to a classic of 
ordinary difficulty. 
6. To tell why a piece of literature (like a standard novel, 
or essay, or a lyric poem, such as may be found in 
The Golden Treasury) has merit. 
7. To quote either orally or in writing 200 lines (not 
necessarily consecutive) of classics, prose or poetry. 
B. He should have a working knowledge of the course of both 
English and American literature, of their great names and 
great books, and of some of the most significant influences 
in history and life that have molded such literature. 
C. In addition to regular prescribed work in literature he 
should have read (from a list of books for home reading, 
prepared for high schools by the English council, or from 
the college-entrance requirement list) four good books of 
short stories, five good novels, three good plays, two 
good biographies, two good books of history or travel. 
In cities where a large number of high schools comprise 
the system, it is manifestly unjust even if possible to pre- 
scribe a definite course of study for all of them. As a means 
to good teaching the entire membership of several depart- 
ments of English should have a voice in the determination of 
the material to be included. A wide range of suitable titles 
should be decided upon by representative participation 
through committees, the members of which are continually 
subject to referendum if not recall. When this comprehen- 
sive course has been shaped, the teachers of a single school 
should select from it, subject always to its stipulations and
-P-A-G-E-314
  306 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
provisions, the detailed entries for their own work. Such 
choice should not be haphazard, but dependent upon under- 
lying principles of unity, progression, and aims. The term’s 
work in any school must represent the equivalent of the same 
term in every other school of the system. Here a skeleton- 
ized outline of such a general list is followed by the scheme 
followed by one high school of the large city for which this 
course is provided.

    If a school differentiates in curriculums for general or 
academic and commercial pupils, the course in English may 
reflect this distinction as soon as the selections separate. 
The following course represents this cleavage at the begin- 
ning of the second year. Business English is then provided 
until the end of the third year of high school. It does not 
appear in the senior year, patently because only three years 
of English are required and commercial course pupils are not 
supposed to elect it. In many schools with highly developed 
training as preparation for business, it is impossible, because 
of credit requirements, for such a pupil to secure English in 
his last year, even though he knows he is not doomed to} 
serve forever as a bookkeeper, but may hope to mingle with] 
business men of culture and refinement.

A course of study may present only the barest outlines of 
the work offered, or it may rival the textbook itself in its 
attempt to achieve completeness. Some courses may be 
printed upon a single sheet of large letter paper, others fill 
half a hundred printed pages upon which are not only titles 
of books, chapters in basal texts, grammatical details, but 
sentences illustrative of common errors of speech and their 
corrections. This second form becomes almost a textbook 
in itself; in it teachers may find almost everything they need 
to present. The example printed after this paragraph shows 
the shortest entries possible to indicate the work attempted.

  818 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
A fairly definite scheme is shown in the following stipula- 
tions for two semesters. The suggestions for the study 
under each heading are definite enough to secure results 
from every teacher, even the most inexperienced and the 
least conforming, yet they are not so restricting that they 
prevent enrichment or originality. More definite still is the 
allotment of points to the various books for home reading, in 
which every pupil must earn at least ten points each semester. 
An extra credit of one point is granted for promptness and 
excellence. (Query: Why add a point? Is this any better 
than deducting for tardiness? Should not the regular work 
be done upon stipulated dates for the regular credit?)

The course for the first two years of senior high school 
reproduced below this paragraph illustrates definiteness of 
results to be obtained and time to be consumed. Some of 
the first year outside reading is prescribed, some left to 
selections from an adequate but not too long list. In the 
second year, the prescription varies from this. The pupil is 
prevented from indulging in the rapid consumption of fiction 
by being required to choose two-thirds of his reading from 
non-fiction material. Notice the frequency of examinations 
on units just finished. Every pupil is forced to take account 
of his standing frequently during each year.

Similar to allotment in units of five or ten weeks, or by 
calendar dates of beginning and finishing a phase of study, 
but much more inelastic, is the plan of assigning by single 
weeks. This does not permit much leeway for the gathering 
up of loose ends, for the amplification or condensation of 
study according to differences among classes, nor does it 
allow much opportunity for the initiative of the individual 
teacher. When one reads the entries in such a course of 
study, one wonders whether what is displayed upon the 
paper is actually carried into classroom practice. If such a 
result is obtained, it must depend upon close supervision or 
departmental conferences. Such a course should be—very 
likely always is—the result of long experimentation in a single 
school.

Specialization of English for vocational purposes has bee 
checked by the feeling that there is danger in deciding to 
early upon life careers, and that there is no need for teachin, 
specialized business practice and the vocabulary of busine: 
in the high school years. Should such a technical term a:
-P-A-G-E-335
  COURSES OF STUDY 327 
escrow or even inventory be taught by the instructor of 
English or by the teacher of some commercial subject? Are 
some terms and phrases not better explained and practised in 
typewriting classes? In some commercial schools spelling 
has been transferred from English to penmanship or type- 
writing. So much business practice depends upon formalized 
tradition (making out blanks, etc.) that English teachers 
have argued against being burdened with covering such 
stereotyped material. Every adult should know something 
of business methods, of course; the point of the distribution 
of classes is whether teachers of English should instruct in 
such details. Is any original composition required in the 
regular duties of a minor clerk? On the other hand, should 
not business adepts know all that the general English train- 
ing of a high school offers? The best business compositions 
are not based upon the trite phrases of jargon which ignorant 
office assistants are prone to use in their pompous sounding 
notes to their correspondents of the same level. Every teacher 
has read them ad nauseam—“yours to hand and contents 
noted,” “would say in reply,” ‘kindly advise,” “take the 
matter up with him,” “esteemed favor,’ “hoping for 
continued patronage,” “I beg to remain,’ “I am yours 
faithfully,” ad infinitum. The old things die hard. This 
paragraph was printed in a reputable newspaper in 1922 in 
answer to a correspondent. What can a few teachers do with 
immature minds against the weight ofa daily circulation of 
hundreds of thousands? 
Please state if it is now considered good form to close a business 
letter with the phrase, ‘‘ Trusting that this information will be of 
some service to you, I remain,” I am under the impression that 
the use of ‘‘ I remain” at the closing of a letter is obsolete.-—M. 
Answer.—The word “ remain” in the complimentary close of 
a letter implies previous correspondence. The first letter should 
close with ‘I am,” if such a term be used at all. Therefore, if 
you have had previous correspondence with the person to whom
-P-A-G-E-336
  328 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
you are writing, the use of “‘ I remain ” in the sentence you quote 
is correct. 
Where some attempt at specialization is made, there is 
usually the endeavor to include some literary and cultural 
material as indicated in the succeeding course of study for a 
shortened stay of two years in high school. It may be said, 
however, that after several years of futile at empts to put 
this course into operation, it was abandoned, mainly because 
the pupils proved that they liked to follow the regular course 
of English, because it was felt that having only two years of 
high school training they should be given some glimpses of 
great literature, and also because the school authorities did 
not purchase the books listed in the supplementary reading. 
.It will be plain that many of them, not regular school texts, 
cost three or four times as much as the widely known edited 
“classics.” The course is commendable because it does not 
depart too widely from the intentions and progress of the 
usual academic developments.

High School Course in Business English—Two Years 
General Character and Aims 
It is the purpose of the course in Business English to give pupils 
a training in English and business letter writing which will directly 
equip them to meet the requirements of commercial life. The 
first year of the course emphasizes training in the essentials of 
composition and gives some drill in business letter writing; it is 
designed to give to pupils who cannot continue their school work 
the benefit of a well proportioned course. The second year gives 
extended training in composition and devotes the second half of 
the year to the application of this training to business correspond- 
ence. The content of the course is a unit, but for convenience it is 
outlined under the topics (1) grammar, (2) composition, (3)

primarily with reference to basic personal and social needs. 
2. To the study of English should be devoted not less than five 
units in Grades 7-12, with additional electives in Grade 11 or 
Grade 12. 
3. English comprises two subjects, language-composition and 
literature-reading. 
4. Though related, these involve radically different pedagogical 
methods. Hence in the course of study they should be separated. 
This does not mean, however, that literature is not to be used 
in the composition class. Effective expression is helped by the

  338 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
use of literary models and by constant insistence upon good, 
fluent, and accurate expression in all subject-matter classes, 
including those in literature. The separation of literature teaching 
from composition teaching makes possible the selection and use 
of the right models. 
5. The aim of composition teaching is to give the learner the 
power to communicate his ideas to others. Its subject-matter is 
the whole body of the pupil’s ideas, emotions, and aspirations. Its 
medium is the English language. It therefore touches life every- 
where and touches literature every time a pupil has an opinion to 
express either orally or in writing, because literature furnishes 
models of expression. 
6. Since it touches life everywhere, composition can be taught 
successfully only through the interest of English teachers in the 
writing and speaking of pupils in all subjects and through the 
supervision of all teachers in the oral and written reports of their 
own pupils. 
7. Language-composition includes several subjects, among 
them being oral expression, grammar, rhetoric, and written 
expression (which includes spelling, punctuation, and capitaliza- 
tion). It is best taught by the following cycle of processes: (1) 
The choice of a subject; (2) The gathering of material; (3) 
The organization of material; (4) Oral composition; (5) Written 
composition; (6) Revision; (7) Publication. 
8. The aim of literature-reading instruction is to develop in 
pupils the power to understand, feel, and appreciate the ideas, 
emotions, and aspirations of others. As a vehicle by which 
thought and feeling about subject-matter are transferred from 
mind to mind, it touches all content subjects. 
9. Like composition, literature includes several subjects, among 
them being reading, both silent and oral, oral and written discus- 
sion, declamation, dramatization, dramatic presentation, and the 
history of literature. 
10. The study of literature should create in pupils a desire to 
read and the habit of reading. It should be conducted so as to 
form in the learner well-defined tastes with regard to the type 
and the quality of his reading and so as to enable him independ- 
ently to select books for his avocational and vocational reading. 
This means the provision in the class room of many books of 
many types and the abandonment of that type of course of study 
which tries to satisfy these aims by the use of a very limited
-P-A-G-E-347
COURSES OF STUDY 339 
number of books. It does not mean that the intensive study of a 
few great books should be eliminated. 
11. The individualization of instruction is of great importance. 
For example, children whose language habits are natively correct 
should be excused from drill lessons in grammar and other drill 
subjects. On the literature side this principle should operate so as 
greatly to increase the amount of independent reading. 
12. At the end of Grade VI pupils should be able: (1) To express 
clearly and consecutively, either in speech or writing, ideas which 
are familiar; (2) To avoid gross grammatical errors; (3) To com- 
pose and mail a letter; (4) To spell their own vocabulary; (5) 
To read silently and after one reading reproduce the substance of 
a simple story, news item, or letter; (6) To read aloud readily and 
intelligently simple news items, lessons from text-books, or litera- 
ture of such difficulty as The Ride of Paul Revere or Dickens’s 
A Christmas Carol; (7) To quote accurately and understandingly 
several short poems, such as Bennet’s The Flag Goes By and Emer- 
son’s The Mountain and the Squirrel. 
13. Building upon this foundation, when it exists, and upon the 
actual attainments of pupils when it does not exist, there should 
be organized in each high school a course in English to meet 
the aims and principles set forth above. The details of such a 
course must vary to satisfy the requirements of different com- 
munities and of pupils of different grades of intelligence. A high- 
ly condensed outline of such a course follows. 
To composition and literature, alternating by semesters or by 
shorter periods, should be assigned five recitations or conferences 
of 45 minutes a week, or an equivalent. General or home reading 
by individuals should be required throughout. Proper emphasis 
should be placed both upon speaking and writing and upon oral 
and silent reading. 
GRADE VII 
A—Composition. 
The materials for composition in Grade VII should be derived 
from the children’s play; their work in school and out; their direct 
observation of processes, scenes, objects, and occupations; the 
books they read; and their imagination. The nature and spirit of 
written work most appropriate for this grade may be found in 
informal letter writing which draws its content from the sources  
-P-A-G-E-348
  340 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
named earlier in this paragraph. Formal compositions and themes 
assigned as such should be discouraged. 
B—Minimum Essentials. 
To secure correctness there must be attained a mastery of 
certain fundamentals in the technique of language. In Grade VII 
there should be investigation of the language habits of all pupils so 
that instruction may begin at the proper level. The aim should 
be to master these topics: recognition of the parts of speech by 
function; subject and predicate, object, predicate noun and adjec- 
tive; inflection of nouns and personal pronouns for number and 
case; the idea of tense; clauses and phrases as groups of words 
with the functions of single words; and necessary punctuation. 
Words used in all school subjects must be spelled correctly. 
C—Reading. 
For the general reading in this and the following grades there 
should be provided a wide range of books, papers, and magazines 
dealing with wholesome living, worthy home membership, voca- 
tions, citizenship, the worthy use of leisure, and right conduct. 
Poetry, fiction, science, art, ethics, civics, sociology, history, 
biography, and travel should be included, both new and classic. 
For class work in Grade VII some of the shorter poems of Long- 
fellow and Whittier, Miles Standish, Evangeline, The Great Stone 
Face, Rip Van Winkle, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, Treasure 
Island, The Gold Bug, Stories of King Arthur, and The Jungle 
Books are of about the right grade of difficulty. 
D—Individual Needs. 
In line with the foregoing paragraphs, in Grades VII, VIII, and 
IX, there must be recognition of the wide range of differences in 
language attainment found in any group of pupils. By the use 
of objective measurements, weaknesses and proficiencies may be 
discovered, the needs of individuals diagnosed, and suitable 
materials of instruction determined. Instruction in language 
control must increasingly turn away from uniform class procedure 
toward differentiation and adaptation to individual needs. 
GRADE VIII 
A—Composition. In addition to the composition materials sug- 
gested for Grade VII it is advisable, in Grade VIII, to use civic 
questions, imaginary journeys, admirable characters in life or 
   
-P-A-G-E-349
COURSES OF STUDY 341 
books, questions of school life, and trips. These subjects may be 
treated in expositions, narratives, descriptions, conversations, 
discussions, and letters. Particular attention should be given, in 
this and all subsequent grades, to the art of making well-organized, 
fluent, and correct recitations and reports in other subjects. 
Progress should be made in the planning of themes, the manipula- 
tion of sentences, spelling, and punctuation. 
B—Grammar. 
The study of grammar in Grade VIII should add a mastery of 
the essential elements of the sentence (subject, predicate, mod- 
ifiers, connectives), of clauses as parts of compound and complex 
sentences, of common and proper nouns, of classes of pronouns, of 
the person, number, and voice of verbs, of the classification and 
comparison of adjectives and adverbs, of the choice of prepositions 
and of conjunctions as co-ordinating and subordinating. 
C—Reading. 
As material for class work in literature in Grade VIII, some of 
the short poems of Holmes, Lanier, Riley, and Field, Snow-bound, 
The Lay of the Last Minstrel, Horatius, The Tales of a Wayside Inn, 
Norse Myths, Cooper’s novels, Kidnapped, Captains Courageous, 
Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, The 
Tempest, Franklin’s Autobiography, and Warner’s In the Wilder- 
ness offer a reasonable range. 
GRADE IX 
A—Composition. 
Particular vocations and current events may be added in Grade 
IX to the composition materials. The most available means of 
attaining clearness, force, and interest in composition should be 
presented informally; the chief features of explanation and narra- 
tive should be learned inductively; much drill should be devoted to 
social and business letters, spelling, word structure, and punctu- 
ation. At the end of Grade IX a pupil should be able to avoid 
any ordinary error in grammar, to improve expression by varying 
grammatical structure, and to write good social and business 
letters. 
B—Grammar. 
Such grammar should be taught as is necessary for use or to 
remedy previous deficiencies.
-P-A-G-E-350
  
342 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
C—Reading. . 
Among the poems suitable for Grade IX are Hervé Riel, The 
Courtin’, The Lady of the Lake, To a Skylark, The Concord Hymn, 
On First Looking into Chapman’s Homer, My Captain, To Helen. 
Poe’s Purloined Letter, Hawthorne’s Ambitious Guest, O. Henry’s 
Chaparral Prince, Davis’s Gallegher, and Hale’s Man without a 
Country are the kind of stories recommended for this grade. 
Ivanhoe, Quentin Durward, and Kim are desirable novels; Julius 
Caesar is the best play; Irving’s Christmas Sketches are useful; and 
Palmer’s Odyssey and Bryant’s Iliad (in part), with related myths, 
are well-nigh indispensable. 
GRADE X 
A—Composition. 
To the work in composition Grade X brings a wide range of new 
school studies, social relations, and knowledge of the world’s 
work and play. In the field of rhetoric it is the time to study the 
building of paragraphs, sentence manipulation (particularly 
clearness through connectives, the correct placing of modifiers, 
and unmistakable reference), conciseness, word-building. Spelling 
and punctuation must not be forgotten. To the forms already 
used may now be added telegrams, news stories, editorials, ad- 
vertisements, and the dramatization of situations. The products 
should be greater clearness and force in speech and writing, in- 
creased power of persuasion, ability to handle the simple problems 
of business correspondence, and the habit of using the newspaper 
rightly. 
B—Reading. 
For poetry in Grade X, The Vision of Sir Launfal, Enoch Arden, 
Ulysses, The Eve of St. Agnes, The Ancient Mariner, The Idylls of 
the King, Bannockburn, and Sohrab and Rustum are recommended; 
for plays Henry V, As You Like It, The Bluebird, The Piper, and 
Abraham Lincoln; for fiction Lorna Doone, Silas Marner, A Tale 
of Two Cities, and Ben Hur; for other prose The Alhambra, Travels 
with a Donkey, Burroughs’s Essays, and Lincoln’s Gettysburg 
Address. 
 
-P-A-G-E-351
  
COURSES OF STUDY 343, 
GRADE XI 
| A—Composition. 
In Grade XI, the work in composition should become more 
definitely technical. The secrets of literary effect should be 
studied. Outlines, themes, debates, parliamentary usage, related 
letters, short articles, editorials, and descriptions may be produced. 
Particular emphasis must be placed on wealth of material, effective 
organization, and correct technique. 
B—Literature. 
Some attention should be given in Grades XI and XII to the 
history of literature. This may be illustrated by The Idylls of the 
King, Macbeth, Hamlet, Milton’s Minor Poems, She Stoops to 
Conquer, Boswell, Burns, Wordsworth, Macaulay’s Essays, and the 
novels of Jane Austen, Dickens, Thackeray, Hawthorne, and 
George Eliot. Provision should also be made for the study of 
speeches on citizenship and of the best modern prose and verse. 
GRADE XII 
A—Composition. 
In Grade XII pupils who have done with credit the work out- 
lined for previous grades should be permitted to follow up their 
special interests in order to prepare them for their vocations. 
Among such special interests are newspaper work, commercial 
correspondence, advertising, debating, the short story, verse 
writing, dramatization, and scientific description. Pupils who 
show marked deficiency in the work outlined for previous years, 
on the other hand, should be given individual attention or grouped 
in drill classes according to their needs. 
B—Literature. 
Similarly in literature there may be in Grade XII a number of 
courses, to be elected by pupils according to their aptitudes. 
Among these might be the drama, the novel, short stories, speeches 
essays, poetry, or the works of a single author. 
Three possible organizations, indeed, may be suggested for the 
literature work in Grades X, XI, and XII. First, Grade X may be 
devoted to a chronological survey of American, and Grades XI 
and XII to a chronological survey of English literature. Second, 
each grade may be set aside for the study of one or more types of 
literature, each to be traced historically. Third, books may be  
-P-A-G-E-352
  
344 TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
selected with a view to proper variety within the range of the 
tastes of a given group of pupils. 
14. To attain the ends outlined above, encouragement should 
be given to school papers, dramatics, debating, public speaking, 
literary clubs, and such other agencies as supply proper motiva- 
tion to students. 
15. The number of pupils in composition classes must not be 
excessive. 
16. Suitable libraries, trained librarians, and special instruction 
in the use of libraries are necessary. 
17. Special English rooms, equipped with books and filing 
devices, are as necessary as are laboratories for the study of biology, 
chemistry, and physics. 
18. Properly trained teachers are indispensable. 
19. At the end of Grade XII, the average graduate should 
possess a working knowledge of the essentials of good usage, should 
be interested in the correct and fluent use of the English language 
both in speech and writing; as an ideal at least should regard 
slovenly English as being in the same category with soiled hands; 
should have a habit of correct speech; and should possess some 
power in its effective use. On the appreciation side he should 
know the main facts of the history of English and American litera- 
ture and be familiar with a few great books (say some of Homer, 
some of Shakespeare, and some of the Bible); should have an 
interest in reading and a somewhat cultivated taste in books; 
should have the habit of reading for pleasure; and should possess 
the power to read intelligently. 
The foregoing plan should be conceived of as temporary and| 
subject to revision in the light of further study and experience, 
The committee regards it as sufficiently conservative and at th 
same time progressive enough to justify its adoption at the presen 
time, but recommends that it be revised at intervals of three o1 
four years so that full advantage may be taken of the bes! 
modern thought and experience. For example, the establishment 
of clinics in spelling, handwriting, and silent reading may be safel 
recommended at this time as experiments which may ultimatel: 
result in a better adjustment of the English teacher’s load, i 
important reductions in the cost of English teaching, and in th 
improvement of the product of that teaching.

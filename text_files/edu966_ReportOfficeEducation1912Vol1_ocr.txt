  REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, 
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
Bureau or Epvucation, 
Washington, April 29, 1913. 
Sir: Because of the lack of means for collecting statistics promptly, 
it is still necessary for the Bureau of Education to publish in its 
annual report statistics for State school systems for one year back of 
the statistics pertaining to city schools, colleges, and other schools of 
higher and special learning. Therefore the Report of the Commis- 
sioner for 1912 gives figures of State school systems for the year 
ended June 30, 1911. An effort made last year to remedy this con- 
dition was not successful, but it is hoped conditions may be more 
favorable for another effort next year. 
Within the year ended June 30, 1911, the estimated increase in 
the number of children of school age in the United States was 505,614, 
while the reported increase in enrollment in the public schools was 
only 221,266, and the increase in the average daily attendance only 
44,673. This apparent falling off in enrollment and daily attendance, 
as compared with the estimated increase in the number of children 
of school age, is no doubt due to inaccurate and incomplete returns. 
The figures for 1911 are probably more nearly correct than those for 
1910. There is a constant improvement in the several States in 
methods of collecting and compiling the statistics on which this 
bureau must depend for the material for its summaries. In one 
State last year the reported enrollment and attendance were reduced 
by several thousands by more careful elimination of duplicate 
enrollments. 
The total number of teachers in the public elementary and high 
schools increased 10,396. This total increase was more than equaled 
by the increase in the number of female teachers. Of the teachers 
in the public elementary and high schools, 79.5 per cent were women 
and 20.5 per cent were men. 
There was an apparent decrease in the average length of school 
term from 157.5 days to 156.8 days. There was also an apparent 
decrease in the average'salaries of teachers. Probably this apparent 
decrease in salaries was real. If so, it can be accounted for by the 
fact that, while the increase in total expenditure was only $20,576,595, 
the increase in the total value of property reported was $121,688,218. 
Many new schoolhouses were built in city and country, and the new 
houses are much better and more costly than the older ones. Only 
xv  
-P-A-G-E-16
  XVI EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
about 60 per cent of the total expenditures of school funds is for 
salaries of teachers. 
For the year ended June 30, 1912, the number of public and private 
high schools reporting was 1,058 more than the number reported for 
the previous year; an increase of 8.6 per cent. The number of high- 
school pupils reported was 131,501 more than for the previous year; 
an increase of 11.8 per cent. The number of high-school graduates 
was 19,214 more than for the previous year; an increase of 14 per 
cent. This increase in attendance in the high schools and in the 
number of graduates is very gratifying, and is sufficient answer to the 
statement frequently made that fewer children enter the high schools 
than formerly, and that the proportion of those who graduate is con- 
stantly decreasing. On the contrary, the growth of the high schools, 
and especially of the public high schools, in the last decade is prob- 
ably the most notable thing in our school system. Better economic 
conditions and the recognition of the need for more education than 
can be acquired in the elementary schools by children who have not 
yet reached the period of adolescence both contribute to this. 
Nearly one-fourth of the children of this generation in the United 
States, and something more than one-fourth of the native-born white 
children, now get some education in high schools. The number of 
high-school teachers increased something more than 12 per cent. 
Of the total number of high-school teachers, 44 per cent were men, 
56 per cent women. 
Not all institutions calling themselves colleges or universities are 
listed as such in this report. Many of them do little or no work 
above the high-school grade; some do little above the grade of the 
elementary school. In the 596 colleges listed for the year ended 
June 30, 1912, there were 198,453 undergraduate and graduate stu- 
dents, and 63,815 in the preparatory classes. This is an increase 
of 8 per cent in the number of undergraduate and graduate students, 
and of 6 per cent in the number of students in preparatory classes. 
Probably the increase in the number of students in preparatory 
classes in colleges is due to the raising of standards and of entrance 
requirements; but it is hard to understand why, with the rapid 
increase in the number of high schools, colleges should much longer 
burden themselves with large numbers of immature students doing 
work that could be done much better and at much less expense in 
the high schools. The number of baccalaureate degrees conferred 
was 22,354, and the number of graduate degrees, 5,226; a decrease of 
1 per cent in baccalaureate degrees, and an increase of 10 per cent in 
graduate degrees. Of the baccalaureate degrees, 58 per cent were 
conferred on men, 42 per cent on women. Of the graduate degrees, 
83.4 per cent were conferred on men, 16.6 per cent on women. The 
number of professors and instructors in colleges and universities
-P-A-G-E-17
   THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XVII 
increased 6.3 per cent. Of the total number of professors and 
instructors, 80.2 per cent were men, 19.8 women. The value of 
property owned by universities and colleges increased from some- 
thing more than 367 million dollars to a little more than 409 million 
dollars. Endowment funds increased from nearly 300 millions to 
more than 350 millions, and the total of working incomes from 81 
millions to 90 millions. The figures in this paragraph do not include 
departments of theology, law, medicine, etc. These are included 
with the professional schools in the next paragraph. 
The number of professional schools reporting, including profes- 
sional schools and departments in universities and colleges, was 564, 
a decrease of 20. This decrease is due to the consolidation of small 
professional schools, the absorption of small schools by larger schools, 
and the tendency of colleges and universities to discontinue or unload 
the professional schools and departments which they find burdensome 
and which they are unable to maintain adequately. All this is in 
response to the demand which the public is beginning to make for 
‘better professional preparation. This demand applies at present 
more to medicine than to other professions, but it will soon extend to 
them all. It is not so important that we have a large number of 
professional schools as it is that those we do have shall be adequately 
‘supported and do genuine work. We are beginning to look with 
suspicion on colleges which, with very small incomes, attempt to sup- 
port large numbers of professional schools or departments; and profes- 
sional schools established and maintained for personal profit do not 
flourish as they once did. Though the number of professional schools 
was less than for the year before, there was an increase of 1.3 per cent 
in the number of students reported, an increase of 5.3 per cent in the 
number of graduates, and an increase of 1.8 in the number of pro- 
fessors and instructors. Substantial increase is shown im value of 
property, endowment funds, and working incomes. 
The number of normal schools reporting decreased from 288 to 
277. This decrease was probably due to the disappearance of some 
private normal schools and a change in the classification of others. 
Within the last few years there has been a large increase in the number 
of county normal schools and of normal classes in high schools, but 
these are not listed in this report. The reports show an increase of 7 
per cent in the number of normal school pupils enrolled, and of 10 
per cent in the number of graduates; an increase of 3.3 per cent in 
the number of teachers, and an increase of 5.3 per cent in the total 
of incomes. Of the total number of normal school students, 23.7 
per cent were men, 76.3 per cent women. Of the graduates, 14 per 
cent were men, 86 per cent women. The total number of graduates, 
18,278, was large enough to supply less than 25 per cent of the demand 
for new teachers in the elementary schools of the country.

XVI EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
  If all these graduates had begun teaching in the fall after their 
graduation, there would still have been 60,000 vacancies or more to 
be filled by young teachers who had not had the education and pro- 
fessional training represented by graduation from a normal school. 
This lack of preparation of teachers is one of the greatest evils of 
our school systems. In no other country that pretends to provide 
an opportunity for universal education is the condition in this respect 
so bad as in the United States. This condition must be remedied, 
or the schools must continue to be much less efficient than they 
should be. The State or country that assumes the responsibility of 
educating its children at public expense, and in schools under public 
control, must assume the corresponding responsibility of preparing 
at public expense a sufficient number of teachers, and must refuse 
to license persons not having sufficient native ability, education, and 
training to use to good advantage the time and money of the children. 
It is unwise and unjust to give to one school supported by the taxes 
of the people and attended by children that they may be prepared 
for life, for making a living, and for the duties and responsibilities of 
citizenship, a well-educated and well-trained teacher, and to give 
at the same time to another school supported by the taxes of the 
people and attended by children that they may be prepared for life, 
for making a living, and for the duties and responsibilities of citizen- 
ship, a teacher without education, training, or experience. We must 
have more normal schools of a high grade, and they must be content 
to confine their efforts more to the high task of giving adequate 
preparation to a sufficient number of young men and women to supply 
teachers for the elementary schools. In most States, at least, the 
duty of preparing teachers for the high schools should be left to 
schools or departments of education in colleges and universities. 
For the year ended June 30, 1912, 569 summer schools reported to 
this office, an increase of 90 over the year before. Since the year 
1911 was the first year in which statistics for summer schools were 
collected, it is quite certain that the increase in the number reporting 
does not indicate that there was a like increase in the actual number 
of such schools. The summer schools have come to be a large part 
of our educational equipment, and an important agency for the 
further preparation of teachers in the elementary and secondary 
schools. A very large majority of their students are teachers who 
have taught one or more years; some of them many years. It is 
worthy of note that of the 142,217 students reported, 32.8 per cent 
were men, a larger proportion of men than is found among the stu- 
dents of the normal schools or among the teachers in service. 
The average annual term of the schools in most of the States, and 
in the country as a whole, is still too short. Less than 157 days for 
all the schools, it varies from little more than 100 days in several 
States to a maximum of 193 days in Rhode Island. The average
-P-A-G-E-19
  
THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. xIx 
length of term in the rural schools is still shorter, being less than 140 
days for the country as a whole, and less than 100 days in some of the 
States. This is much less than in many other countries. In most 
countries of western Europe both city and country children have 200 
days or more of schooling in the year. In Australia the schools of 
city and country alike are in session 45 weeks, something more than 
210 days after all holidays are counted out. In Porto Rico the 
schools are in session 9 months—185 days, not counting holidays. 
The same is true of the rural schools of the Philippine Islands. The 
average number of days in which children of school age attended 
school was, in 1911, for the whole country, only 81.1. This varied 
from 42.5 days in South Carolina, 42.6 days in New Mexico, and 45.8 
days in Louisiana to 105.8 days in Iowa, 106.4 days in Massachu- 
setts, 107.4 days in Utah, and 120.4 days in the District. of Columbia. 
At this rate the average number of days of schooling for each child 
in the 13 years included in the school age varies from 552.5 days 
in South Carolina, 553.8 days in New Mexico, and 595.4 days in 
Louisiana to 1,375.4 days in Towa, 1,383.2 days in Massachusetts, | 
1,396.2 days in Utah, and 1,565.2 days in the District of Columbia; 
the average for the country at large being 1,054.3 days, or 5.27 years 
of 200 days each. Of course there are many schools in each State 
with an annual term below the average, and in each State there are 
many children who attend much less than the average for all children 
of that State, but the average even in the best States is far too low. 
It is not sufficient to enable the children to obtain the instruction 
and training necessary to fit them for life in an industrial, political, 
social, and religious democracy. 
Surely an annual school term of 180 days, and an average attend- 
ance of 90 per cent of this time by all the children between the ages 
of 6 and 16, a total of 1,620 days, can not be considered more than is 
necessary to prepare children for life and citizenship. The following 
tables show, on the one side, the average number of days the schools 
were open in each of the States in 1910-11, and the average number of 
days of schooling each child will get in each of the States at the rate 
of attendance for that year; and, on the other side, the number of 
days to be added in each State to make an average term of 180 days, 
and the necessary increase in attendance to make an average of 
1,620 days for each child. 
In the report for the year ended June 30, 1911, I called attention 
to the fact that there were, according to the Federal Census of 1910, 
more than five and one-half millions of people in the United States 
over 10 years of age unable to read and write. At the time that 
report was written separate statistics on illiteracy of children from 
10 to 20 years old were not available. The figures now available 
show that, with an increase of nearly 3,000,000 in the population 
included within these ages between the census years 1900 and 1910,

1900 and 4.7 in 1910. These figures are so important, as showing the 
results of the constant war against illiteracy, that they are given here 
for all of the States. For the Southern States they are given for 
white and: colored separately. It will be seen that the reduction of 
illiteracy among both white and colored children in the Southern 
States is remarkable and gratifying. The comparatively small reduc- 
tion in some of the North Atlantic States is due to the large influx of 
foreigners from countries in eastern and southern Europe, in which 
the per cent of illiteracy is very large. A finer analysis of the figures 
compiled by the Census Bureau shows that the per cent of illiterates 
in this class of the population is three times as large in rural districts 
as in the cities and towns. It also shows that for both white and 
colored the illiteracy is about 50 per cent greater for boys than for 
girls, and that the lowest per cent of illiteracy is found among the 
native-born children of foreign-born parents. This last fact is very 
reassuring. The eagerness of the’illiterate immigrant that his chil- 
dren shall obtain the education necessary to fit them for life in their 
new home means much for the prosperity of the country and for the 
safety of our democratic institutions.

XXIV EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
The gradual reduction of illiteracy is shown very effectively by a 
comparison of the per cents of illiteracy in the population between 
different age periods in 1900 and 1910. They are more interesting 
than any baseball or football score, and more thrilling than the 
reports of the battles of a great war. These figures show that the 
illiteracy of the negro population, and of the whole population, from 
10 to 15 years of age, is less than one-third the illiteracy of this class 
of the population 65 years of age and over, and that the illiteracy of 
the white population from 10 to 15 years of age is less than one-fifth 
the illiteracy of this class of the population 65 years of age and over. 
The schools of 40 years ago are responsible for the condition of the 
population over 65 years old. The schools of the last decade are 
responsible for the condition of the population between the ages of 
10 and 15 years.

For foreign-born whites, despite the large influx from countries in 
which more than half the people are illiterate, the per cent of illiterates 
has decreased. 
Without the public schools the illiteracy of foreign-born whites 
would have very rapidly increased and their children would have 
been almost totally illiterate. For negroes, despite their rapid nat- 
ural increase and the fact that they belong to a race almost totally 
illiterate through all the centuries of the past, the illiteracy has rap- 
idly decreased.
-P-A-G-E-25
     THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION.      
  XXV 
It is easily understood that these figures do not show fully the effect 
of the public schools. The decrease in per cent in illiteracy depends 
on two factors. The education of children of school age and the 
dying off of illiterate adults. Despite all the crudities and all the 
difficulties attendant on the task unprecedented for magnitude, 
method, and purpose, the public schools have probably accomplished 
more for the good of humanity within the 40 years than has ever Been 
accomplished by any other agency in a like number of years. 
A careful study of the several chapters of this report will show that 
there was much activity in the field of education in all parts of this 
country and throughout the world, and that some real progress was 
made within the year. The field of education has become so large, 
the work so differentiated, and the problems so complex that it is 
much more difficult than it once was to bring together in one report 
any complete account of progress for a definite period. No attempt 
has been made to include in this report a survey of progress in all 
parts of the field, nor to discuss more than a few of the most impor- 
tant agencies. 
Within the year the public schools were criticized freely in the pub- 
lic press, at public meetings, and elsewhere. Much of this criticism 
was intelligent and constructive. Some of it was unintelligent, -un- 
sympathetic, and destructive. Some of it was very superficial, and 
some only of the irritating, gadfly type. Like all other public 
institutions, the public schools are subject to the freest possible 
criticism, and any criticism however unintelligent and unsympa- 
thetic, if it only be free, must result in final good. The criticism 
which began several years ago, and seemed to reach its climax within 
the year for which the report is made, led to a general investigation of 
organization, methods, and results. Some of these investigations 
were conducted by officers and teachers in the schools investigated; 
some by parents and citizens in the towns and cities; others by com- 
missions of experts selected for this purpose. The findings have been 
discussed freely in the press, and debated in the meetings of educa- 
tional associations and elsewhere. It is interesting and instructive to 
note that, within the current year, there has been a rapid cessation 
of criticism, a restoration of confidence in the schools, and a larger 
amount of constructive discussion in the press and at public meetings. 
As noted in other chapters of this report, there has been a large 
extension of vocational education and a more persistent effort to 
adapt the work of the schools to the needs of modern life, both in 
urban and rural communities. Progress has also been made in the 
coordination of schools of different kinds and grades. In several 
States, effcrts more or less successful have been made to coordinate 
the institutions of higher learning, so as to eliminate waste through 
overlapping and unnecessary rivalry. A large number of colleges   
-P-A-G-E-26
  XXVI EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
have increased and made more definite their requirements for admis- 
sion and for graduation. The sentiment for the establishment of 
junior colleges which will not grant degrees, and in which only two 
years of college work will be given, seems to be growing. More or 
less successful attempts have been made in different parts of the 
country for a better adjustment of the work of the colleges and high 
schdols, so that the colleges may leave to the high schools their 
legitimate work and may use their funds wholly for college work. 
The Bureau of Education has had some opportunity to assist in this. 
That education, however differentiated and complex, is one thing, 
not many, seems to be better understood than it has been for many 
years. This is probably the most important symptom of all.

INTRODUCTORY. 
The year has been distinctly one of advance. For the most part, 
it has been marked by substantial practical achievement, rather than 
by any signal development of educational theory. There is, on the 
one hand, the record of routine progress in education, whereby cer- 
nk 
   
-P-A-G-E-28
  2 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
tain sections of the country are rapidly overtaking others that have 
had a temporary lead; the gradual elimination of illiteracy where it 
has persisted most stubbornly; pronounced improvement in the work 
of getting all the children into the schools; the extension of the 
amount, of educational opportunities in terms of length of school year 
and period of compulsory schooling; broadening the provisions of 
State education to include higher education; the constant betterment 
in teaching standards; the slow but certain transformation of the 
rural schools to make them adequate for rural life; increased ex- 
penditures for suitable buildings and grounds; the steady rise in col- 
lege and professional standards, together with a greater uniformity 
in requirements and results in higher institutions. 
These are the fundamental lines of progress in routine efficiency. 
On the other hand, there has been relatively little new educational 
theory. Most of the new things are no longer new. Medical in- 
spection and general health supervision; mental measurements; 
vocational training; vocational guidance; school gardening; social 
centers; provision for exceptional children; and the many projects 
for closer cooperation: between school and home—it is no longer a 
question of the advisability of these things, but of their extension in 
practice from isolated localities to larger educational units. 
In the present period of readjustment in public education, one of 
the most important results of recently developed theories has been 
to arouse lively discussion and criticism of existing school conditions 
as related to the new demands. 
I, CURRENT CRITICISMS OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
Public education of the present time is subjected to searching criti- 
cism with respect to purpose, organization, administration, curricu- 
lum, teaching methods, and results. Particularly during the past 
year there has developed a literature of educational criticism that 
needs to be studied. Contrary to popular impression, this literature 
has been produced almost entirely by educators and not by laymen. 
School men themselves are likely to be the severest critics of the 
weaknesses of the schools, perhaps because they know what public 
education has accomplished and can accomplish, and are impatient 
that the schools do not progress uniformly in accordance with their 
ideals. Thus Francis G. Blair, State superintendent of public in- 
struction of Tlinois, says: 
What we are doing in public education to-day is at least 25 years behind 
what we think we ought to be doing. ... When we turn our faces to look 
upon educational things as they really are and see the little circumscribed 
school grounds, the ill-constructed school buildings, ill-lighted, ill-ventilated, ill- 
suited to the life and work of millions of children; when we see the narrow, 
constricted courses of study, the short terms of school; when we look into the
-P-A-G-E-29
  SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1911-12. 3 
schoolrooms and see the-work done in so many instances by immature, ill-pre- 
pared, incompetent teachers—when we see all this a chill of disappointment, 
amounting almost to discouragement, comes over us, and we break forth into 
the question: Why is it that this great instrument of public education is so 
unresponsive to the theory and the thought of those who know the most about 
what it should be? Why is it that this great wagon of the common school is 
not more closely hitched to the star of educational progress? 
In the criticism that has come to a climax in the past year, there 
is much that is based on the best thought of our time; there is much 
that is the direct result of the discoveries of modern sulsriesy there is 
much that is backed by years of practical experience in the school- 
reom and in the administrator’s office; and there is naturally much 
that represents mere guesswork, misunderstanding, or even ignorance. 
Good and bad, significant and trivial, this mass of educational criti- 
cism is an indispensable guide to the progress of public education. 
) 
THE CHANGING PURPOSE OF EDUCATION. “i 
It. is apparent at a glance that much of the criticism of the public 
schools to-day is due to a marked change in the purpose of public 
education. Thus the charge of a curriculum “ behind the times,” and 
the demand for vocational subjects, represent no mere call for’ 
different school subjects as such, but a complete transformation in the 
idea of what the public schools should do. When public education 
was first. introduced in this country it represented an extension of the 
educational facilities already at hand to wider circles of the popula- 
tion. It was no time to consider whether the type of education that 
had served to make cultured gentlemen of those who had wealth and 
leisure was equally adaptable to the work of educating “ all the chil- 
dren of all the people.” The early public-school men were concerned 
with the task of extending the benefits of education, not with chang- 
ing it. They believed in it; they were themselves the product of it. 
They saw the vital need for enlightenment, and they knew of but one 
type of education to produce it. They used that type. 
No one can criticize these men or their purpose; they did well a 
work the full significance of which we are only too prone to forget; 
but the conditions of American life have changed radically in the 
past hundred years, and the whole basis of educational purpose has 
shifted to meet changing needs. Most of the criticism of the year 
will be found to come, on the one hand, from those who feel that the 
schools are still teaching the children of all the people by a process 
that was never designed for that end; and on the other hand from 
those who fear that education has entered upon dangerous paths, 
wherein the older cherished heritage is neglected. Those who criti- 
cize the bookish curriculum of the public school, whether elementary 
or high school, are really striving for what they conceive to be the
-P-A-G-E-30
  ea EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
changed purpose of public education: To reach all the children of 
all the people with the kind of training that will make them not 
merely intelligent in respect to things that are in books, but will 
equip them directly for the kind of life, economic and social, which 
they will lead when they leave school; while those who oppose the 
innovations do so because they do not concede this broader, though 
apparently more specialized, purpose. Thus the validity of much 
of the educational criticism of the year will be admitted or not ac- 
cording to the belief or nonbelief in a changed purpose for the 
schools, 
THE UNIFORMITY PROTEST. 
One criticism found prominently in the discussion of the year is 
directly attributable to this idea of changed purpose—that the schools 
attempt a uniformity that is undesirable; that they try to teach 
all the children the kind of things once designed for the few who 
intended to enter college. The uniformity charge is thus summed up 
by Dr. A. C. Perry, in his Problems of the Elementary School: 
Into the same school, into the same classroom, we thrust those pupils to 
whom we wish to extend the opportunity of seeking a liberal education, and 
also those others, in the substantial majority, upon whom we are placing the 
duty of securing that minimum of instruction consistent with proper usefulness | 
in a Republic. We place these two groups of pupils, with such divergent in- / 
terests, in the same classroom, under the guidance of the same teacher, and / 
put them through the same curriculum, and then wonder at the confessed fail- 
ure of the public school to prepare great numbers of its pupils for life, 
THE HIGH SCHOOL AND THE “ STANDARD.” 
Growing out of the argument against uniformity is the protest 
against arbitrary standards in the high school, by which pupils are 
rejected if they do not meet the requirements in certain traditional 
subjects, Latin and algebra, for instance. If the high school, like the 
rest of the system, is for all the children, says the critic of this type, 
then it can not eliminate those who do not come up to algebra-Latin 
standards, but must meet their demands. In modern education it is 
the boy or girl, and not the subject, that is the determining basis of 
school method. William Hughes Mearns states the case against 
uniform standards in the high school as follows: 
If the aim of the public high school is to turn out the largest percentage of 
perfect products, then every indolent, weak, ill-informed, or slow-witted 
youngster lowers the average and should be got rid of. Such should go into 
the junk heap as imperfect parts of machinery. Everyone sympathizes with 
such an aim in a medical school. There the greater the elimination of the 
unfit the greater will the community be served. The object of the college of 
medicine is not to assist some young person to get a better footing in life, but 
rather to discover and train the greatest medical efficiency. Dental schools,
-P-A-G-E-31
  
SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1911-12. 5 
law schools, engineering schools have small excuse for keeping half-equipped 
students; and particularly is it incumbent upon training schools for teachers to 
hold a high and inflexible standard * * *. 
But the object of the public high school is not primarily to turn out an ex- 
ample of skill; its fundamental achievement is to bring young people a step 
or two nearer efficient manhood or womanhood, to insure for the next genera- 
tion a healthier, better-thinking citizenship, to give youth a better training 
for his later daily work—in short, to make intelligent beings a little more 
intelligent * * *, 
Some high schools are managed like a track team instead of a gymnasium 
class. A good track team consists of record breakers, and only the possible 
point winners are taken care of; a good gymnasium class consists of all sorts 
and conditions of physical aptitude and inaptitude, and the weak are prescribed 
for with even more care than the strong. The chap that can not jump 6 feet, 
or run 100 yards in 11 seconds, or hurl a shot so many meters is useless to a 
track team. Who would eliminate these fellows from the gymnasium hour or 
the period of organized play? The track-team high schools have nothing but 
dismissal for those who do not qualify according to the arbitrary standard. 
Every mother has a standard of health for the family toward which she is 
daily and nightly striving; but she doesn’t asphyxiate all members that do not 
measure up.* 
THE SCHOOL’S WIDER ACTIVITIES. 
A frequent criticism from conservative sources is that the school is 
entering fields in which it does not belong. This appears to be a 
criticism based on the changed purpose of education, and in so far 
as it refers to the attempts to relate the schools more definitely to life 
it will be found true of the more progressive communities. The criti- 
cism is usually expressed with regard to the work of medical inspec- 
tion, dental clinics, etc. In this respect it must be said that the 
school is really only in line with the evident trend of the times, which 
allows government to interfere to a greater extent than heretofore 
with freedom of the individual, when the larger demands of society 
make such interference desirable. It is doubtful if the schools 
have even gone so far in this particular as the spirit of the times 
would permit. The community is concerned with getting for its 
schools the best possible educational material, and is therefore begin- 
ning to insist upon the most, thorough health supervision as a prelimi- 
nary requirement of public education. For the same reason, the 
school in its wider social purpose is intensely interested in eugenics 
and euthenics, to the end that the children may begin their educa- 
tional opportunities under as uniformly favorable conditions as 
possible. Those who resent the interference of government in the 
daily lives of the citizens will similarly resent the enlarged activity 
of the schools; no more and no less.

THE PROBLEM OF ORGANIZATION. 
When it comes to the organization of our system of education, it — 
may be said that educators are much more critical than outsiders. 
Among modern thinkers on school organization there is almost 
unanimous agreement that the present arrangement involves the 
waste of precious time and energy. Four criticisms of organization 
are: (1) That the period of elementary education is too long; (2) 
that the school year is too short; (3) that there is not the proper 
correlation between the elementary and the high school; (4) that 
classes are too large. 
These criticisms are mainly historical, and the conditions in their 
most objectionable form survive only where public opinion is not 
strong enough to better them. The length of the time devoted to 
elementary education in the United States is longer by several years 
than that of other countries. ‘The American system postpones sec- 
ondary education past the proper period of boyhood or girlhood, with 
the result, on the one hand, that it accustoms children to an educa- 
tional attitude they should have outgrown, and, on the other hand, 
that it shuts off many boys and girls from any work of secondary 
quality. This is a criticism repeatedly made by foreign observers of 
American schools. The shortness of the school term in the United 
States also amazes foreign observers, since in other countries, Ger- 
many, for instance, 10 months is the regular term. ‘The problem of 
correlation between elementary and -high school has passed from the 
stage of discussion to practical experimentation, and will accord- 
ingly be treated later. The size of classes is a general complaint, not 
confined to the United States, and is based on the feeling that the 
personal relation* between teacher and pupil emphasized in modern 
education requires small classes. 
“Too MUCH” or “ TOO LITTLE” SUPERVISION ? 
The question of supervision is one about which there is wide di- 
vergence of opinion. On the one hand we are met with the cry of 
too much supervision—“ we are supervised to death,” say some of the 
teachers in city schools. But the educators who know conditions, and 
foreign observers particularly, make the opposite criticism—that 
there is not supervision enough, particularly in the rural districts. 
They attribute this to the lack of centralized educational authority 
within the States. Localities that have the means provide machinery 
of supervision that sometimes exceeds what is desirable, while other 
communities without the means or inclination for well-developed 
school systems allow their schools to go without the supervision 
that would insure efficiency. Thus the question of too little or too 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
  SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1911-12. 'G 
much supervision is a matter of locality. It may be true that super- 
vision has sometimes gone so far in the city as to crush out the in- 
dividuality of teachers, but the harm thus done can not compare 
with the damage done by the neglect of providing country schools: 
with sufficient good management and supervision to make and keep 
. them efficient. 
CRITICISMS OF CURRICULUM—THE THREE R’S ARGUMENT. 
  The great bulk of the educational criticism is directed at the cur- 
riculum, and here the criticisms are most contradictory, because here 
is where the changing purpose of the school shows itself most clearly. 
On one side we hear that there are “ too many subjects,” “too many 
fads and frills,” and hence neglect of the “three R’s.” This is a 
favorite charge with those who forget their own schooling or remem- 
ber it with a glow of reminiscent sentiment. The critics who utter 
this sort of criticism seldom agree on exactly what are the “ fads and 
frills,” but they invariably hark back to a golden past when the so- 
called “ fundamentals,” reading, writing, and arithmetic, were taught 
in such a way as never to be forgotten. 
Regardless of whether the enrichment of the curriculum has been 
wholly beneficial or not, the trouble with this retrospective three R’s 
argument is, as Dr. Gregory says, “ that it isn’t so.” Those who use 
it do not seem to realize that the question of quality of results by the 
old and the new schools is not a question of guesswork, but one that 
has been answered by plain comparisons of fact. The Springfield 
tests of a few years ago demonstrated that despite the enrichment of 
the curriculum the three R’s are better taught to-day than they were 
50 or 60 years ago. In view of the tendency to revive the three R’s 
argument, it seems worth while to recall briefly what the Springfield 
tests were and what they revealed. 
In 1890 there were discovered in the attic of the high-school build- 
ing in Springfield, Mass., several old sets of examination questions: 
that had been written in the fall of 1846. They consisted of printed 
questions in geography and arithmetic with answers written on the 
printed sheets, and written tests in spelling and penmanship. Two 
of these tests were later (1905) given to 245 ninth-grade pupils in 
the Springfield schools, and the results were carefully compared with 
the results of the tests of 1846. The following is the comparison:

  8 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
Of the class of 1846, only 16 of the 85 pupils stood as high in spell- 
ing as 70 per cent, the present “ passing” mark in most schools. 
Three pupils had no words spelled correctly; nine had only one 
right; while 24, or more than one-fourth of the entire class, mis- 
spelled 17 or more words. 
Comparisons of the geography and penmanship were even more _ 
conclusive evidence of the superiority of the pupils of 1905 over those 
of 1846. 
In commenting upon the results of these tests, Dr. Gregory says: 
The system of to-day is immeasurably ahead of the school system of the 
past. The growth has been steady. Whatever may be said against the 
“enrichment ” of the course of study, its “frills and fads,” the contention that 
the essentials, so called, have suffered. in comparison with the past, falls flat. 
It does not follow that these essentials are taught as well as they should be~ 
yet. Perhaps they should have advanced more but for the “frills and fads” 
aforesaid. This is an open question. But no argument to that effect can be 
based on the superiority of.the schools of the past. That is not an open question. 
“ SUBJECTS OUT OF TOUCH WITH LIFE.” 
In the present literature of criticism the tendency is not to attack 
the curriculum because of the newer things that have come in to en- 
rich child life, but because of the persistence in it of subjects for 
which our age has no need, to the partial exclusion of subjects for 
which there is a genuine social demand. The general criticism all 
along the line is that the subjects are out of touch with life. The 
quarrel is not with arithmetic, for instance, as a school subject, but 
with what is likely to be taught as arithmetic—operations and meth- 
ods the utility of which ceases when school is out. Dr. Leonard P. 
Ayres tells of having been called upon to examine the eighth-grade 
arithmetic textbooks in a New England city. From the book in use 
he made up an examination, which he persuaded a number of success- 
ful business and professional men to try. These were men earning 
from.three to fifteen thousand dollars a year. None of them passed 
the examination. The highest mark recorded was 25 per cent. There 
was one problem in paper buying that seemed particularly trouble- 
some. Two of the men who took the examination were directly en- 
gaged in publishing work, and purchased many tons of paper every 
year. Both failed on the paper question, and both gave the same 
excuse: “ They had known how to do that when they left school, but 
having had no use for it since, they had forgotten it.” They further 
explained that the terms used in the paper problem had not been in 
use in the trade for the last 50 years. There is an interesting epilogue 
to this story. Dr. Ayres gave the same arithmetic examination to 
his 15-year-old office girl, just from the eighth grade. *She received 
75 per cent on the examination.

LATIN AND THE PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL, 
Thus the elementary school curriculum is subjected to the general 
criticism that the subjects are not in substance sufficiently in touch 
with the life of to-day, and that they are usually taught without suffi- 
cient “correlation” to each other. In the case of the high school 
this criticism goes further and condemns certain subjects as utterly 
out of place in any curriculum, at least as prescribed subjects. Latin 
is the chief object of attack in this connection. It is unnecessary to 
review the historical reasons which have led to the retention of Latin, 
except to note that here again we have the case of the changing pur- 
pose not fully recognized. For purely practical reasons, Latin was 
formerly the center about which instruction revolved. It was ac- 
tually and not artificially the sine qua non of education. Few claim 
it is now. The high schools were originally not designed as institu- 
tions to train all the children of all the people for different tasks 
in life, but to furnish what was then considered educationally neces- 
sary to those who desired it. The State demand for education did 
not include the high school. As soon as public opinion began to con- 
sider it the function of the State to carry the child through the addi- 
tional years of secondary schooling, not as a privilege for the in- 
dividual, but as a State duty, then the obsoleteness of Latin as a 
school subject became apparent. Whatever its cultural value for the 
individual, the current educational criticism considers Latin as dis- 
tinctly unnecessary in a people’s school. and a relatively strong group 
of critics would reject it, entirely. Lo oe 
Cer wy Rola Nye 9 ce : 
RIGIDITY OF THE CURRICULUM. 
It is not merely that the subjects are in content not adapted to cur- 
rent demands, but they are not fluid enough; the curriculum tends to 
be too rigid. This is the real reason for the complaint about mul- 
tiplicity of subjects. Many educators point out that if the new 
things that are desirable can be worked in with others, there can be 
no complaint of overcrowding. Thus school gardening need not 
usurp the place of arithmetic, but may be of real value in bringing 
arithmetic down to life. Other subjects can be so treated as to vital- 
ize the so-called traditional subjects. As one writer expresses it: 
You can not put a 10-year-old boy in a shop school, but you can bring him 
into close touch with the shop, the factory, the ship, the bank, with commerce, 
and with the whole world of business before you have changed his course of 
study at all. Why is not such a treatment of the child the logical preparation 
for industrial education? Why should we wait until a boy is 14 years old be- 
fore we wake him up to the fact that he is living in a real world?
-P-A-G-E-36
  10 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912, 
“ “PRACTICAL ” AND “ CULTURAL ” SUBJECTS. 
The problem of curriculum at the present time is often stated as 
the question of “ practical or cultural.” Theoretically, of course, all 
subjects are, or ought to be, both vocational and cultural. Every 
subject, however remotely connected with real life, is expected to 
help the pupil in his future, or it would not-be in the curriculum. 
It is really not a question of excluding certain subjects because: they 
are not vocational and adding others because they are; it is really the 
problem of emphasis—of using those subjects which will provide the 
greatest benefit to the individual combined with the greatest useful- 
ness to society. It is not that educators fail to appreciate the “ prac- 
tical ” as well as the cultural values of Latin, but they feel that there 
are other subjects more immediately necessary for the public welfare 
that are not only practical, but “ cultural,” in the best sense. In this 
connection it is felt by many critics of public education that what is 
needed is emphasis upon the “ cultural” value of the so-called prac- 
tical subjects. The merely book-taught boy has much to learn, from 
a purely cultural standpoint, of the boy who knows how to use his 
hands. What manual training was intended to do, and did not, 
something in the modern school must sooner or later accomplish— 
achieve genuine sentiment in behalf of all labor, whether of head or 
hands. : 
Judged by comparison with other nations, and by consideration of 
the needs of American life, it is only recording an acknowledged fact 
to say that the public-school curriculum in the United States is still 
considerably behind in its provision for vocational subjects. There 
is no question of this in the minds of careful critics of public educa- 
tion; but there is decided difference of opinion as to how far down in 
the grades the deliberate vocational training shall go and to what 
extent it shall affect the present school subjects. There is a very 
real danger, manifest in some quarters, to develop practical subjects 
at the expense of necessary preliminary training; but so far the need 
is decidedly for more, rather than less, vocational training in the pub- 
lic schools. 
THE QUALITY OF INSTRUCTION—THE TEACHERS. 
It is an interesting tribute to the teachers of the United States that 
there is so little general criticism of them on the part of the public. 
In this respect the public is more generous toward the profession 
than are many of its own members. Thus Prof. Miinsterburg says: 
It is the greatest defect of the American school life that too many teachers 
are standing before their pupils with a knowledge which has been crammed 
the night before and lacks a background of serious, thorough study. * * * 
The teacher must be primarily a person of broad general education.’

  SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1911-12, 4 
INADEQUACY OF THE SUPPLY OF TEACHERS, 
The usual criticism is rather of the inadequacy of the supply of 
teachers than of the inefficiency of the individuals, though of course 
there is a direct relation between the two. The teaching standard is 
unquestionably lower in'many parts of the United States than in 
certain other countries, for a number of reasons that need not be 
entered into here. It is seldom recognized how inadequate the supply 
of teachers for American schools really is. There were last year 
about 25,000 graduates of teacher-training courses in colleges, normal 
schools, and high schools in the United States. It is found by the 
Bureau of Education that the average length of employment is less 
than five years. With a total teaching force of about 450,000, this 
means that not more than 1 in 5 of the teachers actually employed is 
professionally trained, even on a minimum basis. In: one Western 
State, by no means the lowest in educational facilities, only about 
one-half the teachers in the schools have even a high-school educa- 
tion, and there are many parts of the United States where the aver- 
age education of the teachers is not above seventh grade. 
In discussing the inadequacy of teacher training in the United 
States it must always be borne in mind that for various historical 
reasons the sense of public responsibility in the matter of education 
has developed unequally in different sections of the country. Stand- 
ards of the teaching profession are much higher in some States than 
in others, and in most States the cities are far ahead of the country 
districts in adequate salaries and other conditions requisite for an 
efficient teaching force. It is simply that the State, in its eagerness 
to allow the maximum of local self-government, has been reluctant 
to insist upon education as a State function. The first step in educa- 
tional progress is recognition by the State of its direct school obliga- 
tions; once these are recognized in the form of ample financial sup- 
port where such has hitherto been withheld, the public-school system 
of a particular section will improve sufficiently to make the national 
showing for education more nearly what it should be. 
CONTRADICTORY CRITICISMS OF METHODS. 
A number of miscellaneous criticisms are advanced in respect to 
the quality of instruction, many of them contradictory. We hear 
on one hand that “ methods are machinelike,” or they are “ inelastic,” 
while on the other hand they are held to be slipshod. This, like the 
question of supervision and of school efficiency generally, is mainly 
a matter of geography. Both extremes will be found, but at the 
present stage of education the net results of excessive method are 
infinitesimal compared to the results of the lack of it.
-P-A-G-E-38
  12 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
In the same way we hear on one side that methods are “ too easy,” 
and on the other that they are “too hard.” The graduates of the 
schools of a generation or two ago are apt to complain that the pupils 
of to-day have too easy and pleasant a time; they are almost unani- 
mous in declaring that “we had to work when we went to school.” 
Discounting, as with the three R’s argument, the element of fond 
reminiscence involved in this type of criticism, it is nevertheless true 
that the methods of to-day are somewhat less harsh and unbending 
than those of the past. Any teacher or parent who yearns to return 
to the methods and discipline of our forefathers is specifically re- 
ferred to first-hand accounts of early nineteenth century schools in 
New York or Philadelphia. The delver into the past will almost be 
willing to believe that childhood is a modern discovery. The charge 
that the methods of to-day are too hard has, however, occasionally 
been justified in certain instances, where a craze for efficiency on the 
part of the school, coupled with the personal ambitions of a parent, 
sometimes lead to the imposition of tasks beyond the child’s physical 
endurance. 
EXAMINATIONS AND HOME WORK. 
Two other criticisms are put forward so often that they should be 
mentioned here; they deal with examinations and home work. 
Making due allowance for the sentimentality that often enters into a 
discussion of these two subjects, it should be said that there is 
considerable educational authority against the persistence of the 
old-fashioned examination, especially in so far ag it is designed to test 
memory only. There is also a marked tendency to move away from 
the strict adherence to written examinations as the final test of school 
work. This tendency has worked recently particularly in aid of 
the problem of the articulation of high school and college. For some 
time many American colleges, especially in the West, have been 
accepting accredited high-school graduates without examination. 
Two years ago Harvard took a step which, while retaining the exami- 
nation principle, recognized largely the previous work of the student. 
During the current year Yale and Princeton have also formulated 
plans with the same end in view—that of assigning some more satis- 
factory standard of measurement than a mere examination on formal 
subjects. In the public-school system this tendency shows itself in 
the gradual elimination of the examination bar between the highest 
elementary grade and the high school. As long as the high school 
was merely a special privilege to a favored few it was felt that some 
sort of admission test was necessary, but with the extension of the 
high school into becoming an integral part of the State-provided 
education of every child, whatever justification there was for dis- 
crimination is considered to have vanished.
-P-A-G-E-39
      
   13     SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1911-12. 
With regard to “home work,” considerable difference of opinion 
still exists among American schoolmen. Home work for young 
children is rightly censured on the ground of health, and there is 
some disposition in the current criticism of the year to carry the same 
argument into the high school—that home study too often means 
work at night under unhygienic conditions or sacrifice of daylight 
hours that should be spent in the open air. So far as the high school, 
is concerned, this opinion does not yet find very general acceptance.      
      
         
          
       
                  
              
     
                                     
      MEASURING THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS BY RESULTS. 
   An institution is ultimately measured by its results, or what are 
taken to be its results, and the American public school has always 
had more or less criticism based on this principle. The present year 
has been no exception. Although measurement of results in educa- 
tion is obviously a complicated problem, one or two things can be 
very definitely measured with the means at hand, pending the evolve- 
ment of scientific standards. Thus we can measure the extent to 
which educational opportunities are availed of, and within certain 
limitations we can infer from this the relative success of systems of 
public education. / 
LOW ATTENDANCE. 
Low attendance records are a measure both of the efficiency of the 
school system and of the school methods. An efficient school sys- 
tem compels the child to go to school at least until a certain age de- 
termined by the State. When it is necessary to report that six States 
still have no compulsory attendance laws and a number of others 
have laws which apply only partially, the school system of a large 
part of our Nation is at once condemned, not for its efficiency so far 
as it exists, but for its efficiency as measured by the very important 
standard of what the State is able to require. 
To some extent, however, low attendance is also a cation of 
educational methods. The pupils are likely to find a way to come to 
school if convinced of the vital nature of the instruction offered 
them. One of the most severe indictments of the too-academic char- 
acter of public-school education is the prejudice that it has engen- 
dered in the minds of those who saw no relation between school and 
life. It is difficult to estimate how much of the unwillingness of 
legislators to appropriate money for education has been due to the 
feeling that the instruction for which they were asked to pay was 
somehow unrelated to the life their children were going to lead. 
. ELIMINATION OF THE “AVERAGE” PUPIL. 
The premature dropping out of pupils from school has received in- 
creased attention during the year as an index of educational progress, 
or lack of progress. The modern demand for vocationalizing the
-P-A-G-E-40
14 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
curriculum owes its force mainly to the proved fact that a larger 
proportion of pupils drop out of school than can possibly be ac- 
counted for on the ground of economic pressure. The average boy 
leaves school because study of the bookish sort has ceased to make 
any appeal to him. The current criticism tends to regard this aver- 
age boy as the real problem of public education. It views his elimi- 
nation as a distinct social loss, and seeks to devise ways and means to 
give him more than he has, not merely for his individual benefit, but 
for the larger benefit of society. 
INACCURACY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL, 
  So much for results that can be measured in externals. There is 
another set of criticisms of results that can not be so readily meas- 
ured, though science is rapidly learning how. Measuring intelligence 
has been indulged in impressionistically without much regard for the 
scientific possibilities. Notwithstanding the remarkable advances 
of the science of mental measurements, it is far from coming into its 
own in the present state of public enlightenment. In the meantime 
the year has seen many of the measurements not based on scientific 
tests. Thus business men complain of the product of the elementary 
school as it comes to them, and college teachers complain of the in- 
accurate work of the high-school students. In so far as this criti- 
cism is based on comparisons between what the schools do now and 
what they used to do, there is, as has been shown in connection with 
the Springfield tests, no justification for the idea that the pupils of 
the old time were better at the fundamental branches than they are 
to-day. Quite the contrary. There is also the fact, which tends to 
affect this particular judgment from business men, that the mentally 
alert are nowadays much more likely to continue their schooling 
than to enter business at an early age; so that this criticism is fre- 
quently based on the less creditable products of the public schools. 
There is a disposition in the educational criticism of the year to 
charge the inaccuracy complained of by business men and others to 
influences peculiar to American life that have survived despite the 
opposing work of education. D, O. S. Lowell, of the Roxbury Latin 
School, after analyzing certain peculiar traits of American life, 
declares that because of them “ average boys and girls believe it is 
enough to half learn a lesson, to half know a principle, to half ex- 
plain a problem, to half understand an explanation or assignment.” 
It should be said, however, that there is some criticism, especially 
foreign, that attributes this inaccuracy, together with other unde 
sirable characteristics, to our educational system. The Germans re- 
port a lack of thoroughness in our school work, particularly in the 
secondary schools; English critics carry the judgment a step further,
-P-A-G-E-41
SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1911-12, 15 
and declare that the graduates of our colleges “ lack power to think.” 
Many of them admit, however, that our task is different from any- 
thing that has been attempted elsewhere, and they are usually quite 
ready to grant that our way may be necessarily different. 
DEMOCRACY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL. 
  There is one criticism of the results of education in this country 
that affects so particularly the social aspects of it that it must not 
be passed over. It is charged that the public school inculcates dis- 
taste for labor—by which is usually meant physical labor. William. 
Hawley Smith tells of the high-school teacher who, when asked 
whether her girl students “ would be willing to marry men who got 
their hands dirty from work,” replied indignantly: “‘ Well, I should 
hope not; I hope we’ve taught them better than that.” Part of this 
attitude is due to the phenomenon of social rise regularly observed 
in this country, and critics who profess to discover undemocratic 
tendencies in the public-school system, more particularly in the high 
school, are met with the assertion that this is but one of the inevitable 
results of social readjustment. It is pointed out that wherever the 
public purpose of education is not fully understood, the idea prevails 
quite generally that a rise in the social scale means less work on the 
part of the individual so rising. In this respect the best justification 
for such subjects as school gardening, woodworking, and other indus- 
trial branches ought to be that they will aid in the more complete 
recognition of the dignity and importance of every kind of human 
labor. 
The charge of lack of democracy is directed usually at the high 
school, and is less frequent than usual in the educational criticism 
of the year. Indeed, one critic who is severest in denouncing the 
weaknesses of the public schools thus pays his tribute to their work 
in furthering democracy: 
All criticisms regarding the faults of the public schools, either as they have 
been or as they now are, should be tempered and modified, and in large 
measure excused, by our acknowledgment of the inestimable blessing they have 
already proved themselves to be as makers of democracy. All their past and 
present shortcomings are as nothing when compared with the great results 
they have yielded, on the lines of good-fellowship and love, amongst all classes 
of people. There is not one who reads these lines who can not verify the truth 
of this in his or her own life. Think of the men and women in all ranks of 
life whom you now hold in high esteem because of the knowledge of them that 
you gained in the public school. 
Il. RECONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAMS. 
To what extent is American education attempting to meet con- 
structively the current educational criticism? To a surprisingly
-P-A-G-E-42
  16 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
large extent and in the following ways: (1) By a noteworthy open- 
mindedness toward new ideas and new plans; (2) by numerous 
school investigations, designed to test actual conditions with respect 
rto general efficiency and up-to-dateness; (3) .by opening wide the 
avenues of information, so that the people may have accurate knowl- 
edge of the work of education as it is carried on in their schools; 
(4) by nationalizing local experience and thereby formulating stand- 
ards for public-school systems based on the best obtainable educa- 
tional theory and practice; (5) by constructive programs on the 
part of practical school administrators intended to keep school sys- 
tems as completely as possible up to the community’s altered stand- 
ards and shifting demands. 
SCHOOL INQUIRIES, 
The voluminous literature of criticism by educators is sufficient 
indication of their alertness to new ideas. American educators are 
disposed to put their educational theories and practice to every con- 
ceivable test and change their methods whenever necessary. Hence 
the remarkable number of school surveys, investigations, and inquiries 
that have characterized the past year, almost without exception owing 
their inspiration as well as execution to schoolmen. These inquiries 
are noted for the relentlessness with which they lay bare weaknesses 
and advertise deficiencies. The more professional the character of 
the investigation, the more severe the strictures seem likely to be. 
Yet schoolmen welcome such investigations and frequently seek them 
for their own community. The National Council of Education has 
recently been asked by a committee of representative schoolmen to 
constitute a commission on school efficiency that shall be “ representa- 
tive of the most significant scholarship and of the best administrative 
practice known to our profession,” for the purpose of making it 
easier to carry on school inquiries. In addition to aiding in the work 
of deriving scales of measurement and furnishing expert advice with 
respect to the nature and scope of school surveys and inquiries— 
It should offer to members of our profession engaged in administrative work 
the opportunity to secure a scientific investigation of their systems of schools 
under the direction of professional experts. As the situation is at present, we 
have the anomaly which permits a politician, an interested book-publishing 
company, or a personal enemy of the chief administrative officer of a school 
system to attempt to secure the removal of such an officer without any adequate 
mneasure of the efliciency of the school system or the accomplishment of the 
man whose work is called in question. The establishment of a body of pro- 
fessional experts would in time render such action impossible.

MAKING KNOWN THE SCHOOLS’ NEEDS, 
Not only do schoolmen of to-day show conspicuously their desire 
to have their work carefully scrutinized by competent judges, but 
they wish above all to give ample publicity to the work they are 
doing with the public school. They seek to acquaint the public with 
the needs and problems of education as a vital public concern. This 
attitude on the part of schoolmen is but one of the many signs of the 
vigorous sentiment for closer contact than ever before between the 
work of the schools and the work of life. It is an essential part of 
the educational policy of progressive communities to-day to relate the 
schools so closely to sound public needs that the schools will become 
the immediate concern of all the citizens, instead of a sacred institu- 
tion to be viewed from afar. The intimacy that must replace the 
aloofness of the past is well expressed by William H. Allen, director 
of the Bureau of Municipal Research, of New York City, who, speak- 
ing from the point of view of an observer standing between the 
schools and the public, states the lines of attack by which a com- 
munity must learn its unmet educational needs: 
1. By democratizing the purpose of the schools. 
2. By demanding that the public be continuously informed regarding school 
work. 
3. By making it easy for newspapers to report what the schools do and need. 
4, By denying that the schools are better than the health department, police 
department, tax assessor, or the politics with which school children must learn 
to cope. Schools are weakened, not helped, by being separated from the main 
currents of community life and by being protected against problems which play 
upon and educate the child before going to school and after its few short years 
at school. 
5. By encouraging school-teachers, principals, superintendents, and commis. 
sioners to tell currently what they want, what they need, what they dislike, and 
where they fail. This means adequate comparative statements; first, by super- 
yisory officers for schools within each community, and then by county and State 
superintendents, by the United States Commissioner of Education, and by 
national comparing agencies such as the Russell Sage Foundation. Having 
given up the fiction that there is something sacred about school curriculum, 
school policy, or schoolmen, there will at once become available a vast amount 
of testimony, interest, and constructive suggestion on the part of those who best 
see the unmet school needs, namely, the men and women who are meeting the 
children and are therefore better able to solve the problems of curriculum, man- 
agement, and health. This will follow, not precede, the establishment of 
definite and continuous tests for the efficiency of school trustees and of the 
mayors who appoint them or the public which elects them. 
Tn this connection there are a number of national agencies whose 
work during the past year has been of conspicuous value in gaining 
wider publicity for educational problems. By focusing attention 
upon the problem of high school and college, the Carnegie Founda- 
tion has aided materially in raising the standards of both types of
-P-A-G-E-44
18 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
institution, and the results of this work have been especially notable 
during the past year. The recent comparative description of the 
school systems in the 48 States, as worked out by the Russell Sage 
Foundation, is another of the things that help in this movement to 
make the real needs of the public schools known, Such nationalizing 
of public knowledge of education is of very real value in raising the 
efficiency level of public education. 
FORMULATION OF STANDARDS AND PROGRAMS, 
The actual formulation of standards and the making of practical 
programs has been particularly noticeable during the year under 
review. These represent definite attempts to adjust education to 
changed social demands. Thus Supt. Randall J. Condon, formerly 
of Providence, is reported to have outlined for the schools of that city 
a statement of desiderata that would doubtless be accepted by many 
school superintendents of advanced ideas: 
The full conservation of the health of the children. 
The introduction of manual training and home economics into the elementary 
schools. 
Adequate provision for all children who are mentally and physically defective, 
the tubercular, the lame, the blind, the deaf, and the feeble-minded. 
The development of industrial education under trade and continuation 
schools and part time cooperation courses that shall connect directly with the 
leading industries and occupations of the city. 
A distinct modification of the plan of grammar-school instruction along 
industrial lines for the over-age, slow, and indifferent pupils who will not go 
beyond the grammar schools. 
An extension of the home school to all sections of the city, educating girls 
directly for the home and for their future duties and responsibilities as wives 
and mothers. ‘ 
An extension of the kindergarten to all sections of the city. 
The maintaining of summer schools for children who need or wish to take 
advantage of such opportunities. 
The opening of the schools as social centers, for the use of all the people in 
any direction that makes for social and civic betterment. 
A continual and distinct recognition and conservation of the interests of the 
pupils who can remain longer in school and who are likely to pursue their 
studies beyond the high school. 
REORGANIZING THE ELEMENTARY AND HIGH SCHOOL. 
This program refers only in a general way to the elimination of 
waste by means of reorganizing the elementary and high schools. 
Many attempts have recently been made to solve this problem in 
actual practice, some of them notably successful. Prof. Calvin O. 
Davis, of the University of Michigan, has summed up the discussion 
and experimentation in this field by a statement of four distinct
-P-A-G-E-45
  
SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1911-12. 19 
methods of reorganization, any one of which, he believes, will solve 
the problem. These four methods are: 
1. Continue the external form of the school as it is to-day, but introduce into 
the seventh and eighth grades the principles now obtaining in the administra- 
tion of the high school. This would leave the elementary school outwardly in 
much the same condition as to-day. A modified form of departmental teaching 
would be provided, an enriched curriculum, a closer approach to the idea of 
student responsibility, and a better promotional system. 
2. Bring the seventh and eighth grades into the high-school building and or- 
ganize and administer all work above the sixth grade as a unit, both respecting 
external form and internal operation. This plan merely takes the seventh and 
eighth grades out of their present setting and merges them with the present 
high school. They thereby are brought fully under the principles dominating 
secondary education. Departmental teaching, limited election of studies, 
scientific methods of instruction, a freer spirit of regulation and control, all 
are henceforth to be the birthright of the seventh and eighth grade students as 
they are at present of the four upper grades. 
3. Make a complete differentiation of schools and subject matter from the 
very beginning of the seventh grade. This plan implies a differentiation of 
schools and of subject matter and in buildings at the very outset. From the 
sixth grade the ways diverge. All work beyond this is organized in separate 
and distinct schools by themselves. ‘In its complete organization there will be 
seven distinct types of schools, the number varying with local conditions. These 
several general types are: (a) College preparatory school, (0b) manual train- 
ing school, (c) high school of practical arts for girls, (d) high school of com- 
merce, (e) the business school, (f) the trade school for boys, (g) the trade 
school for girls. 
4. Group the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades by themselves as a junior 
high school, and the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grades by themselves as a 
senior high school. This method is adaptable to large cities where separate 
buildings and separate control may be had. 
PROF. HANUS’S FORMULATION. 
One of the most ambitious attempts yet made to set up a program 
of achievement for American education is that of Prof. Hanus, head 
of the New York City school inquiry. Recognizing at the outset of 
his work the absence of standards by which to measure school sys- 
tems, he undertakes to formulate them. Since his formulation is not 
only based on a reliable personal judgment and wide comparative 
opportunities, but is accepted almost completely by a large committee 
of coworkers in the inquiry, it may be taken as fairly representative 
of the advanced educational thought of to-day as to what schools 
ought to be and do. The literature of contemporary educational 
theory is so scattered that a summation of this sort, applied by an 
acknowledged authority as the criterion for an existing school sys- 
tem, forms an important document in progress. It is therefore 
given below: 
1, Public education should train efficient citizens—men and women who recog- 
nize and appreciate the common interests of our democratic society and are

  y or net 20 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
able to promote their progressive development. These interests are spiritual 
(intellectual, moral, esthetic), hygienic, economic, civic. 
2. Public education should strive gradually to emancipate each pupil from 
external restraint and guidance, and thus render him seif-directing—intel- 
Jectually, morally, and physically stable, alert, vigorous, and active. Together 
with the instruction public education offers, it should therefore insist through- 
out on discipline that is wise, kindly, and firm, including appropriate punish- 
ment when it is needed—a discipline that insists on progressive conformity of » 
conduct to insight, including habits of steady application and reasonable 
achievement. 
3. Public education should endeavor to prepare each pupil to make the best 
use of his leisure, as well as of his working hours. Satisfactory diversions and 
good recreative habits are important for both the individual and society. With- 
out disparaging harmless diversions and amusements, public education should 
therefore strive to develop an appreciation of, and a demand for, the serious 
pleasures our civilization affords. 
4, Public education should strive to render each pupil economically intelligent 
and efficient. It should direct each pupil’s attention to a vocation to which he 
may reasonably aspire; that is, every pupil should be led gradually to realize 
that a suitable vocation, accessible to him and adapted to him, is indispensable 
to a useful and happy life. As he approaches the end of his school career, 
whatever his age may be, he should come to see that his vocation will be not 
only the means of satisfying his personal wants and ambitions, but, because it 
is the chief means of establishing significant relations between himself and his 
fellow men, it is also the source of such public service as he is capable of and 
may be called upon to render. Public education should, therefore, provide for 
-the development of vocational purposes based on vocational enlightenment 
(vocational guidance) ; and it should offer each pupil appropriate training for 
the vocation of his choice. 
Schools must therefore be so constituted as to provide adequately: 
(a) The means of appropriate and, so far as possible, complete general 
development (self-discovery, and self-realization, and preparation for general 
social service for every pupil) ; and 
(b) Various kinds of vocational training adapted to the needs, tastes, and 
» future callings of all pupils who pass at once from school to their life work; 
and for those who wish to improve themselves after they have gone to work 
“ (preparation for specific social service, i. e., for usefulness). 
They must therefore provide: 
1. The elements of general culture, comprising— 
(a) A satisfactory command of the school arts—the three R’s. 
(b) An insight into, appreciation of, and power to deal with (1) the recorded 
ideals and experience of the race; and (2) all worthy interests of contemporary 
life so far as they can be rendered interesting, intelligible, and accessible to chil- 
dren and youth of school age; that is to say, the school program (program of 
studies) must cover (a) The school arts—reading, writing, and arithmetic; (b) 
Janguage and literature (modern and ancient); (c) history, government, and 
economics; (d@) art (pictorial and plastic art, constructive art, and music) ; 
(e) mathematics; (f) natural science; (g) manual arts and domestic arts; 
(h) physical education, including physical training and athletics; (i) vocational 
guidance; in— 
I, Kindergartens. 
II. Elementary schools, with differentiated upper grades, and well articu- 
lated with the
-P-A-G-E-47
SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1911-12. 21 
Ili. High schools, having as wide a range of electives (administered under 
wise guidance) as possible. 
2. Vocational training (training for specific social service) at the upper end 
of the elementary school in industrial and commercial schools, whether called 
secondary schools or not, in— 
{a) Day vocational schools for normal pupils over 14 years of age, whether 
they have completed an eight years’ elementary school course or not, and who 
will not go to a high school. 
(0) Day cooperative and continuation schools (vocational) for pupils 14 to 
18 years of age who can not-afford or will not take the time to attend a day 
vocational school. 
(c) Evening continuation schools, vocational and nonvocational, for pupils 
over 18 years of age who are at work during the daytime. 
({d) Vocational high scheols—vocational schools of secondary grade. 
(1) High schools of commerce. 
(2) High schools of practical arts (technical high schools). 
(8) Agricultural high schools. 
Or well-organized separate departments of (1), (2), and (8) for vocational 
instruction in general high schools. 
But the American people are not satisfied with schools for normal children 
only. They acknowledge their obligation to do all that can be done for excep- 
tional children as well; hence they provide also schools or classes for (a) 
cripples, (0) anemic and tubercular children, (c) incorrigibles and truants, 
(d) blind children, (e) deaf children, (f) mentally defective children. 
Il. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION.' 
The movement for vocational training in the public schools is 
now at a crisis in this country. With the vocational principle fully 
acknowledged, with more or less complete systems of vocational 
education in operation in a half dozen States and in numerous 
cities, and with constant demands from all sources for the extension 
of vocational training, the movement is not yet making the headway 
in practice that it should. There is a sort of opposition, very often 
unexpressed, that does not appear to be due so much to the fear of 
emphasis upon the “ practical” at the expense of the “ 
to a feeling that certain features of the vocational propaganda seem 
to involve a form of social cleavage that is alien to the funda- 
mental purpose of American education and American life. This 
objection is not at all against the principle of vocational training; 
indeed, the staunchest advocates of industrial training are among 
those who appear to feel this element of distrust. Whether this 
feeling is expressed or not, it plainly exists, and is at present clearly 
retarding the progress of the vocational movement with schoolmen 
and with the public generally. 
The real difficulty seems to be that pioneers in the movement, 
having become saturated with the foreign experience from their 
close study of it, are inclined to try to force this foreign, specifically   
1¥or a detailed report of progress during the year, see ch, 10. cultural” as ‘ 
     
-P-A-G-E-48
  22 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
German, practice upon American schools without sufficient effort to 
adjust it to American conditions. Many educators feel that they are 
asked to adopt a foreign system because of its proved industrial 
efficiency, regardless of the different social conditions in the United 
States. They feel that we must above all avoid the idea of separate 
schools for industrial training, since that sort of differentiation is 
bound to lead, if not to an undesirable social separation in itself, at 
least to the belief that some such separation is contemplated. 
This is the real objection on the part of many vocational advocates 
to the “ dual system ” as proposed in several States. There is clearly 
something to be said on both sides of the question, but this one objec- 
tion seems almost fatal. Those who object most strongly to the 
idea of separate schools, industrial high schools as distinct from 
“regular” high schools, for instance, point out that they tend to 
separate the population into groups with differing social interests 
just at the time when common social aims should be emphasized. 
‘The objectors say: 
The imperative need for vocational training for these boys and girls must not 
blind us to the danger of so introducing it as to separate those who are going 
into the trades from those who are going into the professions or business. 
It is pointed out that the localities where industrial training is 
working out most successfully are those where the boys and girls 
who take the industrial course at no point lose touch with the other 
students. Thus, in Fitchburg the first year of high-school work is 
the same for all students, those who are going into the trades as well 
as those who are not. Thereafter the boys taking the cooperative 
course work one week in the shops, the next in school. They may 
have different instructors, but they remain in and of the high school; 
they never lose their identity with the school. Rightly or wrongly, 
the American is instinctively repelled by any diversification of edu- 
cational aims that results in widely differentiated strata of society. 
He feels that separation of pupils in different schools involves dis- 
crimination. He not only demands equality of opportunity in edu- 
cation, but a certain fundamental similarity of education, experience, 
and actual intercourse up to young manhood and womanhood, to 
insure like aims and ideals in the wider democracy of which the 
school is at once a model and a part. It is instinctively felt that if 
boys and girls from different living groups get together in the public 
high school they will be much more likely to get together in life. 
Any movement for vocational education, therefore, which even ap- 
pears to ignore this spirit, is apt to run the risk of being accused of 
interference with the school’s duty toward democracy. 
It would hardly be fair to give so much attention to this rather 
unformulated objection if it were not that the vocational principle is
-P-A-G-E-49
  
  SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1911-12. 23 
so important for the advancement of the schools. For the same 
reason it is believed that only good can come from calling attention 
to another objection that is raised in some of the corament of the 
year—that the vocational appeal is to selfish instincts, and that there- 
fore care must be taken lest it work real injury to the spirit of social 
service that is at the basis of modern*education. Thus Mr. George 
H. Martin, in discussing conjointly the play movement and the voca- 
tional movement, says: 
It may seem strange, but it is true that the two latest movements in educa- 
tion—the play movement and the vocational nrovement—while undoubtedly, on 
the whole, beneficent, make the work of the high school harder in meeting what 
I have called the supreme obligation. Each of these movements serves to 
strengthen one of two tendencies fatal to the spirit of social service. 
The play movement tends to promote a frivolous spirit, and the vocational 
movement tends to promote a selfish spirit. 
These movements, aS worked out in practice, appeal to the love of pleasure 
and love of gain of the individual. They are primarily unsocial in their motive. 
They throw upon the high school the added burden of showing to the student 
that the better body produced by better play and the greater productive efficiency 
produced by industrial training make him a better instrument for the service of 
society. 
Somewhat the same idea is expressed by a less sympathetic critic, 
who, taking as his text “America’s Public Schools are Meant to 
Make Citizens,” declares: 
The trend to-day of nearly all State or municipal school systems is determined 
by the supposedly unquestionable principle that the children must be “ taught 
what they will need after they get out of school.” Opinions differ in different 
communities about what pupils will “need” in after life; some towns think it 
dancing and music, others carpentry and cooking. But all insist on being thus 
“practical ’—with an eye either to commercial or to social success, according to 
local temper. 
The vice of this calculation is not at all in adding manual training and 
industrial features to the public-school curriculum—they ought to be added 
wherever there is room for them—but in debasing the ideal of the school from 
a public purpose, large and social, to a personal purpose small and selfish, 
The ery for “ practical education” is, unconsciously no doubt but perilously 
none the less, a cry for success-making schools in the place of nation-building 
schools—and that is simply one more guise for the everthreatening usurpa- 
tion of materialism where the hopes of the higher man and the nobler race 
demand idealism.* 
On the other hand, a distinctly hopeful sign for the vocational 
movement is the prevailing tendency to recognize it in its larger 
aspects, not as merely industrial training, but as preparation for 
life in every field of endeavor. In this respect it is a valuable part 
of the tendency to connect more closely school and life. 
The fact that the vocational movement has outgrown the merely 
industrial or trade education stage is indicated by the tendency 
  
1'The Continent, vol. 43, No, 31, p. 1065, Aug. 1, 1912.

  24 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
to apply the principle to the rural districts in the form of agricultural 
instruction. Nowhere could vocational training be better justified 
than in rural schools. In the cities vocational training may be 
viewed as an answer to the well-defined demand for better advantages 
for the boy or girl who does not take to books, or for better trained 
workers in the trades and in the homes; but vocational education 
in the rural districts ought to mean the reclaiming of a civilization. 
Proper emphasis of the vocational principle with respect to agricul- 
ture and related interests in the rural schools is already aiding 
notably in the upbuilding of the country. 
At this stage of the vocational movement, when the problem has 
become essentially that of applying accepted principles, and many 
States are considering legislation for State systems of vocational 
training, one of the most useful things is a platform of. workable 
statements based on the sum total of available experience. Such 
a program, admittedly tentative, has been drawn up by the National 
Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education, and is given 
elsewhere in this report. Like the Hanus formulation on page 9, 
it is worthy of special attention as a representation of current 
demands in a reliable and authoritative form. 
VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE, 
Closely related to the vocational education movement is that of 
vocational guidance. Speaking generally, vocational guidance, in 
the sense of directing children into occupations, is by no means a 
new thing; it is merely the attempt to systematize a process that has 
always been practiced more or less informally. The peculiarly com- 
plicated character of modern industry and the increasing peril of 
blind-alley employments have led to the demand for systematic 
selection of workers for jobs and jobs for workers. Vocational train- 
ing is meant to provide boys and girls with the kind of training 
necessary to increase their efficiency in human society; vocational 
guidance is to direct these future workers into employments not 
only adapted to their particular abilities, but advantageous for the 
_ individtal’s future and the welfare of the community. The voca- 
‘tional guidance movement has gained considerable momentum since 
the establishment of the Boston vocation bureau in 1909, even though 
it may still be, as some one has said, “little more than a body of 
good intentions without any clarified plan.” 
One of the most significant reports yet made on the subject is that 
of the Vocational Guidance Survey of New York City.t. This 
survey was inaugurated under the auspices of a joint committee 
+See 14th Ann. Rept. of the City Supt. of Schools, App. G, p. 385. 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
  SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1911-12. 25 
of the Junior League and the Public Education Association. It was 
organized for the purpose of studying the actual situation in New 
York City of children leaving school to go to work, in the hope of 
determining what vocational guidance should mean to the public 
schools of the city. The method was to examine intensively a small 
group of children in different school districts, and to relate the 
results closely to the larger group—the 19,000 children who took 
out employment certificates in Manhattan in 1911. The investi- 
gators studied the reasons for leaving school, and found them much 
more complicated than is usually imagined. In the first place, they 
found that “economic pressure” accounted for but 30 per cent of 
those leaving school to go to work. The others left for a variety of 
reasons, of which apathy on the part of the parents was the most 
conspicuous. Some chilren felt too big for school; many passively 
took it for granted that 14 was the appropriate age to leave; “ more 
of them suddenly wanted to work, they wanted the activity of it, the 
responsibility of it; they felt the approach of maturity, and wanted 
to earn money and begin to take part in the real life of the world.” 
A study of the children after they had gone.to work left the in- 
vestigators with a feeling of skepticism about the desirability of 
“guiding children into vocations.” They found that in most in- 
stances the children had not found work which meant anything to 
them, and that there was— 
an unformulated, unconscious feeling of protest against the lack of individual 
attention and training, against the military discipline and explicable tasks. 
The demand for a job “ where you can learn ” had become insistent. 
The result was that the “ Vocational Guidance Survey ” voluntarily 
changed itself into the “ Vocational Hducation Survey.” The rea- 
sons which led to this action are indicated in the following conclu- 
sions, drawn by Miss Alice P. Barrows, director of the survey: 
(1) A system of vocational guidance which would mean finding jobs for chil- 
dren under 16 would be not only futile but dangerously near exploitation, how- 
ever well meant the intention might be. The facts showed, broadly speaking, 
that there are no jobs for children under 16 which they ought to take. 
(2) It is useless to attempt to guide children into “vocations” before we 
haye more information. Neither the Vocational Guidance Survey nor any other~ 
organization has adequate information at present about the demand for work- 
ers or the opportunities for and conditions of work and training in the 20 
largest industries, not to mention the legion minor ones. 
(3) What the children want is vocational training. The kernel of truth in 
this popular movement for vocational guidance is the need of vocational train- 
ing for children. Vocational guidance should mean guidance for training, not 
guidance for jobs. Hence, under present cgnditions the interests of public- 
school children can best be served, not by the establishment of a vocation 
bureau, but by the development of vocational training.
-P-A-G-E-52
26 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
(4) Certain questions must be answered if the development of vocational train- 
ing in this country is to be sound. There have been profound revolutionary 
changes in industry. * * * ‘A study of the facts of industry is, therefore, 
the only sound basis for discovering what types of industrial training—whether 
preyocational schools, vocational schools, continuation schools, or half-time 
work in school and shop—are practicable and desirable for children between 
14 and 16 and 16 and 18 years of age. 
Iv. THE MONTESSORI METHOD. 
  The continued interest in the Montessori method of educating 
young children is significant of the open-minded disposition of 
American school men. _Even in the face of more or less unfavorable 
reports brought by later investigators of the Italian schools where 
Madame Montessori’s methods are in operation, there is an inclina- 
tion if not to accept the plan, at least to examine it sympathetically 
with a view to enriching our own educational practice. Thus Dr. 
Holmes, one of the first in this country to become acquainted with the 
Montessori work, and perfectly cognizant of certain manifest diffi- 
culties in transplanting the system, still believes “ that we do well to 
adopt a cordial, even.a credulous, attitude ” toward it, on the ground 
that it is both suggestive and promising for the future, even if in 
details it may be disappointing. Dr. Holmes sums up the character- 
istic features of the Montessori system as follows: : 
First and most important, an organization and equipment which make it 
possible to dispense absolutely with the artificial restraints commonly imposed in 
the schools and to grant children a freedom they could not have even in 
their own homes, 
Second, a plan of instruction and management which dispenses with formal 
class teaching and substitutes for it the individual guidance of the child’s own 
efforts to learn, 
Third, a series of activities and a set of materials and apparatus especially 
designed to develop children’s bodies and minds systematically, and the didactic 
objects, originated by Dr. Montessori or taken over from Seguin and others, 
for sense training and physical development. 
Fourth, a daily program which includes a large variety of social enterprises 
in which the children are trained for the duties of practical life and to which 
they may turn at almost any time if they tire of the didactic materials or 
the other formal work. Under this last category comes the hygienic care of 
the children themselves, which includes careful medical inspection and also 
vnthropometric measurements for both scientific and corrective purposes. 
Dr. Holmes emphasizes particularly the organization and environ- 
ment. A Montessori school is, indeed, he says, a “house of child- 
hood.” It is a Republic, in which the children are free citizens. It 
is this condition which permits and favors the real Montessori 
method, the method of free individual auto-education. He says: 
The fundamental difference between a Montessori school and an ordinary

  gathered in groups at set times and made to go through set activities. There 
is no lack of discipline in a Montessori school; the order is excellent, for it 
is the order of busy, happy, mutually respectful, intensely purposive little men 
and women. But there is no constraint and repression. The children come 
and go practically at will, so long as they stay within bounds and do not dis- 
turb their fellows. In short, the order is like the order of a home or a club, 
not like the order of a barracks, a man-of-war, a prison, or a school. 
Kindergartners are particularly interested in the possible develop- 
ments of the Montessori system, and the Montessori theories have 
been prominently before the kindergarten meetings of the year. In 
comparing Froebelian and Montessori methods in a talk before one 
of these meetings recently, Prof. Earl Barnes attempted to place 
Montessori historically. Wilderspin, Froebel, Seguin, Montessori, 
is his order. He shows that Dr. Montessori has taken Seguin’s 
idea and applied it to normal children. He then makes the follow- 
ing comparison of the striking differences as they appear to him: 
Froebel’s method grew out of the study of life as an ideal whole; Montessori’s 
out of a study of backward children. One rests in concepts; the other on a 
base of sense impressions. One reaches toward ultimate ideals of thought 
and feeling through symbolic types; the other offers systematic series of exer- 
cises as preparatory for the more immediate future. One keeps its exercises 
related to reality through play as in the occupations; the other draws its 
materials from real life, but teaches them as abstractions, as in buttoning 
and lacing. One provides amply for the future years, but lacks exact discipline 
for to-morrow; the other prepares for to-morrow, but lacks a vision of the 
future years. 
Prof. Barnes believes that the kindergarttéh might well absorb 
most of the Montessori system and be much the stronger for it. He 
sees a certain kindergarten weakness on the side of sense training, 
and thinks that the Seguin exercises, as adapted by Dr. Montessori, 
“would add definiteness to security of content.” 
The question, What is there in the Montessori system that we in 
America can wisely utilize in the education of our children during 
the kindergarten age? was more critically answered at the Philadel- 
phia meeting by William Heard Kilpatrick. Though agreeing that— 
in the matter of scientific attitude, in the doctrine of real individual I{berty, 
and in the insistence upon concrete life experience, the kindergarten in general 
and the conservative kindergarten in particular can learn something of dis- 
tinct value from the Montessori system— 
he frankly declares it his opinion that— 
in point of richness of material, in the matter of play and games, in the fuller 
utilization of social cooperation, of the imagination and of invention, Madame 
Montessori has much to learn from our better American practice.

  283 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
  And again: 
We have in this country a body of educational theory superior to Froebel 
and Montessori alike. If the school practice of this early age were brought 
thoroughly in line with the best that America otherwise knows, we should 
henceforth need to hear but little of Froebel and less of Montessori. 
Little can be reported of the Montessori method in actual prac- 
lice in this country beyond the palpable facts of propaganda and 
discussion. It appears to be surviving the suspicion of commer- 
cialism, and, as the foregoing discussion shows, is receiving serious 
consideration from American educators. The attempt has already 
been made in a number of cities to put the method. into practice, 
but it is entirely too early to measure results; even those who are 
making the attempt are as yet unwilling to give a definite opinion 
of its success. 
If it does nothing else, the Montessori work will be considered 
valuable for its influence in attracting increased public attention to 
the educational problems of early childhood; and in this respect its 
influence is apt to be quite as great in the home as in the school. 
The limitations of its adaptability for school use in the United 
States are carefully stated by Dr. Holmes, who is inclined to be the 
most sympathetic of the observers of the method. After indicating 
that in his opinion the Montessori method “ will make schools less 
narrow and less narrowing, homes richer in opportunities for de- 
velopment,” he continues: 
But American homes can not themselyes become Montessori schools, for, 
although it may be profitable for a good many homes to have the didactic 
apparatus at hand, no home can give its children all the freedom and the at- 
tention they would get in a “House of Childhood * * *.” Nor will most 
American homes be found willing to give up to houses of childhood so many 
educational functions as the homes of San Lorenzo have been willing to sur- 
render. The children of San Lorenzo have profited by that surrender; so 
would the children of any tenement section of our cities; so, for a time at 
least, would the children of most American homes, even those of the well-to-do; 
but except where poverty constrains both father and mother to constant labor 
and consequent neglect of their children, it is surely better for the parents, 
and thus, in the long run, better for the children, to keep within the home 
as many educational rights and obligations as they can. America will not 
look kindly upon Dr. Montessori’s plan to communize completely the great 
duty of developing persons. We are far from the day in which our economic 
and social system will permit most parents to undertake their proper portion 
of that supreme task with the necessary leisure, intelligence, and devotion; 
but to give it over to schools is not the final solution of the problem. 
This means that the very heart of the Montessori scheme can not be in- 
cluded in our use of it. 
V. TEACHERS AND THE HIGH COST OF LIVING. 
In view of the rapidly increasing demands made upon the public 
schools it is rather disheartening to consider the economic status of 
those upon whom educational efficiency ultimately depends—the
-P-A-G-E-55
  SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1911-12. 29 
teachers. The problem of teachers’ salaries is by no means a new 
one, but it has seldom been shown how serious the whole matter is in 
its larger social aspects. Teachers, like all those on fixed salaries, 
have felt the increased cost of living to a greater degree than other 
workers, and in a way that means serious social loss, since the effi- 
ciency of all producing classes of the population is so directly affected 
by the process of education. The whole problem is presented with a 
solid background of reliable economic fact in the current report of 
the committee on “ teachers’ salaries and the high cost of living,” of 
the National Education Association. 
The report is based on an investigation of five American cities in 
different sections of the country. Especially significant in the find- 
ings are the lowered stundards that inevitably follow increased cost 
of living without adequate salary advance; the lessened social effi- 
ciency of a group ef workers unable to save for old age; and the 
danger of a condition which discourages marriage and the raising of 
a family. The report brings out these points clearly and unmistak- 
ably. The scope of the committee’s report will be seen from the 
summary below: 
MEASUREMENT OF THE INCREASED COST @F LIVING. 
The United States Bureau of Labor found that in 1911 wholesale prices were 
44.1 per cent higher than in 1897. Measured by wholesale prices a teacher 
whose salary had remained fixed at $1,000 since 1897 would have had no 
greater purchasing power in 1911 than $693.76 possessed in the earlier year. 
The increase of wholesale prices has, of course, been reflected to a greater 
or less degree in retail prices generally. In the case of 15 staple articles of 
food the Bureau of Labor finds that from 1896 to 1911 retail prices increased 
50.2 per cent. Figures for the first six months of 1912 show that the upward 
flight of retail food prices, which was temporarily arrested in 1911, has begun 
again with increased rapidity. In June, 1912, retail food prices were 61.7 per 
cent higher than the average for 1896. 
CITIES INVESTIGATED. 
The communities chosen—Cincinnati, Hamilton, Denver, Atlanta, and New 
Haven—represent four distinct geographical sections of the country. In the dis- 
cussion of the topics considered in Part II of the report, numerous comparisons 
are drawn between these communities with regard to such matters as age, sex, 
educational training, experience, salaries, ete., of teachers. 
PERSONS DEPENDENT UPON TEACHERS FOR SUPPORT, 
It is frequently asserted that the salaries of men teachers are fixed with 
reference to the burden of a family, actual or prospective. To what extent 
are unmarried women teachers burdened with the support of others? 
On this question detailed data are presented for Denver. Of the 266 women 
grade teachers of that city 157, or 59 per cent, had others dependent upon 
them. The average salary of the unincumbered teacher of this group is  
-P-A-G-E-56
  30 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912, 
  $885.53, while the average amount of salary of those who are supporting others 
is $567.84 per person supported. Of the 30 single woman teachers in the high 
schools of Denver, 14 support themselves only and 16 have others dependent 
upon them for support. . These 16 support 7 persons entirely and 19 persons 
partially. The 25 married men teaching in the high schools of the same city 
support entirely 103 persons (including themselves), and 15 persons partially. 
Working out the cost of such support on the basis of adults only, it is shown 
that the 14 married women of this group with no others dependent upon them 
have an average from salary of $1,211.83 to meet their own needs exclusively ; 
the 16 unmarried women with others dependent upon them have an average from 
salary of $801.03 to spend for each adult person, including themselves; while 
the married men have an average from salary of $413.49 for the equivalent of 
each adult person, including themselves. 
That the proportion of unmarried women teachers supporting others is 
Jarge and the burden of such support heavy is shown for all cities and teaching 
groups by one of the tables in this section of the report. <A single citation will 
illustrate the nature of this material. Of the 434 unmarried women grade 
teachers in Cincinnati 264, or 60.8 per cent, are supporting others, as follows : 
28 male and 34 female minor dependents, of whom 16 are totally and 46 
partially supported; and 91 male and 303 female adult dependents, of whom 
199 are totally and 195 partially supported. Other tables show the extent to 
which this burden increases with advanced years. 
HOME OWNERSHIP, 
The percentage of married men teachers in the cities studied who own their 
homes is 57.38. How this varies in different localities is indicated by tables of 
teaching groups and cities. 
PROPERTY OF TEACHERS. 
Unmarried women grade teachers in the five cities report an average value 
of all property, real and personal, of $1,091.94. In one city the average for 
teachers of this group and sex is-less than half of this amount. Similar 
averages are presented for all teaching groups by cities. A table showing the 
number of teachers reporting property holdings of various specified amounts 
also brings out the large number who have not succeeded in acquiring, any 
property. 
Thus among unmarried women grade teachers the percentages reporting 
no property are as follows: Under 25 years of age, 67.07 per cent; 25 to 30 
years of age, 52.83 per cent; 80 to 35 years of age, 38.88 per cent; 85 to 40 
years of age, 30.87 per cent; 40 to 45 years of age, 29.19 per cent; 45 to 50 
years of age, 20.21 per cent; 50 to 55 years of age, 21.43 per cent; 55 to 60 
years of age, 14.28 per cent; over 60 years of age, 19.05 per cent. While the 
decrease in the proportion of the propertyless thus shown is gratifying, still 
the percentage of those even in the higher age groups who have acquired no 
property is alarmingly large. 
A detailed study of single women grade teachers over 50 years of age shows 
that in Cincinnati only 5 out of*66 and in Denver only-9 out of 42 such 
teachers have property in excess of $5,000, which is probably the lowest 
possible amount upon which they could retire at their own expense. This in 
spite of the fact that the two cities referred to pay by far the best salaries to 
this group of teachers. Similar figures for other groups of teachers make clear 
the necessities for teachers’ pensions.
-P-A-G-E-57
  SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1911-12, 31 
Out of 1,600-teachers of all ranks in the five cities studied only 13 were 
found to be worth over $15,000. <A detailed examination of these cases shows. 
that. nearly all owe their good fortune to sources outside their salaries as 
teachers. The common observation that teaching is not a money-making pur- 
suit would seem to be more than confirmed by the results of this investigation. 
SAVINGS OF TEACHERS DURING 1911. 
In round numbers, unmarried women grade teachers in the five cities with 
average salaries of from $550 to $900, saved from salaries in 1911 an average of 
from $30 to $90. The larger percentages saved, as salaries are advanced, indi- 
cate a provident spirit. In Cincinnati and. Hamilton, however, slightly more 
than one-third, in New Haven and Denver more than two-fifths, and in Atlanta 
very nearly two-thirds of the women grage teachers reported no savings in 
1911. The relation between this unsatisfactory condition and low salaries is. 
developed in the accompanying tables. Even among teachers of longer experi- 
ence and higher rank the proportion of nonsavers is large. Nor can the amounts 
laid aside by those who report savings for the year be considered satisfactory. 
Under existing conditions it is clear that the great majority of teachers are so 
situated that they can not save enough from salaries to enable them to retire 
at their own expense. 
LIFE INSURANCE. 
The moral obligation resting upon married men teachers to insure their lives 
is recognized by a large majority of them. In Cincinnati and Denver only 13 
out of 138 married men teachers are uninsured. The average amount of insur- 
ance carried, however, is far from adequate. Even combining insurance with 
property owned, only 4 out of the 138 married men teachers referred to above 
would, if they were to die now, leave estates aggregating over 10 times the aver- 
age salary they are now receiving. Nearly two-thirds of them would leave 
estates amounting to less than five times their average salaries. Death of the 
breadwinner in the majority of such cases would inevitably mean a sharp 
reduction in the standard of living of the survivors. 
RESIDENCE AND AMOUNT PAID FOR BOARD AND ROOM BY UNMARRIED TEACHERS. 
Rate of board differs materially in the different cities. In Denver the average. - 
weekly commercial rate*paid for board and room by women grade teachers is, 
$7.15; in New Haven, $5.42; in Hamilton, $5.15; and in Atlanta, $4.90. 
This section of the report indicates the advantage generally enjoyed by 
teachers living with parents or other relatives. The percentage of unmarried 
teachers not living with parents or other relatives is a rough index of the ex 
tent to which cities draw their teachers from outside localities. Wide differ- 
ences in this regard are noted. In all five of the cities, 28.75 per cent of 
unmarried teachers are tiving apart from parents or ‘other relatives. As age 
advances a constantly increasing percentage of unmarried women grade teachers 
are found living apart from parents or other relatives. 
AVERAGE SALARIES AND OTHER SOURCES OF INCOME OF TEACHERS, 
The purpose of this section of the report is to ascertain the amount of the 
earnings and other income of teachers in addition to their salaries. Particular 
importance attaches to the earnings derived from extra teaching or other out- 
side work, although interest on savings, etc., and income from property is also. 
considered. More than half of all the teachers in the five cities belong to groups.
-P-A-G-E-58
  32 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
adding less than 24 per cent, and nearly 90 per cent belong to groups adding 
less than 5 per cent to their salaries from extra teaching or other outside work. 
In practice, therefore, the opportunities open to teachers to supplement their 
salaries in this way are not very largely productive. Men enjoy very great 
advantages over women teachers in this respect. An outline showing the sources 
of the teacher’s outside income is also presented. ‘The overwhelming predomin- 
ance in this list of sedentary clerical and indoor forms of work is a very dis- 
quieting feature of the situation. 
TEACHERS’ EXPENDITURES. 
In general the investigation showed that teachers spend more for rent and 
clothing than workingmen. This would indicate the pressure of higher com- 
munity demands upon teachers. ‘Qhey also spend more than workingmen for 
life insurance, religious purposes, charity, amusement and vacations, and care 
of health. Grouping the following five items: (1) Dues of teachers’ clubs; 
(2) educational books; (3) fees for institutes, lectures, normal courses, sum- 
mer schools, etc.; (4) contributions to school activities; and (5) transportation 
costs due to attendance upon institutes, meetings of State and national educa- 
tion associations, etc., it is shown that the expenditures of the married men 
teachers above referred to in meeting these directly professional demands upon 
their funds amount to from 1.16 to 6.94 per cent of their total expenditures. 
Seventy unmarried women teachers report expenditures of from 1.07 to 5.14 in 
meeting these demands. In both cases the burden is heaviest upon teachers 
with smaller incomes. Board, room rent, and clothing in the case of these 70 
unmarried women teachers account for from 57.69 to 78.50 per cent of their 
total expenditures. In general it is the smaller incomes which show the higher 
percentages for these three purposes. It is evident that where so large a pro- 
portion of teachers’’ salaries is claimed for the elementary necessities of food, 
shelter, and clothing scant margin is left for vacations, care of health, self- 
improvement, and provision for the future. 
TEACHERS’ SALARIES AND SALARIES OF OTHER MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES. 
A detailed comparison between the salaries of teachers of all ranks and the 
salaries of other municipal employees in Cincinnati, Denver, Atlanta, and New 
Haven shows that in all four of these cities the compensation of grade teachers 
is not only less than that of many groups of skilled manual workers, but also, 
in numerous cases, lower than that of common or unskilled labor. It is also 
noteworthy that the highest salaries obtainable in the school service beneath 
that of superintendent (e. g., by principals of high schools, supervisors, prin- 
cipals of larger schools, etc.) are much lower than the salaries paid to heads 
of departments and many of their subordinates in the city’s service, 
VI. ACADEMIC CELEBRATIONS. 
INAUGURATION OF PRESIDENT HIBBEN. 
The inauguration of the Rev. John Greer Hibben as president of 
Princeton University took place on May 11, 1912, following his elec- 
tion by the board of trustees in January. The President of the United 
States and the chief justice of the Supreme Court were guests of 
honor. In his address Dr. Hibben described the ideal university as 
consisting of two phases—a phase in which every effort is directed 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
    SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1911-12. 33 
to the attainment of freedom, and a progressive phase of develop- 
ment in which the freedom gained in the earlier stages finds for itself 
varied pursuits and pleasures in the fields of knowledge. Speaking 
of the doctrine of prescribed and elective college studies, Dr. Hibben 
declared: 
In Princeton we have very positive convictions on this point. We believe that 
the teaching body of a university should select a consistent group of required 
studies for the express purpose of developing in the student to the highest 
degree of efficiency the full powers of his intellectual life. We believe that it is 
absolutely necessary ‘to have a certain schooling in preparation-for the re- 
sponsibilities of freedom; and that the hit-and-miss choice of an immature 
mind in new and strange surroundings, the blind groping for truth by the 
process of trial.and error, form a poor propeedeutic to the serious tasks of free 
investigation, of original thought, and of practical efficiency. 
Dr. Hibben, in his address, spoke enthusiastically of the results of 
the preceptorial method of instruction in force at Princeton, as well 
as of the promising future of the new graduate college.   
  PRESIDENT MEIKLEJOHN, OF AMHERST. 
President Hibben had been Stewart professor of logic before his 
election to the presidency. Another teacher of logic and philosophy 
was called to high administrative duties when Alexander Meiklejohn, 
formerly dean of Brown University, was inaugurated president of 
Amherst College, October 16, 1912. President Meiklejohn’s induc- 
tion into office was the occasion of an unusually brilliant gathering 
of distinguished delegates representing universities, colleges, and 
learned institutions. President Meiklejohn devoted his address to a 
consideration of the ideals of the college teacher, emphasizing par- 
ticularly the aim of the liberal college as opposed to the technical or 
professional school. “The college,” he said, “is primarily not a place 
of the body, nor of the feelings, nor even of the will; it is, first of all, 
a place of the mind.” 
Against this intellectual interpretation of the college our teachers find two 
sets of hostile forces constantly at work. Outside the walls there are the 
practical demands of a busy commercial and social scheme; within the college 
there are the trivial and sentimental and irrational misunderstandings of its 
own friends. * * * 
As against the immediate practical demands from without, the issue is clear 
and decisive. College teachers know that the world must have trained work- 
men, skilled operatives, clever buyers and sellers, efficient directors, resourceful 
manufacturers, able lawyers, ministers, physicians, and teachers. But it is 
equally true that in order to do its own work, the liberal college must leave the 
special and technical tre ining for these trades and professions to be done in 
other schools and by other methods. * * * 
One may safely say on behalf of our college teachers, that their instruction 
is intended to be radically different from that given in the technical school or 
even in the professional school. Both these institutions are practical in a 
sense which the college, as an intellectual institution, is not. In the technical   
  
 
-P-A-G-E-60
34 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
school the pupil is taught how to do some one of the mechanical operations 
which contribute to human welfare. He is trained to print, to weave, to farm, 
to build; and for the most part he is trained to do these things by practice 
rather than by theory. His possession when he leaves the school is not a stock 
of ideas, of scientific principles, but a measure of skill, a collection of rules 
of thumb. His primary function as a tradesman is not to understand but to 
do, and in doing what is needed he is following directions which have first 
been thought out by others and are now practiced by him. The technical school 
intends to furnish training which, in the sense in which we use the term, is not 
intellectual but practical. 
And elsewhere he adds: 
In the technical schoo! pupils are prepared for a specific work and are kept 
for the most part on the plane of perceptual action, doing work which others 
understand. In the professional school, students are properly within the realm 
of ideas and principles, but they are still limited to a specific human interest 
with which alone their understanding is concerned. But the college is called 
liberal as against both of these because the instruction is dominated by no 
special interest, is limited to no single human task, but is intended to take 
human activity as a whole, to understand human endeavors not in their isola- 
tion but in their relations to one another and to the total experience which 
we call the life of our people. And just as we believe that the building of ships 
has become more successful as men have come to a knowledge of the principles 
involved in their construction; just as the practice of medicine has become 
more successful as we have come to a knowledge of the human body, of the. 
conditions within it and the influences without; just so the teacher in the liberal 
college believes that life as a total enterprise, life as it presents itself to each 
one of us in his carreer as an individual—human living—will be more successful 
in so far as men come to understand it and to know it as they attempt to carry 
it on. To give boys an intellectual grasp on human experience—this it seems 
to me is the teacher’s conception of the chief function of the liberal college. 
  OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES, 
Among other inaugurations during 1912 were that of Stratton D. 
Brooks, formerly superintendent of schools of Boston, as president 
of the University of Oklahoma, which occurred October 21; and 
that of Charles H. Keyes as president of the new Skidmore School 
of Arts at Saratoga Springs, N. Y., in August. Worthy of special 
mention is the appointmeyt of Talcott Williams as director of the 
new Pultizer School of Journalism of Columbia University. 
There have been a large number of changes in executives on the 
part of institutions of college grade during the year, and at the 
present time an abnormally large number are without permanent 
heads. <A partial list of institutions of college grade where changes 
in the executive office have recently been made is given herewith,

ACADEMIC ANNIVERSARIES, 
  Mount Holyoke celebrated the seventy-fifth anniversary of its 
founding in October, 1912. Most of the leading colleges in the 
United States were represented by delegates, as well as 14 foreign 
institutions. President Mary Emma Woolley and Elizabeth Storrs 
Mead, president of the college from 1890 to 1900, welcomed the dele- 
gates, guests, and alumne. The new memorial gateway was dedicated 
on the second day of the festivities. At the auditorium exercises 
President Hadley, of Yale, spoke on “ Our colleges and their ethical 
problems.” President Thomas, of Bryn Mawr, in an address on 
“The future of woman’s higher education,” presented the cause of 
the woman seeker after education and the obstacles in her path. 
Among other things, she said: 
Women have almost won the right to study what and where they please. 
They have to-day almost equal opportunities for study. But they have not yet 
won the rewards of study. They are still shut out from the ‘incentives to 
scholarship. Over one-half of all women college graduates teach, one-third of 
all graduate students in the United States are women fitting themselves for 
higher teaching. Yet even in the lower public schools the most responsible and 
highly-paid positions are reserved for men, and in the women’s colleges only 
may women compete with men for full professorships. In all coeducational 
colleges and universities the number of women holding even subordinate teach- 
ing positions is jealously limited. Presidents of coeducational universities have 
sometimes told me that they would gladly advance women scholars were it not 
for the opposition of men teaching in the same departments. 
Even in a women’s college like Bryn Mawr there is a steady, although I be- 
lieve almost unconscious, pressure exerted by some of the men on our faculty 
to prevent the appointment of women to vacant professorships. The world of 
scholarship and research has been a man’s world. Men mistrust women’s 
ability to breathe in this keener air. And in a sense they are right: Very few 
women—or men—can maintain scholarly research and enthusiastic teaching 
throughout a lifetime without living salaries or honorable recognition. Colleges 
for women, few and poorly endowed as they are, offer the only rewards for 
women scholars. 
President Burton, of Smith College; Miss Pendleton, recently in- 
augurated president of Wellesley; and President Taylor, of Vassar, 
discussed other phases of the problem of college education.

36 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
The University of Michigan also celebrated its seventy-fifth anni- 
versary in 1912 with significant ceremonies. : 
Among secondary institutions a celebration of note was the one 
hundred and twenty-fifth aniversary of the founding ‘of Erasmus 
Hall High School, Brooklyn, N. Y., and the dedication of the new 
building. This school, now one of the New York City public high 
schools, is the oldest existing institution chartered by the New York 
State regents. Atkinson Academy, in Atkinson, N. H., one of the 
first coeducational institutions in the United States, and one of the 
oldest of the New England secondary schools, also celebrated’ its one 
hundred and twenty-fifth aniversary. 
NEW YORK STATE EDUCATION BUILDING. 
The dedication of the State Education Building, at Albany, 
should be placed among the notable educational events of the year. 
Guests were present from all over the world to witness the ceremonies 
by which New York State dedicated a magnificant specimen of 
American architecture to the exclusive purposes of public education. 
The idea behind the project is thus stated in the official announce- 
ment: 
To find the inception of the idea of the New York State education building 
one must look back to the unification of educational interests of the State in 
1804. Bringing together under one organization two State education depart- 
ments which had become radically separated was an epochal achievement. It 
was felt that there ought to be a monument to this singular accomplishment, 
and that nothing would be more appropriate than a great State building which 
would indicate to the State and to the entire world the interest which New 
York maintains in both popular and higher education. 
The State of Illinois has recently appropriated money for a State 
education building, and Indiana’s Centennial Commission is to— 
formulate plans for the celebration of the centennial of the admission of 
Indiana into the Union by the erection of a State building and its dedication 
in 1916, to be known as the Indiana educational building. 
Vil. A NATIONAL UNIVERSITY. 
The plan for a national university at the capital, first proposed in 
the early days of the Republic, and recently revived, was discussed 
at the Chicago meeting of the National Education Association by sev-. 
eral prominent representatives of higher education. 
President James, of the University of Hlinois, opened the discus- 
sion with an argument based on the eonception of education as a na- 
tional function. After showing that the organization which he rep- 
resented, the national association of State university presidents, had 
repeatedly indorsed the project of a national university, he laid down  
-P-A-G-E-63
  SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1911-12. 37 
several propositions that seemed to him fundamental: (1) That in a 
free Commonwealth education is essentially a national function; (2) 
that this country can not solve its educational problems in the large 
until it recognizes that education is the business of the Nation, and 
that petuniary assistance for its support in a large way shall come 
through the organs of the Nation as a unit; (3) that. we shall make 
vastly greater progress if we can get national attention concentrated 
upon our educational problems year after year as one of the funda- 
mental issues going to the very heart of national life. 
With these propositions as a basis he strongly upheld the idea of a 
national university. He said: 
I mean by a national university an institution sufficiently like the ordinary 
institutions with which you are all acquainted to be thoroughly familiar to you; 
a teaching and training as well as an investigating institution, manned with the 
best men in all departments in which the human intellect has exercised itself, 
drawn from the entire world, equipped with all that money can provide, for the 
purpose of stimulating and increasing our interest in the world of the spirit 
and the world of sense about us. :: 
Such an institution would not injure, but benefit every private and every 
State university. By its superior support, by its superior prestige, by its 
greater wealth, it would strike the popular imagination of this country in such 
a way as to give to the university idea itself an enormous impetus, the reflex 
effect of which would show itself in the increasing prosperity and develop- 
ment of every private and State institution. 
  President Van Hise, of the University of Wisconsin, discussing 
“A national university a national asset: An instrumentality for ad- 
vanced research,” advocated a different kind of institution. To his 
mind there was no necessity for a university of the type which ex- 
isted elsewhere, no need of an additional university like the great 
endowed and State institutions of the country. He declared: 
One who advocates a national university at Washington with the idea that 
it shall be a larger Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Cornell, or Chicago, a larger Michi- 
gan, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, or California, will fail in his advocacy, 
because he can not give to Congress a satisfactory reason for the expenditure 
of public funds for another university of a kind of which there is a sufficient 
number. 
He emphasized the fact that it is the research material in existence 
at Washington which justifies the demand for a national university. 
The real aim of those advocating a national university, he said, should 
be to make available for the advancement of knowledge the unpar- 
alleled facilities of Washington to graduate students. He cited a 
long list of institutions and bureaus at Washington where valuable 
research material exists. He showed that because of the demand 
for immediate results, for routine work, these materials, rich as they
-P-A-G-E-64
  38 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
are, “ from the larger point of view of the advancement of science are 
in large measure neglected.” He therefore proposed: 
(1) That the unapproached wealth of books and materials at Washington for 
research be made available to advanced students of the country having the 
baccalaureate degree and one year of graduate work or its equivalent” 
(2) That the scientific staff at Washington be authorized as part of its official 
duties to give a limited amount of instruction. 
(8) That an administrative division be established, the duties of which shall 
be to make the facilities of Washington known and to guide students to them. 
If desirable, this division may be made a part of the National Bureau of 
Education. . 
(4) That a student completing his work for a doctorate at Washington be 
granted his degree from the institution from which he came. 3 
(5) That existing universities cooperate in this work with the departments at 
Washington. 
In urging “A national university as related to democracy,” Presi- 
dent Baker, of the University of Colorado, expressed himself as 
distinctly favorable to the idea. He said: 
In Germany higher education is related to the State; in America the problem 
is far more difficult—to relate it to democracy. A few educated men at the head 
of affairs can value science and culture; pure democracy, in its formative stages, 
may be shortsighted, fail to see its own true goal, and even be suspicious of 
attaining it * * *. If we are to gain the respect of older civilizations, we 
must show that democracy is not superficial; that it has a high ideal of govern- 
ment; that it can be fertile in scholarship, and especially in appreciation of 
its value and service. The “glory that was Greece” will never be ours unless 
our ideal is built of spiritual elements that have given leading nations their 
place in history. If we have a boasted new form of State and society—the 
body—we must see to it that we have also the new humanism and the new ideal- 
ism—the soul. If we have a unique civilization, if we have a peculiar mission, 
then let us have an unequaled center of learning at the very heart of our 
national life, adequate to reveal that life to ourselves and to the world.   
Proceeding to a discussion of ways and means, President Thomson, 
of Ohio State University, took up the question from the practical 
viewpoint of getting something done. He showed how little appeal 
the cause of education tended to make to Congress as compared with 
other causes. He thought that the first fundamental problem, there- 
fore, was to get into the national consciousness a true conception of 
the value of a great national graduate institution that should utilize 
for educational purposes the resources of the-Government already 
accumulated and increasing every year. A second problem was to 
secure a consensus of intelligent opinion as to the general scope and 
purpose of such a university. A third step would be to agree upon a 
bill that should include a comprehensive plan of operation, followed 
by a campaign of education which would convince Congress of the 
far-reaching importance of the national-university idea.

VI. BENEFACTIONS. 
DISTRIBUTION OF THE PEABODY FUND. 
Private benefactions to American education approximated $25,- 
000,000 during the academic year 1911-12. This amount represents 
simply the amounts actually reported as paid. Many other gifts 
have been announced, some of the more significant of which will be 
found summarized below. 
The last of the Peabody Educational Fund, originally created in 
1867, was-allotted for distribution during the year. Particularly 
noteworthy among the final gifts is that of $500,000 to the George 
Peabody College for Teachers at Nashville, contingent upon the 
raising of a million dollars by November 1, 1913. In their announce- 
ment the Peabody trustees explain the great work which they believe 
Peabody College is destined to accomplish, and incidentally pay a 
merited tribute to the efforts of the South in behalf of education: 
The Southern States, with a courage and self-sacrifice rarely if ever equaled, 
are devoting every year from 35 to 40 per cent of the total amounts raised by. 
them by taxation to the education of both races, wisely recognizing that this 
is their best hope for the future. 
Disbursements from income of the Peabody Education Fund had 
amounted to over $3,500,000 on September 30, 1911. With the ulti- 
mate disposal of the principal in 1913, this fund will have yielded 
for educational purposes more than $5,500,000. 
CARNEGIE FOUNDATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF TEACHING. 
Mr. Carnegie transferred a million dollars to the trustees of the 
foundation in December, 1911, and a similar sum in May, 1912, 
bringing the total of benefactions up to $13,000,000. With accrued 
interest the total endowment amounted to nearly $14,000,000 at the 
close of the year ending September 30, 1912. The trustees reported 
an income of $676,486.56 for the year. They expended $634,496.89, 
of which $441,984.64 was for retiring allowances and pensions in the 
case of accepted institutions, $128,438.39 for similar payments to indi- 
viduals, $36,949.31 for expenses of administration, and $27,124.55 for 
educational investigation and publication. 
GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD. 
At the meeting in May, 1912, the General Education Board 
authorized the contingent distribution of $700,000 among five col- 
leges: $250,000 to the George Peabody College for Teachers, at 
Nashville, for the establishment of the Seaman A. Knapp School of 
Country Life; $100,000 to Beloit College, in Wisconsin; $100,000 to 
77236°—xp 1912—vor 1——5
-P-A-G-E-66
40 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
Coe College, at Cedar Rapids, Towa; $50,000 to Macalester Col- 
lege, at St. Paul, Minn.; and $200,000 to the University of Rochester, 
at Rochester, N. Y. Except in the case of Peabody College, where 
the gift is made part of the million dollars to be raised, the grants 
were contingent upon the raising by the institutions of a like amount. 
In addition to these sums, $210,000 was set aside for three purposes: 
For demonstration work in agriculture in the Southern States, for 
professorships of secondary education in the State universities of the 
South, and for negro education. Other conditional gifts by the 
board were: Allegheny College, $50,000 toward $200,000; Lake 
Forest College, $50,000 toward $400,000; Whitman College, $125,000 
toward $500,000. 
MILLION-DOLLAR ENDOWMENTS. 
  The extent to which endowment and income estimates for higher 
institutions have risen in recent years is interestingly indicated in 
current budgets. The income of many institutions of higher learning 
_ is now at a figure that would have been considered a substantial en- 
dowment but a few years ago. The College of Physicians and Sur- 
geons, affiliated with Columbia University, seeks an endowment of 
$7,000,000. Princeton University desires a further endowment of 
$4,000,000 in order to provide additional income to meet the present 
annual deficit in the budget. The alumni of the University of Penn- 
sylvania suggest $10,000,000 as the goal of their efforts. These 
are typical. A number of institutions, aside from those usually 
considered among the wealthy institutions of the country, are engaged 
in raising one million dollar funds. The following institutions have 
either completed or are attempting to complete such a fund: Brown 
University (the second within a short time) ; Trinity College, Hart- 
ford; Trinity College, Durham, N. C.; Western Reserve University, 
Cleveland; Goucher College, Baltimore; and Smith College, North- 
ampton, Mass.

announced benefactions to American education, or even those of a 
certain size. It is worthy of note that many institutions receive gifts 
of comparatively small amount in themselves that in the aggregate 
make considerable sums. A statistical summary of receipts from 
private benefactions is given in Volume II, page 298, of this report.

IX. INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. 
NEW OFFICIAL ARRANGEMENTS, 
International interchange in the field of education continues to ex- 
pand rapidly. Among newer professorial exchanges should be men- 
tioned that between the Universities of Chicago and Paris, to begin 
in the fall of 1913, and to take place in alternate years. At the 
University of Wisconsin, Eugen Kiihnemann, well known in this 
country for two previous visits on an exchange basis, held the first 
appointment to the new Carl Schurz professorship. In Holland 
funds have been raised for the establishment at Columbia University, 
New York City, of a Queen Wilhelmina professorship of Dutch his- 
tory, literature, and language. The Japanese interchange, under the 
Carnegie Peace Foundation, began auspiciously with the visit of Dr. 
Nitobe, president of the First Higher College of Tokyo, who spent 
about six weeks at each of the following American institutions of 
learning: Brown University, Columbia University, Johns Hopkins, 
University of Virginia, University of Illinois, and University of 
Minnesota.t 
REGULAR EXCHANGES. 
Among regular exchange professors on existing foundations the 
following are to be reported for the year 1912-13: Kaiser Wilhelm 
professor at Columbia, Felix Krueger, professor of experimental 
psychology in the University of Halle; Theodore Roosevelt professor 
at Berlin, William M. Sloane, Seth Low professor of history in Co- 
lumbia University; French visiting professor at Columbia, Henri 
Bergson, professor of philosophy in the University of Paris; Ger- 
man exchange professor at Harvard, Rudolph Eucken, professor of 
philology at the University of Jena; French exchange professor, 
Emile Légouis, professor of English at the Sorbonne; Harvard ex- 
change professor at Berlin, Dr. Charles 8. Minot, of the medical 
school; Harvard exchange at Paris, Prof G. G. Wilson, of the depart- 
ment of government. 
OTHER ACADEMIC VISITORS. 
Apart from the regular exchanges, there have been many impor- 
tant academic visitors from abroad during the past year. Julius 
Petersen, of the University of Basel, is professor of German lit- 
erature at Yale University for the academic year 1912-13. Prof. 
Jacques Hadamard, of the College de France, gave instruction in 
mathematics’ at Columbia in the autumn of 1911. Prof. Ludwig

  44 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
Sinzheimer, of the University of Munich, a prominent German econo- 
mist, comes to the University of Wisconsin for the second semester 
of 1912-18; while Prof. Richard T. Ely, of Wisconsin, goes to the 
University at London. Prof. Gilbert Murray came over “fiom Eng- 
land to wa in the revival of Greek as a school and oe study, in 
which Amherst College is taking a leading part. Guenther 
Jacoby, of the University of Greifswald, spent eas iisiiie in- 
specting departments of philosophy and psychology in American 
universities. 
The Germanistic Society of New York has been instrumental in 
bringing a number of prominent German scholars and literary men 
to this country, among them Dr, R, W. Drechsler, of the Amerika- 
Institut, Berlin; Prof. Erich von Dryghlski, of the University of 
Munich; and Prof. Edward Engel, of Berlin. Prof. Wilhelm Pas- 
kowski, who, as head of the bureau of information at the University 
of Berlin comes in contact with many Americans who go to Germany 
for study, was in this country in the spring of 1912 and made a 
tour that included many of the important centers of learning in the 
United States. 
A distinguished group of foreign scholars was. present at the for- 
mal opening of Rice Institute, including: Prof. Rafael Altamira y 
Crevea, of Madrid, Spain; Prof. Hugo de Vries, of Amsterdam, Hel- 
land; Prof. Emile Borel, of Paris, France; Prof. Sir Henry Jones, of 
Glasgow, Scotland; Prof. Sir William Ramsay, of London, England; 
and Prof. Vito Volterra, of Rome, Italy. 
A tour of peculiar interest to Americans was that of Prof. Caspar 
René Gregory, of the University of Leipzig, said to be the only 
American scholar eneee a regular professorship in a German uni- 
versity. As the guest of Chicago University and other institutions 
Prof. Gregory made an nog lecturing tour in the United States 
and Canada.    
THE PRUSSIAN EXCHANGES. 
Influential as these professorial visits between the United States 
and other nations may be they can hardly be any more so than the 
exchange of teachers between Prussia and the United States which 
takes place every year under the auspices of the Carnegie Foundation 
for the Advancement of Teaching: Both in this country and in 
Prussia the exchange teachers are given an unusual opportunity to 
see at first hand the educational conditions. For the year 1912-13 
10 American teachers have been assigned to Prussian schools and 
7 Prussian teachers to American-schools and colleges. 
The American teachers, tegether with the institution from which 
they come, their subjects, and their assignments in Germany, are as 
follows:

OTHER INTERNATIONAL VISITS. 
In the summer of 1912 a party of 350 American teachers toured 
Germany under the auspices of the German-American Teachers’ As- 
sociation. Prof. H. H. Fick, of Cincinnati, headed the party. At the 
meeting in Berlin the speakers were: Dr. Busse, of New York, on 
“The teaching of German in the United States”; Director Jospeh 
Winter, of New York, on “The future of the German language in the 
United States”; and Prof. Emil Cramer, of Cincinnati, on “ Co- 
educational schooling in America.” 
Forty foreign geographers, guests of the American Geographical 
Society of New York on its sixtieth anniversary, paid a visit to this 
country in the late summer and fall of 1912, spending two months in 
travel through different sections of the United States. In connection 
with the Seventh International Congress of Hygiene and Demog- 
raphy, held in ‘Washington in September, 1912, many distinguished  
-P-A-G-E-72
  46 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
foreign scientists and educators, who came over for the sessions of 
the congress, took the opportunity to visit American educational 
institutions. 
At the Congress of Associated British Universities, in London, 
during the past summer, the following guests from the United States 
were present by special invitation: Dr. George E. McLean, formerly 
president of Iowa State College; President Frank L. McVey, of the 
University of North Dakota; Hon. Andrew S. Draper, commissioner 
of education for New York State; and Dr. Kendric C. Babcock, of 
the United States Bureau of Education. 
The United States will be the meeting place of at least two world 
congresses of educational import in 1913. The Fourth International 
Congress of School Hygiene is to be held at Buffalo, N. Y., in August, 
1913, and the Eighth International Congress of Students (Corda 
Fratres) will be held at Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y., during the 
same month. 
THE COSMOPOLITAN CLUB MOVEMENT IN GERMANY. 
In speaking of the international movement in Germany, which 
has assumed large proportions during the past year, Edwin D. Mead, 
of the World Peace Foundation, calls attention to a new develop- 
ment growing out of the cosmopolitan clubs: He writes: 
The exchange professorships at Berlin, the international influence of such 
men as Prof. Lamprecht and Prof. Ostwald at Leipzig, and the rapid extension 
throughout all Germany of the new Society for Vélkerverstiindigung, inspired 
and controlled largely by professors in the various universities, have undoubt- 
edly done much to affect the thought and feeling of the great student body; but 
it is really a young American scholar, Dr. George W. Nasmyth of Cornell Uni- 
versity, carrying on his higher studies in Germany, who has given the direct 
impulse leading to the organization in several universities of international clubs 
like those already existing in some 30 of our own American universities. Young 
Nasmyth was the leading spirit in the great Cosmopolitan Club at Cornell, which 
now has 800 members; and carrying his enthusiasm to Germany, he prompted 
the organization of an international club among the Berlin students, which 
quickly attained a menibership of 200. Similar clubs have been established 
through his initiative in Leipzig, Munich, and Gottingen; and recently there 
was held in Gottingen a general convention of students from all of these clubs 
to discuss the various aspects of the international movement and perfect plans 
for larger activities in the German universities, in sevetal other of which efforts 
looking to the formation of international clubs are already under way. 
ASSOCIATION FOR THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OF STUDENTS. 
The Association for the International Exchange of Students, an 
organization designed to aid students in one country who wish to 
study in another, held its first conference in London, June 27-29, 
1912. This conference was devoted to a report and discussion of the 
three years’ preliminary work that has been done. Among Ameri-  
-P-A-G-E-73
  SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1911-12. 47 
can representatives present at the conference were: B. F. Kurtz, 
California; F. L. McVey, North Dakota; E. B. Greene, Illinois; 
Capt. Horgarrd and Prof. D. C. Jackson, of Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology; Prof. T. W. Edmondson, of New York. The Ameri- 
can Government was represented by William Phillips, of the Ameri- 
can embassy. The Bureau of Education was represented by Dr. K. 
C. Babcock. Many American universities are cooperating in the 
plan. At the conference emphasis was placed on the idea that the 
students to be aided by these tours are those really anxious to work; 
“idlers and globe-trotters disguised as students are weeded out at 
once,” it was announced. Lord Strathcona is president of the asso- 
ciation and Hon. Herbert W. Crees the honorary secretary. 
THE RHODES SCHOLARSHIPS. 
The year 1912 marked the tenth anniversary of the Rhodes Scholar- 
ship Foundation. The book by Prof. Parkin, who is in active charge 
of the administration of the trust, shows that the exchange has not 
yet passed the experimental stage. Particularly in respect to the 
United States, the scholarships are still of somewhat uncertain status. 
What Prof. Parkin says on this subject is of distinct interest to 
Americans: 
The problem of devising a satisfactory system, generally applicable for the 
election of scholars, has presented greater difficulties in the United States than 
elsewhere. The reasons for this are various. For one thing, the 48 States 
and Territories to which the scholarships are assigned differ greatly in the de- 
gree and completeness of their educational organization. In a few States the 
universities can stand comparison in endowment, equipment, number of students 
or professors, and range of intellectual interest with the best of the Old World; 
in others the agricultural college or technical institution is only beginning to 
be developed into a State university with broader teaching aims. In some an 
admirable system of elementary schools leads up to the university; in others 
it is still difficult to get the thorough preliminary training necessary for real 
university work. 
A further complication is introduced by the extraordinary number of col- 
legiate and university institutions which have the power to grant degrees, and 
do this on standards and courses so various as almost to defy reliable compari- 
son between the scholars they turn out * * *, 
In a few States the development of higher education is still largely under 
political control, and is subject to political influences. In one case a State 
election swept away, as the result of a party victory, the whole committee of 
selection, consisting of the leading educational men of the State. Under such 
circumstances, the only course open to the trust was to take the selection of the 
scholars into its own hands until the conditions were radically changed. 
With regard to the athletic provision, which Cecil Rhodes made 
one of the features of his bequest, Prof. Parkin says: 
Certain well-defined conditions have made it difficult to apply in some com- 
munities the athletic tests suggested by Rhodes, if at the same time due regard

is paid to other essential interests of the scholarship scheme. In the univer- 
sities and colleges of the United States athletics have become a highly special- 
ized side of student life. Instead of thousands of men taking an active part in 
the college sports, as is the case at Oxford and Cambridge, or the hundreds of 
boys with whom it is compulsory in the great English public schools, the interest 
of the games is concentrated upon_.a very limited number of men who compose 
the college teams. The pressure brought upon these teams to maintain the 
athletic reputation of their institutions is very great, and success is pursued 
with an energy very unfavorable to other work and in something closely akin to 
the professional spirit. I have been constantly told by educational authorities 
in the United States that college athletics were not favorable to the production 
of the all-round man whom Rhodes evidently had in his mind. In a less degree 
circumstances somewhat similar are met with in some of the colonial com- 
munities. 
CHINESE STUDENTS AND THE REVOLUTION. 
An interesting light on the development of international student 
relations is shown by the following statement of the former minister 
from China: 
Most of the leaders of the revolution either received their education or got 
their ideas of republicanism from America. Dr, Sun, the originator of the revo- 
lution, got much inspiration from the United States, where he sojourned so 
many years and where he found not only complete safety, but sympathetic 
encouragement, while a price was on his head. The Hon. Mr. Tang Shao-yi, 
our great peace commissioner, was one of the 120 young men who first came to 
America some 30 years ago. The Hon. Dr. Wu Ting-Fang, at the age of 78, 
who is well known in America, is often called a Yankee. Then we find in the 
revolutionary government at Nanking the Hon. Dr. Chin-Tao Chen, minister of 
finance, and the Hon. Chung-Hui Wang, minister of foreign affairs, who are 
graduates of Yale. And so down the list ware a large number of American- 
educated students in the Revolution. That is not all. In the assembly it was 
also the American-returned student who held the rudder. The first chairman of 
that representative body, for instance, was the Hon. Mr. Chao 8. Bok, a gradu- 
ate of New York University; and the vice chairman, who was also the ablest 
speaker of the House, was the Hon. Mr. Chengting Wang, another graduate of 
Yale. Then there were scores of others from American universities, such as 
Harvard, Chicago, Wisconsin, Illinois, and California, who played important 
parts in the revolution. In the Provinces as well we find the American-edu- 
cated students in every center of activity, with their sleeves rolled up to their 
elbows, working in true Yankee style. 
The bandful of young men who received their education from America have 
already shown the Chinese people, and the world as well, what they have 
learned from their colleges. What is more significant is that which may be ex- 
pected hereafter from the hundreds and hundreds of Chinese young men now 
found in every important educational institution in the whole United States. 
For it is in America that we have the largest number of students in any single 
foreign country outside of Japan; and it is also here that the young Chinese 
learn the American push and the business spirit. They always remember their 
universities and colleges with gratitude. ‘These memories have done them good, 
and in return they have done credit to their alma mater.*

ConvEntTs.—Legislative conditions in the several States.—State boards and officers.—County boards and 
officers —Municipal school boards.—School finances.—Business methods.—School boards.—School 
buildings.—Teachers: Examination and certification; salaries and tenure; pensions.—Normal schools.— 
Compulsory attendance.—Child labor.—Transportation and consolidation.—Textbooks.—Play

agriculiure and the industries.—Addendum: Higher educational ins‘itutions; professional schools; 
professional practice; schools for special classes; welfare of children; dependents and delinquents. 
LEGISLATIVE CONDITIONS IN THE SEVERAL STATES. 
The legislatures of 13 States were in session during the year 
1911-12, namely, Arizona, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mary- 
land, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Jersey, New Mexico, New 
York, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Virginia. In but few of 
them were the enactments of more than passing importance. In 
Arizona and New Mexico the sessions were the first since the admis- 
sion of those States to the Union, and the legislation in them covered 
a wide field; although the Territorial laws continue in effect after 
admission until repealed or superseded, many considerations demand 
that each State upon assuming the political toga virilis shall overhaul 
and furbish its code. 
‘ Arizona.—In Arizona an extra session was added to the regular 
legislative term in order to accomplish all that was desired. Prac- 
tically an entirely new educational code was enacted in a single bill; 
and in addition a stringent child-labor law was adopted, and a free 
textbook law and a pension law were enacted that are remarkable 
for their simplicity and originality. 
New Mezxico.—The legal achievements of New Mexico were not so 
comprehensive as those of Arizona, but they were numerous and 
valuable nevertheless. The provision of a reserve fund, following 
the requirements of the State constitution, was, under the circum- 
stances, an act of real statesmanship. The purpose of the fund is 
to equalize school privileges throughout the State, and the means by 
‘which that end is accomplished is worthy of more than passing 
notice. The situation there will be discussed more fully on a sub- 
sequent page.

  50 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
Louisiana is the only State other than Arizona in which a general 
law was passed amounting to a comprehensive revision. Appar- 
ently it was primarily for the purpose of consolidating and simpli- 
fying existing laws, and that result was well accomplished. But it 
did a great deal more. It abolished several State boards of an 
auxiliary character, centering their functions in the State board of 
education; it increased the dignity and responsibility of the parish 
school boards; it gave New: Orleans a new plan of school govern- 
ment; it introduced the budget system of finance; and, most 
important of all, it provided a thorough and well-considered system 
of teachers’ examinations and certificates under State authority. 
Kentucky.—in Kentucky at least as much was accomplished as in 
any other of the older States, and the activity of the legislative com- 
mittee of the State educational association must be credited with a 
large share of the responsibility for the result. This committee was 
constituted in June, 1910, and proceeded actively to investigate the 
needs of the school system. A series of excellent suggestions was 
prepared and submitted to the two convocations of county superin- 
tendents in 1911. After full discussion and mature deliberation a 
report was presented to the full meeting of the association in June, 
1911, and it was unanimously adopted. Unquestionably it repre- 
sented the sense of the teaching profession in the State, and its 
influence is unmistakably visible in the bills that finally passed. 
New York.—tThe situation in New York in 1912 was in marked 
contrast to that of the two previous sessions. In 1910 the ‘“educa- 
- tion law” was revised throughout in connection with the general 
revision of the code. The result was not wholly satisfactory to the 
officers of the State education department, and in response to their 
wishes another revision was enacted in 1911. The work was thor- 
oughly and carefully done, and, the same officers with the same 
policies being in charge, little was desired of the legislature of 1912. 
New Jersey.—In New Jersey, too, unusual productiveness in 1911 
was followed by a decrease in the number of important bills passed 
in 1912. In this case, however, there was no lack of activity, and 
the reduced output did not result from the prevalence of serenity 
and quiet. A series of laws passed in 1911 provided a reorganization 
of the State board of education, and in effect a complete readjustment 
of the relations between the State and the local school authorities. 
A far greater degree of centralization was contemplated, and in order 
to attract a man of the highest type to administer the new system a 
salary was provided for the new State commissioner of education 
which is greater than any other State school officer in the United 
States receives. 
Unexpected difficulties were encountered in the accomplishment 
of some of the reforms that were conceded to be desirable, and natu-
-P-A-G-E-77
  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1912. 51 
rally there was strong opposition to some of the changes in organiza- 
tion. Naturally, too, the following session of the legislature, that 
of 1912, was marked by strenuous attempts to undo, at least in part, 
the work of its predecessor. In one particular the attempts were 
successful, and the provision for uniform examinations for graduation 
from the grammar school was so changed as to be unrecognizable. 
In other respects, however, there was no lessening of centralization, 
and the new law relating to county superintendents seems in reality 
to strengthen the authority of the State. 
Massachusetts.—A number of useful bills were passed by the Massa- 
chusetts General Court, but none of them was of striking character. 
The incident that excited most interest outside the State was in con- 
nection with the appropriations for the Massachusetts Agricultural 
College. In his inaugural address the governor discussed the relation 
of the State to higher education, and spoke with gratification of the 
excellent character of the universities and colleges under private 
control in the State. These, in his opinion, make it unnecessary to 
maintain a university at State expense, as most of the other States 
do; but he recommended the establishment of a system of State 
scholarships, and suggested the annual appropriation of $50,000 in 
order to maintain 400 of them. 
Subsequently a bill was presented to him after passing both houses, 
in which $250,000 was appropriated for the development of the 
agricultural college. He declined to sign the measure, and returned 
it with a special message in which he reiterated his views concerning 
scholarships. He held that expansion of that institution would be 
equivalent to the establishment of a State university, contrary to 
sound policy. He expressed the belief that the agricultural college 
should devote all its energies and its appropriations to agriculture, 
and that instruction in the liberal arts should be left to established 
private institutions. His arguments, however, did not prevail, and 
the bill was passed over the veto. 
Rhode Island.—Little that concerned the schools took place in the 
Legislature of Rhode Island in 1912. There is some relation, of 
course, between the extent of a State and the volume of its legisla- 
tion, and Rhode Island and Delaware would not be expected to be as 
prolific in laws as New York and Texas. The demands of individual 
communities with diverse interests necessitate many local laws, or 
laws that are essentially local in their application, though expressed 
in general terms; and naturally from many minds come many ideas. 
Other things being equal, therefore, a half million people may be 
expected to continue satisfied with a given condition of affairs longer 
than 5,000,000 people would be. But diversity of interests and the. 
law of probability based on numbers are not the only factors that 
determine the relative number and extent of legal changes. A more 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  
  52 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
important factor is the length of tenure in administrative offices, 
and most important of all are habit and tradition. A State superin- 
tendent elected for a two years’ term is in office during only one 
session of the State legislature. He feels either that the time is too 
short for him to do more than to continue in the ways of his prede- 
cessor, whether good or bad; or else he realizes that he must do a 
great deal, now or never, to impress his individuality upon the school 
system, and incidentally to justify his own reelection. The latter 
course is attempted oftener than the former; human nature is con- 
stituted that way. The result is inevitable. Laws are urged, and 
often enacted, which are not based upon mature experience and 
consideration; and the next superintendent will have the opportu- 
nity of recommending the necessary amendment or repeal. Unde- 
niably this process serves to keep many legislatures busy; and that 
is the least of its evils. 
Rhode Island is preserved from periodical changes due to this 
cause, but the paucity of its educational legislation is due more to 
the customary manner of drafting laws and to the traditions of the 
people. The laws that are passed are usually brief, and general in 
their terms. The State board of education or the local school com- 
mittees are permitted to supply the details. Changes in those details 
may be made with little formality to suit changing conditions, and 
the result is a system. that is markedly elastic and effective. 
Virginia.—In. Virginia the new laws for education were few and 
unimportant. There was no lack of friendliness on the part of the 
legislators, but there seemed to be no need of radical amendments. 
Perhaps the most important act was that relating to taxation upon 
the rolling stock of railroad corporations. By that law 75 per 
cent of the receipts of such taxes is apportioned to the districts 
through which the roads respectively pass. This will add materially 
to the income of some rural districts. 
In the remaining States, namely, Maryland, South Carolina, Geor- 
gia, and Mississippi, laws were enacted in great number and variety. 
Some of them were of considerable importance, but nearly all were 
of local application only. To such extent does the habit of special 
legislation prevail in those States that one who considers only the 
general laws included in the published codes fails to gain a correct 
understanding of the educational situation. 
Georgia.—The ease with which local laws may be secured in Georgia 
obviates the need of general legislation in most cases. If a good idea 
is advanced and finds favor in a certain community, that community 
may readily, as a rule, secure legislative consent to its adoption, and 
-need not disturb other communities in doing so. There are over 80 
districts organized under laws of their own choosing, and neariy 
every modern idea in constructing a separate school system may be 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1912, 53 
  found in some one or more of the special laws of the State. Many 
of the organizations are excellently constituted, and constant improve- 
ment is manifest throughout the State as good ideas prove their worth 
in practice. Four counties have been organized as units, each under 
a special law, one having been added to the number in 1912. 
Maryland.—In Maryland there are numerous local laws, but they 
do not take the form of separate district organization as in Georgia. 
Outside of Baltimore city, the county plan of organization prevails 
throughout the State, and this plan is not disturbed. But it is com- 
mon for individual counties to be excepted from general laws, and 
for special laws to be passed affecting single counties. Some of them 
even instruct county officers as to their action in certain particulars 
which are ordinarily left to local determination. 
In addition to numerous local provisions three laws were enacted 
that were of general interest. The first was a comprehensive child 
labor law, extending fourfold the statute previously in force; the 
second was a well-drawn compulsory attendance law, applying to 
Baltimore and to those counties whose school commissioners adopt 
it, six counties being excepted; and the third was an appropriation 
of $600,000 at once and $50,000 annually for a school of technology 
in connection with Johns Hepkins University. 
South Carolina.—The final distribution of the fund of the abandoned 
State dispensary system was an event of interest in the legislative 
session of 1912. The act in favor of consolidation of schools and 
transportation of pupils marks a distinct advance; and the change 
of the date upon which new county superintendents assume their 
duties has a significance and importance not apparent on its face. 
Mississippi.cThree general measures were urged by the State 
superintendent of public education, and all were enacted, namely, 
(1) authorizing transportation of pupils at public expense; (2) em- 
powering county boards of supervisors to issue bonds for the erec- 
tion of school buildings in rural communities, and to levy taxes to 
provide fuel, etc.; and (8) making additional appropriations for 
agricultural high schools. All these laws will be discussed in a 
subsequent paragraph. 
STATE BOARDS AND OFFICERS, 
The composition and duties of State boards of education present a 
constantly recurring problem. No matter how constituted, it is 
difficult for any set of men, meeting at intervals of about three 
months, to keep in touch with the details of a complicated and exten- 
sive system of schools, and to act effectively at practically a moment’s 
notice upon highly technical matters. The difficulty is vastly= 
increased when the board is expected to perform purely executive 
functions. If the members convene in a perfunctory way and merely
-P-A-G-E-80
  54 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
follow the recommendations of the superintendent, the feeling is 
apt to prevail that they are useless. If, on the contrary, they assert 
their authority and venture to dictate to the trained educator in 
the office of State superintendent, who is in constant contact with 
the schools and is far more familiar with their needs than the board 
members could possibly be, they are almost certain to arouse antago- 
nism and create friction. The situation is usually far more delicate 
for State boards than for local boards, because the latter are in closer 
touch with the schools under them and they have more direct power 
over the superintendents whom they employ. 
Whatever the cause, it is a fact that the State board is a part of 
the educational machinery which it is difficult to adjust and keep in 
adjustment. There are few States in which suggestions for change 
are not made from high quarters with considerable frequency, and 
that, too, without regard to the type of board that prevails. For 
example, the superintendent of public education of Louisiana desires 
to exchange the board appointed by the governor of that State for 
one whose members shall be elected by the people;! the governor of 
Kentucky proposes? to supplant the ex officio board of Kentucky 
with one whose members shall be in part laymen and in part profes- 
sional educators, most of them to be appointed by the governor. It 
is by'‘no means uncommon to note the demand in one State for a 
certain type of organization, when some other State is moving at 
thesame time to “reorganize” a board of substantially the type 
desired by the first. 
Several instances of reorganization were reported in 1911, but no 
radical changes were made i in 1912, unless the Arizona board may 
be considered changed because it is different from the former Terri- 
torial board. As it is now constituted it consists of the governor, 
the State superintendent, the president of the State university, the 
principals of the two State normal schools, and a city superintendent, 
a high-school principal, and a county superintendent appointed by 
the governor. 
In Louisiana, notwithstanding. the superintendent’s suggestion, no 
change was made in the manner of selection, but one member was 
added because of the increased number of congressional districts, one 
being appointed from, each district. The terms of appointed mem- 
bers in New Mexico were reduced from five to four years, and the 
reverse of the process was enacted in Rhode Island, for in that State 
* the terms were fixed at five years, with the provision that = terms 
of one-fifth the members should expire each year. 
An important change was made in Louisiana in abolishing the 
@ tate textbook commission, the State board of examiners, and the 
1 In his Annual Report for 1910-11, p. 45. 2 In his message to the legislature, 1912. 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1912, 55 
State board of institute managers. The functions of all of these 
boards were transferred to the State board of education. Undoubt-' 
edly the change will make for simplicity and for directness in han-, 
dling public business. The actual work in each case was necessarily 
done by subordinates; and the board of education can furnish direc- 
tion for all of them and thus avoid the multiplication of boards and 
the consequent diversity of ideas. The board of education will 
employ “an examining commitee’” and a State director of institutes, 
and no substantial change of method is necessarily implied. by dis- 
continuing the superfluous organizations.  - 
The State superintendent.—While there is frequent discussion of 
the proper constitution and functions of the State boards of educa- 
tion, there is never any doubt of the value of the work of the State 
superintendent. The importance of the office constantly increases. 
New duties and responsibilities are steadily added, and larger sala- 
ries are offered to attract and hold men of the caliber to make the 
position in fact as well as in name the head of the State educationat 
system. - But it is still unfortunately true that in many cases the 
superintendents of the large cities and the heads of all the important: 
institutions in % State receive considerably higher salaries and have 
far more certain tenure than the man who is nominally their officiak 
superior. 
A still more anomalous condition appears in several States’ im 
which supervisors of elementary schools, of rural schools, or of high 
schools, named by the State superintendent and presumably acting: 
under his direction, receive several hundred dollars annually more 
than the State superintendent. Their salaries, however, are not paid 
by the several States, but by the General Education Board. 
Such anomalies must soon disappear. The tendencies are all in 
the direction of increasing the dignity, responsibility, and salary of 
the State superintendent. The legislation of 1912 contained many 
instances in point. For example: 
The commissioner of education of Massachusetts was authorized 
(ch. 80, Feb. 12) to approve bills for expenditures from funds placed 
under the direction of the board of education. 
The State commissioner of education of New Jersey now appoints: 
all the county superintendents of that State (ch. 367). He is charged’ 
with the administration of the law (ch. 336) providing higher educa- 
tion for the blind at State expense. He was also directed (ch. 152, . 
Mar. 25) to determine and certify to the educational qualifications: 
of applicants for admission to medical colleges. 
The State superintendent of public instruction of Virginia was. 
charged with similar duties (ch. 237, Mar. 13) in connection withe 
medical colleges. 
77236°—xp 1912—vo. 1——6
-P-A-G-E-82
56 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
In Kentucky it was enacted (ch. 13, 1912) that the State superin- 
tendent of public instruction shall act as special State inspector and 
examiner of all schools in the State which receive public funds; for 
this service he shall receive $1,500 in addition to his present salary; 
he shall appoint two assistants at $1,000 each per annum, with their 
expenses of travel; he shall be allowed also $2,000 additional for clerk 
hire. In a vague and general way the superintendent probably had 
already the power given to him by this law, but it is now definite and 
specific, and the additional help will enable him to perform his duties 
in an effective manner not possible hitherto. And the $1,500 added 
to his salary will prove to be a difference that is very real. 
COUNTY BOARDS AND OFFICERS. 
Legislative activity in behalf of county superintendents proceeds 
at an even greater rate than for State superintendents. There is 
need for it. In few States is the recognition accorded to this office 
commensurate with its importance; but the prospect is continually 
brightening. The action of the New Jersey Legislature in fixing the 
salaries of all county superintendents at $3,000 (ch. 367, Apr. 2) is 
the most encouraging event of the year in this conne@tion. Yet that 
salary is no more than is necessary to hold men of sufficient ability 
to do the work acceptably. That city is poor indeed which does not 
pay its superintendent as much. High-school principals often receive 
more, and New York City pays that salary to its elementary-school 
principals. The problems of the county superintendent are as per- 
plexing and his need of ability and maturity is surely as great as any 
of these. Furthermore, the physical difficulties with which the 
county superintendent must contend are incomparably greater than 
those which any city official ordinarily meets. 
The county superintendent in New Jersey is in reality a State officer, 
since he is appointed by the State commissioner of education and his 
salary is paid from the State treasury. He must, however, have been 
a resident of the county at least three years. This provision was” 
clearly inserted to retain the local element in the control of the 
schools and to avert the possibility that a nonresident commissioner 
might fill the State with nonresident superintendents not in sympa- 
thy with local views and needs. It is probably not difficult to find 
men in any county of New Jersey who are worth $3,000 as superin- 
tendents. Nevertheless, it is contrary to the principle that is con- 
* stantly gaining favor, that the best man available should be selected 
for every position regardless of boundary lines. 
Next to New Jersey, Kentucky has taken the most commendable 
«step of the year in relation to county superintendents. It was enacted 
(ch. 117, Mar. 18) that to be eligible to the office candidates must   
1 By a later law county superintendents may be chosen from any part of the State.
-P-A-G-E-83
  
  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1912, 57 
hold a State diploma or certificate, or else must be personally exam- 
ined at the State capital before the election, the examination being 
equivalent to that for a State teacher’s certificate. Superintendents 
shall devote their entire time and attention to the duties of the office, 
and their salaries shall be not less than $600 nor more than $2,500. 
Assistants may be provided in the discretion of county boards of 
education. Kentucky’s minimum seems pitifully small as compared 
with New Jersey’s $3,000, but the rate of advance was no greater 
in the one State than in the other, and the difference means even 
more to the southern than to the eastern State. 
Arizona, too, provided substantial increases for her county super- 
intendents, and according to the new schedule (ch. 93, May 21) two 
will receive $2,400, two $2,000, and two $1,800. Only two will 
receive less than $1,000. Assistants are provided for some of them, 
and traveling expenses are allowed to all. 
In South Carolina several special laws extended the terms of 
officers of certain counties from two to four years. An act (No. 386, 
Feb. 20) applicable to all but 19 counties provided that the terms 
of all superintendents should begin July 1. Such laws as these, none 
of them applicable to the entire State, have in the aggregate greatly 
improved the conditions of supervision in South Carolina in the past 
few years. 
The last-mentioned law, simple though it seems, is expected to be 
especially beneficial. In effect, the old law, under which the super- 
intendent’s term began January 1, practically barred teachers from 
the superintendency. For them election to that office meant idleness 
for a half year before the beginning of supervisory work, and for 
another half year after the completion of the term. They could not 
accept a teaching position pending the assumption of the superin- 
tendency, and they could not find one vacant in the middle of the 
school year upon leaving the county office. It is said that teachers 
refused, therefore, to offer themselves as candidates for the work in 
which their services were especially desired. A different attitude on 
their part is expected in the future. 
In Georgia it was enacted (Laws 1912, p. 180) that the terms of 
all county superintendents shall begin simultaneously January 1, 
1918, and continue four years. Evidently the difficulties experienced 
in the neighboring State are not feared in Georgia, for it may be 
presumed that a mid-summer date might have been specified if it 
had been considered desirable. 
The parish school boards in Louisiana appear (Act No. 214) to have 
gained authority at the expense of the parish superintendents. The 
changes, however, do not seem to have been intended to deprive the 
superintendent of his legitimate functions, but rather to relieve him 
of certain nonprofessional duties and to make the county board a

more active factor in school affairs. The board upon its own initia- 
tive now fixes the number and salaries of teachers; repairs, equips, 
and furnishes buildings; sells property, etc. All these formerly 
required the recommendation of the superintendent. Nomination of 
teachers is still the duty of the superintendent, but by a vote of two- 
thirds of the full membership the board may elect a teacher without 
the nomination of the superintendent. Furthermore, the superin- 
tendent himself may be removed by a two-thirds vote of the board, 
that power having been transferred to them from the State board of 
education. 
MUNICIPAL SCHOOL BOARDS. 
The time is rapidly passing for city boards of education whose 
members are elected as representatives of the several wards. When 
it is considered that few legislatures were in session, an unusually 
large number of city boards were reconstructed during 1912. In 
only two of them was the local-representative plan retained. 
New Orleans afforded the most conspicuous instance of reorganiza- 
tion. Formerly the board of school directors of that city consisted 
of 17 members, 1 elected by the voters of each of the wards of the 
city. By the new law (Act No. 214) the number is reduced to 5, and 
they are elected from the city at large for terms of four years. Three 
members constitute a quorum. 
The boards of the four Kentucky cities of the second class—namely, 
Lexington, Covington, Newport, and Paducah—were reorganized by 
the same act (ch. 137). The plan adopted for Louisville in 1910 is 
closely followed. A board of education is provided for each city, 
consisting of five members elected from the city at large. A super- 
intendent will be elected first for a two-year term, and if reelected 
it will be for four years. He may be removed for cause by a vote 
of three members of the board, and he may be dismissed at any time 
by a vote of four members. A business director will handle the 
material affairs of the schools and will act also as secretary of the 
board. The tax for schools must be not less than 3 mills. 
The citizens of Salem, Mass., were permitted (ch. 559) to determine 
by ballot whether to retain their old charter or to choose one of two 
new forms of government, the first consisting of a mayor and a 
council of seven members, and the principal feature of the second 
being a commission of five members. The school provisions were 
the same in both the new forms; they were characterized by a school 
committee of five, elected at large. 
Similarly, the question of the composition of the school committee 
was presented (ch. 341) to the qualified voters of New Bedford, Mass. 
The proposal contemplated a school committee consisting of the
-P-A-G-E-85
  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1912, 59 
mayor and six elected members. If the act is adopted, the school 
committee will have entire control of the school buildings and grounds, 
an important change in that city. 
With certain exceptions, city boards of education in New Jersey 
will in future be appointed by the several mayors, and they will con- 
sist of five members each in cities of fewer than 45,000 inhabitants 
and of nine members in larger cities. 
New Mexico also provided for small city boards, and it was enacted 
(ch. 43) that the board of education of each incorporated city shall 
consist of five members elected at large. Formerly the members of 
all such boards were elected as ward representatives. 
Providence and Woonsocket, R. I., are the two cities in which the 
old method of selection is retained in new laws. In the former city 
(ch. 863) three members will be elected from each ward, and in the 
latter, two will be elected from each of four districts. 
A number of small cities and towns in Georgia received new school 
charters in 1912, and a great variety of forms of organization were 
represented. One county, Clarke, with Athens as its capital, was 
organized as a single district. 
SCHOOL FINANCE. 
No other feature of legislatic: affords a more interesting study than 
the appropriation bills and related measures. In them the charac-'! 
teristics of the several States appear conspicuously; they tell the 
story of progress in terms that leave no doubt, for one may be sure 
that he sees there the bare facts, not an expression of hope. They 
are not by any means prosaic reading when their full significance is 
appreciated, when they are studied from year to year, when each 
State is compared with the others. Pathos may be often seen ill-con- 
cealed in stilted legal phraseology; and sometimes bits of grim humor 
appear, which may or may not have been so intended by the legis- 
Jators. The appropriation bills of 1912 contain even more than their 
share of interesting provisions, and the temptation is strong to dwell 
upon them at greater length than the limits of this paper will permit. 
The final act of South Carolina’s effort to control the liquor traffic 
by handling it herself is written in the law (No. 566) ordering the dis- 
tribution within 30 days of the last money remaining in the dispen- 
sary fund. The history of the experiment is as exciting as a French 
romance, but the end was placid to a degree: The schools received 63 
cents per pupil. 
In Maryland it was provided (ch. 113) that before the proceeds 
of the State school tax are apportioned, $4,000 per annum shall be 
withheld and delivered to the Garrett County school board. The 
reasons are set forth at length: Garrett is the largest county in the 
   
-P-A-G-E-86
  60 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
State; mountain ridges divide the population, and render school facili- 
ties more expensive than in other counties; the tax rate required to 
maintain schools for 74 months is therefore unduly great. So the 
other counties generously contribute to her aid before receiving their 
own share. 
In other forms the same thing is done in many other States. The 
dispensary money in South Carolina, just mentioned, will be used in 
part for a similar purpose. The provision of a reserve fund in the 
constitution of New Mexico, and the legislation of 1912 (ch. 51) 
following its requirements, have been already mentioned briefly. 
The conditions of New Mexico are well known; the population is 
small and scattered; a large proportion of the inhabitants are Indians 
or of Mexican descent, and many of them speak Spanish exclusively; 
large areas are practically rainless, and the possibilities of agricul- 
ture are limited. Educational progress is therefore attended with 
unusual difficulty. 
In 1910 there was no school in 84 districts; 6 others had only one 
month of school, and 258 had two or three months. The average for 
the Territory was 44 months. The need of effective aid for weak 
districts is therefore imperative, and the provision made is more 
generous than any other State has seen fit to allow. Perhaps it is 
more than will be needed. One-half the entire eurrent school fund, 
consisting of the receipts from a State tax of 14 mills and the income 
from the permanent fund, is set aside as a reserve fund. It is dis- 
tributed according to their needs to those districts which can not 
maintain school for 5 months with the maximum tax of 15 mills, 
The maximum to be allowed to any schoolroom is $300, allowing 1 
room to each 50 children, or fraction thereof, in a district. 
Mississippi also has appropriated a fund of $5,000 annually (ch. 5) 
to be used in aid of weak districts which are unable to maintain 
school for 4 months. 
It is not practicable to present in a paper like this an analysis of the 
regular appropriations, profitable though it would be. It may be 
said, however, that increases are general all along the line. Higher 
institutions in many States have fared particularly well. In no case 
has a lack of friendliness to educational interests been reported. 
BUSINESS METHODS, 
Laws constantly appear forbidding public officers to contract debts 
in excess of their resources. Several of them were enacted in 1912. 
They have a good effect to be sure, but it is ordinarily very difficult 
to enforce the penalties provided. In South Carolina, for example, 
notwithstanding the prohibition in the law (sec. 1777), 342 of the 
1,916 districts in the State reported deficits aggregating $64,590.
-P-A-G-E-87
  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1912. 61 
In Arizona and Kentucky new restrictions were imposed upon the 
administrators of certain State educational institutions, but the 
restrictions of Arizona were in effect nullified by the provision that the 
appropriations may be exceeded if necessary to provide food and 
clothing for inmates. This is, of course, a beneficent qualification; 
its only weakness is that a wise treasurer or trustee, if his funds are 
short, will be careful to spend his cash for other purposes which he 
considers necessary, and postpone his bills for food and raiment to a 
more convenient day. 
The Louisiana Legislature approached the matter from a different 
direction and prescribed the budget system for all school organiza- 
tions (Act No. 214). The budget of revenues shall in no case include 
any sum which is not reasonably certain to be received, and the 
budget of expenditures shall never exceed the budget of revenues. 
The budget of expenditures shall show anticipated expenditures in 
detail, and no item of indebtedness not included in the budget shall 
be paid by the treasurer under penalty of personal liability, enforce- 
able by any taxpayer before any court of justice. No provision is 
made for a revision of the budget during the year, except in relation 
to receipts from unexpected or contingent sources not included in the 
original budget. This system has manifest advantages, but perhaps 
it will be modified in practice, either with or without formal legisla- 
tive sanction, so that sums not required for certain items may be 
applied to unforeseen contingencies. 
SCHOOL BONDS. 
As usual, a large proportion of the legislation of 1912 was im rela- 
tion to school district bonds. Much of it was of the petty character 
that the bond issues demand to an extraordinary extent. Nothing 
else in the field of school administration presents so many perplex- 
ities and causes so many aggravating controversies as the issue and 
sale of bonds. These evidences of debt exist as negotiable securities 
for the life of a generation, and they are usually sold and resold many 
times before the day of final redemption. A thousand contingencies 
arise during the life of a series to affect their status. The officers who 
issued them are almost invariably dead or out of office from some 
other cause before the bonds mature, and the issuing district itself 
may have been reorganized out of existence in the meantime. It is 
essential, therefore, that every minute detail of the law be observed 
in order that payment-may be assured beyond the possibility of a 
doubt. Otherwise the “securities” are not secure, and they are 
without value in the market. 
A law authorizing any bond issue is always drawn with care, and 
all the steps of procedure are set forth as clearly as possible. Never- 
theless, the probability of error on the part of some one is very great, 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
62 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
  for not all school officers are trained in the minutie of the law and of 
finance. If not observed and corrected in time, an error, apparently 
trivial though it may be, usually causes a series of vexatious delays 
or controversies, frequently leading to the courts or requiring addi- 
tional legislation. 
The practice prevails in North Carolina and Virginia of lending 
certain moneys of the State permanent fund to school districts under 
proper conditions. That plan seems to be an excellent one. It 
avoids the pitfalls that surround the sale of bonds in open market, 
and in a most effective way it simplifies the problems of financing 
schoolhouse construction. There is never a question of the validity 
of a loan, and there is no doubt of the sufficiency of the security, for 
the State board of education is in a position to control both sides of 
each transaction if necessary. The plan may be commended for 
wider adoption. 
The use of bonds as an aid to schoolhouse construction is a recent 
development in the Southern States. Even yet there is no legal 
authority for such action in Florida, and in other States the provisions 
are very inadequate. The reason for this is to be found in the manner 
in which the public school system developed in that section. In the 
beginning of the public school systems the States frequently subsi- 
ized private schools, and that practice, which still exists in some of 
the States,! often avoided the necessity of building at public expense. 
The districts were not accustomed to provide schoolhouses by tax- 
. ation, and naturally did not feel the need of bond issues in the earlier 
stages of their development. In recent years, however, all the 
devices of school administration have been utilized more freely in the 
South, and the advantages of distributing capital expenditures over 
a series of years have been generally realized. 
In Georgia “local tax districts” were authorized (No. 537, p. 176) 
to issue bonds, if approved by a majority of the qualified voters. 
The Mississippi Legislature went still further and authorized (ch. 159) 
county boards of supervisors to raise money on bonds for building 
schoolhouses in rural districts. 
Another provision of the latter law affords an interesting side light 
upon the customs of many parts of the South. It permits county 
supervisors to levy a tax in any district, when requested to do so by 
the majority of taxpayers thereof, for the purpose of providing fuel 
and paying incidental expenses. It has been customary in the past 
_to raise money for such purposes by collecting an incidental fee from 
each pupil, and a long step in advance is indicated by this law, even   
1In Maryland the act of Apr. 11, 1912 (ch. 583), authorized the county school commissioners of Frederick 
County to pay $250 annually to the Sisters of Charity of St. Euphemia’s School for educating colored chil- 
dren. In Georgia, in 1911, the schools were operated 140 days; the “free term” was 114 days (40th An. 
Rept. Dept. of Education, 1911). 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1912, 63 
if its terms do not presage general adoption. It will probably be 
many years before the incidental fee is entirely a thing of the past in 
the South. 
SCHOOL BUILDINGS. 
Satisfactory laws for issuing bonds must necessarily wait on com- 
plete provision for local taxation. This is still a desideratum in 
some of the Southern States, but the energy with which the problem 
is attacked promises early improvement. 
State funds may ordinarily be used for teachers’ salaries only; it is 
expected that buildings and material equipment shall be furnished 
by local action. The degree of effectiveness of local tax laws, there- 
fore, is shown most clearly in the condition of the schoolhouses. And 
it is in this that the rural schools show their greatest deficiency. 
State appropriations to aid local boards in building and improving 
houses have proved to be a stimulus of great value. The experience 
of Alabama with an annual appropriation of $67,000 was discussed 
in the Annual Report of 1911. A similar favorable result for a like 
appropriation is reported from South Carolina. The sum of $20,000 
was made available in February, 1912, and the entire amount was 
exhausted by the middle of April. Nearly all the buildings for which 
State aid was given, 89 in number, were in country districts, and 
none of them would have constructed without that stimulus. Never- 
theless, the amount contributed by patrons and local trustees was 
14 times as much as the State appropriations. 
A novel addition to the machinery of school administration is 
reported from Kentucky. By the act of March 11, 1912 (ch. 30), 
upon the application of 250 householders in any county, the county 
judge must appoint a “building school commission” of four mem- 
bers. This commission shall direct the construction and equipment 
of all schoolhouses erected in the county. All matters relating to 
the purchase or condemnation of sites are confided to them, and they 
will handle all moneys received from the sale of school bonds. Plans 
for buildings, however, must be approved by the county board of 
education, and title to property is vested in that body. 
The movement for wider use of schoolhouses continues to progress. 
Kentucky is the latest State to authorize such use of buildings, and 
the act of March 13, 1912 (ch. 67), opens the doors to lawful assem- 
blages of educational, religious, agricultural, political, civic, or social 
bodies. The existing law to similar effect in Massachusetts was 
broadened (ch. 320) to permit the collection of admission fees. In 
every instance the means of egress must be approved by an inspector 
of public buildings before any schoolroom or hall may be used for 
such assemblages.

TEACHERS. 
EXAMINATION AND CERTIFICATION. 
State systems of certification were provided in the two general 
school laws passed during 1912, namely, in Arizona (ch. 77) and in 
Louisiana (No. 214). The methods are substantially similar in both. 
Question papers are prepared by a committee of examiners and sent 
to the county superintendents; who conduct the examinations and 
return the papers to the State examining committee. Those per- 
sons grade the papers, and all certificates are issued by State author- 
ity and are valid throughout the entire State. This is the plan 
which experience has shown to be the most effective; it has been 
adopted in all the States in which there has been serious legislation 
upon the subject within recent years. 
Formerly examinations were conducted in Louisiana by “ parish 
examiners,” and certificates were good only in the county of issue, 
unless the papers were examined and the certificates indorsed by 
the proper officers of another county. In addition to the parish cer- 
tificates, there was a series of State certificates conducted by the 
State board of examiners. 
The new law of Louisiana upon the subject (No. 214) does not 
specify the subjects of examination for the several grades of certifi- 
cates, but directs the State board of education to determine them. 
It is unusual to give this power formally to the State board, but it is 
nevertheless a proper provision, since it tends to elasticity and there- 
fore to good administration. In reality it adds nothing to power 
already given, for the nature of the questions asked and the manner 
of rating actually determine the worth of any certificate, notwith- 
standing the lists of subjects incorporated in the laws. 
SALARIES AND TENURE. 
It is not often that a maximum is fixed for teachers’ salaries, but 
that has been done in Kentucky for rural elementary schools. Chap- 
ter 117, Laws of 1912, provides that not over $70 a month and not 
less than $35 shall be paid for such service, and that the amount 
paid shall be based on and regulated by the qualifications of the 
teacher and the number of children in attendance in proportion to. 
the school population. Regulations by which salaries shall be 
graded must be promulgated by the State board of education. 
All this has the aspect of novelty, and it will be interesting to 
observe the operation of the law. No appropriation is provided by 
which salaries may be raised to comply with the regulations if local 
funds are not sufficient, but there is a clause authorizing county 
boards to combine State and county funds. It is not clear whether 
that affects the salary question; but it is a fact that Statefunds may
-P-A-G-E-91
  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1912. 65 
be used for teachers only. It will be remembered that in Pennsyl- 
vania, and perhaps in other States, a minimum salary is fixed and a 
State fund is used to maintain that minimum. 
Several laws were enacted in Maryland providing minimum sal- 
aries in individual counties, and in all cases the amount specified was 
from $100 to $150 greater than the prescribed minimum for the 
entire State. All these laws provided that the county boards of 
commissioners shall levy additional taxes to cover the expense. 
Another law (ch. 138), general in its application (excepting Garrett 
County), reduced the number of pupils necessary to bring a school 
within the minimum salary provisions; now every white teacher of 
a school whose average attendance is 10 (instead of 15) or more 
shall receive at least $300 per annum. 
The climate of Arizona is well known to be favorable to persons 
afflicted with tuberculosis, and many teachers are included in the 
number of persons so affected who have gone to Arizona in search 
of health. Naturally, some of them have found places in the public 
schools. This, however, will no longer be permitted, and the law of 
March 16 (ch. 37) forbids the payment of salary to any person 
suffering with that disease. Periodical physical examinations are 
required at the discretion of the school board. 
In relation to tenure of position, the paragraph concerning New 
Orleans, La. (Act No. 214), is the only new law of general interest 
that appeared during 1912. It provides that all teachers now in 
service shall be regarded as permanent employees, and none of them 
shall be removed except on written charges of immorality, neglect 
of duty, incompetency, malfeasance, or nonfeasance, of which he 
has-been found guilty after investigation and report according to the 
regulations of the board of directors. Marriage of a female teacher, 
however, at once vacates her position. Appointments in the future 
shall be for one year, but after three years’ satisfactory service the 
appointment shall be permanent. 
PENSIONS. 
. Arizona.—To the new State of Arizona must be accorded the dis- 
tinction of having a retirement law (ch. 95) that is by far the best 
in the United States. It is best, first, because it provides a reason- 
ably adequate annuity, namely, $600 a year; second, because it does 
not reduce salaries under the fiction of ‘assessments,’ but provides 
that all annuities shall be paid direct from State funds; third, 
because it is State wide in operation and avoids all controversies 
concerning the place of service and the proportion of individual 
pensions which certain districts should pay; fourth, because there 
is no complicated administrative machinery, the control of the entire 
matter being in the hands of the State board of education and the  
-P-A-G-E-92
  66 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
superintendent of public instruction; and, fifth, because its sim- 
plicity and the absence of restrictions permit its application to any 
deserving case. Practically the only limitation is that the annuitant 
shall have served 25 years in the public schools of Arizona; all the 
rest is in the discretion of the State board of education. 
No other law possesses all these good points in combination. In 
Rhode Island and Maryland the principles of State control and direct 
payments by the State are observed, but in neither State is the 
annuity so nearly adequate and in neither is such large discretion 
given to the administrative board. In any system and under any 
plan of retirement the judgment of some officer or of some board 
must finally decide who shall retire and when. Uniform policies are 
desirable in this, and the State board of education is the body upon 
which such decisions should logically rest. 
Many existing laws provide that after a given number of years of 
service any teacher shall be retired upon his own application. Per- 
haps such a clause would improve the Arizona law. On the con- 
trary, it may be said that many teachers are still able to render 
valuable service after 40 years’ experience, and in such case the inter- 
est of the State should prevail over the wish of the individual. In 
any event, the board that decides fairly a disability case after 25 
years’ service may be trusted to decide as fairly upon the application 
of one who has served 15 years longer.* 
The Arizona statute requires that each claim for quarterly pension 
shall be approved by the superintendent of public instruction before 
payment. This is clearly for the purpose of guarding against pos- 
sible imposition by persons retired for disability. Al such laws must 
make some provision for the removal from the rolls of pensioners 
who have recovered from their former disability; and the State 
superintendent or the State board of education is presumably the 
proper authority to control the matter. Between the two there is 
little difference, inasmuch as the superintendent is the right hand of 
the board. 
Virginia.—This matter arose in Virginia also during 1912, and it 
was enacted (ch. 329) that either the State board of education 
or the State board of health may examine a disability pensioner 
at any time, and shall examine each one at intervals of three years. 
If either board decides that disability no longer exists, the pension 
shall cease. There is no reason why the board of health should not   
1A letter from Hon. C. 0. Case, State superintendent of Arizona, dated Apr. 9, 1913, contains the fol- 
lowing: 
“The board of education at its meeting Sept. 7, 1912, granted the application of Misses M. A. Tyrrell, 
Mary E. Post, and Sue H. Summers to be placed upon the retired list after service of more than 25 years 
in the public schools of Arizona. 
“An age limit of 60 or 65 years was urged by some of the legislators, but as the matter of retiring a teacher 
after the 25 years’ service is optional with the board, it is not expected that any will be retired as long 
as their services are valuable to the State. 
“Only the three applications have been made, each being a worthy subject for a position.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1912, 67 
be asked for advice in such cases, and it would not be amiss, per- 
haps, to give to that board positive duties in making examinations 
desired by the board of education; but the alternative provisions of 
the Virginia law can not be expected to prove satisfactory. In 
effect, since either board may examine, neither must. Presumably 
a working agreement will be made by the two boards; otherwise 
the law must be amended to prevent duplicating examinations in 
some cases and omitting them in others. 
> Maryland.—The Maryland retirement law was amended in 1912 
(ch. 135) so as to give the State board of education more direct con- 
trol and a wider discretion in its administration. The board is 
authorized to waive the age limit of 60 years in extraordinary cases; 
and pensions in future will be paid by the treasurer of the board 
instead of by the State treasurer. 
New Jersey.—Two pension systems have been established by laws 
of New Jersey and exist side by side. Both are State wide, but 
neither is properly a State system. One is based upon the assessment 
plan, with only nominal aid from the State treasury, although public 
officers are on the managing board; the other is purely local, each 
district being required to retire teachers on half pay after 35 years’ 
service, 20 of which must have been in the district. It is significant 
that the latter system is rapidly developing. Formerly retirement 
depended on the application of the beneficiary, but by the act of 
March 13, 1912 (ch. 58), the local boards of education may retire 
eligible teachers without application. 
It is not to be expected that the two systems will continue indefi- 
nitely, and it remains to be seen what form the inevitable consoli- 
dation will assume. It may be that a general State pension system 
is presaged by the act of April 1, 1912 (ch. 323), providing for the 
retirement on half pay of officers and employees of penal and reforma- 
tory institutions. This development would be an easy transition 
from the present conditions. 
New York.—The New York law relating to pensions for teachers 
in State institutions was amended in 1912 (ch. 293), making it 
decidedly more favorable to its beneficiaries. The former age limits, 
namely, 70 years for retirement on application and 65 years on recom- 
mendation of a board of trustees, were removed. Service in teachers’ 
institutes may count toward the 30 years’ service required, and it 
is no longer necessary that 10 years’ service shall immediately precede 
an application for retirement. Furthermore, the maximum allow- 
ance is fixed at $1,000 per annum for teachers as well as for principals. 
Local laws.—In addition to these laws of general application, 
retirement funds based principally upon assessments were established 
for Baltimore County, Md. (ch. 83), Alleghany County, Md (ch. 463), 
Louisville, Ky. (ch. 129). All were drawn along familiar lines.
-P-A-G-E-94
  68 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
A little out of the ordinary course of events, however, were the 
Maryland law (ch. 818) directing the county commissioners of Balti- 
more County to pay to Blanch Paxton Baldwin, “an afflicted ex- 
public school-teacher,” an annual pension of $200, and the law of 
the same State (ch. 45) authorizing the school commissioners of 
Washington County to pay Amanda Barr a pension of $200 per 
annum. The preamble of the latter act explains that the beneficiary 
was a faithful teacher for 35 years, and was during that time totally 
disabled. She has been incapacitated for work since 1909. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
No new normal school was established in 1912, and excepting the 
usual appropriations, which seemed to be a little more generous than 
usual, there is little to record of legislation concerning them. The 
New Jersey Legislature did pass a bill (ch. 369) establishing an addi- 
tional normal school, but failed to follow the act with an appropriation, 
and the act was necessarily a nullity. 
An appropriation of $126,500 was made (ch. 26) for the new normal 
college at Hattiesburg, Miss., and the institution should begin under 
favorable auspices. Further preparations were made for the removal 
of the Maryland State Normal School from its old site in Baltimore. 
The building commission was directed to sell the property of the 
school at La Fayette and Carrollton Avenues and to use the proceeds 
in the construction of buildings upon the new site. It was also 
authorized to raise $600,000 by the sale of bonds for the same purpose. 
In Massachusetts the normal schools received more than their usual 
share of attention. In addition to several bills of local importance 
relating to individual schools, a general act (ch. 79) was passed con- 
cerning the business affairs of allof them. Criticism has been directed 
in the past to the manner in which accounts were kept in some of the 
institutions, and in order to produce uniformity it was enacted that 
receipts from pupils for board and from ail other sources shall be paid 
monthly into the treasury of the Commonwealth. All claims for ser- 
vices and bills for food and supplies shall be audited and paid as other 
claims against the State are paid. This means, of course, that all 
the financial transactions of the normal schools shall be handled in 
Boston. 
The old question of whether it is the duty of the State to train 
teachers for service in cities again arose in Massachusetts, and the 
State board of education was directed to investigate and report 
whether the Boston Normal School should be transferred to the State. 
COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE, 
Kentucky.—One of the important features of the report of the 
legislative committee of the Kentucky Educational Association was 
its insistence upon “an efficient compulsory education law.”’ In this
-P-A-G-E-95

respect different laws have governed the cities of the several classes 
and the common school districts. The acts relating to the munici- 
palities have been improved from time to time, and seem to be 
reasonably effective; but in the rural districts there could have been 
little of compulsion that was worthy of the name. Even if the 
machinery of enforcement had been of the modern type, the com- 
pulsory term was too short to be of much value—only eight weeks. 
The agitation initiated by the committee resulted in the passage 
of a law (ch. 96) requiring that attendance shall continue each year 
during the entire session of the public schools, but under it the com- 
pulsory period is from 7 to 12 years of age, instead of from 7 to 14 
as before. Teachers are required to report to the district trustee 
promptly and regularly the names of parents who fail to send their 
children to school; and the school trustee shall prosecute the offend- 
ing parents in the county court. 
It remains to be seen whether this law will prove altogether “ effi- 
cient,” but it is a great improvement over the old statute, and the 
teachers’ committee may count its passage as a distinct achievement. 
The principle of State-wide compulsion has been recognized, and 
it may be confidently expected that its application in detail will be 
made more and more effective as the years add experience in its 
operation. 
Maryland.—Another “border State” attacked the game problem 
in an entirely different way (Md. Laws 1912, ch. 173). Maryland 
is no more ready for a full measure of compulsion than Kentucky, 
but the Maryland constitution does not prohibit local laws upon 
general subjects, as the constitutions of Western States generally 
do, and it is possible there to enact stringent laws applying to com- 
munities which desire them, exempting communities which desire 
exemption. 
-The difference between the two types of organization are well 
shown in the new compulsory laws of the two States mentioned. 
The Kentucky law is very moderate in its terms, but it applies to all 
the counties in the State; the Maryland law, on the contrary, is much 
stronger, but it applies immediately to Baltimore city only, exempts 
six counties outright, and is left optional with all the other counties. 
Adoption, however, will mean real enforcement, for attendance 
officers must be employed and no halfway measures will be tolerated; 
the law has a businesslike ring that argues well for its effectiveness. 
Four counties had actually put the law in operation before Novem- 
ber, 1912, and two others were planning to enforce it in 1913. The 
matter was still under consideration in five counties, three had not 
considered it at all, and three had decided adversely.'

  70 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
CHILD LABOR. 
Arizona.—When Arizona has become a manufacturing State like 
Massachusetts, a mining State like Colorado, and an agricultural 
State like Missouri, she will still be able to boast a child-labor law 
that meets every requirement of her complex civilization, and she 
need not amend her present law in the meantime. The act of May 
13, 1912 (ch. 32), bears in every paragraph evidence not only of 
legal acumen, but of a thorough knowledge of the enactments of 
other States; it avoids the weaknesses and adopts the strong points 
of all of them; the occupations permitted or prohibited at the several 
ages are graded with the utmost nicety and with rare judgment, 
although many of them may not be seen in Arizona within the life 
of this generation; its methods of enforcement are ideal; the penalties 
are well adjusted to the gravity of each offense; and without hesi- 
tation or reservation it may be said that the newest State in the 
Union has a law to govern the employment of its children that is 
at least the equal of that of any other State in the Union. In short, 
Arizona enacted the ‘uniform child-labor bill’ advocated by the 
National Child Labor Committee. It only remains to enforce it. 
Exactly 37 children under 16 years of age were employed in the 
industries of the Territory of Arizona in 1909.1 
Maryland.—An equally comprehensive statute, that is practically 
all new, was enacted in Maryland (ch. 731, Apr. 11). It was appar- 
ently homemade, but it, too, shows clearly the influence of the Child 
Labor Committee, and well it might, for the work of that organiza- 
tion is worthy of the highest commendation. One must go back 
to the days of Mrs. Mary H. Hunt in her prime to find a parallel 
to the extent and effectiveness of its legislative activity. 
Like the Arizona law, the Maryland statute is ahead of the times, 
for it presupposes conditions in relation to compulsory school attend- . 
ance that exist in only a few counties; but it is none the worse for 
that, and it may be instrumental in bringing about a wider extension 
of the attendance law. It may even be so enforced as to be in a 
measure a compulsory attendance law of itself. It is plainly the 
intent of the legislature to make it a real law and not a mere ornament 
to the statute books, for the appropriation for enforcement was 
increased from $8,000 to $12,000. 
Mississippi.cThe southern legislatures are more amenable to 
arguments for child-labor legislation than for compulsory attend- 
ance. In this history repeats itself, for the same was true of New 
England in the early days. A law was enacted in Mississippi (ch. 165, 
Mar. 16) that is excellent in many of its provisions, although it will 
probably be less effective in operation than it would be if special

officers were provided for its enforcement. Nevertheless, it indi- 
cates an awakening public sentiment that will undoubtedly develop 
with the increase of manufacturing. 
Mississippi, however, is still essentially an agricultural State, not- 
withstanding the boll weevil and the discouraging condition of the 
sugar market. The largest city in the State had fewer than 25,000 
inhabitants in 1910, and only four others had more than 10,000. 
There are few child-employing industries in the State; 14 establish- 
ments manufacturing cotton goods, and 11 canneries, constitute 
nearly the entire list. The child-labor problem can not, therefore, be 
rated as of transcendent importance, and the law that was passed 
must be deemed a reasonable response to the demand that existed. 
Massachusetts. —In the States that really have a child-labor problem 
the laws have developed, as a rule, to the point of effectiveness, and 
the legislation in them in 1912 was generally of supplemental char- 
acter. Perhaps the most significant of the new enactments was the 
Massachusetts law (ch. 706) providing for a commission to fix the 
minimum wages of women and minors. It was provided also (ch. 96) 
that seats shall be furnished for women and children employed in 
manufacturing, mechanical, and mercantile establishments. 
New York.—The legal hours of labor for minors employed in 
factories in New York were reduced (ch. 538) as follows: For males 
under 18 years of age and females under 21, maximum, 54 (instead 
of 60 hours per week, 9 (instead of 10) hours per day. Females 
under 21 shall not work before 6 a. m., nor after 9 p.m. It was also 
enacted (ch. 333) that every child who applies for an employment 
certificate shall be examined by a medical officer of the local board 
of health to determine the fitness of the applicant for the work he 
intends to do. 
Messenger laws.—In the cities of South Carolina which contain 
more than 5,000 inhabitants it is now unlawful to employ any child 
under 14 as a messenger, or to employ any minor under 18 in that 
capacity between 10 p. m. and 5 a. m. (ch. 405). In Rhode Island 
no minor under 21 may be similarly employed during the same 
hours (ch. 814). The laws of Arizona and Maryland, already dis- 
cussed in this section, include ‘‘messenger clauses” as a matter of 
course, similar in their purport to those of South Carolina and Rhode 
Island. 
TRANSPORTATION OF PUPILS AND CONSOLIDATION OF SCHOOLS. 
New Jersey.—What seems to be the most effective arrangement 
yet devised for handling the matter of transportation is included in 
chapter 141 of the Acts of New Jersey, 1912. 
It will be remembered that at least three-fourths of all the money 
expended for public education in that State passes through the State 
77236°—xp 1912—vor 1——7 ‘

  72 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
treasury. A county tax, uniform over the entire State, provides the 
sinews of the system. It is called the “State tax” and is paid into 
the State treasury and, although it is sent back to the counties from 
which it came, it is subject to apportionment by the county superin- 
tendent, who is really a State agent. 
The new law provides that 75 per cent of the cost of all transpor- 
tation of pupils shall be paid from the “State funds,” and the neces- 
sary amount shall be withheld by the county superintendent before 
making the apportionment to the districts. The entire matter will 
be under the control of the county superintendent, for he must 
approve the necessity, cost, and method in every case. 
Tn effect, therefore, transportation in New Jersey is a State and not 
a local matter. Under the direction of such highly qualified men as 
county superintendents are required to be; with favorable conditions 
of population; with level country and good roads; and with no lack 
of money for every proper purpose, it may be confidently expected 
that there will be developed in New Jersey a system of transportation 
‘without an equal in the country. It is difficult to imagine any 
important factor that is lacking for complete success. 
Kentucky.—An adverse court decision in Kentucky was the cause 
of the complete cessation for a time of all transportation of pupils at 
public expense in that State. No constitutional objection was raised 
to the practice, but it was held that no action had been taken by the 
legislature that could be construed as authorizing any expenditure of 
public money for the purchase of wagons or for pupil transportation. 
The objection was speedily met, and the act signed March 18, 1912 
(ch. 117), left no doubt of the intention of the lawmakers. County 
boards of education were authorized to consolidate districts, and to 
submit to the voters thereof the question of levying additional tax 
for the purposes of transportation. It was provided that any funds 
available for local expenses might be used for transportation, whether 
specifically so stated or not. 
South Carolina.—An act to provide for consolidated and graded 
schools (No. 497), which became a law on February 26, 1912, proved 
to be immediately beneficial and stimulating. By its terms any 
strictly rural district may receive from the State $300 per annum if 
it maintains a well-housed and well-equipped school with 3 or more 
certificated teachers and at least 75 pupils enrolled. A district simi- 
larly equipped as to building and furniture, but with only 2 teachers 
and 50 pupils enrolled, may receive as State aid $200 per annum. The 
State fund may in any case be used for transportation if the county 
superintendent approves the arrangements. 
The total appropriation for this purpose was $15,000, and it was 
apportioned almost immediately. Fifty-eight communities in 20 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
  
  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1912. 13 
counties shared in benefits, and it was necessary to decline 42 other 
applications. The State superintendent is highly gratified at the re- 
sult and desires at least $40,000 for the same purpose in 1913.1 
Like results have followed a similar appropriation in Virginia, and 
the allotment for rural schools of 2, 3, and 4 rooms was increased in 
1912 from $25,000 to $75,000 per annum. 
TEXTBOOKS. 
Men unfamiliar with the practices of others in handling long-stand- 
ing problems, when confronted with those problems sometimes devise 
surprisingly direct means for attaining results that had previously 
been reached only through complicated processes. An instance of 
this has been cited in the teachers’ pension law of Arizona, a State 
whose officers were without experience in the practical conduct of 
pension administration. Another instance equally striking may be 
found in the free textbook law (ch. 72, May 18, 1912) of the same State. 
In a few concise paragraphs the whole knotty problem of textbook 
supply is solved at a stroke. The simplicity of the thing is such that 
one wonders after it is done why it had never been done before, The 
State board of education adopts a series of books for the entire State 
and buys them; the county superintendent orders from the board 
what his estimates show that his county will need, and he supplies the 
district trustees, who in turn supply the pupils. Payment is made 
from the State school fund before apportionment, and the books 
remain the property of the State. What could be more simple? 
There is no question of the prices to be paid by districts or pupils, no 
requirements for supply depots, no need of stern penalties for failure 
to use adopted books, no difficulty in enforcing the State course of 
study—none of those complications which produce almost endless 
chapters of laws every year. If free books are the proper policy, and 
if State uniformity is desirable, then Arizona has the ideal system. 
PLAYGROUNDS. 
The idea of directed play has so far received attention princi- 
pally in those States in which the school systems have reached a 
stage of advancement which makes it possible to devote time and 
money to matters of the second order of importance. In the South 
the elemental needs still hold attention. More comfortable build- 
ings must be constructed; more trained teachers must be secured; a 
longer school term must be provided; the negro must be more ade- 
quately instructed. All these require earnest work and money—a 
great deal more than the present resources furnish—and playgrounds 
must wait their turn. Besides, southern cities as a rule are not

-P-A-G-E-100
  14 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
compactly built; in most of them there is no lack of vacant space for 
play, and the country is “the open country,” indeed. 
It is not surprising, therefore, to find that in the year under con- 
sideration all legislation for playgrounds was confined to the States 
of the East. None of the laws was of especial importance, for nearly 
all of them were supplemental in character. In Massachusetts, towns 
of over 5,000 inhabitants were authorized to vote to maintain one or 
more public playgrounds and to acquire land for the same (ch. 223) ; 
in New Jersey the mayors of certain cities were empowered to ap- 
point municipal playground commissioners without reference to or 
confirmation by the respective city councils; in Rhode Island the 
city council of Providence was authorized to provide for a board 
of commissioners to manage the playgrounds of the city. All these 
laws are of the sort that come from time to time after an idea is well 
rooted. They are for extension and improvement of detail rather 
than for original establishment. On the other hand, in Maryland, a 
_“ border State,” which as a whole is like the South in its sentiment 
and like the North in its prosperity, formal recognition was given to 
the playground movement by the provision that land may be con- 
demned for playgrounds or for other school purposes, as well as for 
building sites. The maximum area that may be condemned for a 
school was fixed at 5 acres instead of 1 acre (ch. 532). 
HIGH SCHOOLS, 
New Mewico—Except in New Mexico and Arizona there was no 
general legislation of importance in 1912 in behalf of high schools of 
the standard type. The New Mexico law (ch. 57) is of more than 
usual interest, for it is unique in some of its provisions. It contem- 
plates the establishment of a county high school in any county of 
more than 5,000 inhabitants, upon the approval of the majority of 
the electors of the county. The control of each school is vested in 
the board of directors of the district in which the high school is 
located, but the county superintendent is an ex officio member. That 
board may levy a special tax not exceeding 2 mills upon all the 
property in the county and must use the receipts thereof only for 
the maintenance and operation of the county high school. The site 
and building must be furnished by the district. All children of the 
county who have completed the eighth grade may attend gratis. 
The course of study of every county high school must include manual 
training, domestic science, the elements of agriculture, and com- 
mercial science. 
More than one county high school may be established in a county, 
and in that case the receipts from the special tax must be appor-

tioned between the schools on the basis of the number of pupils whe 
attended at least half the regular sessions of the previous year. 
Avizona—tThe Arizona high-school law has little in common with 
that of New Mexico. In Arizona the district, not the county, is 
the unit. Any district with 200 pupils or more in average attendance 
may establish a high school, and two or more districts may unite for 
the purpose. The course of study must in each case be approved 
by the State board of education, and the qualifications for promotion 
from the eighth grade to the high school must be prescribed by the 
same body. ° 
AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
It is indicative of current thought that the topic which occupied 
the attention of legislators in 1912 more than any other was voca- 
tional training, in the form of either agriculture, the mechanical in- 
dustries, or domestic economy. The “commercial branches,” which 
received so much attention a few years ago, are rarely mentioned 
in recent laws, although they do appear occasionally as a further 
evidence that the typical American course is the resultant of many 
ferces applied in the form of widespread “movements,” each of 
which has exerted a permanent influence. e 
To trace these movements is to study the history of American 
education. In a measure they seem to recur in cycles, taking, per- 
haps, a different form at every appearance. While each is in the 
ascendant it fairly monopolizes the discussions in gatherings of 
teachers, fills the educational journals, and affects legislation both 
directly and indirectly. Education after the manner of Fellenberg 
at Hofwyl was a leading topic in the early years of the nineteenth 
century. The monitorial system of Bell and Lancaster followed hard 
upon its heels, and was the vogue for many years. Gymnastics held 
sway at the beginning of the second quarter of the century, and was 
followed in turn by manual labor schools, grading, physiology and 
hygiene, professional supervision, training of teachers, light gym- 
nastics of the Dio Lewis sort. During the Civil War, naturally, no 
study was pursued so zealously as military drill. 
Afterward came agricultural colleges, compulsory attendance, com- 
mercial education, the kindergarten, temperance instruction, Swedish 
gymnastics, manual training, nature study, Herbartianism, educa- 
tional psychology, and many others. All were “fads” in the begin- 
ning, but nearly all became substantial realities in their permanent 
impress upon the country’s schools. With us to-day in full vigor 
are vocational training in its several forms, and the Montessori 
method.
-P-A-G-E-102
  76 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
Agriculture has had its turn at least as often as any other subject. 
It was the principal feature in the schools of the Fellenberg type; 
it was the favorite pursuit in the manual labor schools, which were, 
in fact, inspired by Fellenberg’s ideas; it was the prime purpose of 
the institutions established under the Morrill Act in imitation of the 
Michigan Agricultural College; and it now dominates the vocational 
education movement to such an extent that it is usually considered a 
thing apart. No branch is vocational to a greater degree than agri- 
culture; the same considerations apply equally in the advocacy of 
training in agriculture and of training in the mechanic arts. Yet 
the agricultural side of vocational training shows such preponder- 
ance that in popular use the term “ vocational ” is usually applied to 
the mechanical industries alone. For the sake of convenience, agri- 
culture is ordinarily treated as a matter entirely distinct from voca- 
tional education. 
. 
LAWS FOR THE “ RURAL UPLIFT.” 
Agriculture in the schools is but a part of the general “ rural 
uplift.” movement, the manifestations of which are of common 
knowledge. It is interesting to note how that movement affected 
legislation in 1912, and how the general interest in the conditions 
#of farming communities has brought forth measures for their amelio- 
ration. The most. comprehensive action was taken in Maryland, 
where the legislature provided for a commission, to be known as 
the “Maryland Country Life Commission,” to investigate the prob- 
Jems of country life and to suggest policies and legislation for the 
benefit of farmers (ch. 742). In this the Maryland Legislature 
followed the example of President Roosevelt in constituting the 
“country life commission,” whose deliberations attracted so much 
attention a few years ago. 
No other investigation of like scope was initiated in 1912, but a 
number of specific laws were passed which tended to accomplish the 
ends desired in Maryland. In Louisiana the “police juries” of 
the several parishes were authorized to maintain experimental farms, 
and also to appropriate money for demonstration work in cooper- 
ation with the representatives of the United States Department of 
Agriculture. In Massachusetts an appropriation was made to enable 
incorporated agricultural societies to offer prizes to children under 
18 years of age for excellence of animals or crops grown, for stock 
judging, etc. 
The United Agricultural Board of Virginia, which was consti- 
tuted in 1910, was reorganized in 1912 (ch. 153). This board is 
charged with the duty of directing the “ farm demonstration work ” 
of the State, and it was originally composed of 11 members, 9 of
-P-A-G-E-103
    EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1912. TT 
whom were State officers and members of State boards of Virginia, 
and 2 representatives of the United States Department of Agri- 
culture. The number was reduced by the act of 1912 to 4, namely, 
the governor of Virginia, the State superintendent of public instruc- 
tion, the general director of demonstration work of the United States 
Department of Agriculture, and the Virginia director of the demon- 
stration work of the United States Department of Agriculture. The 
former law contemplated a division of the work between several 
State authorities, but all of it is now concentrated in the single board 
of small membership. Clearly the new law is in the interest of 
simplicity and effectiveness. The board will control or direct the 
expenditure of all funds available for farm demonstrations con- 
tributed by the State, the several counties thereof, the Department 
of Agriculture, and the General Education Board. 
An interesting outcome of the increased attention to rural affairs 
is the development, of a rural police system in a number of the States, 
similar to the Canadian mounted police and the Mexican rurales. 
Such organizations were provided in 1912 in New Mexico and in 
South Carolina. Although the system is not yet State wide in the 
latter case, many of the counties are included. 
SCHOOLS OF AGRICULTURE AND THE INDUSTRIES, 
In relation to schools of agriculture and the industries, there was 
marked activity in 1912, and important, measures were passed in 
every legislature that was in session. New schools of secondary 
grade were specifically provided in Massachusetts (Bristol County 
and Essex County), New York (on Long Island), Maryland (Caro- 
line County). In other States, of which Virginia is an example, 
increased appropriations resulted in new schools that were not indi- 
vidually named in the law. Existing schools of this type were 
strengthened by largely increased appropriations, especially in 
Georgia, Massachusetts, and Mississippi. 5 
Massachusetts is impelled by the variety of her industries con- 
stantly to increase the variety of her vocational institutions. The 
educational officers and legislators are vigilant in recognizing each 
new demand as it appears, but it is often the pressure from the rear 
that forces Massachusetts to the front in nearly all lines of educa- 
tional endeavor. The people have learned to put in the schools what 
they wish to appear in the State; better than the people of any 
other State in the Union they have learned the relation between 
education and life. In that is the explanation of the high standing 
of the school system of the State. A new instance of characteristic 
enterprise appears in Resolution No. 16, directing the State board 
of education to investigate the advisability and cost of establishing  
-P-A-G-E-104
  78 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
and maintaining a State school for designing, modeling, and manu- 
facturing silverware and jewelry. It is probable, therefore, that the 
prestige of priority in special schools, conspicuously established by 
the normal schools, art schools, and textile schools of Massachusetts 
will be maintained in a new class of institutions. 
Rhode Istand—The New Jersey plan of paying from the State 
treasury half the cost of industrial training has found favor in Rhode 
Island. By the act of May 3, 1912 (ch. 845), any town which main- 
tains day or evening classes for vocational industrial education, in- 
cluding instruction in agriculture and training in mechanic and 
other industrial arts, may receive from the State a sum equal to half 
the expenditure for the same. In addition, any town maintaining 
instruction in manual training and household arts may receive from 
the State one-half the cost of the apparatus purchased. 
New Meaico—The requirement of industrial subjects in the high 
schools of New Mexico was mentioned in a preceding section. In) 
addition, the State board of education was authorized (ch. 52) to 
prescribe a course of study in industrial education for all public 
schools, to include domestic science, manual training, and agriculture. 
The board was authorized also to include industrial training in 
the institute manual, and to require all teachers attending institutes 
and summer schools to pass an examination in one or more branches 
of industrial education. It was evidently expected that the State 
board would promptly act upon the authority granted it, for the same 
law. directed—not authorized—the State superintendent of public 
instruction to appoint a State director of industrial education and 
to prescribe his duties. A salary of $1,000 per annum was provided 
for this officer, to be paid from the State treasury; and in addition 
a fee ranging from $20 to $30 must be paid to him by each county 
which he visits for purposes of instruction. His traveling expenses 
will be paid by the State. 
Arizona.—In this State vocational training was the subject of a 
separate law (ch. 45). Like many other new school laws of that 
State, the provisions are well conceived and well stated. Any high 
school properly located and well equipped for instruction in agricul- 
ture, mining, manual training, domestic science, or other vocational 
pursuits may be designated by the State board of education to main- 
tain such courses. Half the cost, not exceeding $2,500 in any one case, 
will be borne by the State. 
Mississippi.No less than 11 laws were enacted in Mississippi in 
1912 relating to county agricultural high schools. Several of them 
related to individual institutions or to the temporary use of funds 
raised for such schools pending establishment, but 2 of them were of 
great value to all the schools as a class. By the first, counties were 
authorized (ch. 150) to issue bonds for the purpose of raising money
-P-A-G-E-105
  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1912, 79 
to establish agricultural high schools. By the second, the State 
appropriation was increased from $1,500 to $2,000 per annum to each 
school in which the number of boarding pupils exceeds 30, and to 
$2,500 to each school in which there are more than 40 such pupils. 
Undoubtedly these two statutes will largely increase the extent and 
efficiency of agricultural instruction in Mississippi. 
South Carolina—One of the earliest incidents in the history of 
agricultural education in America was the bequest of Dr. John de la 
Howe, a native of Hanover, who left the bulk of his estate for the 
endowment of a farm school “ for educating, boarding, and clothing 
twelve poor boys and twelve poor girls of Abbeville district.” Five 
hundred acres of arable land, 1,000 acres of forest, and an endowment 
of $42,000 were left to the institution. It was stated in Barnard’s 
Journal of Education* that the school was put into actual operation 
in 1817, at Lethe, in Abbeville County; and the possession of farm, 
stock, and implements in 1854 was mentioned. 3 
If the school was established as stated by Barnard it was not con- 
tinued, for an act of the South Carolina Legislature (No. 572, Feb. 
25, 1912) authorized the trustees of the estate to institute legal pro- - 
ceedings to determine their right to establish scholarships in Clem- 
son Agricultural College and in Winthrop Normal and Industrial 
College. The preamble of the act states that it is impracticable liter- 
ally to carry out the terms of the will. If the courts authorize that 
disposition of the funds, 12 scholarships will be established for poor 
boys at Clemson and 12 for poor girls at Winthrop. Thus, apparently, 
will end the career of “ the first Fellenberg school in America.” 
Louisiana —The transformation of the “ Southern University,” an 
institution for colored students located at New Orleans, was provided 
by Act No. 118. It is stated that the school has not been in satis- 
factory condition, and its complete reorganization is contemplated 
by the law mentioned. The newly constituted board of trustees is 
directed to sell the property of the institution in and near New 
Orleans and to purchase other property and erect new buildings in 
the rural section of the State. The purpose of the school will be 
henceforth to train colored teachers of industrial and agricultural 
subjects. A model school of agriculture and the industries, com- 
prising at least eight grades, will be maintained in connection with 
the institution. All the teachers and employees must be negroes. 
There appears to be some question as to the constitutionality of this 
law. The matter is in the hands of the courts at the time of this 
writing, and the contemplated changes have not been made.

cultural College, of $35,000 to the Eastern State Normal School, and 
of $25,000 to the Western State Normal School (ch. 32). The need 
of such instruction was held to be so urgent that an emergency was 
declared, and the appropriation was made available immediately 
after the approval of the governor. 
Another act (ch. 103) appropriates $2,000 annually to the Ken- 
tucky Normal and Industrial Institute for Colored Persons, “ for 
training students in useful trades.” No previous appropriation had 
been made for this purpose.

  CHAPTER III. 
HIGHER EDUCATION. 
By Kenpric CHARLES BABcocK, 
Chief of the Division of Higher Education, Bureau of Education. 
During the year covered by this report several currents of progress 
have gained strength and significance in that section of higher educa- 
tion concerned with graduate, collegiate, and technological courses, 
in contrast with secondary education on the one hand and profes- 
sional education on the other. Many privately endowed institutions 
have increased in resources and in power to serve. Plans for im- 
proved standards of admission and graduation have multiplied and 
gone into full effect. The control exercised by States over higher 
and professional education within their limits has expanded in many 
places, and in no place diminished. In practically every State in 
which a legislature met in 1912 larger funds than in the preceding 
year were devoted to higher education. In several States the move- 
ment for better coordination of State-supported institutions took 
more definite form. That many States have been wasting money and 
losing efficiency through unwholesome and unsystematic development 
of their educational systems—or lack of system—has changed from 
a vague feeling to a positive judgment in favor of readjustment and 
reformation. 
The method of attack upon this problem of coordination of the 
State’s agencies of higher education has varied according to the 
acuteness of the need of the State, the zeal of the reformer, and 
political exigencies in the State. Education commissions, to study 
the conditions of higher education and to make reports and con- 
structive recommendations, have recently been at work in Virginia, 
North Dakota, and Vermont, under official appointment, and in Colo- 
rado as a committee of the Colorado Teachers’ Association. The 
Iowa State Board of Education has undertaken a radical readjust- 
ment or redistribution of functions among the three institutions 
under its control. The central boards of education in Mississippi and 
Oklahoma have undergone reorganization by legislative action, for 
reasons seemingly not altogether determined by educational consid- 
erations. Renewed discussions of institutional coordination have 
appeared in Montana, Washington, and Maryland. 
In several States the normal schools have continued to press for 
larger scope and power to confer regular bachelors’ degrees. The 
83
-P-A-G-E-110
    84, EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
junior-college idea has gained ground, and several new organizations 
doing college work of the first two years have been created. 
CORRELATION OF STATE-SUPPORTED INSTITUTIONS. 
In 17 States the universities comprise all of the State-supported 
higher educational work, with the exception of that done in the 
normal schools; in 9 States there is no State university, but a State 
agricultural and mechanical college; in 12 States there are both a 
university and an agricultural and mechanical college; and in 9 
States there are three or more State-supported and State-controlled 
institutions. Seven States make appropriations in aid of privately 
endowed institutions, over which the State exercises no real control. 
While there are obvious advantages in having some of the work done 
by institutions in certain States distributed so that their special work 
may be in close contact with the interests which they serve, as in 
the location of the Michigan College of Mines and the Missouri 
School of Mines in the mining districts of those States, the disad- 
vantages in the newer and poorer and more thinly populated States 
are well expressed by a prominent member of the faculty of an in- 
stitution in one of these States: 
The disadvantages of the system are duplication of work, diffusion of energy, 
insufficient financial support for any institution, the preponderance of local 
opinion and requirements, and consequent inadequacy in view of the educational 
requirements of the day. 
The waste due to duplication of faculty, equipment, and buildings 
is frequently overestimated. While it may be temporarily notice- 
able in weak, new Commonwealths, which have distributed their in- 
stitutions, the permanence of this defect in a given State system will 
depend largely upon the rapidity of the growth of population and 
the upward reach of the work undertaken. The work done at the 
present time by the three higher institutions supported by the State 
of Michigan, and the two supported by the State of Indiana, would 
not greatly gain in efficiency if it were all combined in each State 
in one place and under one management, while the economies would 
be confined to a few administrative salaries saved in the process. of 
centralization. There is no loss of economy or of efficiency in carry- 
ing on in different places the work of the first year, or the first two 
years, of a liberal arts course or of courses preliminary to or funda- 
mental to technological work, provided always that the faculty and 
the equipment of buildings, laboratories, libraries, etc., for the work 
of these two years are fully utilized. If there are 400 freshmen to 
be instructed, and if it is assumed that they are organized into 20 
sections of 20 students each, in English, mathematics, physics, and 
chemistry, they would require space, instructors, many duplicate
-P-A-G-E-111
  
  HIGHER EDUCATION. 85 
pieces of apparatus, and duplicate reference books, all of which 
might advantageously be distributed among four or five places in- 
stead of concentrated in one place. If to these be added correspond- 
ing groups of sophomores, and the combination be constituted as a 
junior college, its demands in the way of administration, instruction, 
and living accommodations may be met in several localities quite as 
well as in one. 
It is when specialized and technological work is begun in the 
second or third year of the usual course, when the services of high- 
salaried men and enormously expensive equipment are required, that 
the waste and inefficiency of plant inevitably appears. If investiga- 
tion and research be carried on in an engineering experiment station 
like that maintained by the University of Illinois, the danger of 
duplication reaches its maximum. The popular demand for clear 
differentiation of function then rightly makes itself heard, a demand 
which is based not merely upon present conditions, but upon proba- 
bilities of future development. 
The problem thus presented in several States is well illustrated 
by the State of Montana, which supports engineering work in three 
institutions. In the following table the first figures in each column 
represent the registration of engineering students by classes; the 
second figures in each column represent the total collegiate registra- 
tion by classes:

  86 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
In these three institutions 18 persons are employed in engineering 
of some kind, as professors, instructors, or assistants, excluding 
teachers of chemistry, physics, mathematics, English, and modern 
languages, who would be wholly concerned with the instruction of 
freshmen and sophomores. The total number of students in the 
senior and junior group in 1911-12 was 47; if the sophomores be 
added, to include with certainty all those who are pursuing really 
technological courses, presumably under the instruction of the 18 
persons just mentioned, the total for the three institutions would be 
73. The merging of these three small groups of engineering students 
might give a body sufficiently large to insure enthusiasm, momentum, 
healthy competition within classes, and that professional spirit so 
highly important in training engineers to meet the exacting demands 
of the present and future. 
Not the least of the advantages of unifying the work in engineer- 
ing would be the increase of the salary scale of instructors.thus made 
possible. The head of every technological institution in the country 
knows all too well the difficulty of attracting and holding highly 
trained and experienced men for the work of instruction as compared 
with the more active and more remunerative work in the world of 
commerce and industry. Except in rare and exceptional instances, 
the offer of a good salary is the first item in negotiations between a 
president or dean and a successful practicing engineer, and in a 
general way it can not be denied that the better the salary paid, the 
abler and more inspiring will be the man secured. 
Tn yet another group of States, institutions have been permitted to 
develop many parallel courses leading to corresponding degrees, with 
little or no attempt to correlate the work. In some of these, in highly 
specialized courses like mining engineering and forestry, there is 
small prospect of gathering from the tributary territory more than 
enough students, in competition with older, richer, and more famous 
schools, to insure both impetus and inspiration to the work. In the 
State of Washington, both the university and the State college give 
courses in liberal arts, civil engineering, mechanical engineering, elec- 
trical engineering, mining engineering, forestry, and pharmacy. 
The failure of the State college to publish a classified list of its stu- 
dents makes a detailed comparison such as that just given for Mon- 
tana impossible without a study of the records of the institution. If 
the question of State control were to be dropped and a study made on 
a regional rather than a State basis, it would be necessary to note 
that 10 miles away from the State College of Washington, just across 
the State boundary, is the University of Idaho, which also gives 
courses in liberal arts, engineering (including mining engineering), 
agriculture, and forestry.
-P-A-G-E-113
  
HIGHER EDUCATION, St: 
In the State of Oregon a similar condition exists in regard to the 
University of Oregon and the Oregon Agricultural College. By the~ 
act of March 17, 1909, the legislature provided for a board of five 
members called the “ board of higher curricula.” This board is ap- 
pointed by the governor for a term of five years, the term of office 
of one member expiring each year; the board receives no salaries or 
fees other than actual expenses. Its powers are thus defined: 
The exclusive purpose and object of the board of higher curricula shall be to 
determine what courses of study or departments, if any, shall be duplicated in 
the higher institutions in Oregon; to determine and define the courses of study~ 
in departments to be offered and conducted by each such institution. 
  The board is required to visit institutions, and is empowered to~ 
direct the elimination of duplicated work from any institution. Ata 
meeting in April, 1910, this board made the following orders: 
1. The departments of mechanical and mining engineering shall be confined to 
the State agricultural college. 
2. In view of the fact that strong departments in civil engineering and elec- 
trical engineering are now established in the State agricultural college and the 
university, these departments shall continue to be a part of both institutions. 
3. The school of education, as such, shall be confined to the University of Ore- 
gon; but this rule shall not be construed against the maintenance by the State- 
agricultural college of a department of industrial pedagogy and the provision by~ 
this institution for such work in connection therewith or related thereto as may 
be necessary in training persons to teach industrial subjects in the common and 
high schools, in accordance with the provisions of the Nelson amendment of 1907. 
to the Morrill Act of 1890. 
The department of economics and sociology and the school of com- 
merce at the university and the course in commerce at the State agri-- 
cultural college were continued. Having practically authorized the: 
continuation of existing conditions, the board ordered that— 
6. No new school, department, or course may be established in either the State- 
agricultural college or the University of Oregon unti] the plan of such school,. 
department, or course shall have been submitted to this board and have received: 
its approval. - 
Since the exact meaning of the words “ school,” “ department,” and 
“course ” here used was not defined, there is considerable doubt as to- 
the effectiveness of this order. 
Twenty-two States, in the organization of their agencies for higher 
education, adopted in the beginning the policy of distributing them 
geographically, each one independent in its organization and ambi- 
tions. Whatever may have been the original motives, it is the general 
agreement of wise and progressive leaders of higher education in the: 
States at the present time that there is distinct advantage in com- 
bining in one institution the colleges of liberal arts and sciences and 
all the professional schools, including colleges of engineering and 
agriculture, thus forming a single university for a given State. The 
77236°—ep 1912—vor 1——8

arguments for separate institutions are less strong now, when each 
State is developing the work of its separate institutions on a college 
level, than they were 40 years ago, when the work of the land-grant 
colleges, for example, was chiefly that of the secondary school or work 
definitely directed to vocational ends. 
The distribution and subdivision of what should be a unified func- 
tion of the State as a whole has led inevitably in most cases to waste, 
duplication, undesirable competition for appropriations, and cam- 
paigning for students in order to get more appropriations. Not 
the least of the disturbing effects of this condition has been a confu- 
sion as to the standards which each institution should maintain, 
not merely with relation to the other parts of the higher educational 
system, but with reference to the secondary schools as well. 
Small reason exists for a State to continue indefinitely the attempt 
to build up a strong high school in every good-sized town or county 
and at the same time to subsidize colleges which receive large num- 
bers of their students from the first, second, or third year of the 
high school to continue secondary work in the college. 
The need for readjustment is very real, and the possibility of ac- 
tually uniting different institutions is too remote to be considered. 
Idealism must yield to practical procedure. During the past 10 years 
many experiments have been tried in the endeavor to remedy some 
of the admitted defects of the system now operated in many States. 
This process of experimentation has gone on without very clear con- 
ception of the educational and administrative problems involved, 
and certainly without the much desired divorcing of educational 
policies from political considerations. There can be no mistake in 
believing that the people of several of the Commonwealths have 
definitely decided that waste, overlapping, and unwholesome com- 
petition shall cease. Whether the desired end shall be reached by the 
establishment of central boards of control, by organized cooperation, 
and concessions on the part of existing institutions and their govern- 
ing bodies, remains to be seen. 
CENTRAL BOARDS OF CONTROL, 
One of the first States to attempt centralization of control of State 
institutions was South Dakota. Under the laws of 1896 and 1903 
a board of regents of education, consisting of 5 members appointed 
for 6 years, with compensation of $1,000 a year, was placed in 
control of the university at Vermilion, the State college of agricul- 
ture and mechanic arts at Brookings, the school of mines at Rapid 
City, and three normal schools. Up to the present time little seems 
to have been accomplished in the way of readjustment and delimita- 
tion of function among the 6 institutions.
-P-A-G-E-115
  
HIGHER EDUCATION. 89 
Tn 1901 the State of Minnesota created a board of control for the 
management of charitable and penal institutions, but the law was 
framed in such a way as to give the board financial control over 
educational institutions without abolishing the board of regents of 
the university. The university sought release in 1903 from this 
double-headed government, but failed. The intolerable condition 
created by the act of 1901 was remedied by the exemption of the 
university from the board of control, save in the matters of placing 
insurance, the purchase of fuel, and the erection of new buildings. 
In all other matters the board of regents has full control. A separate 
board of 9 members has jurisdiction over all the normal schools 
of the State. 
By an act of 1905 the State of Florida abolished 6 institutions of 
higher education of uncertain grade, together with their boards; 
and a new board of control of 5 members, appointed by the governor 
for 4 years and serving without compensation, was created and given 
charge of a new University of Florida, a new Florida State College 
for Women, the Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes, 
the colored normal school, and the institution for the blind, deaf, 
and dumb. By the new law the complete management and control 
of these institutions was vested in the new board, but a section of the 
law provided that the board of control— 
shall act in conjunction with, but at all times under and subject to the con- 
trol and supervision of, the State board of education, the latter consisting of 
the governor, secretary of state, attorney general, State treasurer, and State 
superintendent of public instruction. 
Tt should be noted that the board of education, which has power 
over the general interests of the State, has only one officer who can 
be considered as representing primarily such interests. The rela- 
tions of the two boards have been on the whole amicable and co- 
operative, though in.at least two instances the fact of two boards 
has complicated the administration of the university. The Florida 
board has seemed to work more effectively and harmoniously than 
the boards in any other State having such central boards. The 
president of the university reports that under no circumstances would 
the institutions “go back to independent boards and their scrambles 
at each meeting of the legislature for support of their respective 
institutions.” He states further that the new law has “ unified our 
higher educational scheme. It has resulted in a more perfect 
and better understood relation between the high schools and the 
colleges, and our entire education system has been quickened and 
stimulated.” He recognizes, however, the possibility of trouble aris- 
ing from friction between the two boards. 
The rivalries of the three State institutions in lowa—the university, 
the college of agriculture and mechanic arts, and the State teachers’  
-P-A-G-E-116
90 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
college—reached a climax in 1909 when the legislature, influenced in 
some measure by the success of a board of control of charitable in- 
stitutions of the State, passed a law creating a State board of educa- 
tion, consisting of 9 members appointed by the governor with the 
consent of the senate for a term of 6 years, to be paid a moderate 
per diem compensation. This board has full control of all three in- 
stitutions. It is assisted in its management of them by a finance 
committee of 3 outside its own membership, each of which receives 
a salary of $3,500 and expenses. While the board has endeavored 
in its management of the institutions to discriminate between gov- 
ernment and administration, to put an end so far as possible to 
rivalry, and to reduce duplication to a minimum, both its personnel 
and its procedure have been subject to a running fire of unfriendly 
criticism, which was specially vigorous after its announcement in 
October, 1912, of a scheme of somewhat radical redistribution of 
functions among the three institutions. It can scarcely be said that 
the experiment in Iowa is wholly or permanently successful. On the 
other hand, it should be said that institutions which had so long had 
a free hand and free field for their energies throughout the State and 
before the legislature could hardly be welded into a unified and 
cordially cooperative group in the single space of three years. 
Some of the difficulties of institutional correlation in Montana 
have already been described in an earlier section of this chapter. 
To remedy these the State passed a law in 1909 under which a board 
of education of 11 members was created. Eight of these were ap- 
pointed by the governor and senate, for terms of 4 years, without 
compensation other than traveling expenses, and 3 were ex officio 
members, the governor, State superintendent, and attorney general. 
Under this board were placed all the higher educational institutions 
of the State: The university at Missoula, the agricultural college at 
Bozeman, the school of mines at Butte, and the State normal college 
at Dillon, together with two charitable institutions and the State 
reform school. Supplementing this board at each institution was an 
executive board of 8 members appointed by the governor and the 
State board for terms of 4 years.. Of each executive board the 
president of the institution concerned Was an ex officio member. 
These subordinate boards were given immediate control of finances, 
subject to the supervision and control of the State board of education, 
which is in turn subject in financial matters to a third board, the 
State board of examiners, consisting of the governor, superintendent 
of public instruction, and the attorney general. If the Florida com- 
bination of two boards contains large possibilities of friction or of 
disagreements which would block progress, these difficulties are 
greatly increased by the complexity of Montana’s threefold board 
system. No results appear to have come from efforts to remedy over-
-P-A-G-E-117
  HIGHER EDUCATION. 91 
lapping and duplication among Montana’s institutions. Possibly not 
all of this lack should be attributed to the board alone. The presi- 
dent of the university, in his annual report for 1912 to the State 
board of education, stated: 
Nothing has been more impressive than the defects in the system of divided 
institutions and their government in Montana. * * * That this division pro- 
duces weaknesses of rivalry and waste of duplication, without real compen- 
sating advantages by separation, is recognized by many thoughtful men. En- 
couraged by such men, including many prominent in public life and several of 
this State board, I undertook a public discussion of this situation to see whether 
Montana would repair her great educational mistake before institutions were 
highly developed. No practical response was made by educational authorities 
or by the legislature. Instead, a measure was enacted into law introducing 
a more complicated system, giving final authority through financial control over 
higher education to a board of three political officers, not one of whom need be 
or is likely to be nominated or elected by reason of any special qualification 
to be an educational trustee. * * * Consolidation or even administrative 
unification of Montana’s higher institutions seems to be a dream, not to be 
realized because of the strength of the forces of localism. 
West, Virginia was another State which entered ‘in 1909 upon a 
scheme of centralized government for its State-supported institutions. 
A State board of regents of 5 members, including the State super- 
intendent of public instruction, appointed by the governor and senate 
for a term of 4 years and receiving compensation of $1,000 a year 
and expenses, has control of the university, 2 branch preparatory 
schools, 6 normal schools, and 2 colored institutes. This board deals 
only with educational matters. Alongside it is a board of control of 
8 members, appointed by the governor and senate, receiving a 
salary of $5,000 per year. This board has full charge of the chari- 
table and penal institutions and of financial or business control of the 
educational institutions. On request of the board of control the two 
boards meet together. While this dual system violates the funda- 
mental principle of unified authority and responsibility, the two 
boards have up to the present time worked together harmoniously 
and the State superintendent, declares that “there has been great 
saving to the State.” 
In 1908, the year after the admission of Oklahoma to the Union, 
the university, which then had its own board of regents, suffered a 
sweeping change of administration and faculty. The facts con- 
nected with this revolution have been widely discussed and need not 
be rehearsed at length here. In February, 1911, the State created a 
board of education consisting of 6 appointed members and the 
superintendent of public instruction, who was president of the board. 
The superintendent was the only member of the board receiving a 
salary other than a per diem allowance. The board of education was 
charged with the supervision of the common-school system and the

work of the State textbook commission, and in addition governed 
the University of Oklahoma, the School of Mines, the Industrial 
Institute and College for Girls, the Agricultural and Normal Uni- 
versity for Negroes, 6 normal schools, 2 university preparatory 
schools, 4 schools for defectives, a State school for orphan children, 
the colored orphanage, and the reform school. The Agricultural 
and Mechanical College, however, was continued under the separate 
control of the State board of agriculture. 
The board was organized in April, 1911, and almost immediately 
began to make sweeping changes in the personnel of the faculties of 
ihe university and other schools under its control. New heads were 
appointed in six institutions and a large proportion of the members 
of their faculties were removed or transferred. Because of a dis- 
agreement between the board and the governor in regard to a book 
adoption, the governor in June, 1912, removed certain members of 
the board and appointed others to fill their places. Through an in 
junction of the institution these new members were not permitted to 
serve. In December the governor called the State senate in extra 
session. The Senate refused to confirm the new appointees. The 
governor then appointed a temporary board. 
The State of Mississippi has had two central boards within two 
years. In 1910 a board of eight trustees appointed by the governor 
succeeded the separate independent boards of the University of 
Mississippi at Oxford, the Agricultural and Mechanical College at 
Starkville, the Industrial Institute and College at Columbus, and 
the Agricultural College for Negroes. The term of office was made 
six years, with per diem compensation and payment of all expenses. 
In addition to geographical distribution by supreme court districts, 
the board was obliged to have in its membership one farmer, one 
lawyer, and one builder, architect, or factory man. Various influ- 
ences prompted the abolition of this board of 1910 and the creation 
of a new board under a law of 1912. It is of course too soon to judge 
the working of the new scheme in Mississippi beyond saying that its 
tenure and procedure are distinetly uncertain. The president of one 
of the State institutions stated the matter tersely, saying: “A central 
board as an abstract proposition is good; as a practical proposition, 
bad.” 
In summarizing an excellent discussion on central boards of con- 
trol, presented to the National Association of State Universities, at 
its meeting in 1911, President C. R. Van Hise, of the University 
of Wisconsin, said: 
If there were no overlapping of the work of higher educational institutions 
in.any of the States, the movement for central boards of control would probably 
haye little strength. Where concentration of the higher educational efforts of 
a State is still possible, at least so far as the university, the agricultural col- 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
  
HIGHER EDUCATION. 93 
lege, and the school of mines are concerned, this should be the line of endeavor 
of the educational leaders. There can be no question that in the new States 
where subdivision has been recently inaugurated the advantages would be im- 
measurable if concentration were possible; and this I do not hesitate to assert, 
even if to accomplish this would involve the total destruction of the physical 
plants from which the higher educational work is withdrawn. Usualiy, how- 
ever, this would not be necessary, for with the movement for trade schools 
and the necessity for normal schools such plants could be used for these lines 
of effort, or, if not for them, for some other public purpose. * * * 
In those States where overlapping of function does exist and it is not practi- 
cable to solve the problem by concentration, it is certain that the movement 
for central boards will have an ever-increasing strength, unless there is rational 
cooperation of educational effort and reduction of overlapping to a minimum. 
The advantage of each large educational institution having a separate board 
is obvious. The experience of hundreds of years in this country, both with 
endowed and tax-supported institutions, shows that a nonpaid board of some- 
where between 7 and 20 in number is the best method of governing an educa- 
tional institution. * * * 
If separate boards are to exist, where the institutions overlap they must 
cooperate. Of the methods which have been proposed for cooperation, those 
begun in Kansas and in Oregon are clearly the most hopeful. * * * 
My conclusions are as follows: 
1. In those States in which there are two or more higher educational insti- 
tutions aside from the normal schools, these should be consolidated, if this 
be practicable; or in some of the Southern States the institutions for the whites 
and those for the blacks, respectively, should be consolidated. 
2. Where consolidation is not practicable, each of the important educational 
institutions or groups of institutions of the same kind should have its own 
governing board. In this matter the experience of hundreds of years of all 
the educational institutions of the first rank should not be disregarded. 
8. Where the higher educational institutions of a State overlap, in order to 
retain independent governing boards it will be necessary to have sharp delimi- 
tation of scopes, which reduces overlapping to a minimum, and cooperation in 
financial requests to the legislature. These may be accomplished through a 
commission composed of representatives of each of the institutional boards, 
or by a higher board composed of members not belonging to the institutional 
poards and having full authority in the respects mentioned, but leaving the 
government of each institution to its independent board. 
4. In the ease of overlapping institutions, if cooperation be not successful, 
central boards are inevitable. Of the types of existing central boards, that 
of Iowa is probably the best, in that it holds to the established principle of a 
nonpaid board of moderate size for the government of educational institu- 
tions, and thus in a measure at least retains the advantages of independent 
governing boards. 
The agitation over duplication in Kansas led in 1911 to the pas- 
sage of a bill creating a board of control, to be composed of three 
members receiving $2,500 each, with provision for the election, out- 
side of the board, of an educational expert to act as secretary at the 
same salary. Before acting upon the bill the governor took counsel 
by telegraph with many university administrators, and received re- 
plies from more than 20 of them. Almost without exception these
-P-A-G-E-120
  94 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
men advised against the measure, and the governor vetoed the so- 
called Keene bill. Before doing so, however, he prevailed upon the 
three existing boards to organize voluntarily into a commission on 
higher education, of which the governor should be chairman and the 
State superintendent of public instruction secretary. This extra- 
legal body has therefore served as a coordinating force in the State of 
Kansas, and through its committees on business management, on effi- 
ciency, and on coordination has been working toward a solution of 
the difficulties existing in the State. No measures of importance 
looking toward improvement, coordination, and economies have yet 
gone into effect as a result of the action of this commission. At best 
it may be looked upon as a hopeful experiment by which each in- 
stitution may preserve its individuality and at the same time be 
released from danger of encroachment from other State-supported 
institutions, and feel assurance of adequate and equitable provisions 
by the State for its support and enlargement. 
Investigations relating particularly to the problem of better econ- 
omy, supervision, and correlation of State-supported institutions 
have recently been made or are now in progress in several States, 
through official commissions. In others the investigation is made 
through an extra-legal commission or committee, as in Colorado, 
where the committee was created by the Colorado State Teachers’ 
Association. These educational commissions are not to be confused 
with bodies having similar names in Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, 
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Idaho, and Delaware, which have 
been created to deal with the general subject of public elementary 
and secondary education, industrial agricultural education, school 
law, ete. 
The State of Virginia created in 1910 the Education Commission 
of Virginia, composed of seven persons appointed by the governor, 
four of whom must be experienced educators— 
whose duty it shall be, after investigation, to devise suitable and systematic 
methods for the maintenance, management, and expansion of these institu- 
tions, according to the needs of each of them and with reference to a definite 
and harmonious educational system. 
The commission when organized included the speaker of the house 
of delegates, the State superintendent of public instruction, the presi- 
dent of the University of Virginia, and representatives of the 
privately endowed colleges, normal schools, and medical schools. 
Before transmitting its careful and comprehensive final report to 
the governor in 1912 a detailed survey of the situation in Virginia 
was made by the commission itself. A tentative report on a mill 
tax for the State educational system as a whole was presented in 
October, 1910. In 1911, at the request of the commission, special
-P-A-G-E-121

reports were presented by a representative of the Carnegie Founda- 
tion for the Advancement of Teaching and by the specialist in higher 
education in the Bureau of Education, both of whom made personal 
investigation of the State’s institutions of higher education. The 
final report of the commission dealt with present conditions, with 
needed definitions of function, with apportionment of fields of work, 
with the question of State support for higher education for women, 
with professional education, and with the mill tax as a means of 
support. This report caused a very vigorous and even heated dis- 
cussion, and in the end the legislature failed to take action on the 
recommendations of the commission. 
The temporary education commission of North Dakota was created 
by an act of legislature in 1911, to study the educational system both 
in the United States and elsewhere, and to present a report which 
might— 
form the basis for the unifying and systematizing of the educational system of 
the State, and thereby provide for the removal of unnecessary duplication of 
courses in the institutions of the State, as well as to suggest such legislation 
as will tend to prevent any unseemly competition among the institutions for 
appropriation, and to prepare a bill embodying its recommendations. 
The commission consisted of seven members, including the lieu- 
tenant governor, the superintendent of public instruction, and the 
presidents of three institutions. It was given $1,000 for necessary 
expenses. A report was presented to the governor and legislature 
under date of December 27, 1912, in which the commission accepted 
as a satisfactory basis for the development of the educational system 
of the State the provisions of a memorandum prepared by the Bureau 
of Education, in reply to a questionnaire submitted by the commission 
discussing “a State system of education, ideally outlined and oper- 
ated.” 
The report of the commission favors one board for the normal 
schools, but separate boards for the university and the agricultural 
college, the coordination of secondary and special schools under a 
common board, and the development of the principle ef the mill tax. 
The appendix to the report contains an important group of “ views 
of authorities,” 51 in number, submitted in response to a question- 
naire sent out by the commission. 
Tn addition to making provision for the board of higher curricula, 
mentioned in another paragraph, the State of Oregon passed a law 
in 1911, after correspondence with the United States Commissioner 
of Education, which regulates the certification of teachers by the 
State. Section 15 of this law provides that— 
certificates shall be issued to graduates from standard colleges or universities who 
have completed 120 semester hours, including 15 semester hours in education.
-P-A-G-E-122
96 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
By section 17 it was determined that— 
a standard college, university, or normal school is one that shall be standardized 
by the United States Bureau of Education, of Washington, D. C. In case of the 
failure of said bureau to prepare a list of standardized colleges, universities, 
and normal schools, or to pass upon the standard of any college, university, or 
normal school of Oregon, a board for such standardization composed of [seven 
members, ex officio presidents, superintendents, ete., is provided]. 
The Bureau of Education accepted the invitation to assist the 
State of Oregon in this task of standardization of the higher educa- 
tional institutions of that State. The specialist in higher education 
in the bureau was sent to Oregon late in 1911, and personally visited 
all of the institutions conferring degrees, in order to gain first-hand 
information regarding their administration, support, equipment, 
faculty, and standards. His report to the State superintendent of 
public instruction indicated that the University of Oregon, Pacific 
University, and Willamette University were to be considered as meet- 
ing the requirements of a standard college or university, according to 
the State law. The report indicated also the essentials in which 
seven other institutions fell short of meeting the requirements of a 
stindard college, and pointed out in brief some steps which might 
be taken to remedy the deficiency. Five other institutions which 
had not as yet offered full four-year courses leading to regular 
degrees were not officially examined and reported upon. 
In a region like the Columbia and Willamette Valleys, notable 
for their recent educational progress, each year is certain to produce 
some change in the status of colleges and universities, and the judg- 
ment expressed in this report will need to be revised frequently, so 
that no injustice shall be done to the colleges, on the one hand, or 
to the high schools employing their graduates, on the other hand. 
Any discussion of schemes of coordination or correlation of State 
institutions would be incomplete without reference to the experience 
of Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio. Michigan maintains an agricul- 
tural college, a school of mines, and a State normal college, entirely 
dissociated from the University of Michigan. The status of the 
university is fixed by the constitution. Under the broad-minded 
leadership of President Angell, a working scheme of cooperation was 
elaborated and has been followed for many years. The institutions 
have not developed the main bedy of their courses on the same level, 
and therefore the understanding has not necessarily taken a definite 
and positive form. 
The State of Indiana maintains two universities, Indiana Uni- 
versity and Purdue University. After long years of more or less 
vigorous and unwholesome rivalry, in the last instance over the con- 
trol ef medical education, these institutions reached, through their 
presidents, a clear and cordial agreement to delimit their separate
-P-A-G-E-123
AIGHER EDUCATION, 97 
fields in such a way as tu prevent undesirable duplication of work, 
so long as the present good understanding continues. 
The State of Ohio has effected come degree of correlation of its 
three State-supported and State-controlled universities, at Columbus, 
Athens, and Oxford, through direct limitation of their functions by 
the legislature itself. An act of 1906, incorporated in the general 
code of 1910, reads: 
Inasmuch as it is deemed desirable for this State to determine its policy in 
regard to the support of institutions of higher learning, and further desirable 
that it adopt a distinct and fixed policy in regard to universities and colleges 
for all time to come, so that the policy of the State with reference to the Ohio 
State University, the Miami University, and the Ohio University shall be deter- 
mined and made definite, and to the end that the State may build up one 
university worthy of it, as now begun at the Ohio State University, and also 
to fix such a policy as will provide support for the Miami and Ohio Universities 
as colleges of liberal arts, but not to include technical or graduate instruction, 
aside from the usual graduate work for the degree of master of arts, and to 
determine definitely for ail time that the Miami University and the Ohio 
University shall be no greater charge on the State so far as university purposes 
are concerned than herein provided for; therefore this subdivision of this 
chapter is passed to set forth the policy, to wit: That in the future no repre- 
sentative of the Miami University or of the Ohio University or of the Ohio 
State University shall violate or attempt to violate this policy herein enacted 
into law as a policy for the support of higher education and as a guide for 
future general assemblies of the State of Ohio. 
In furtherance of this policy, each of these institutions receives 
from the State the proceeds of a mill tax proportioned to its needs. 
A somewhat similar result has been reached by the State of 
Washington through the act of March 13, 1911, creating separate 
funds for the university, State college, and the three normal schools, 
which are the proceeds of a continuing mill tax, varying for each 
institution. In order to secure an equitable revision of the rates 
fixed by the statute of 1911, it is provided that— 
after January 1, 1916, it shall be the duty of the governor, upon the request 
of the president of any of the institutions of higher learning, to appoint a com- 
mission of five members to investigate reasons for changing the levy herein 
provided for, and to report to him in time for action, if any is necessary, by 
the legislature of 1917.    
STANDARD COLLEGES AND JUNIOR COLLEGES. 
Notwithstanding innumerable efforts to give a definition of a 
college, the word still remains almost as hard to define as “ gentle- 
man.” To deny that the term is fully applicable to any institution 
calling itself a college is to offer serious affront to individuals con- 
nected with the institution, to all who hold its degrees, and to all 
their friends. Yet definition, or at least exact discussion, is abso-
-P-A-G-E-124
  98 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
lutely necessary if an institution is to deal honestly with the great 
public to whom it appeals and with the students whom it receives 
into its classes. Self-hypnotism or self-deception is not at all un- 
common among institutions which have taken a high and honorable 
name at their beginning and have struggled through long years to 
reach a status worthy of the name. While they have exercised the 
degree-granting power as an incident in their commendable en- 
deavor to furnish education to a community or a clientele, and while 
their numerous sons and daughters have risen up to bless their alma 
mater, there is no disguising the fact that the degrees granted repre- 
sent in reality a debased educational currency. For example, one 
State institution having more than a thousand students never had 
as much as 4 units for admission requirements before 1912; in other 
words, it had not required for admission the equivalent of one year 
of an ordinary high school. Yet for years this institution has con- 
ferred the following degrees upon students who have completed the 
four years of work based upon the requirements just stated: Bachelor 
of science in agriculture, in civil and mining engineering, electrical 
engineering, mechanical engineering, and textile engineering, and in 
the school of industrial education. During the same period, degrees 
similar to these have been conferred by such standard institutions as 
Cornell University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the 
University of Wisconsin only when a student had completed a full 
four-year high-school course preliminary to the regular four years 
of college work. 
If one turns from the group of State-supported institutions repre- 
sented by the one just mentioned to a group of privately supported 
institutions, the same difficulty arises in justifying the use of the 
term “ college,” complicated by lack of that assured support which 
has enabled the State institutions to develop with such unparalleled 
rapidity. Scores of these privately organized “ universities” and 
“colleges” have disappeared during the westward march of popu- 
lation; still others have come to a recognition of the futility of try- 
ing to do four years of reputable college work with resources wholly 
inadequate for two years. 
As a result of this long experience of certain institutions with 
income insufficient to justify the pretentious names assumed in the 
beginning, and as a result also of the unequal competition between 
the weaker private schools and the group of institutions which are 
beneficiaries of generous and awakened Commonwealths, the discus- 
sion of the scheme for junior colleges is gaining notable momentum. 
A study of the reports presented to the Bureau of Education for 
1910-11 shows that there are in the United States 281 colleges with 
a working income less than $50,000, exclusive of gifts for endowment 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
HIGHER EDUCATION, 99 
or increase of plant. Of these, 39 have less than $10,000 of an- 
nual income; 76 between $10,000 and $19,999; 75 between $20,000 
and $29,999; and 91 between $30,000 and $49,999. In the matter of 
endowment the showing of the same institutions is equally significant. 
Out of 581, 187 had no endowment; 70 have less than $50,000; 115 
have less than $100,000; 197 have less than $200,000. In these calcu- 
lations are included 47 Roman Catholic institutions, which make no 
report of endowments, and whose estimates of income do not repre 
sent, a figure exactly comparable with those of other institutions, for 
the reason that the teachers are not salaried and their services are not 
payable from income of endowment or from fees. 
Among the minimum requirements now commonly recognized as 
necessary for a standard college is an unincumbered income-produc- 
ing endowment of at least $200,000. In the State of New York an 
institution must have at least $500,000 of property. The acceptance 
of this minimum has stimulated numerous small colleges to undertake 
campaigns for increased endowment, and many of them have suc- 
ceeded in bringing up their endowments to the minimum figure. But 
even this minimum is not a guaranty that the college will maintain 
itself on an approved level in competition with its richer and more 
vigorous rivals for patronage and support. In a notable address 
delivered in 1900 the late President William R. Harper, of the 
University of Chicago, discussed the prospects of a small college 
and declared his firm conviction— 
that a large number, perhaps even a majority, of the colleges now attempting 
to do the four years of preparatory course and the four years of college work 
will be satisfied to limit their work to the six years which would include the pre- 
paratory training and the first year of college life. The motives to this change 
will be found in its economy, and in the possibility of doing thorough and sat- 
isfactory work, where to-day such work is impossible. 
There are at least 200 colleges in the United States in which this change 
would be desirable. These institutions have a preparatory school, as well as a 
college course. The number of students in the preparatory school is perhaps 
150. In the freshman and sophomore classes they have 30 to 40 students, and 
in the junior and senior classes 20 to 30. The annual income of these institu- 
tions is restricted for the most part to the fees of the students, and will aver- 
age from all sources, let us say, eight to ten thousand dollars. In order to 
keep up the name of the college, the income is made to cover the expenses of 
eight years—that is, the preparatory and the collegiate departments. It is evi- 
dent that * * * the work of the junior and senior college years can be done 
only in a superficial way, because the library and laboratory facilities are 
meager, the range of instruction is very narrow, and a single instructor is often 
required to teach in three or four subjects. 
President Harper estimated that 20 or 25 per cent of the chartered 
colleges of the United States “are doing work of a character only a 
little removed from that of an academy.” In such cases, he insisted
-P-A-G-E-126
100 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
that the term “college” had been misappropriated. These institu- 
tions, he said— 
will yield to the inevitable and one by one take a place in the system of educa 
tional work which is in one sense lower and in another sense higher. It is 
surely a higher thing to de honest and thorough work in a lower field than 
to fall short of such work in a higher field. 
In the years which have elapsed since this great educational states- 
man uttered these words, the movement for the readjustment of the 
name and organization of institutions to fit more exactly their real 
purposes and practices, and for the organization of junior colleges 
or the reorganization of old institutions on substantially a junior- 
eollege basis, has gone on slowly but with sure step. The name has 
here and there been changed so as to describe more exactly the func- 
tion of the institution. Lincoln University, Illinois, became Lincoln 
College in 1901; Lawrence University became Lawrence College in 
1908; Lake Forest University continues as the corporate name, but 
since 1902, by action of the trustees, the institution has been called 
Lake Forest College, the alliance with certain professional schoois in 
Chicago being severed in the same year; the College of the Pacific 
succeeds the University of the Pacific; Carleton College (Missouri) 
resumes its legal name of Carleton Institute. 
The Methodist Episcopal Church South, through its educational 
commission, has for some years presented a tabulation of its educa- 
tional institutions in three groups: (1) Universities, colleges (A), 
colleges (B), totaling 22; (2) unclassified institutions, in nearly 
every case calling themselves colleges and universities, numbering 30; 
(3) academies (A), academies (B), and junior colleges, totaling 49. 
The junior colleges thus enumerated number 12 in the report for 
1911, and are located as follows—9 in Texas, 1 in Oregon, 1 in 
Georgia, and 1 in North Carolina. The board explains the use of the 
term in a footnote: 
Under the law of our church, committing the basis of the classification of 
our institutions to the educational commission, it is not the province of the 
board of education to create a new group of institutions. However, the insti- 
tutions numbered 38 to 49, doing a grade of work above that of the secondary 
school, but giving no academic degrees, describe themselves as junior colleges. 
Probably the chief difference between these junior colleges and 
many of the institutions in group 2, unclassified institutions, lies in 
the fact that the latter give degrees, while the former do not. 
The superintendent of public instruction of the State of Missouri 
reports 15 of the institutions which are ordinarily listed as colleges 
in that State as being junior colleges, and doubts if three or four of 
these are entitled to so high a rank as junior college. 
Among the institutions which give college work but no degrees, 
as reported to this office, are Reynolds College and Fairmont College, 
 
-P-A-G-E-127

Texas; Caldwell College and Hamilton College, Kentucky; Glen- 
dale College and Urbana University, Ohio. 
Several States make an approach to the junior-college problem 
along one of two lines. The first of these is discussed in the para- 
graph dealing with schools for the training of teachers. One of 
the most notable examples is that of Wisconsin, which has authorized 
its normal schools to give two years and no more of college work, 
thus in effect making the college departments of the normal schools 
just so many State-supported junior colleges having a special mis- 
sion. The other approach is through junior-college organization 
in connection with local high schools. In Illinois such junior-college 
work has been carried on for more than 10 years by the township 
high school in the city of Joliet, whose principal writes regarding 
the progress of the work: 
We began with five or six students with rather more serious attitude than 
the average student. The number has slowly grown until now we have 52 
doing this fifth or sixth year’s work. Not everyone who takes this work in- 
tends to go to a higher institution of learning, but every year for 10 years 
has seen from one to six enter college with advanced credit ranging from 20 
hours to 50 hours. Thirty hours of such credit is considered a full college year. 
The number whose parents seem to approve of their remaining in the local 
high school for an additional year’s work is increasing. * * * From the 
carefully chosen faculty of 53 people, we would intrust to do this work of col- 
legiate grade only four or five. 
The Lane Technical High School and the Crane Technical High 
School, in the city of Chicago, also carry on junior-college work 
which is recognized by the University of Illinois. The work in the 
Lane school was authorized by the board of education in 1911, and 
50 pupils are now registered, but none have yet completed the full 
two years’ course. ‘ 
The State of California provided by law (Mar. 1, 1907) for the 
organization of junior colleges in connection with high schools. The 
law provides: 
The board of trustees of any city, district, union, joint union, or county 
high school may prescribe postgraduate courses of study for the graduates of 
such high school or other high schools, which courses of study shall approxi- 
mate the studies prescribed in the first two years of university courses. 
The first city to organize such a junior college was Fresno. Three 
teachers were secured, and in the first year work was done in agricul- 
ture, as well as in the ordinary freshman subjects, with an average 
attendance of 12 or 13. Other similar junior colleges have been 
organized in connection with two city high schools in Los Angeles, 
the Hollywood High School, and the Santa Barbara High School. 
By law the course in these junior colleges is closely coordinated with 
that of the university, though they have aimed rather to supply the 
needs of students who could go no further than to fit students for 
transfer to college or professional work in the universities.

Along with this process should be noted the tendency of institu- 
tions still retaining the name university to discontinue professional 
departments which entail ever-increasing demands upon the treasury 
of the university, as the requirements of professional education, 
notably in medicine, are raised year by year. They are thus enabled 
to devote their services and strength to the limited field with renewed 
effectiveness. Hamline University (1907), University of Denver 
(1911), and Drake University (1918) are illustrative of the transfer 
of the medical departments to the State university; Ohio Wesleyan 
University relinquished its medical school to Western Reserve Uni- 
versity. The University of the South discontinued both the law 
school and its medical school in 1909-10, after nearly 20 years of 
experimentation with them. Nor have the privately endowed institu- 
tions been alone in this matter of restriction of the work of profes- 
sional schools. The University of Missouri suspended, temporarily at 
"least, the work of the last two years of the medical school on account 
of inadequate clinical facilities; the University of North Carolina 
gave up in 1909 the last two years of its medical school, which it had 
maintained since 1902 in Raleigh on an unsatisfactory footing; and 
the University of Mississippi experimented briefly and unsuccess- 
fully with a second two years of its medical course at Vicksburg, and 
now has but the first two years at Oxford. 
CONSOLIDATION OF INSTITUTIONS, 
The merger of two or more institutions now and then takes place. 
In 1868 two Presbyterian colleges of the antebellum period were 
united as Greenville and Tusculum College, located at Tusculum, 
Tenn. Fifteen miles away was Washington College, doing practi- 
cally the same work. To secure economy and eliminate rivalry a 
union was effected in 1908, after several unsuccessful attempts had 
been made. Under the name of Washington and Tusculum College, 
the academic, agricultural, and industrial work was to be carried 
on at Washington and the college work and domestic science at 
Tusculum. It was a case of coalescence, however, rather than a real 
union, since, in 1912, the colleges were separated by a court decree. 
In 1889 Carson College, for young men, and Newman College, for 
young women, two institutions in Tennessee, united to form a coedu- 
cational college, since known as Carson and Newman College. 
Two Kansas universities were combined in 1903 to form one 
college. Lane University, of Lecompton, founded in 1867, and 
Campbell University, at Holton, founded in 1882, were united at 
Holton. 
A more striking example of this procedure is to be found in the 
consolidation of Centre College and the Central University of Ken-
-P-A-G-E-129
  HIGHER EDUCATION. 103 * 
tucky, under the name of Central University of Kentucky. By ~ 
agreement made in July, 1901, and amended in November, 1907, . 
Central University as a college at Richmond ceased to exist, and the : 
institutions originally known as Centre College, the Central Univer- 
sity of Kentucky, the Hospital College of Medicine, and the Louis- 
ville College of Dentistry, located at Louisville, constituted the new 
university. Later the college of medicine was united with three : 
other medical schools of Louisville and ceased to be a part of Central - 
University. : 
The latest and most noteworthy merger was the union of Scio + 
College and Mount Union College, Ohio, under the general direction 
of the Methodist Episcopal Church. At the time of the merger Scio - 
College had 64 college students and 130 preparatory students, $5,500 - 
of endowment, property valued at about $65,000, and a total working ° 
income of $6,550. Mount Union had 127 college students and 97 
preparatory students, endowment of $316,000, property valued at 
$200,000, and a total working income of about $23,000. The fact 
that these institutions were within 50 miles of each other, appealed 
to like constituencies, and were affiliated with the same great church, . 
probably facilitated the union thus happily accomplished. 
The process of alternating consolidation and expansion of institu- - 
tions has been carried on with varying measures of success through- 
out the advancing West and in the re-created South. A resolute 
attack upon the problems of ignorance and indifference has not 
always succeeded. The failure of one method has prompted a second, 
a third, and even a fourth attempt, illustrating the various elusive, 
elastic, accommodating qualities of the name “university.” Many 
institutions have disappeared altogether, while others, after pro- 
longed struggle and self-sacrifice, have achieved permanence and 
admirable vigor. Like the ship in Kipling’s story, they have found 
themselves and have started with fine equipment and adequate sup- 
port upon their long journey of service. Not infrequently a notable : 
achievement, or success stands out all the more prominently because 
of the long wrestling with poverty and adverse circumstances which 
has preceded it. 
Only occasionally nowadays does one find a small or middle-sized 
college taking the name of university; even Harvard, Columbia, and 
Princeton did not take their present names until a comparatively 
recent date. An illustration of the reversal of the program described’ 
in the preceding paragraphs is found in the change of the name of 
Santa Clara College (California) to University of Santa Clara in 
1912: 
The university now possesses the following constituent colleges: The college~— 
of philosophy and letters; the college of general science; the institute of law; 
the college of engineering, embracing civil, mechanical, and electrical engineer-

ing; the college of architecture; the school of pedagogy; and the premedical 
course, 2, 
* * * Tn order that Santa Clara may widen her scope as a first-class edu- 
cational institution, funds are necessary. Santa Clara stands in imperative 
need of an endowment. 
Other instances of this sort of change of name are the incorporation 
of Union College (New York), as the undergraduate department, 
with the observatory and three professional schools in Albany, as 
Union University in 1878, and the change of the name of the State 
College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts of Maine, in 1897, by an 
act of the legislature of that State, to the University of Maine. The 
State university in South Carolina has the unique distinction of being 
a university for the third time. Chartered as South Carolina Col- 
lege in 1801, and reverting to that name twice since, it was made the 
University of South Carolina in 1865, 1887. and 1906, by legislative 
acts of reorganization. 
COMPETITION AND COOPERATION OF COLLEGES. 
The problem of efficiency, economy, and essential honesty in the 
administration of colleges and universities is no longer one for solu- 
tion merely by individual institutions according to their necessities. 
or the wisdom of their heads. Just as the aroused public sentiment 
in the States is demanding wider correlation of State-supported insti- 
tutions to the end that public higher education shall be harmonious 
and progressive, so the common sentiment of the great body of the 
supporters of Christian churches, disregarding more or less the 
hard lines of denominationalism, is demanding of the organized 
agencies for promoting Christian education a wise and statesmanlike 
cooperation. The great aim is the upbuilding of colleges, universi- 
ties, and specialized schools in which the principles of religion and 
morality shall be safeguarded, emphasized, and vitalized. Coordi- 
nate with, or running through, the intellectual and social training of 
the student, the development of a strong and active Christian faith is 
and must remain among the primary functions exercised by this group 
of institutions. 
The period of overzealous competition among denominations for 
advantage of position and priority in the centers of population in 
the West and the farther West witnessed the multiplication of weak 
churches in thousands of localities, until the number of church organi- 
zations and church buildings in some of the frontier towns became 
almost a joke. Likewise each denomination, honorably ambitious for 
its progress, felt obligated to plant colleges along the route of expan- 
sion, often quite regardless of similar establishments of other churches. 
The cheap, bare, unattractive church structures were matched with
-P-A-G-E-131
  HIGHER EDUCATION. 105 
the cheap, ill-constructed, pathetically inadequate buildings of the 
“college” or “ university,” whose supporters labored with true mis- 
sionary enthusiasm, backed by an infinite hope of support and in- 
dorsement. In each section certain colleges were bound to survive 
and to reach a position of power and influence, as centers both of 
liberal culture and of religious truth. The doctrine of the survival 
of the fittest applied with inexorable steadiness, and the history of 
higher education in the West is full of the stories of the wrecks of 
these enterprises. In the State of Illinois probably net more than 
50 per cent of the institutions chartered or organized are now in 
existence. : 
Admirably as the history of Ohio or Kansas would illustrate this 
sort of development, the Willamette Valley in Oregon will serve 
still better. There, in an area 120 miles long and 50 miles wide, in 
a State having a total population of 675,000, are found 12 colleges, 
including the State university, the agricultural and mechanical col- 
lege, and one clearly undenominational college; the rest represent 9 
denominations, while a tenth denomination has organized a junior 
college in another part of the State. One of these colleges, which 
belongs to a great church, was first opened nearly 50 years ago, yet 
last year its total registration of college students was only about 
20. Two other colleges, representing, respectively, the radical and 
conservative wing of a church whose total membership in the whole 
United States is slightly over 300,000, are located in the same little 
village—* The Brick College” and the “ College on the Hill.” In 
one of the “colleges” in this region, nearly a half century old, all 
the work, in classroom, laboratory, and museum, in physics, chem- 
istry, biology, and geology, is carried on by one man in a single room 
not more than 16 feet square. 
Out of this condition sprang up in the last year a unique move- 
ment to combine colleges. The United Evangelical Church, the 
United Brethren Church, and the Church of the Evangelical Asso- 
ciation combined in the creation of a commission for the purpose of 
formulating plans for the prosecution of their educational work on 
the Pacific coast. In the “ Declaration of federation,” which was 
unanimously adopted, the commission states: 
We recognize the wisdom of combining our forces to conserve the largest 
degree of interest and efficiency of our educational work on the Pacific 
Cong. * ko * 
We do hereby severally and together declare ourselves unqualifiedly in favor 
of the federation of our work on the Pacific coast, and the organization of one 
college which shall be the successor to the two collegiate institutions hitherto 
maintained at Philomath and Dallas, respectively, and which shall be owned 
and controlled by the three churches represented on this commission. * * * 
We favor the consummation of this federation not later than September 1, 
1913. . 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  106 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
The name of this institution for the time being shall be “The Federated 
College of Oregon”; and in the event some individual will give $100,000 for 
the endowment fund to the federated college, it may bear the name of the 
donor. 
The development in southern California is much more recent 
and in a region noted for its population and wealth and for the ex- 
cellent educational lineage of its people, yet in an area not more 
than 70 miles by 25 miles are 8 institutions, representing in reality 
’ though not nominally, 6 churches. There is, besides, one large State 
normal school. 
In certain of the newer States, like Oklahoma, the State has pre- 
empted so thoroughly and so promptly the field of secondary and higher 
education that the development of competition among denominations 
has been somewhat retarded, as it has been in States like Minnesota 
and North Dakota. The State of Oklahoma supports an agricultural 
and mechanical college, and also, under the direction of the State 
board of education, the University of Oklahoma, the School of 
Mines, the college for women, 6 normal schools, and a normal and 
industrial university for colored students. To provide institutions 
in which the training of moral character and the inculeation of the 
principles of the Christian religion shall be specially emphasized, 
five denominations have undertaken to plant colleges and academies. 
Three colleges have been accorded definite recognition, while 8, 
calling themselves colleges or universities, have not gone much be- 
yond the secondary-school stage. The work of the Reformed Church 
was confined to Cordell Academy; after several years of unsuccess- 
ful effort, the academy building was turned over to the Presbyterian 
Church, which succeeded no better and relinquished the task. 
Obviously, conditions such as these in southern California and 
Oklahoma are not very satisfactory to the denominations concerned. 
Shrewd, experienced, forcible, farsighted leaders of the great Prot- 
estant denominations have recognized this waste of energy and the 
hopelessness of the outlook for some of the colleges in their care. 
The cause of Christian education to which they are all devoted 
suffers from divided efforts, from low and uncertain standards, from 
the general weakness of multiplying agencies, and from the mis- 
location of institutions. Obviously, too, the cause of Christian 
education for the future would be better promoted by insuring 
concentration of support on a limited number of carefully chosen 
institutions, rather than by indefinitely nursing along struggling 
rivals ill-fitted by every characteristic except earnestness and denom- 
inational loyalty to compete with the immeasurably stronger, aggres- 
sive State institutions. 
The purpose of the Council of Church Boards of Education, the 
outgrowth of the recognition of such conditions as those-just de-
-P-A-G-E-133
  HIGHER EDUCATION. 107 
scribed, was discussed in the last annual Report of the Commissioner 
of Education, pages 55-58. The first meeting looking toward its 
formation took the form of a conference of the secretaries of the 
boards of education of certain churches, which was held in New 
York, February 18,1911. The churches represented were the Metho- 
dist Episcopal, the Methodist Episcopal South, Congregational, Pres- 
byterian, and Lutheran. At another meeting representatives of 
the Friends Church and of the General Education Board were 
present. 
A third conference was held in Philadelphia January 17, 1912. 
The membership of the council includes, besides those just mentioned, 
representatives of the following churches: Disciples of Christ, 
United Brethren, Reformed, Presbyterian Church South, and Chris- 
tian, making a total of 18 men representing 11 churches. 
CORRELATION OF UNIVERSITIES AND THEOLOGICAL SCHOOLS. 
Squarely in line with this cooperative movement among the church 
boards of education is the effort made to unify the work of prepar- 
ing religious and social workers. Separate and isolated theological 
schools have struggled in certain sections to obtain both support and 
students. Social developments of recent years have laid stress upon 
the need of social and institutional workers, in addition to the reg- 
ular clergy. There was organized in 1910 in Nashville, Tenn.. the 
American Interchurch College for Religious and Social Workers. 
On its directory were representatives of the Methodist Episcopal 
Church South, the Methodist Episcopal Church, the Presbyterian 
Church, and the Congregational Church. : 
A part of the fixed policy of the interchurch college is to establish and main-— 
tain a close affiliation with Vanderbilt University and with the George Peabody 
College for Teachers, so that the entire resources of the three institutions may 
be made available for all students. S 
Another phase of the cooperative movement is found in the happy 
and economic relation established between certain great universities 
and special denominational schools in their vicinity. The relation 
between Columbia University and neighboring theological seminaries 
is peculiarly close and cordial. Union Theological Seminary and 
the General Theological Seminary are both represented in the uni- 
versity council, and students are reciprocally admitted to certain 
lectures in regular or special courses without tuition fee. Similar 
reciprocal arrangements exist with other theological seminaries in the 
vicinity of New York—Jewish Theological Seminary, Drew Theo- 
logical Seminary, St. Joseph’s Theological Seminary, New Bruns- 
wick Theological Seminary, and the German Theological Seminary,
-P-A-G-E-134
    108 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
though the distance of some of these precludes the frequent exchange 
carried on between the university and the Union, the General, and 
the Jewish Seminary. 
Around Harvard University, and in intimate relation with its 
divinity school, three theological institutions have grouped them- 
selves. ‘The Episcopal Theological School was the first, receiving its 
charter in 1867. Though there is no official connection between the 
two institutions, Harvard offers to the students pf the theological 
school, in addition to opportunities to take regular courses, the free 
use of its library and gymnasium, and the theological students may 
become members of the Harvard Athletic Association, including 
membership in the boat clubs and admission to athletic contests. The 
Stillman Infirmary, of Harvard, is also open to them. 
The relation between Andover Theological Seminary and Harvard 
University is much more intimate. Andover Seminary occupied its 
palatial new buildings adjacent to the Harvard Divinity School in 
1911, and the agreement for interchange of faculty and of students, 
perfected in 1908, became fully effective. The libraries of the 
two institutions, known now as the Andover-Harvard Theological 
Library, containing more than 100,000 volumes, are housed in the 
new Andover Seminary building. Students may receive the whole 
of their instruction from Andover teachers, or may divide their work 
between the seminary and the university. If the student wishes to 
take the Harvard degree, he may fulfill the statutory requirement of 
“residence at the university at least one year” while in residence 
at Andover Seminary. The dormitories and boarding accommoda- 
tions of Harvard University are open to Andover students on the 
same terms as to university stutlents. 
Also adjacent to Harvard University~is the New Church Theo- 
logical School, which was moved to its present locatiqn in 1889, and 
the same privileges are extended by the university to the students of 
this theological school as to the others. The Newton Theological 
Institution, at Newton Center, might also be added to this list, since 
its distance from Harvard is not so great as to preclude the regis- 
tration of its students for a limited number of university courses. 
Around the University of Pennsylvania are three seminaries, whose 
students may take advantage of the opportunities for undergraduate 
or graduate work offered by the university. The Divinity School 
of the Protestant Episcopal Church encourages the combination 
course, and students art allowed to add to their studies at the uni- 
versity branches of study belonging to the junior year in the divinity 
school; thus industrious students may complete the course prescribed 
for this year by the time they have graduated from the university.
-P-A-G-E-135
  
HIGHER EDUCATION, 109 
The Crozer Theological Seminary of the Baptist Church has a 
similar working arrangement with the university. In this-case— 
the privilege of elective work in the University of Pennsylvania is regarded 
as a reward for their collegiate preparation for a theological course and as an 
opportunity for investigation of subjects not usually provided for in a theological 
curriculum, In order that this privilege may minister to the best discipline, 
both in the seminary and in the university, the number of university electives 
that may be taken during a three years’ residence in the seminary is limited 
to the number required for the degree of master of aris from the university. 
These electives in the graduate school of the university are open 
only to seminary students who hold degrees granted by colleges or 
universities whose degrees are recognized by the university. 
The University of Cincinnati maintains reciprocal relations with 
two theological institutions in its vicinity, which are described as 
follows in its catalogue for 1911-12: 
Arrangements have been made with the Hebrew Union College and with Lane 
Theological Seminary whereby students of these institutions who are pursuing 
2 course in the University of Cincinnati may be allowed to count work in 
Hebrew taken in these institutions for the degree of bachelor of arts, to the 
amount of two hours a week throughout the freshman and sophomore years, 
and three hours a week throughout the junior and senior years, for the Hebrew 
Union College, and three hours per week for three years in Lane Theological 
Seminary, provided such work is regularly entered upon the election schedules 
of the University. * * * 
Courses in Hebrew taken in Lane Seminary and in the Hebrew Union Col- 
lege by graduates of recognized colleges and universities may count to the 
extent of 12 hours for the master of arts degree. 
At Berkeley, Cal., on the other side of the continent, is found a 
similar grouping of theological schools about the University of 
California. .In this case several of the schools have been recently 
moved to the neighborhood of the university, or have been newly 
created in that vicinity, for the purpose of close affiliation with the 
university. Within a few minutes’ walk of the campus are the Pacific 
Theological Seminary of the Congregational Church, the Berkeley 
Bible Seminary of the Christian Church, the Pacific Unitarian 
School for the Ministry, and the Pacific Coast Baptist Theological 
Union. Not only do these institutions avail themselves of the oppor- 
tunities offered by the university, but they recognize the advantage 
of interchange with each other. The last institution announces 
that— 
by a system of free cooperation it is able to avail itself of the values of any 
of the courses of the Pacific Theological Seminary (Congregational), and of 
the Berkeley Bible Seminary (Disciple), and of the courses in the University 
of California. * * * The faculty urge students, even if they are college 
graduates, to take some courses in the university. If a student is not prepared 
in Greek, that too can be had in the university. It is evidently wise economy 
to use these university courses rather than to provide them ourselves, at great 
expense.
-P-A-G-E-136
  110 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
To San Francisco, less than an hour away from the university, 
the Protestant Episcopal Church has removed its Church Divinity 
School of the Pacific, from San Mateo, where it was founded in 1893. 
It also announces that— 
there will be opportunity to arrange for special courses in advanced study at 
the California universities when desired. 
The Ryder Divinity School of the Universalist Church, hitherto 
located at Galesburg, in connection with Lombard College, was last 
year removed to Chicago and is now affiliated with the divinity school 
of the University of Chicago. A similar removal has been under 
consideration by the Meadville Theological Seminary (Unitarian), 
Meadville, Pa. Already there are seven theological schools in Chi- 
cago and its suburbs. Three of them are organically related to uni- 
versities. Besides the two just mentioned is the Garrett Biblical 
Institute of the Methodist Episcopal Church, which includes special 
seminaries for Norwegian-Danish and for Swedish students. This 
institute occupies, under a long lease, a portion of the campus of 
Northwestern University, of which it is, to all intents and purposes 
the theological department or schocl. The catalogue of Northwest- 
ern University devotes a section to these theological schools, and 
states the conditions of interchange of credits for advanced degrees. 
At Eugene, Oreg., the Bible University of the Christian Church 
has been built on land almcst adjoining the campus of the University 
of Oregon, and interchange of students and college credits takes 
place. 
Recent. announcements are made of a plan of cooperation with 
each other and of affiliation with McGill University, of Montreal, 
Canada, entered into by four theological colleges of Montreal, repre- 
senting the Congregational, Presbyterian, Wesleyan, and diocesan or- 
ganizations. It is worthy of note in this connection that the insti- 
iutions in Canada are following an English model as well as an 
American, since the theological schools of various sects have been 
affiliated with municipal universities in Manchester and Bristol. 
The University of Bristol, notwithstanding that it is supported by 
both municipal and imperial subsidy, accepts the work of these 
affiliated schools and grants degrees in divinity along with other 
ordinary degrees. Three such degrees were granted in 1912. 
NEW INSTITUTIONS. 
Among the institutions recently created, two stand out significantly 
for the deliberation, courage, and originality which have charac- 
terized the pfans for their organization—Reed College, Portland, 
Oreg., and Rice Institute, at Houston, Tex. Scarcely a single region 
in the country could be named where there is urgent need for a
-P-A-G-E-137
  
HIGHER EDUCATION. 111 
college or university with the aims and methods of the average insti- 
tution of this class. One chartered college, more or less, does not 
shift the center of gravity or point of interest in higher education 
in such great States as Texas and Oregon. But when a college like 
Simmons College, of Boston, or an institution like Tuskegee Normal 
and Industrial Institute, for negroes, makes a new attack upon a 
problem of education, forging new machinery for turning to educa- 
tional account existing material hitherto unused, or when it deals 
with its raw material in a new way, the experiment gains nation- 
wide attention. So in the last two years Reed College and Rice 
Institute, both highly endowed, have opened their doors to students. 
Both are prepared to put into execution most carefully matured 
plans for high-power educational service. 
Reed College is the first institution established by the trustees of 
the Reed Institute. Created under the wills of Mr. and Mrs. Simeon 
G. Reed, who gave property valued at about $3,000,000, this college 
starts with an income of approximately $100,000. Exercising their 
broad discretionary powers, the trustees decided, after most careful 
study of the needs of Portland and vicinity, and after counseling 
with the experts of the General Education Board, to establish a 
college of liberal arts and sciences, but to differentiate it by its 
administration, rather than by its organization, from other colleges 
of liberal arts. Its declaration of purpose, made in a bulletin of 
March, 1911, reads: 
It will attempt to do only as much as it can reasonably be expected to do 
with its annual income as well as such work is done anywhere. Accordingly, 
it will not overburden its instructors, allow its enrollment to increase more 
rapidly than its resources, or trust any of its teaching to temporary underpaid 
assistants whose interests do not center in their students, It aims to appoint 
and retain only those who are devoted to their students, who love their teaching 
above all else, who know how to teach and can not but inspire, and whose whole 
life is imbued with the professional spirt. 
Reed College unquestionably stands for personalized education, 
for the impartation of the best thought and impulses of the race 
to the worthiest young men and women obtainable. Requiring as 
an indispensable qualification for admission the completion of a 
four-year high-school course of standard grade, it proceeds with 
refreshing deliberation and frankness to sift and sort the candidates 
offering themselves, so that waste of time and effort upon ill-trained, 
ill-advised, and ill-disposed intrants shall be reduced to a minimum. 
The college does not bind itself, however, to admit all students who present 
the necessary scholarship certificates and the ordinary certificates of good 
character. Earnest effort will be made to learn the temperament, habits, and 
purposes of each candidate for admission, as well as his total record in and 
out of school. For the first class, at least, the president expects to have a 
personal interview with each prospective student, and to take as much time
-P-A-G-E-138
. 
112 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
as may be necessary to form a judgment of his fitness to profit by the offerings 
of Reed College. * * * 
No students will be admitted on condition. As this is a departure from the 
prevailing practice of American colleges it needs some explanation. To a 
majority of candidates our colleges virtually say: “According to our pro- 
fessed standards you are not prepared to undertake college work. Although 
the secondary-school opportunities are greater than ever before, although the 
wider range of admission subjects makes failure every year less excusable, yet 
you have failed to present our minimum requirements. Neveriheless, we admit 
you with conditions, allow you to try to do college work in the same class 
with those who are prepared, and in addition we require you to make up 
your deficiencies in secondary-school work.” ‘The effect of this policy is to 
hamper the work of those secondary-school teachers who are trying to promote 
and sustain intellectual effort; for the prospective college student interprets 
this leniency as a guaranty of admission, despite superficiality or deficiency 
of preparation. He is thus prepared for further evasion of work after he 
gains admission to college. 
The first application of this method of admission, by which not 
merely units checked, counted, and proportioned are the things need- 
ful, but in which the fiber, purpose, and spirit of the student are 
weighty considerations, was marked by a notable firmness and self- 
restraint. Out of 263 students who applied for admission to the 
first class in September, 1911, all but 50 were declined; some because 
they would have been conditioned or special students; others because 
they seemed to lack the desired earnestness or purposefulness. All 
applicants for advanced standing were in like manner refused. 
One very significant test of the wisdom of a method of admission 
of freshmen lies in the percentage of students regularly completing 
within the year the freshman work for which their admission creden- 
tial is supposed to be an evidence of fitness. In place of the “mor- 
tality” of 20 per cent, of which some institutions speak without 
shame and even boastingly, Reed College eliminated three because 
of poor scholarship, and advised two to transfer to other institutions 
more allied with their interests. The students thus constituting the 
first freshman class (26 men and 24 women) did not enter upon a 
course necessarily four years’ long, for the catalogue expressly states 
that the requirements for a degree can not be stated in terms of 
years of residence, since the quality of work enters into account, as 
well as the number of courses, semester by semester. 
During 1911-12, with only the freshman class, the college had, 
besides the president and director of music, 3 professors and 2 
instructors. In 1912-13 a new freshman class of 80 was admitted; 
with two classes, the faculty consists of the president, the librarian, 
9 full professors, and 3 instructors. Two professors and an in- 
structor are on leave of absence, and will enter upon their duties in 
September, 1913. The average salary for all persons teaching during 
1912-13 is $2,385; the ratio of instructors to students is fixed at 
1 to 10.

  HIGHER EDUCATION. 113 
The transformation of the Peabody Normal School of Nashville, 
Tenn., into the George Peabody College for Teachers is worthy to 
rank with the organization of Reed College and Rice Institute as 
an event of primary significance in the recent development of higher 
education. The Peabody Normal College was supported from 1875 
to 1911 by the Peabody Education Fund. The trustees of that fund 
decided to make a final distribution and voted to appropriate $1,000,- 
000 for the organization of the new George Peabody College for 
Teachers. This action was concurrent with gifts to the new institu- 
tion from the city, county, and State, amounting to $500,000, together 
with 16 acres of land and the buildings of the University of Nashville, 
approximately $250,000 in value. A further offer of $500,000 is made 
contingent upon the raising of $1,000,000 by the college prior to 
November, 1913. Toward this latter sum the General Education 
Board has contributed $250,000 for the endowment of the Seaman A. 
Knapp School of Country Life, as a memorial of the uniquely con- 
structive work of Dr. Knapp in energizing in the rural South the 
forces for economic and social betterment. 
Thus is assured for the South a central teachers college for the 
higher education of teachers, designed to supplement and reenforce 
the State normal schools of the section. Its strategie location on a 
beautiful site adjoining the campus of Vanderbilt University, with 
which it has established cordial relations; its measurably adequate 
equipment and endowment; and its freedom to work out its plans for 
direct usefulness to the elementary and high schools of the South 
place it alongside the Teachers College of Columbia University, New 
York, the University of Chicago, and the University of California 
in its opportunities for wide specialized service. What the Teachers 
College of Columbia University has been and is for the Eastern and 
Middle States, with their complicated problems of urban and foreign 
populations, that the new George Peabody College aims to be for 
the great South and Southwest, a region where 80 per cent of the 
population contributes its children to the rural and village schools. 
These schools in their present development—or lack of development— 
stand in critical need of trained educational leaders, such as the new 
college aims to prepare, men and women at, once sympathetic, patient, 
enlightened, and resourceful, who can undertake the constructive 
reformation of the present rural school, which has been aptly charac- 
terized as “only a poorly equipped and poorly taught city school 
located in the country,” so that it shall become a vital force through- 
out the whole section, binding the interests and aspirations of the 
youth to their communities and at the same time giving them ideals 
and appreciations which link them indissolubly to the higher life of © 
the Stato and Nation.

  114 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
The Rice Institute of Liberal and Technical Learning was opened 
to students in 1912, in Houston, Tex., and formally dedicated in 
October, during an academic festival notable for dignity, lavishness 
of entertainment, and distinction of foreign guests invited to par- 
ticipate in the elaborate program of addresses and papers. The 
original gifts or bequest of William Marsh Rice, by whose will the 
institute was to be located at Houston, Tex., and devoted to the 
advancement of letters, science, and arts, have increased under the 
prudent management of the board of trustees in amount and income- 
producing power until the present resources of the institute are 
estimated at approximately $10,000,000. Relieved by its imperial 
revenues from the necessity of an immediate showing in number 
of students and in the “results” too often impatiently demanded 
from tax-supported institutions, Rice Institute has taken four years 
for the formulation of definite plans for building and development. 
Unhurried, and with many sagacious counselors, it has begun its work 
in a new and rapidly developing country by first building a group 
of strikingly beautiful buildings on a great campus of 300 acres 
near the city of Houston. In the words of President E. O. Lovett, 
in his formal dedicatory address: 
The very problems pressing for solution in the development of its environ- 
ment seemed to call for a school of science, pure and applied, of the highest grade. 
looking in its educational program quite as much to investigation as to in- 
struction. Accordingly, and in the spirit of the founder’s dedication of the 
institute, it was proposed that the new institution should enter upon a univer- 
sity program beginning at the science end. As regards the letters end of the 
threefold dedication, it was proposed to characterize the institution as one 
both of liberal and technical learning, and to realize this larger characterization 
as rapidly as circumstances might permit. With respect to the art end, it 
was proposed to take architecture seriously in the preparation of its plans and 
to see to it that the physical setting of the institute be one of great beauty 
as well as of more immediate utility. 
Rarely if ever in recent years, with the exception of the brief 
period which saw the organization of the University of Chicago 
and the Leland Stanford Junior University, has a single three years 
seen the beginnings of work in three such richly endowed institu- 
tions as Reed College, Rice Institute, and the George Peabody Col- 
lege for Teachers. Each one is set in a widé field of service; each 
is independent of hampering traditions and entangling alliances; 
each is to be worthily housed at its beginnings; each has in present 
command of its destinies men of unusual experience and vision and 
courage; and to them the whole group of higher educational insti- 
tutions, even the oldest and greatest, may look for light and lead- 
ing in the solution of their common problems.

HIGHER EDUCATION, 115 
EDUCATION FOR JOURNALISM. 
The opening of the new School of Journalism of Columbia Uni- 
versity in September, 1912, was an event in higher education com- 
parable with the founding of the new institutions already discussed. 
The original gift for founding this school was made by Joseph 
Pulitzer, owner of the New York World, who gave to the university 
in 1903 $1,000,000 for the purpose of establishing a school of journal- 
ism, which at that time was practically without precedent. By the 
terms of agreements made between the donor and the university in 
1903-4, the definite organization of the school was not to be pro- 
ceeded with until the donor exercised his right to nominate an ad- 
visory board, a board to be composed of “the foremost journalists 
and editors possessing expert knowledge on the subject.” Mr. 
Pulitzer chose not to exercise his right to appoint such a board 
during his lifetime, and the stipulations of the agreement did not 
become effective until after his death in 1911. “By his will a second 
gift of $1,000,000 was provided for, contingent upon the successful 
carrying out of the purposes of the original agreement for a term 
of three years, failing which the million dollars was to be given to 
Harvard University. 
Following the death of Mr. Pulitzer, the advisory board was ap- 
pointed, consisting of the president of the university, Mr. Ralph 
Pulitzer, and the most distinguished men in American journalism, 
representing four New York newspapers—The World, The Sun, The 
Times, and The Tribune—the Boston Globe, Brooklyn Eagle, Phila- 
delphia Press, Chicago Daily News, St. Louis Post-Despatch, and the 
Springfield Republican, and the Associated Press. The school has 
- registered during its first year 55 regular students, the fourth-year 
class being made up entirely of persons already holding collegiate 
degrees. 
This great gift, and the organization of this new school of journal- 
ism, is indicative of the momentum acquired by the movement among 
colleges and universities for the development of professional or semi- 
professional courses in journalism, and also of the strength of a prac- 
tical idealism generated in the very center of a most practical, most 
strenuous, profession and business. The aim of such courses, as an- 
nounced by Columbia University— 
is to assist and attract to the journalistic profession young men of character 
and ability, and to help those already engaged in the profession to acquire the 
highest moral and intellectual training. It will be the object of the school to 
make better journalists, who will make better newspapers, which will better 
serve the public. 
While a college training can not make a journalist, it can help to 
make broader and bigger the man who has the capacity for a success- 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-142
    116 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912., 
ful career as a journalist, who shall practice with high mind and 
public spirit, coupled with strong business acumen, the “art of 
timely and effective presentation in print.” 
The last decade has seen a marked change in the recognition by 
newspaper men themselves of the value of thorough training for the 
profession. If the old college training was looked upon by the elder 
journalists, like Horace Greeley, as a positive hindrance, there can 
be no question that such a princely gift as that of Mr. Pulitzer is 
an index of the changed sentiment of the journalistic world. His 
own conception of conditions in his profession and of the principles 
underlying their improvement through reduction of waste of time, — 
material, energy, and life itself were expressed in a notable article in 
the North American Review in May, 1904: 
The “shop” idea is one that used to prevail in the law and in medicine. 
Legal studies began by copying bills of cost for the country lawyer; medical 
training by sweeping out a doctor’s office. Now it is recognized that better 
results are obtained by starting with a systematic equipment in a professional 
school. The lawyer learns nothing at college except the theory of the law, its 
principles, and seme precedents. When he receives his diploma he is quite 
unprepared to practice. Nor does the doctor learn to practice at the medical 
school. We learns only principles, theories, rules, the experience of others— 
the foundation of his profession. After leaving college he must work in the 
hospitals to acquire the art of practically applying his knowledge. 
In journalism at present the newspaper offices are the hospitals, but the 
students come to them knowing nothing of principles or theories. The news- 
paper hospital is extremely accommodating. It furnishes the patients for its 
young men to practice on, puts dissecting knives into the hands of beginners 
who do not know an artery from a vermiform appendix, and pays them for the 
blunders by which they gradually teach themselves their profession. We may 
sympathize with the students in their industrious efforts at self-education, but 
may we not also sympathize with the unfortunate editor who has to work with 
such incompetent instruments? 
Speaking of this change, President Butler, of Columbia, says: 
The plan which was greeted with respectful incredulity then (1903) is wel- 
comed with generous enthusiasm now. Much of this change of sentiment is due 
to a clearer understanding of what Mr. Pulitzer had in mind and of what he 
hoped to achieve by his great benefaction. It was plainly his wish and purpose 
to do what lay in his power to dignify and elevate the standards and to extend 
the influence to that calling to which be had so successfully devoted his life. 
He believed that this could best be accomplished by a university training 
school, placed side by side with successful training schools for the so-called 
learned professions and in the same academic association. He was not afraid 
of adding knowledge to practical experience, nor did he hesitate to prefer prac- 
tical experience based upon knowledge and training to one which was without 
that secure foundation. (An. Rep., 1912, p. 44.) 
While this gift of Mr. Pulitzer has been lying fallow, as it were, 
the provisions made for direct instruction in journalistic principles
-P-A-G-E-143
  
HIGHER EDUCATION. AAG, 
and methods have been extended throughout the country. Both 
endowed and State-supported institutions have organized courses of 
varying length and breadth leading in some cases to such a degree 
as bachelor of science in journalism in a school with a separate 
organization as a school or department, having a faculty and equip- 
ment of its own. Twenty-six universities and colleges now offer 
courses in journalism, and in December, 1912, a permanent national 
organization was effected by teachers connected with these schools. 
Nearly all such schools of journalism have the same quantitative ad- 
mission requirements as other departments of the university. At the 
University of Missouri, however, journalism is a separate profes- 
sional school, coordinate with the schools of law, medicine, and 
education, requiring for admission two years of regular college work. 
In such institutions as the University of Wisconsin, Kansas Univer- 
sity, and the University of Washington the work in reporting and 
news writing and editorial writing is spread over two years at least, 
and is connected with the press enterprises of the student body. 
Through the courtesy of the Seattle Times the department of journal- 
ism has exclusive control of one page of the Sunday edition. At 
the University of Wisconsin, in which 155 students were registered 
in the course in journalism in 1911-12, six organizations are main- 
tained by students interested in journalism: The University Press 
Club, The Cub’s Club (for freshmen and sophomores interested in 
newspaper work), the Hoard Press Club (for students in agricul- 
tural journalism), the Advertising Club, and two professional 
journalistic fraternities for men and for women. 
While the academic side of the work of students in journalism is 
confined largely to English and modern languages, history, economics, 
sociology, political science, philosophy, logic, and psychology, the 
professional work is made intensely practical by actual gathering of 
news, especially in institutions located in centers like New York 
City, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Chicago, and Seattle. The profes- 
sional courses include the practice and discussion of news gathering, 
reporting, editorial writing, and newspaper administration, the his- 
tory of journalism, journalistic ethics, and jurisprudence. In some 
cases the actual typesetting and press work is carried on by the 
students in the issue of a college daily paper, which is run without 
subsidy and must pay its bills like any other paper. More than a

The following outlines of courses in journalism may be taken as 
illustrative of the work counted toward degrees in typical eastern, 
middle western, and far western universities: 
UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI, 1911-12. 
The equivalent of 60 hours’ credit in the college of arts and science is re- 
quired for admission to the school of journalism. These credits should include 
5 hours of economics, 5 hours of sociology or political science, and 5 hours of 
logic and psychology. 
In order to secure the degree of bachelor of science (B. 8S.) in journalism the 
student must fulfill the following conditions: 
1. He must be regularly admitted to the school. 
2. He must complete (a) a major of 24 hours in journalism, including 6 
hours of history and principles of journalism, 6 hours of news gathering, and 3 
hours of copy reading; and (b) a minor of 12 hours chosen, with the consent of 
the dean, in related subjects.

The development of courses in journalism is by no means peculiar 
to the United States. Lecture courses in German universities were 
begun as early as 1906. These deal with such subjects as, at Leipzig, 
the history, organization, and technique of journalism; at Berlin, with 
public opinion and journalism in Germany; at Heidelberg, in the 
history, condition, and opinion of the press in journalism in Ger- 
many, together with a practical course introductory to journalism; 
at Zurich, with the history and system of the law of the press; at 
Berne, with practical courses in editing and news service of a news- 
paper. : 
TRAINING TEACHERS FOR ELEMEN'TARY SCHOOLS. 
Never has the attack upon the problem of providing training for 
teachers for all schools been pressed with more vigor than it is to-day. 
The significance of the teacher’s function, especially in nonurban 
communities; the needs of such communities for educational leader- 
ship which reaches beyond the classroom and beyond the school day ; 
the skill and technical knowledge demanded in a teacher; the sym- 
pathy and enthusiasm indispensable to understand and deal wisely 
with local interests and local industries—these and similar vital mat- 
ters are under daily discussion in schools for the training of persons 
to become teachers. Various forces are working to quicken the popu- 
lar appreciation of these considerations. Education is no longer 
77236°—ep 1912—vor 1——10
-P-A-G-E-146
120 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
merely a thing of books and pencils for children and adolescents; it 
does not end at the age of 16 or 21; it is for men and women who 
still retain the capacity and the desire for growth; it must touch 
Tife in the heart and the hand as well as in the head. Extension 
work, night schools, apprentice schools, short courses (as in dairying), 
corresponding courses, summer schools, and traveling libraries and 
laboratories are forms of response to this new demand for education. 
It might even be characterized as applied education, paraphrasing 
the term applied Christianity as used in certain discussions of 
religion and in the title of a professorship in Grinnell College, Grin- 
nell, Iowa. 
The problem of training teachers differentiates itself according to 
the nature of the pupil material to be dealt with, since qualified 
teachers are needed for positions ranging from the kindergarten to 
the college, from preparation of boys and girls for rural life to 
“ preparation for the complicated responsibilities of business, industry, 
commerce, professions, and social service. Granting that success will 
ultimately reward the efforts now put forth to make teaching really a 
profession and life career, for which definite preparation must be 
made and to which shall be attracted men, as well as women, of fine 
personality and thorough training, it is perfectly clear that teaching 
as a whole is still only a profession by courtesy. When the superin- 
tendent of public instruction in State after State reports year by 
year such alarming impermanence and such disheartening percent- 
ages of crude and untrained teachers in the common schools, no one 
can seriously claim that teaching is yet a profession except in the 
sections devoted to middle and higher education. Earnestness and 
devotion of a few persons can not be made substitutes for knowledge 
or for skill in the many in interpreting life and things to children. 
In the great State of Illinois the superintendent of public instruc- 
tion in 1910 reported 29,281 teachers employed in the common schools 
of that State, including about 6,000 teachers in Chicago, and all high- 
school teachers in the State. Of these, 3,448 had not had the equiva- 
lent of a good high-school course and 3,063 were without previous 
experience. Until very recently, 75 per cent of the teachers of the 
rural schools of Oregon were without the equivalent of a good high- 
school education. 
The normal schools, as originally organized, were designed for 
training teachers for the elementary or common schools and: have 
generally been considered the State’s agency for that purpose. With 
great credit many of them have held themselves to this great task; 
but, unfortunately, too many of them have never outgrown the con- 
dition in which they are a combination of normal school and local 
high school, or have served as a free State high school in competition 
with other high schools supported by the localities alone or in
-P-A-G-E-147
  HIGHER EDUCATION. 121 
cooperation with the State. In some of the older States, as well as 
in some of the newer, secondary or even elementary work, in which 
the problem is that of giving knowledge of subjects to be taught 
rather than instruction in the theory and art of teaching, has been 
predominant. It is not always easy to determine how far this is 
true in a particular institution, since many of the normal schools 
do not report any students of high-school grade, though it is well 
known that students are admitted in large numbers from the eighth 
grade. The custom followed by some of these schools, and also by 
some colleges, of giving only an alphabetical list of students enrolled, 
instead of making a classification of students, increases the difficulty 
of making fair estimates of registration and grade of work. 
A normal school in Oklahoma in its catalogue for 1910-11 gives 
an alphabetical list of students numbering about 700; its report to 
the Bureau of Education showed no high-school students; yet 354 
of the students were registered from the town in which it is located, 
which had a population of less than 4,000 people. Similarly, a 
Missouri normal school reported 1,400 students in 1911, but pre- 
sented only an alphabetical list. The difficulty of making a statistical 
estimate of the services of a normal institution is complicated still 
_ further in cases where the institution is part of a college or university 
maintaining also a preparatory department, because of duplicate 
registration in both the normal and preparatory departments or in 
both the normal and college departments. An institution in Ohio 
includes a normal college and a preparatory school; a classified list 
of students is presented, by departments and classes, showing a gen- 
eral total of over 3,000; of these about 1,400 are “ names counted more 
than once,” but the reader can not tell how many of those credited 
to the normal college are primarily normal college registrations, in 
contrast with preparatory and regular college registrations. A Kan- 
sas normal school presents a careful classification, enabling one to 
see at a glance that in 1911-12 there were in the alphabetical list 
nearly 3,000 enrolled, including “ repetitions ” and graduates of 1911. 
The classification shows the number in the four-year secondary 
course; in the first and second years of the college, or regular normal, 
course; and in the third and fourth years of the college course. Yet 
this school reported to the bureau no students in the high-school 
grades for the year in question. 
Eagerness for numbers of students as an index of success and as a 
basis for asking increased appropriation has led many institutions 
away from strict and unremitting attention to their primary business 
of training men and women for teaching, yet the schools themselves 
are not solely to blame, since the policy of concentrating this work 
in one institution, as in Iowa, has necessarily magnified the element 
of numbers.
-P-A-G-E-148
  122 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
A comparison of the statistics of State school systems and of nor- 
mal schools presented in this report will make it entirely clear that 
the normal schools of the States, without exception, supply only a 
minor fraction of the demand made annually for new teachers in 
each State. The State superintendent of public instruction of Minne- 
sota reported in 1909-10 that 3,000 new teachers were needed an- 
nually in the public schools of that State, while the normal schools 
of the State taken together graduated in that year 690 students, or 
less than 25 per cent of the number needed. In 1911-12 the need was 
just as great, and it would have taken the whole registration of 3,700 
students of the five normal schools to meet the requisitions of the 
schools. To supply new teachers in Iowa, which has more than 60 
per cent more teachers than Minnesota, the Iowa State Teachers’ Col- 
lege, the only public normal school of the State, with a registration 
of 2,425, granted degrees and certificates of all kinds, between June, 
1911, and March, 1912, numbering 308. In Missouri, with a demand 
at least 15 per cent greater than Minnesota’s, the total registration at 
the normal schools in 1911-12 was slightly above 6,300, and the num- 
ber of persons certificated in some way about 750. New York’s 15 
public normal schools in 1910-11 graduated 1,811 students, to fill the 
vacancies occurring in a body of more than 45,000 teachers. Penn- 
sylvania’s 15 public normal schools in the same year sent out 1,925 
graduates, to fill vacancies among more than 35,000 teachers. 
The tendency to advance the normal-school curriculum beyond two 
years of work above the high-school course and to organize standard 
‘courses leading to regular degrees is illustrated by the Albany Nor- 
mal College (New York), the Michigan State Normal College at 
Ypsilanti, the Colorado State Teachers College, and the State Normal 
School at Kirksville, Mo. Some of the States have given authority 
to all their normal schools to grant degrees. Among these are Illi- 
nois, Kansas, Missouri, and Colorado. Many normal schools in other 
States have taken the name of college or university and have con- 
ferred regular collegiate degrees; for example, the North Carolina 
State Normal and Industrial College, Greensboro; Winthrop Normal 
and Industrial College, Rock Hill, S. C., and Illinois State Normal 
University, Normal, Ill. 
The degrees granted by these institutions show a wide variety. At 
one of the normal schools of Missouri, a student may take the degree 
of bachelor of pedagogy upon the completion of two years’ work 
above the high school; for three years’ work he may receive the 
master of pedagogy, and upon the completion of a fourth year’s 
work the degree of bachelor of arts will be conferred. 
The enforcement of the requirement of full four years’ high-school 
work, or its equivalent for admission to the professional two-year 
courses in normal schools, is making steady headway. The State of 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
HIGHER EDUCATION. 4123 
California has established this rule for its normal schools without 
exception, save that two of the schools continue to give a course sub- 
stantially like the usual four-year high-school course. Where these 
entrance requirements have been fully met, students upon graduation 
may, as a rule, go to colleges and universities and receive sufficient 
credit to enable them to take a bachelor’s degree in two years. Such 
a plan of coordination of normal school and college work is com- 
mended by its economy and by its professional efficiency. In this 
way the comparatively small number of graduates from the normal 
schools who desire to go on will be provided for, just as the normal 
schools will provide for those who graduate from training classes of 
high schools or county training schools for teachers. 
This principle of coordination was worked out in the State of 
Wisconsin and embodied in a law passed in 1911 which contains the 
following provision: 
The board of normal-school regents may extend the course of instruction in 
any normal school so that any course, the admission to which is based upon 
graduation from an accredited high school or its equivalent, may include the 
substantial equivalent of the instruction given in the first two years of a college 
course. Such course of instruction shall not be extended further than the 
substantial equivalent of the instruction given in the first. two years of such 
college course without the consent of the legislature. 
By a system which places all the normal schools under a single 
board of regents or trustees, as in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and South 
Dakota, this process of coordination may be carried through logically 
and yet permit the schools in different parts of the State to diversify 
their courses to meet local needs or to provide specialized instruction 
for particular groups of teachers, like those in manual training, 
domestic science, business, or industrial subjects. 
In view of conditions like those just discussed in the preceding 
paragraphs—and the story could be expanded almost indefinitely— 
it is discouraging to find in so many quarters a well-developed tend- 
ency on the part of normal schools to insist on being granted the 
right to develop standard college courses, at least in liberal arts and 
sciences, to give the usual academic degrees, and to prepare graduates 
for high-school positions. Such a tendency might be welcomed by 
a State and its normal institutions provided with the necessary facili- 
ties for such advanced instruction,.if they were already discharging 
fully their duty to the elementary schools. 
As already indicated, some States in their: sovereign unity of pur- 
pose seem to have determined to be judiciously deaf to the urgings 
of ambitious heads of normal schools until every elementary school- 
room is occupied by an informed and pedagogically trained teacher. 
Distinct advantages attach to a system organized to divide up the 
revenues available for the training of elementary school teachers

among several moderate-sized schools set at strategic points in the 
State and to keep each school to its appointed task, permitting none 
to assume college functions in competition with State-supported col- 
leges or universities. Few States have too many normal schools, 
though some of these schools are badly located. Few States have 
normal schools which would not be strengthened for their purposes 
by a rigid pruning and grading and by developing agencies to touch 
directly teachers in service in much the same way as the new move- 
ment in agricultural education and agricultural extension contem- 
plates touching the actual worker at his task. 
The State of Tennessee has made it obligatory on the principals 
and instructors in normal schools for the training of white teachers 
to assist in conducting teachers’ institutes in the counties of the 
State. The teachers of the normal schools are required, without 
additional pay except for traveling expenses, to assist in such insti- 
tutes not more than six weeks in any one year. In other words, by 
this law of 1909 the extension function of the normal school is 
recognized and imposed upon the State normal schools of Tennessee 
as an essential part of their work.

INTRODUCTION. 
The field of urban education is broad. No other branch of the 
American school system ramifies in so many directions or touches 
society at so many points as the city school does. Health, morals, 
wholesome home conditions, industrial and commercial well-being— 
in short, all sorts of means for the enhancement of social and indi- 
vidual efficiency, as well as the traditional textbook training, are now 
promoted by the city school system. Moreover, the city school is the 
most mobile of all the fields of American scholastic endeavor. Only 
a few years ago one read with surprise of medical inspection in 
schools. Then came school savings banks, industrial training, and 
open-air classes, all of which are already widespread. Now one reads 
of swimming lessons, sex hygiene, aviation, and wireless telegraphy 
in the curriculum of some cities; and the end is not yet. In a recent 
letter directed to superintendents of city schools the Commissioner 
of Education said: 3 
In almost every city I visit I find that the public schools are working out 
particularly well some one or more comparatively new things.

There is, however, a field in city school progress which may profit- 
ably be surveyed. It is possible to point out pronounced tendencies 
and significant progressive steps and to bring together as examples 
masses of facts showing the general trend. To be sure, not every 
item of progress in each city, nor every possible example of a tend- 
ency can be given; the purpose of this paper is to present a general 
view of the important developments during the year under consid- 
eration. 
I, ADMINISTRATION. 
There have been during the year no revolutionary developments on 
the administrative side of school work, as in 1911 when Pennsylvania 
reduced the number of members of school boards of practically all 
cities in the State and provided for their election at large, and when 
large and important cities in other States dealt with the matter of 
administration. This is due in a measure to the fact that more than 
three times as many legislatures met in 1911 as in 1912. With a few 
exceptions administrative changes during the past year have pro- 
ceeded little further than the stage of agitation or discussion. But 
it is apparent that there have been forces at work tending in the same 
direction as in previous years. While less productive of specific 
results, these forces have probably been in their influence equally as 
productive as those of some apparently more fruitful years. Among 
the proposals for administrative reforms have been the continued 
agitation in some quarters of the reduction in the size of school 
boards, the removal of school control from partisan politics, the 
reduction in the number of committees of boards, and a marked 
tendency to city self-government. 
The new charter proposed for New York City in 1911, under which 
the board of education was to be reduced from 46 to 7 members, with 
salaries for their services, failed of passage through the State legis- 
lature. But there is no means of knowing what would have been the 
fate of the proposal for a reduced board membership if it had been 
stripped of its association with the more objectionable provisions for 
salaried board members and the reduction of the school department 
to the level of the ordinary city department. These latter two fea- 
tures were sufficiently heavy to break down the whole structure. It 
was urged against salaries for board members that the unpaid board 
always has been almost universal in the United States, that the 
beneficiaries of political preferment—too often not the best type for 
the school board—would seek and obtain the position if it were made 
a salaried office, and that salaried members with nothing else to do 
would interfere with the professional duties of the superintendent _ 
and his staff of trained experts in professional control. Against re- 
 
-P-A-G-E-153
  
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1911-12. 127 
ducing the school department to the level of other city departments, 
it was said that the proposal would place the administration of the 
schools more in the hands of partisan politicians. These two fea- 
tures were the chief points of attack, no objection of consequence 
being made to reducing the membership of the board. In this con- 
nection quotation may be made from an open letter addressed by 
President Nicholas Murray Butler, of Columbia University, to Mayor 
William J. Gaynor on June 29, 1911: 
That the present board of education is much too large is hardly a debatable’ 
question, although it has been debated. The number was fixed at 46, rather 
than at 6 or at 146, simply to compose personal differences and borough rival- 
ries when the school system of the greater city was constituted. A board of 
18 or 15 would, in my judgment, be quite large enough to represent all the 
interests of the city of New York, and it would be small enough to do its busi- 
ness sitting about a table, where views could be easily expressed and compared. 
It would also be small enough to avoid the temptation to divide itself up into 
numerous committees, a method of organization which always makes for 
division of responsibility, inefficiency, and delay. A very few strokes of the 
pen in the present charter would substitute a small board for a large one, and 
would also free the board from a considerable portion of the purely routine 
work which now takes its time.* 
The school year 1911-12 was the first under the new “ School code 
of Pennsylvania,” which received brief treatment in the Annual 
Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1911, the year of its 
enactment. The reduction of the membership of boards and the 
general readjustment of every city school system in the State became 
necessary. Pittsburgh’s former board of 45 members, representing 
wards or subdistricts, was displaced by a new body composed of 15 
members; in Reading, a city of the second class, 64 members gave 
place to 9; Connellsville, a city of the third class, saw 21 men super- 
seded by 7. In all cases the ward system of selection of boards has 
passed away, and every member appointed or elected must now be 
a representative of all the people in the city. It is still too early 
properly to appraise the Pennsylvania law in the light of experience, 
but some intelligent discussion of its results has ensued. Some doubt 
has been expressed as to the efficiency of the law in removing the 
schools from partisan politics. It is pointed out that the election of 
the school directors at the same time with other public officers has a 
tendency to cause the drawing of partisan lines in the nomination 
and election of such directors. In some cities it may happen that 
intelligent and progressive wards which formerly elected a high type 
of board members may now be outvoted by less intelligent sections of 
the city, and thus the board may lose very desirable members. On the 
matter of reduced membership of boards, there appears to be practical 
  
1 Educational Review, 42: 205, September, 1911.
-P-A-G-E-154
  128 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
unanimity among educators that a wholesome change has been made. 
Complete data for all the cities of the State are lacking, but from 
fragmentary facts at hand it would appear that a larger percentage 
of women is now to be found among the directors selected. 
Some cities in which the membership of boards has more recently 
been reduced are New Orleans, La.; Lynn, Mass.; Covington, Lexing- 
ton, Newport, and Paducah, Ky. In New Orleans the reduction was 
from 17 to 5; in Lynn, from 12 to 5. In the Kentucky cities corre- 
sponding reductions were made. In Providence, R. I., where the 
system of election by wards prevails, reduction of membership and 
election at large are earnestly advocated. 
Doubt as to the advisability of creating extremely small boards in 
large cities has been expressed in some quarters. It will be noted, 
that President Butler, in the quotation previously made from his 
letter to Mayor Gaynor, appears to favor a board of about 15 mem- 
bers for New York City. Some have advocated increasing the mem- 
bership of the school committee of Boston from 5 to 9. Those who 
oppose the extremely small board urge that the duties of the govern- 
ing body of the school system in a city of several hundred thousand 
population are too numerous for a board of a very few members; that 
the advantages of having the composite judgment of a board over the 
individual opinion of a single director are to some degree defeated in 
the small board, and that small membership is conducive to “ one-man 
power.” However true this may be, the trend now is unquestionably 
toward reduction of the membership of extremely large administra- 
tive bodies. If the pendulum swings too far, it is not unreasonable 
to expect that it will right itself in a wholesome counter swing. 
Another movement noticeable in school administration is the tend- 
ency in some cities to reduce the number of committees of the school 
board, and thus to secure for ‘proposed measures more trustworthy 
administrative consideration. Without question, committees and sub- 
committees in some board organizations are too numerous. As these 
committees come to have large powers, either delegated or allowed 
by courtesy, it is certain that many important acts of the board as 
a whole become too perfunctory; too often a meritorious proposal is 
defeated or a questionable measure approved through scant considera- 
tion other than committee action, which is frequently behind closed 
doors or in such other privacy as will attract little or no attention. 
But during the past year several boards reduced the number of their 
committees. This, of course, is a natural concomitant of the reduc- 
tion of general membership. In Lynn, Mass., one of the cities to 
which reference has been made, it is specifically prescribed that the 
entire board shall consider all questions. 
In the matter of granting a greater measure of local self-govern- 
ment to cities, Ohio took the lead in 1912, when constitutional amend- 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1911-12. 129 
ments to that end were adopted on September 3. Regarding city 
school boards, Article VI, section 3, now reads: 
Provision shall be made by law for the organization, administration, and 
control of the public school system of the State supported by public funds; 
Provided, That each school district, embraced wholly or in part within any 
city, shall have the power by referendum vote to determine for itself the num- 
ber of members and the organization of the district board of education, and 
provision shall be made by law for the exercise of this power by such school 
districts. 
In Article XVIIT it is further provided that— 
Any municipality may frame and adopt or amend a charter for its govern- 
ment and may, subject to the provisions of section 3 of this article, exercise 
thereunder all powers of local self-government. 
The legislative authority in the municipality is required on peti- 
tion of 10 per cent of the electors to submit to vote of the people the 
question “Shall a commission be chosen to frame a charter?” or on 
its own initiative it may by two-thirds vote submit the question. 
On an affirmative vote of the electors, a commission of 15 is elected 
and a new charter is framed for submission to a vote within one 
year of the election of the commission. 
Il. REORGANIZED SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
Much is said and written nowadays of the school’s inefficiency ; 
one hears, too, a great deal of increasing its efficiency. Thus from 
both points of view the impression is given that something is wrong 
with the American school, that at least there is room for salutary 
changes. In the opinion of even the least critical, much remains 
to be done to perfect our school system. The chief count in the in- 
dictment against the school is that it is not meeting the needs of the 
community, and various panaceas for this ill have made their ap- 
pearance. “Enrichment” of the curriculum, “socializing” the 
school, and industria] training are some of the “movements” of 
which one has often heard or read. A writer recently asserted, 
perhaps without sufficient basis of fact for an accurate statement, 
that 75 per cent of the children in the United States are defective, 
and by implication his remedy would be concentration of interest 
and energy on improving the health of the younger generation. It 
can not be denied that there is much of value in many of the recent 
proposals for improvement. Some see in a complete reorganization 
of the school system the only effectual means of readjustment. But 
whatever may be the need or however great it may be, there is in 
some quarters a tendency to make radical changes in the organiza- 
tion and work of the city school.  
-P-A-G-E-156
  130 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
Gary, Ind.—While the school system of Gary, Ind., does not 
properly constitute a reorganized system, for it has only very recently 
attained the proportions of a city, still it may be regarded as a type 
of reorganization. In that city new buildings have been constructed 
and schools organized on the principle that much time waste may 
be eliminated and economy of administration secured by the simple 
expedient of bringing all the*grades, including the high school, into 
one building and using the building through a longer period of the 
day. The schoolhouse is made available for use from 8.30 in the 
morning until 10 at night, not that the children shall be kept in 
school at night or even all the day, but rather that the period of 
activity may be made to include more hours of work. The class 
room is made to serve two classes, the one doing regular work while 
the other is at play, manual training, or the like. The building is 
equipped for all such activities and the rotation of classes makes 
possible the widest use of all parts of the plant. All activities, in- 
cluding play, are conducted under supervision. 
The advantages claimed for the “ Gary plan” are that wider school 
opportunities are afforded the pupil and that at the same time the 
cost is reduced. Regarding cost, Supt. William A. Wirt says in his 
annual report: 
A tax levy of 25 cents per $100 will provide the revenue for building main- 
tenance with buildings of the Emerson [new] type. A tax levy of 78 cents per 
$100 will be necessary to provide the revenue for building maintenance with 
buildings of the Jefferson [older] type. School buildings of the Emerson type, 
therefore, will make possible a reduction of 53 cents per $100 in the tax levy. 
The present tax levy of the town of Gary is $3.14 per $100 assessed valuation 
of property. A reduction of 53 cents would make this levy $2.61. With a 
fair assessed valuation the school-tax levy in Gary will be reduced 30 cents 
per $100 assessed valuation of property this year, which will be the actual 
proof of the economy of school buildings of the Emerson type from the stand- 
point of the taxpayer. 
Pittsburgh, Pa—The enactment of the new school code in Penn- 
sylvania in 1911, to which reference has already been made, exempli- 
fied the tendency to reorganize the school system and on a larger 
scale, for there the entire State was affected. Pittsburgh has re- 
ceived more notice than any other city of the State in effecting the 
changes provided in the law. In that city not only was the school 
board reduced in membership, but the importance of the superin- 
tendency was increased and the supervisory staff much enlarged. 
A teachers’ training school was established and other measures 
adopted for raising the standard of the teaching force in the city. 
The course of study adopted includes provisions for industrial and 
commercial training and other features more in accord with the best 
practice of progressive city systems. The semiannual promotion of 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1911-12. 131 
pupils has displaced the annual. In short, a school system once the 
subject of much adverse criticism has speedily recovered from its 
atrophy and now gives promise of soon taking its place among the 
best city school systems of the country. 
Hammond, Ind.—tIn this city Supt. C. M. McDaniel has effected a 
reorganization which includes the introduction of cooperative indus- 
trial courses, vocational guidance, preparatory vocational instruction, 
an employment bureau, vacation schools for regular studies, and the 
promotion of pupils without examination or fixed numerical marking 
or grading of papers. The Hammond plan contemplates keeping 
the pupil in school as long as possible, providing practical training 
for him while in school, eliminating nonessentials, and helping the 
pupil through the prescribed work with as little waste as possible. 
Concord, N. H.—The reorganization of the school system of Con- 
cord, N. H., took the form of a readjustment of the grades. The. 
new scheme constitutes an approach to the “six-and-six” plan of 
school organization, to which some space is devoted in another part 
of this chapter. Eleven grades now comprise the entire course, but 
the effort is to do in these 11 years the work of the ordinary 12-grade 
school. The elementary schools are composed of the first six grades. 
The seventh grade, which is considered the first year of the high 
school, is placed in four separate buildings. The eighth grade is in 
a single building. The three upper grades—third, fourth, and fifth 
years of the high school, respectively—are housed in the former 
high-school quarters. Two basic principles underlie the present 
organization of the Concord schools: First, the separation of the 
seventh and eighth from the lower grades and their approximation 
to high-school conditions makes less abrupt the passage from ele- 
mentary to secondary education and works for economy in adminis- 
tration. Second, the plan of providing for the advancement of pupils 
as they are capable of advancing overcomes to a degree the limita- 
tions of the rigid system of promotion. Supt. Louis J. Rundlett 
writes as follows of the separate organization of the seventh and 
eighth grades: 
Results which have been made manifest by this arrangement are: A> very 
decided advance in scholarship. A marked contrast with former freshmen 
classes in preserving manners of action and dress that belong to pupils of their 
age. The social functions allowed have been of a character that retains the 
artlessness and purity of childhood. The class spirit is more wholesome and 
strong, being freed from the influence of older classes. 
Another form of the reorganization consists of offering elective or 
differentiated courses in the seventh and eighth years. This is made 
more feasible by drawing the line of demarcation between, the, 
elementary and secondary schools at the end of the sixth year instead 
of at the end of the eighth. Supt. A. B. Hess, at Crookston, Minn.,
-P-A-G-E-158
    132 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
has planned the courses in his city along this line. There the seventh 
and eighth grades are placed in a single building, and in this school 
three distinct courses are offered: (1) Preparation for the academic 
high school, (2) preparation for a commercial course, and (3) prepa- 
ration for an industrial course. 
Hackensack, N. J., Roanoke, Va., and Houston, Tex., are other 
cities in which fundamental changes in school organization have 
recently been effected. Changes in these cities represent different 
forms of the tendency to differentiate between the elementary and 
secondary schools on a basis other than the traditional basis. 
During recent years there has been a tendency toward and much 
discussion of conducting the school for practically the entire year. 
The vacation school, which made its appearance in the city system a 
quarter of a century ago, has blazed the way to a better use of the 
-pupil’s vacation, and many now see in this period an opportunity for 
valuable school work. In Cleveland, Ohio, a plan involving prac- 
tically a full quarter of work in the summer months was evolved, but 
later the school authorities receded from their advanced position in 
this regard. Newark, N. J., has during the past year been experi- 
menting with the all-year school. 
Ill. PROFESSIONAL INVESTIGATIONS. 
Of the recent efforts to reach a correct estimate of the school’s 
efficiency, none has attracted so much attention as the investigation 
of city systems by professional experts. In the Annual Report of 
the Commissioner of Education for 1911 attention was called to this 
method of approach to the problem of measurement, and the cities 
of Baltimore and New York were pointed out as the two most notable 
examples of investigated systems. 
There are certain difficulties which confront the investigator of a 
school system, however fit he may be for the undertaking. The lack 
of fixed and generally accepted standards of measurement by which 
to judge conditions found, constitutes one of the chief difficulties. 
That such standards exist as yet can hardly be successfully main- 
tained. For example, the number of minutes per week devoted to a 
particular study varies greatly in different cities. Formal grammar 
is begun in some cities in the sixth grade and in others in the fifth 
or seventh. Wide variation is found in methods of instruction and 
in the correlation of the several branches of the course of study. 
This diversity of practice indicates certainly a want of fixity of 
standard and perhaps a lack of knowledge of the true norm in these 
. particulars. In consequence, the investigator is hampered, since he 
must depend in large measure upon empirical opinion, a means which 
can not fix with finality the number of minutes per week that should
-P-A-G-E-159
    CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1911-12. 133 
be devoted by a sixth-grade pupil to arithmetic, the time at which 
formal grammar should be first taught, or any one of numerous other 
desirable standards. 
The lack of full and reliable data regarding the conditions in- 
vestigated constitutes another difficulty. A reasonably complete body 
of facts, not only of the city under investigation but also of other 
- cities of its class, is indispensable to the investigator. But much 
desirable information regarding city schools is not available, or at 
best it is in fragmentary form. Moreover, local school authorities 
themselves are often unable to give desired data. By reference to 
Table 8, Chapter XXV, of the Annual Report of the Commissioner 
of Education for 1911 it will be seen that of 1,241 city school sys- 
tems of 5,000 population and over, only 81 reported in proper form 
for publishing in full the data requested on the Bureau of Educa- 
tion’s unabridged schedule, or blank, used for the collection of city 
school statistics. If it may be assumed that failure to report fully 
on this schedule was due to inability to do so, then only 6.5 per cent 
of the cities of the country could give a body of data of moderate 
scope. It is, therefore, no small task for the investigator coming 
from outside the city to collect and make readily accessible the great 
mass of facts connected with the operation of a large and complex 
city school system. 
Add to the obstacles already indicated the dangers arising from 
the expression of preconceived opinions, from hasty antagonisms be- 
cause of fear that a report adverse to certain interests will be made, 
from opportunities for intensifying prejudices and like manifesta- 
tions of human nature, and one readily sees the difficulty and deli- 
cacy of the task before the investigator of a school system of such 
proportions as that of Baltimore or New York. 
Working under some of the limitations indicated, the “ Commission 
appointed to study the system of education in the public schools of 
Baltimore ” made its study and published its findings, which are now 
matters of record. The chief concern here is with the results of the 
investigation, and the greater proportion of these are more or less 
intangible. Some succeeding events, however, are worthy of note. 
Shortly after the commission’s report was made public three mem- 
bers of the school board were relieved of their duties. This was 
possible through a provision of the charter giving the mayor au- 
thority to remove any member within six months after the latter’s 
appointment. As it happened, three of the board’s members came 
within the reach of this charter provision, and they were displaced 
in favor of three men more in accord with the views of the mayor 
and with the opposition to some of the administrative policies of the 
majority of the former board.
-P-A-G-E-160
  134 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
One of the first acts of the reconstructed board was to remove the 
superintendent from office. The vacancy thus made was filled by 
the appointment of Mr. Francis A. Soper, principal of Baltimore 
City College, and his corps of assistants was reorganized to meet 
the views of the new administration. One other important change 
made was the revocation of the rule requiring teachers to pass pro- 
motional examinations at stated points in their progress to the maxi- 
mum salary in the schedule. Thus, neither the expressed nor the 
implied recommendations of the commission were carried out in the 
reorganization of the Baltimore school system that followed. Over 
the wisdom of the changes made, sharp controversy ensued. 
The New York inquiry, conducted during the year 1911-12, took 
a different form from that of Baltimore. Dr. Paul H. Hanus, pro- 
fessor of the history and art of teaching in Harvard University, was 
called by the board of estimate and apportionment to direct the 
investigation and associated with himself a body of able assistants. 
Eleven distinct phases of the school system were subjected to study. 
The several specialists selected, and the subjects assigned to them, 
were as follows: 
1. Dr. Frank P. Bachman, assistant superintendent of schools, Cleveland, Ohio-— 
Statistical studies : 
(a) “Promotion, nonpromotion, and part time.” 
(b) “ Intermediate schools.” 
(c) “Method of estimating the need of elementary school-teachers.”

consin—*“ The system of supervision and the board of examiners.” 
3. Dr. Jesse D, Burks, director, bureau of qanaictnel research, Philadelphia, 
Pa.—* The compulsory-attendance service.” 
4. Dr. Herman Schneider, dean of the college of engineering, University of Cin- 
cinnati—* Vocational (industrial) schools.” 
5. Dr. Frank W. Ballou, director of school affiliation and assistant professor of 
education, University of Cincinnati—‘‘ Problems in organization and 
administration of high schools.” 
6. Dr. Calvin O. Davis, assistant professor of education, University of Michigan, 
and inspector of high schools—* The course of study in high schools.” 
7. Dr. Frank V. Thompson, assistant superintendent of schools, Boston, Mass.— 
“ Commercial education.” 
8. Dr. Henry H. Goddard, director, department of psychological research, New 
Jersey Training School for Feeble-Minded Boys and Girls—“ Ungraded 
e classes.”

Detroit Home and Day School, Detroit, Mich.—‘ The Courtis tests in 
arithmetic.” 
10. Dr. Frank MeMurry, professor of elementary education, Teachers’ College, 
Columbia University— 
(a) “The quality of classroom instruction.” 
(b) “The course of study.” 
(c) “The supervision by the principals.”

  CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1911-12. 135 
To the 11 monographs contemplated in the assignments indicated 
above Dr. Hanus added a twelfth, “ Introductions and conclusions of 
the report.as a whole,” a paper prepared by himself. At the time 
this chapter is written, six of the monograph reports have come to the 
desk of the writer and others are in process of publication. The 
report of Prof. Moore, however, was rejected by the board of esti- 
mate, difference of opinion having arisen as to the statement of facts 
contained therein, and it will not appear officially as a part of Prof. 
Hanus’s findings. 
It is yet too early, of course, to appraise the results of the New 
York inquiry, but some noteworthy opinions have already found 
their way into print. About two months ago the New England 
Journal of Education said in an editorial :* 
It is a long time since there has been such a state of affairs, educationally, 
in any city as there is in New York at the present time. There seems to have 
been an “inquiry” into the school system. It has cost about $70,000. Some 
of it, at least, does not satisfy those who instigated the inquiry and pay for it. 
The report, so far as received, is not accepted, is not officially published, and 
epparently will not be. Apparently—and at present there is naught but ap- 
pearance to judge from—this inquiry will put an end to all school inquiries ; 
will achieve nothing for the good of the schools or for the enlightenment of the 
public; will intensify all prejudices for or against the management of the 
schools of New York City, widening the breach between the city government 
and the board of education, and magnifying personal prejudices to such a 
degree that facts and opinions will not be considered for a moment by any one 
independently of the effect upon the personal equation. Of course, it is possible 
that a merciful Providence, by whatever name it be recognized, may dispose 
differently from what men propose, and unseen and undreamed of good may 
result. 
The American School Board Journal is equally doubtful of direct 
wholesome results, but points to the legislature as a means of securing 
desirable ends:? 
The present unsettled situation is doing vast harm to the New York schools. 
The best outcome that can be hoped for is some radical legislation which will 
thoroughly reorganize the New York school government, will reduce the size and 
improve the character of the board of education, will increase and fix definitely 
the responsibilities of the superintendent and his associates, and will remove 
the schools altogether from the influence of the politicians. If this happens 
the inquiry will be worth while after all. 
It must not be supposed that the work of Prof. Hanus and his 
corps of associates will be fruitless. The educative influence of the 
reports will be felt in helping to fix school administrative standards 
in other cities, whatever may be their direct effects in New York 
City. The series of monographs will no doubt constitute a valuable 
contribution to city school literature, whether they be fruitful of

wholesome reforms in the city for which they were intended or not. 
Lack of space here prevents quotation at length from these mono- 
graphs, but Prof. Hanus’s “ Conclusions of the report as a whole” 
may be presented: 
From the foregoing it is clear that, in spite of the progress the public-school 
system of New York City has made since the consolidation, it is seriously de- 
fective. It needs thorough reorganization in respect to its administration by 
the board of education and the supervisory staff, and in respect to its general 
system of supervision. The board of education needs a clear conception of 
its functions and should come to close quarters with its work. In the general 
system of supervision, helpful cooperation under leadership should replace 
bureaucratic control. The board of superintendents fulfills no useful function 
and should be abolished. The board of examiners is decidedly efficient, but needs 
reorganization to improve and maintain its efficiency.. The quality of the teach- 
ing, in the elementary schools, at least, is in general not good. The courses of 
study for elementary schools and for high schools need thoroughgoing revision, 
and flexibility should replace rigidity in their administration. The compulsory 
attendance service is inefficient; it emphasizes police functions rather than 
preventive measures, and the staff needs reorganization on a functional basis. 
The recognized advantages of intermediate schools in relieving congestion have 
not led to the further establishment of such schools, and no attempt has been 
made to realize the exceptional educational opportunities these schools afford; 
promotions and nonpromotions are not studied so as to yield a real basis for a 
maximum rate of promotion; part-time classes should be abolished; the es- 
timated need of teachers for elementary schools and for high schools is not 
based on indisputable and well-organized data. The provision for industrial 
education is so meager as to be almost negligible; neither industrial nor com- 
mercial education is so maintained as to secure the necessary effective coopera- 
tion of industry and commerce, and cooperative and continuation schools are 
wholly absent. Habitual self-scrutiny and an appeal to well-conducted investi- 
gations and experiments to secure the necessary data to confirm or refute edu- 
tational opinion and furnish the regulative for all the activities of the school 
system and for its adequate financial support are lacking. 
Iv. CITY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
Three phases of the city superintendency engaged the attention 
of school men during the years 1911 and 1912. These are superin- 
tendents’ salaries, their tenure of office, and changes of incumbents 
in a number of important cities. 
During the period under consideration a very decided upward 
trend in superintendents’ salaries was noticeable, some of the most 
important and progressive cities in the country having increased 
the compensation of their chief professional officers. Of the 50 
cities having a population of 100,000 or more, 20 allowed the super- 
intendent an increase, according to the educational directory of the 
United States Bureau of Education. Among these were the follow- 
ing: Boston, from $6,000 to $10,000; New York, from $10,000 to 
$12,000; Pittsburgh, from $7,000 to $9,000; Buffalo, from $5,000 to 
$7,500; Cincinnati from $6,000 to $10,000; St. Louis, from $7,000
-P-A-G-E-163
  
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1911-12. +187 
to $8,000; Seattle, from $6,500 to $7,500; New Orleans, from $4,000 
to $5,000. As against these increases there were only two decreases, 
and the lower salaries were for new men assuming office. 3 
With the probable exception of the presidents of colleges and uni- 
versities, regarding whose salaries the Bureau of Education has not 
complete data, superintendents of schools in the larger cities are at 
the present time the highest paid class of educators in America. The 
average salary in cities of 100,000 population and over is $5,385. In 
cities of 50,000 to 100,000 population it is $3,502. While the figures 
showing salaries of presidents of all higher institutions of learning 
are not available for comparison here, those for the presidents of 
State universities were published by the Bureau of Education in 
1912.1. According to this report the average annual amount re- 
ceived by such officers was $5,877, the excess over the superintend- 
ent’s salary in the large city being only $492. The average salary 
of chief State school officers is $3,272, or $230 less than that of super- 
intendents in cities of 50,000 to 100,000 population. Thus, when 
compared with that of other educational experts, the salary of the 
city’s chief school officer attained very respectable proportions. 
The tendency to raise the salaries of city superintendents has not 
been confined to any particular section of the country. On the 
Pacific coast, for example, are found the cities of Los Angeles and 
Seattle, whose superintendents receive $6,000 and $7,500, respectively. 
Not counting as southern the border cities of Baltimore, Washington, 
Louisville, and St. Louis, there still remain in the South, Birming- 
ham and New Orleans, which pay $5,000 each. 
The abstract question of the tenure of office of city superintendents 
has evoked no great discussion in recent years, but some intelligent 
attention has been given the subject, and an occasional law has been 
enacted increasing tenure. The Pennsylvania law, for example, pro- 
vides for a term of four years, the former maximum period for which 
a choice could be made having been only three. There seems to be 
no great demand for authority to elect for a longer period than four 
or five years, but on the other hand the limitation to a period of a 
single year would seem to need amendment to permit of choice for a 
longer time. Placing upon the superintendent the necessity of hay- 
ing to stand annually for reelection makes his situation too pre- 
carious and militates against his working at the highest degree of 
efficiency. Despite this limitation in some cities, however, the con 
dition usually adjusts itself and many superintendents who have to 
stand for reelection at short intervals are found to have had long 
periods of service. The average length of service of the incumbents 
in the 50 cities of 100,000 population or more is approximately 7} 
years. Among these are some cases that are notable. The names of

Including his term of service in Brooklyn, Supt. William H. Max- 
well has held a professional administrative position in the schools of 
New York City for 25 years. According to the “ Educational direc- 
tory,” to which reference has been made, the longest period of service 
of all the superintendencies in the United States is that of William 
W. Cottingham, of Easton, Pa., who is reported to the bureau as 
having received his original appointment in 1853. 
Some of the notable changes in superintendencies during the year 
1911-12 were as follows: Stratton D. Brooks, from Boston to the 
presidency of the University of Oklahoma; Frank B. Dyer, from 
Cincinnati to Boston; Sylvanus L. Heeter, from St. Paul to Pitts- 
burgh; Milton C. Potter, from Pueblo to St. Paul; Francis A. Soper, 
from Baltimore City College to Baltimore; Charles E. Chadsey, from 
“Denver to Detroit; J. M. H. Frederick, from Lakewood to Cleve- 
land; Jacob G. Collicott, from Tacoma to Indianapolis; Ellis U. 
Graff, from principal of high school to superintendent, Omaha; 
Percy M. Hughes, from assistant superintendent in Washington to 
Syracuse. 
V. THE COURSE OF STUDY. 
Owing to the constantly changing demands upon the school, the 
curriculum is of perennial interest to the school man and frequent 
revisions or modifications are found necessary. The addition of 
some new subject, or the elimination of a nonessential or less essen- 
tial topic, is a constant source of concern to the superintendent. 
Some phases of the course of study which have recently engaged the 
attention of school administrative officers are: The elimination of 
nonessentials, shortening the elementary course, departmental teach- 
ing in the upper grades, differentiation in grammar-school courses, 
the introduction of European history, moral training, and such sub- 
jects as withdrawals and retardation during the progress. through 
the curriculum.

CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1911-12. 139 
SIMPLIFICATION OF THE COURSE OF STUDY. 
For some years educators have been advocating the enrichment of 
the course of study. This demand arose because of changed condi- 
tions in American life—urban life instead of rural; growth in wealth, 
population, and territory; inventions, scientific discoveries, the dis- 
appearance of the apprentice system, and the introduction of the 
factory system. The traditional three R’s were not broad enough to 
prepare for complete living during the latter part of the nineteenth 
century. Accordingly, there were added to the course new subjects, 
such as physiology, physical training, nature study, manual training, 
music, and drawing. 
No one would think seriously of eliminating any of these from the ~ 
twentieth century course of study, yet the question arises,- How is 
it possible for a child to assimilate all the material of these subjects 
in an eight-year course? Many school men began almost simulta- 
neously to advocate, not the elimination of whole subjects, but the 
elimination of certain subject matter. Some topics in arithmetic were 
found to be useless for practical purposes; the material in American 
history was voluminous and unwieldy; many facts in geography had 
no significance; and many of the topics in physiology had no bearing 
on proper methods of living. The school, because of its inertia, was 
slow in adapting such vast accumulations of material to child life; 
but gradually superintendents began to eliminate a little here and 
a little there. Now many courses of study indicate definitely what 
topics are to be omitted, or they indicate a minimum amount to be 
taught in each subject, but omitting numerous topics once included. 
~ Where courses of study are not definitely planned, the suggestion is 
generally found that nonessentials be eliminated. 
To show what is actually done to simplify the course of study, 
the following quotations are presented from letters in answer to 
an inquiry as to what eliminations have been made in arithmetic, 
history, ete.: 
Oakland, Cal.—We have eliminated from our arithmetic work very much of 
cémpound numbers, using only a few of the more common tables. We have 
eliminated all of stocks, bonds, etc.; cube root; mensuration, excepting the 
simpler forms; and the more difficult parts of percentage. In our arithmetic I 
_ think we are able to promote more pupils, and so far as I can see, the pupils 
know as much about arithmetic as they ever did. 
Helena, Mont.—In history we are not placing very much stress upon explora- 
tions and discoveries. We have also reduced the amount of time that has been 
given heretofore to the details of battles. More attention is given to matters 
pertaining to cause and effect or the “ why ” of history and to those thoughts of 
history which have to do with the making of government and the modification 
of our laws from time to time. We are placing less stress on dates, except a 
few pivotal dates. 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  140 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
Leavenworth, Kans.—The effect [of eliminating subject matter] has been 
decidedly marked and quite satisfactory. My teachers are deeply interested in 
the movement, because its good results are so apparent to them. 
La Crosse, Wis.—In the year before these changes [elimination of non- 
essentials] were instituted there were 79 per cent of the pupils promoted, the 
following year 87 per cent, last year 89 per cent, and in the semester just 
closed [January, 1913] 93 per cent. Whether this gain is due wholly to changes 
in the course of study may be disputed, but the changes certainly helped. 
Winona, Minn.—In grammar we have decreased very largely the amount of 
technical grammar studied in the grades and have transferred the emphasis to 
forms of expression, written and oral. Conjugations, declensions, modes, etc., 
receive little attention, and this little only in connection with composition 
work. The quality of the work done has, I believe, been improved. 
Knoxville, Tenn.—The effect [of eliminating nonessentials] has been good 
upon the schools and has resulted in increased promotions. 
McKeesport, Pa.—Our change in arithmetic has not been due so much to the 
topics we have eliminated as the grade of the work to suit the abilities of the 
children at the different stages of their progress. We have eliminated difficult 
fractions, including complex fractions; difficult work in the lowest common 
multiple and greatest common divisor; difficult work in papering, plastering, 
carpeting, etc.; the trapezoid and trapezium; linear and surveyor’s square 
measure; Troy and apothecaries weights; all interest except to find interest by 
6 per cent method; compound interest; partial payments, except the very simple 
kind, and annual interest; cube root; difficult problems in compound propor- 
tion; progressions; annuities. The work in arithmetic is confined to a great 
amount of simple work within the comprehension of the child. 
Charleston, S. 0.—My belief is that the quality of the work is improving and 
that the number of repeaters is being diminished [since the course of study was 
simplified]. 
¢ The above are typical of the letters received by the bureau. A few 
schools report that little has been done to simplify the course. In 
some courses are found such topics as average of payments, foreign’ 
exchange, domestic exchange, detailed study of wars, the exact loca- 
tion of small cities, technical physiology, etc. The tendency, however, 
is away from a curriculum crowded with nonessentials. 
SHORTENED ELEMENTARY COURSES. 
Several years ago many cities had nine grades in the elementary 
school; now very few have more than eight, and some but seven. The 
tendency is undoubtedly toward shorter and simpler elementary 
courses. It was claimed that the ninth grade was to a great extent: 
a review of the work done in the seventh and eighth; that it led 
nowhere; that pupils became indifferent and dropped out of school. 
One of the small cities in Pennsylvania that had a nine-year ele- 
mentary course adopted an eight-year course in 1908. There were 
at that time 100 pupils in the high school; last year about 400 were 
enrolled. Those who entered from the ninth grade were over age 
and indifferent. The entering classes from the eighth grade take up  
-P-A-G-E-167
  CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1911-12. © 141 
high-school work more easily than those who entered from the ninth 
grade. Under the ninth-grade plan there was a great loss in numbers 
between the eighth and ninth grades, as well as between the ninth 
grade and the first year of the high school. 
Kansas City, Mo., stands out prominently as an example of a city 
having but seven grades in the elementary course. In his report for 
1911 Supt. J. M. Greenwood writes: 
Owing to a seven years’ course of study in the elementary schools, from 70 to 
75 per cent of the pupils who complete that course enter high school, and more 
than 13 per cent of all our pupils are in high school. 
The reduction of the number of grades is a topic often discussed at 
State and national teachers’ associations. No statistics are at hand, 
however, to show the exact number of schools that have more or fewer 
than eight grades. New England was for many years the stronghold 
of the nine-year plan. Practically all cities of any size in New 
England now have eight years, and a few have adopted the “ six-and- 
six ” plan. 
DEPARTMENTAL TEACHING IN THE GRAMMAR GRADES. 
During the eighties a few schools made trial of departmental teach- 
ing in the elementary schools. The Report of the Commissioner of 
Education for 1886-87, in summing up the results of these experi- 
ments, says: 
The attempts to adapt the methods of high-school instruction to the elemen- 
tary grades have not béen attended with conspicuous success. 
The movement at present, however, is toward departmental instruc- 
tion in the seventh and eighth grades. Some superintendents have 
extended the plan to include even the fifth and sixth grades. 
The movement, no doubt, has been given impetus by the fact that 
departmental teaching in New York City has proved a success. This 
method of organization was introduced into the schools of that city 
about 1900. At present three-fifths of its grammar schools are so 
organized. Even in the lower grades of some of the New York City 
schools a limited form of the plan is in use. <A teacher who is pro- 
ficient in some subject, such as music or drawing, may teach in three 
or four rooms, while the teachers of these rooms take turns in having 
charge of her work in other subjects. 
In the report of the New Orleans schools for 1912, it is stated that 
the experiment of teaching under the departmental plan was tried 
and that the results were such that the experiment was continued for 
another year. 
Among the many cities that have recently adopted the plan are: 
Aberdeen, S. Dak.; Lincoln, Nebr.; Trenton, Mo.; Johnstown, Pa.;
-P-A-G-E-168
  142 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
Meadville, Pa.; Washington, Pa.; Hackensack, N. J.; Bloomfield, 
N. J.; Jackson, Mich.; Huntington, W. Va. . 
The organization of the grammar grades on the departmental 
plan is made comparatively easy in New York City by the fact that 
the buildings are large and that there are many seventh and eighth 
grade classes in each. In the smaller cities, where the buildings are 
small, there may not be more than one seventh and one eighth grade 
in each building. The teachers of these grades could and sometimes 
do exchange rooms, but the plan has generally been to bring all the 
seventh and eighth grade pupils together into one building under a 
grammar-school principal.. It is thus evident that the small city 
with but a few rooms in each grade building has to solve an entirely 
different problem from that of a metropolitan city with its large 
grade buildings. 
Some of the smaller cities use a high-school building which the 
high school has outgrown, and a few have erected buildings for 
the grammar grades. Other cities arrange the districts so that 
rooms are made available in a building centrally located, while still 
others use a few rooms in the high-school buildings. 
This plan is, no doubt, a step. toward the “six-and-six plan,” 
which is discussed in another part of this chapter. 
On the whole, school officials and teachers who have experimented 
with departmental teaching consider it a step forward in school 
crganization. It is claimed that teachers can do better work, and 
that the pupil enters upon his work in the high school with more 
confidence and with less likelihood of failure.. On the other hand, 
it is pointed out that the pupils lose the personal influence of the 
single classroom teacher. A State school official recently asked, “ Is 
not the plan for the teacher rather than for the pupil?” So long 
as school administration is an empirical science, no theories formu- 
lated in an office can answer the question. Many experiments must 
be made with the plan to prove whether it is efficient. 
DIFFERENTIATION IN GRAMMAR-SCHOOL COURSES. - 
In some cities the courses in the grammar school have been differen- 
tiated. Among these are New Britain, Conn.; Crookston, Minn.; 
Bloomfield, N. J.; and Buffalo, N. Y. 
New Britain, Conn.—Four courses are offered: (1) A general 
course; (2) a household arts course; (3) a practical arts course; 
(4) a business and English course. The choice of courses is not left 
to the pupil alone, but is in all cases subject to the approval of both 
the parent and the principal of the school. Changes are permitted 
from a given course to any other upon the request of the parent.
-P-A-G-E-169
  CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1911-12. 143 
Crookston, Minn.—Three courses are offered: (1) Preparation for 
the academic high school; (2) preparation for a commercial course ; 
(3) preparation for an industrial course. 
Bloomfield, N. J.—Two courses are offered: (1) A course pre- 
paratory to high school, which includes the subjects of arithmetic 
and algebra, English and Latin, United States history, geography, 
physiology, penmanship, manual training or domestic art, and draw- 
ing; (2) a course preparatory to*a vocation, which includes the sub- 
jects of arithmetic and business practice, English, United States 
history, geography, physiology, manual training or domestic art, 
and drawing. 
Buffalo, N. Y.—In two schools an elementary course of six years 
has been introduced with an opportunity to specialize after the sixth 
year along three different lines, regular, industrial, and commercial. 
If this plan appears to meet the needs of pupils better than the old- 
line organization, it will be introduced in other schools. 
EUROPEAN HISTORY IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, 
Another movement to which attention may be called is that of 
introducing European history into the elementary school. In 1910 
the American Historical Association published the report of the 
committee of eight, which had been appointed by the association to 
investigate the subject of history in the elementary school. The com- 
mittee recommended that, such European history as would form a 
background to American history be taught in the sixth grade. 
Some States, such as Pennsylvania and Maine, have incorporated 
essential features of the report in the course of study for the ele- 
mentary schools. Numerous cities have adopted the recommendations 
of the report. 
Several publishing houses report a growing tendency to introduce 
European history in some form into the elementary grades. One 
house writes that the movement has been more decided in the East 
than in the West. 
Among the many cities that have adopted European history, 
either for supplementary reading or for regular class work, are: 
Syracuse, N. Y.; Alliance, Ohio; Danville, Ky.; Greenville, Pa.; 
Milford, Mass.; Providence, R. I.; Elkhart, Ind.; Kalamazoo, Mich.; 
Duluth, Minn.; Mobile, Ala.; New York, N. Y.; Montpelier, Vt.; 
Brookline, Mass. 
MORAL TRAINING. 
Some educators express doubt as to the advisability of attempting 
formal moral instruction in the schools, while others urge the at- 
tempt, but all agree that one of the functions of the school is to secure  
-P-A-G-E-170
  144 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
proper moral conduct. Religious instruction is practically barred 
from the American school, because of denominational differences of 
opinion, but there seems to be little reason why moral principles 
should not be inculeated. The method of procedure, however, is not 
agreed upon and comparatively few schools attempt formal instruc 
tion of this character. 
In Schenectady, N. Y., a graded course of study has been prepared 
and systematic training is given. St. Louis also has an outline 
course of study, and 30 minutes per week are devoted to moral les: 
sons. In Chicago the idea prevails that formal instruction in virtues 
is not desirable, but an abstract of moral principles and ideals is 
outlined for all grades and moral direction is attempted. Kansas 
City, Mo.; Richmond, Va.; Houston, Tex.; and some other cities have 
forms of moral instruction. 
Some interesting devices have appeared for the inculcation of 
ethical principles. In Lexington, Ky., children are encouraged te 
hunt for the best in life by a system of “books of golden deeds.’ 
Supt. M. A. Cassidy thus describes the system in practice there: * 
The great and noble ideals, past and present, are ever the teachers of the 
young. In some measure to meet the demand for ideals in the lives of the 
Lexington children, thus helping to model their own, and so help them to be 
come better men and women by the subtle inculcation of moral and civic 
righteousness, we have had for several years in every grade in our public 
schools a book of Golden Deeds. This is only a blank book, of moderate size 
with “ Golden Deeds” printed on its cover with letters of gold. In their read 
ing, in their study of history and biography, and in their contact with life 
the pupils are encouraged to treasure in their minds the good deeds and nobk 
impulses which they may discover and recite them to their companions in the 
grade. Ten minutes are daily devoted to this as an opening exercise. Th 
deeds found and brought to the grades by the children are illustrative of obe 
dience, honesty, truthfulness, unselfishness, sympathy, consecration to duty 
usefulness, industry, perseverance, patience, self-respect, purity, self-control 
self-reliance, fortitude, courage, heroism, ambition, temperance, courtesy, kind 
ness to brute and human, justice, fidelity, determination, patriotism, and othe! 
traits that go to make character that is esteemed by civilized society. If th 
deeds so recited are deemed worthy by a vote of the grade they are recorde¢ 
in the “ Book of Golden Deeds.” The children take great pride in these exer 
cises, and many of the books are works of art. The enrolling is beautifull) 
done, and there are numerous pictorial illustrations of the deeds recorded. 
The drama, motion pictures and lantern slides, story telling, anc 
“ school cities ” in which self-government is promoted, are other form: 
of inculeating correct ethical standards which are found in som« 
cities. Newark, N. J.; Houston, Tex.; Hayward, Cal.; and a fev 
other cities have forms of student, self-government. 
The Moral Education Board, with headquarters in Baltimore, i 
an organization for the promotion of ethical instruction throughou 
the country.

TIME SCHEDULES. 
City superintendents usually indicate in their respective courses 
of study the amount of time to be devoted each day to each study. 
This plan, it is claimed, prevents a teacher from emphasizing those 
subjects in which she is especially interested, to the exclusion of other 
subjects of equal importance. The following table gives the average 
time in minutes per week devoted to each study in each grade in 10 
cities—Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Rochester, Cleveland, Cin- 
cinnati, Indianapolis, St. Louis, Chicago, Milwaukee, and San 
Francisco:

The Pennsylvania State Board of Education recently appointed a 
committee to study the time value of the elementary school studies 
for the purpose of determining the proper basis for distributing the 
school time among the various subjects of the course of study. Sub- 
committees composed of superintendents, principals, and teachers 
have been appointed to help collect data for the general committee. 
When the report is completed, it should be of value to superintendents 
who assign their teachers definite time schedules. 
VI. INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
While not confined to cities, industrial education, as the term is 
now used, is found more in cities than elsewhere and should come in 
for its share of treatment in any survey of urban education which 
purports to cover the field. Within the past two years three phases 
of this type of training have been uppermost in the interest and 
attention of its advocates. These are: (1) Cooperative courses and 
continuation schools; (2) a dual system of control under which it is 
proposed to separate, in large measure at least, the administration 
of industrial schools from that of common schools; and (3) Federal
-P-A-G-E-172
    
146 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
aid to industrial training. To these the closely related subject of 
vocational guidance might be added. 
Cooperative courses and continuation schools or classes received 
great momentum from the visit to America in the latter part of 1910 
and the early part of 1911 of Dr. Georg Kerschensteiner, director of 
schools, Munich, Bavaria. The appearance of this distinguished edu- 
cator at the meeting of the National Society for the Promotion of 
Industrial Education, held in Boston, in November, 1910, and his 
subsequent tour through other important cities did more than any 
other single event to crystallize thought on cooperation between school 
and employer as the most effectual means of working out the problem 
of industrial training. True, the cooperative course was already in 
existence in a few places, and the day continuation school was making 
its appearance at the time of the Boston meeting, but the increased 
attention which was then and subsequently directed to these types of 
schools has undoubtedly had much to do with their spread to all parts 
of the country. There are now about two dozen cities in the United 
States in which cooperative courses in some form have been organ- 
ized, and continuation schools are to be found in even more localities. 
Some cities in which cooperative courses have recently been estab- 
lished are: Passaic, N. J.; Allentown and York, Pa.; Lansing, Mich.; 
Hammond, Ind.; and McComb City, Miss. Continuation schools 
have taken root in Wisconsin, where laws were enacted in 1911 pro- 
viding for their establishment. According to a recent statement of 
Mr. H. E. Miles, chairman of the committee on industrial education 
cf the National Association of Manufacturers, who is a resident of 
Wisconsin, there have been established in that State 25 schools of the 
“ continuation ” species. Other States are following the example of 
Wisconsin in the proposal of similar laws. Among these are Illinois 
and Washington. 
A question which remains unsettled in the United States is whether 
industrial education shall be administered as a department of the 
common school system and under the administrative authorities of 
the common schools or as a separate and parallel system under 
distinct administrative authorities. That is to say, Shall we have a 
unified system of administration of all schools, whatever may be the 
type of school organized or the form of instruction given, or shall we 
adopt a dual system similar to that of Germany and some other Euro- 
pean countries? There are arguments on botb sides of the question, 
but it is one with which there has not yet been sufficient experience in 
America to warrant positive conclusions. In 1906 the Legislature of 
Massachusetts, pursuant to the recommendation of a temporary com- 
mission appointed the year before by the governor, created a commis-
-P-A-G-E-173
  
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1911-12. 147 
sion on industrial education and conferred upon it the power to 
establish independent industrial schools. Thus the initial step toward 
industrial training in this country was along the line of the German 
system, but in 1909 this commission was consolidated with the State 
board of education and the dual system of control passed away in 
that State. Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey have had only 
the unified system. Wisconsin’s modification of the dual system was 
inaugurated only in 1911. 
Those who favor the new departure seem to proceed on the theory 
(1) that dual administration has worked well in Germany and some 
other parts of Europe and will therefore work well in this country, 
and (2) that more practical administrators are needed for the indus- 
trial schools than for the common schools. They have been charged 
with regarding the present administrative agencies as incapable of 
handling industrial training. 
Those opposed to the dual system urge that the present school 
machinery is capable of handling vocational education, and that 
therefore two sets of school administrators would be an unnecessary 
duplication and a cumbersome arrangement. It is further urged 
that the common schools would be weakened, as has been the case in 
some sections of Europe; that class, or caste, distinctions would be 
intensified; that the industrial school, under separate control, would 
tend too much to the mechanical and would neglect the “ theoretical 
studies ”; that teachers would be drawn to the vocational schools from 
the common schools, to the detriment of the latter. 3 
However forceful the arguments on either side of this question 
may appear to the reader, the dual system of control has already 
entered upon a period of trial and earnest effort to make it a success 
in this country. Writing of the results thus far of the new régime 
in Wisconsin, Mr. H. E. Miles, to whom reference has already been 
made, recently said: 
In any bright, progressive, up-to-date community a substantially perfect in- 
dustrial school for children of 14 to 16 years of age can be started in from 
4 to 12 weeks, with teachers of superior quality, who will incidentally exert 
a reflex influence upon our present out-of-touch, out-of-date school workers to 
the infinite betterment of the present common schools. There is nothing of 
speculation in this statement. It is a statement of simple fact demonstrated 
in most, if not all, of the places where it has been tried. Such a school was 
started in Racine, Wis., about a year ago on about 48 hours’ notice from the 
State authorities and on 4 weeks’ preparation by the local authorities. Twenty- 
five such schools were started in other places in Wisconsin last September. 
In Sheboygan, for instance, a bright, prosperous industrial community of 
40,000 people, the class in woodworking is taught by a splendid German. of 
middle age, with heart as young as the children’s. He was an apprentice in 
Germany; then a journeyman; and then, in this country, journeyman, foreman,
-P-A-G-E-174

ind employer, successively. * * * At the end of six weeks there were 350 
children, 14 to 16 years old, from the industries in this school, with 100 on the 
waiting list, and it is estimated that still 150 more will come in when the 
authorities fully enforce the law, as they must. 
The bill for Federal aid to industrial education which in different 
forms has been before the United States Congress for several years 
has not as yet become a law, but friends of the measure who have so 
untiringly sought its passage have now increased grounds for hope 
of success. Within the past two years two events of importance have 
occurred in the progress of this measure toward, as its advocates 
hope, its ultimate passage. One of these was the introduction of a 
similar bill by Representative Lever, of South Carolina, and its pas- 
sage through the lower House of Congress at the regular session of 
1912. The “ Lever bill,” however, was confined in its provisions to 
the promotion of instruction in agriculture and home economics 
through extension departments in the several State agricultural col- 
jeges, and may therefore be considered as only a step in the direction 
of Federal aid to industrial education proper. 
The second important event in this connection was the more recent 
passage through the Senate of the bill introduced by Senator Page, 
of Vermont, and widely known as the “ Page bill.” This measure 
contains all the important provisions of the older and well-known 
“ Davis bill,” “ Doliver bill,” and others of like character, which 
have already received notice from time to time in the publications 
of the Bureau of Education. When the Congress came to an end 
the “Lever bill” and the “ Page bill” were still in the hands of a 
conference committee of the two Houses of Congress, and no final 
action was taken on either. 
Vil. KINDERGARTENS. 
One of the conspicuous features of the progress of city schools has 
been the recent extension of the kindergarten system. For many 
years the kindergarten has been attached to the elementary school 
without being “adjusted.” It has been looked upon with suspicion 
by many elementary school-teachers. On the other hand, kinder- 
garten teachers have often entered protests against the methods of 
the primary school when the kindergarten children did not fit in with 
the formal methods of the first grade. 
The tendency-now is to make the kindergarten an integral part of 
the elementary course and to harmonize kindergarten and primary 
methods. To bring about a proper adjustment between the two 
schools, Supt. F. B. Dyer, of Boston, in an address to the Boston 
teachers, said? that he hoped to arrange some way by which the   
1 Kindergarten-Primary Magazine, October, 1912, p. 57.
-P-A-G-E-175
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1911-12. 2 2449 
kindergarten teachers could have the first-grade children for three or 
four afternoons a week and use with them methods of the same kind 
as those to which they had been accustomed before their graduation 
into “real school.” In Los Angeles, Cal., the first primary grade 
has been placed under the supervision of the kindergarten super- 
visor, so that there may be no abrupt break between the kindergarten 
and the elementary school. 
Nearly every city reports an increasing number of kindergartens. 
In Chicago a room for a kindergarten is always included in plans 
for a new building. During every school year there are frequent re- 
quests from individual members of the board of education, front 
members of the city council, from women’s clubs, and from parents’ 
associations that a kindergarten be established in this or that one of 
the 90 schools in which there is not a kindergarten. “These numer- 
ous requests,” Mrs. Ella Flagg Young writes in her report for 1912, 
“and the above recognition indicate that the time has come when a 
kindergarten should be established in every school.” 
Supt. W. H. Maxwell, of New York City, writing in the Educa- 
tional Review, of October, 1912, says that prior to 1898 there were 
only 7 kindergartens in New York City, and that there are now 843, 
with over, 30,000 pupils. 
Supt. H. P. Emerson, of Buffalo, N. Y., in his report for 1911, 
writes: “ We are rapidly reaching the time when every public school 
will have a kindergarten. There are at present 53 kindergartens, 
representing 49 schools.” 
Other cities that have recently added more kindergartens are Salt 
Lake City, Minneapolis, Cincinnati, Milwaukee, and Pittsburgh. 
During the past year kindergarten teachers have studied and dis- 
cussed the merits of the Montessori method to determine its place in 
the American kindergarten. A few schools report that some of the 
Montessori material is used and that they are adapting the method 
to their needs. The reports are so few and fragmentary that no con- 
clusions can be reached as to the progress of the “ method” in the 
public schools of this country. It is evident that city superintendents 
and teachers are not adopting the method or any part of it without 
investigation. 
Vill. TEACHERS’ SALARIES AND PENSIONS. 
A thoroughgoing statistical study of teachers’ salaries has not been 
made in this country since the publication in 1905 of the report of 
the committee of the National Education Association on “ Salaries, 
tenure, and pensions of public-school teachers in the United States.” 
In the absence of such a study at this time it is impossible to show  
-P-A-G-E-176
  
150 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
with any degree of accuracy the progress made through the nation- 
wide effort to secure better pay for teaching service. The steadily 
increasing cost of living has made necessary an advance in all sal- 
aries, and it is known in a general way that teachers have shared in 
this advance, but there is little definite information to show whether 
the teacher has relatively gained or lost ground when his salary is 
considered in conjunction with the increased expense at which he 
must live, 
There are some data from individual cities which indicate that the 
teacher, though still inadequately paid, is surely coming to receive 
more consideration in the matter of salary. In numerous cities in- 
creases were made during the year, and in reports from others are 
found recommendations by school officials that more pay be granted.t 
The movement to secure for women teachers pay equal to that of 
men, where the service rendered is substantially of the same char- 
acter and amount, received decided impetus when on October 30, 
1911, a bill became a law authorizing the Board of Education of New 
York City to adopt by-laws providing for equal pay. Pursuant to 
the provisions of this act the board of education adopted new sched- 
ules of salaries to take effect January 1, 1912. A rule adopted at the 
same time provides that the salary, including the annual increment, 
to which a member of the supervising or teaching staff was entitled 
prior to the passage of the act of 1911, shall not be reduced. In ac- 
cordance with this policy of the board, a number of the old schedules 
were reenacted, in order that teachers already in the service might 
continue their progress to the maximum salary, ds in previous years. 
For elementary teachers coming into the service as beginners the fol- 
lowing scheme of payment was adopted and made applicable to both 
men and women:

PENSIONS. 
According to the report of the committee of the National Education 
Association on “ Salaries, tenure, and pensions,” previously referred 
to, there were in 1905 nine States in which teachers’ pension laws of 
either general or special application were in force. This report, 
however, omitted any mention of the special law applying to Charles- 
ton, S. C., which had been enacted prior to that time. In 1912 there 
were 26 States having such laws. States having laws of either gen- 
eral or special application in the latter year were as follows: 
Arizona.’ Louisiana.” Oregon.’ 
California? Maryland.* Pennsylvania.” 
Colorado.” Massachusetts.* Rhode Island. 
Connecticut.* Michigan.” South Carolina.” 
Delaware.” Minnesota.® Utah. 
Hllinois.* Nebraska.” Vermont.* 
Indiana.’ New Jersey.? Virginia.’ 
Kansas.* New York." Wisconsin.* 
Kentucky.” Ohio.” 
In general, pension laws are of three kinds, according as they create 
systems which are noncontributory, compulsory-contributory, or 
voluntary-contributory from the standpoint of the teacher. In the

first class no part of the teacher’s salary is withheld and he makes no 
contribution to the retirement fund, which in consequence must be 
derived from public or other sources. The law enacted in 1912 in 
Arizona, where the State pays the entire annuity, is of this type. The 
compulsory-contributory plan is the most prevalent. Under this plan 
a small percentage of the teacher’s salary is withheld at the time of 
payment and is applied to the retirement fund. Usually the more 
recent laws of this type provide for supplementing the teachers’ con- 
tributions with public or quasi-public funds. Under the voluntary- 
contributory plan, teachers may elect to take advantage of the pro- 
visions of the retirement system. The Kansas act, approved March 14, 
1911, belongs to this class. 
An examination of the laws of the several States will reveal the 
fact that, notwithstanding the caution of the American people with 
regard to the policy of granting civil pensions, there are now no 
Jess than 24 States in which public funds are devoted to the payment 
of annuities to superannuated teachers. Few laws, it is true, spe- 
cifically provide for taxation for that purpose, but the funds ap- 
propriated are public funds nevertheless. In the case, for example, 
of salaries withheld on account of teachers’ absence and applied. to 
the pension fund, the amounts so withheld would otherwise remain 
in the public treasury and should be expended as other school moneys 
are expended. Likewise, interest on school-fund balances, which in 
some cases is applied to the payment of annuities, is clearly a part of 
the assets of the school system. There can be no question that the 
trend in legislation is toward the public’s sharing with the contrib- 
uting teachers the burden of a teachers’ pension system. With only 
one exception, every State which enacted a pension law in 1911 or 
1912 incorporated a provision for some contribution by the public; 
and Arizona, the last to enact suchea law, provided that the total 
amount of the annuities granted should be paid out of the State 
treasury. 
Ix. HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The field of secondary education is too broad and difficult of proper 
treatment to permit an attempt at exhaustive discussion here, but 
some phases of high-school activity which have been most in the 
public mind may be briefly noticed. These are two-year or other 
shorter courses, junior high schools, and high-school fraternities. 
SHORTER COURSES. 
School administrators have learned that more pupils will be reached 
if short, practical courses are offered in the high school than if ad- 
herence to the rigid four-year course is insisted upon. Some chil-
-P-A-G-E-179
  CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1911-12. 153 
dren, because of home conditions, age, and other considerations, know 
that they never will be able to complete the traditional high-school 
course, so drop out of school altogether at the end of the eighth grade. 
In a number of cities two-year and other shorter courses have been 
provided for such pupils. Preparation for commercial and indus- 
trial pursuits and other vocational training are usually given in these 
abridged forms of the high-school curriculum. From reports re- 
ceived by the Bureau of Education these shorter periods of second- 
ary school work are proving popular without affecting attendance 
in four-year courses. The emphasis in recent years upon vocational 
training in the public schools has no doubt contributed to the new 
trend toward the shorter period of practical high-school education. 
At least the trend has been so strong in that direction that the two- 
year course is now an established fact and in all probability has come 
to stay. Among the numerous cities which now have practical two- 
year courses are South Bend, Ind.; Dubuque, Iowa; New Britain, 
Conn.; Freeport, Tll.; San Francisco, Cal.; Pittsburgh, Pa.; North 
Attleboro, Mass.; Chicago, Ill.; Kansas City, Kans. 
JUNIOR AND SENIOR HIGH SCHOOLS. 
In 1905 the department of secondary education of the National 
Education Association appointed a committee on six-year courses. 
Reports were received and adopted in 1907, 1908, and 1909. These 
reports indicated that the sentiment for the “six-and-six” division 
was growing. Since the adoption of the 1909 report there is every 
evidence of a rapidly growing tendency toward a shorter elementary 
course and a high-school course of six years divided into two parts 
of three years each, known as the junior and the senior high school. 
The object is to give a child the tools of an education in the first six 
years. It is argued that, since the seventh and eighth grades as now 
organized repeat to a great extent the work of the fifth and sixth, 
the pupil gets nowhere, and that he is thus cheated out of that degree 
of advancement to which he is entitled at the end of the eighth grade. 
It is also claimed that the ninth grade would do better work if it 
were organized in a separate department with the seventh and eighth 
grades, as the pupils of this grade are often hopelessly lost when 
thrown in with pupils three years their senior. 
Under the “six-and-six” plan a few of the present high-school 
subjects, such as the languages, algebra, and elementary science, are 
brought down into the seventh and eighth grades. It is pointed out 
that this arrangement will permit a pupil in the junior high school 
to prepare for any of the courses offered in the senior school, thus 
bridging the gap now existing between the eighth and the ninth
-P-A-G-E-180
154 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
grades. A pupil who in all probability will never go to college would 
be given subjects leading to some vocational course in the senior high 
school, while the pupil who intends to enter college would be given 
in the junior high school subjects preparing him for any one of the 
college preparatory courses in the senior school. A pupil would 
thus continue a subject long enough for it to be of some educational 
value. Algebra could be completed a year earlier, and the foundation 
for the study of physics and chemistry could be firmly laid. The 
claim is therefore made that the American boy would, under the 
“ six-and-six ” plan, gain a year or two over the present arrangement. 
In order to discover what the practice throughout the country 
really is in regard to the “six-and-six” plan of organization, the 
Commissioner of Education recently sent the following inquiry to 
200 city superintendents: 
LInyuiry from the Commissioner of Education.] 
1. Have you in your city a school which combines the seventh and eighth 
grades or the eighth grade alone with one or more years of high-school work? 
If so, please indicate which grades comprise the junior, or intermediate, school 
and which the senior school, or high school proper. 
By what name do you designate the junior school (as “intermediate” or 
“junior high” school) ? 
2. Is the “intermediate” or “junior high” school organized as a separate 
entity, with its own principal, etc.? 
Is this school placed in a separate building? 
If not organized as a separate entity, is this school a constituent part of the 
elementary schools or of the secondary schools? 
3. If the seventh and eighth grades are not combined with any year or years 
of the high school, is one or both organized similarly to high schools? 
Please indicate briefly the plan of organization. 
4. Have you organized the first year or the first and second years of the high 
school as a separate school? 
5. Please describe briefly any school in your system, other than those indi- 
cated above, which constitutes a near approach to the “ six-and-six” plan of 
school organization. 
Courses of study, special reports, or other literature descriptive of schools 
of the type indicated may be forwarded to the Bureau of Education with the 
inclosed penalty slips. : 
One hundred and fifty-seven papers were returned with answers to — 
all or part of these questions. Of these, 31 have adopted the “ six- 
and-six ” plan or some modification of it; 7 are seriously considering 
some such plan; and 45 others have departmental instruction in 
grammar-school work without making any claim to a “ six-and-six ” 
organization. 
The following table, based upon the first two questions, shows the 
plans of those who have reorganized their schools with the junior and 
senior high-school idea in view:

From the above it is seen that a large variety of combinations are 
under trial, including the 6-3-3 plan, the 6-2-4 plan, the 6-8-5 plan, 
the 6-2-3 plan, and the 7-8-2 plan. In all this experimentation it 
appears that there is a movement toward a six-year elementary course 
followed by a six-year high-school course; but it is not so evident 
how the six-year high school shall be organized—whether on a 2-4 
plan or a 3-3 plan. The tendency, however, is probably toward the 
3-3 plan. The Pennsylvania State Educational Association recently 
passed a resolution favoring the centralization of the seventh, eighth, 
and ninth grades. The sentiment in many of the Western States 
is growing rapidly for a six-year high school divided on the 3-3 plan. 
Just as there is no unanimity of agreement as to how the six-year 
high school shall be organized, so there is no unanimity as to what 
subjects shall be offered in the junior high school. The following 
courses are given to show what is offered in a junior high school of 
three years and in one of two years. Columbus, Ohio, is taken as a 
type of the three-year course and Oakland, Cal., as that of the two- 
year course.

    HIGH-SCHOOL FRATERNITIES, 
_ One of the many problems that have been vexing school adminis- 
trators for the past few years is that of the high-school fraternity.

The question has been whether high-school fraternities are to be 
ignored, controlled, or prohibited. The tendency has been, however, 
for State legislatures to enact laws and for school boards to make 
rules prohibiting the organization of secret societies in the public 
schools. The following States have enacted laws either expressly 
prohibiting such societies or giving school boards power to deal with 
them: California, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Washing- 
ton, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Ohio, Oregon, and 
Vermont. : 
One of the most recent acts is that of Michigan, May 1, 1911, which 
makes it unlawful for any pupil of the public schools to organize, 
join, or belong to a secret society composed of pupils of such schools; 
every teacher, principal, or superintendent having knowledge of such 
organization shall notify the president or secretary of the board of 
education; the board shall investigate charges, and on finding them 
true shall give notice to offending pupils to disband and withdraw 
within 15 days; penalty for failure to obey such notice, suspension 
until obedience is given; penalty for officer failing or refusing to 
perform duties imposed, fine of not less than $10 nor more than $25. 
A number of school boards in States that have no statutory pro- 
visions regulating or prohibiting high-school fraternities have made 
rules attempting to regulate or to prohibit. Among these cities are: 
Denver, Colo.; Meriden, Conn.; Chicago, Ill.; Covington, Ky.; New 
Orleans, La.; Lowell, Waltham, and Worcester, Mass.; Kansas City 
and St. Joseph, Mo.; Butte, Morit.; Oklahoma, Okla.; Reading, Pa.; 
Salt Lake City, Utah; Madison, Milwaukee, Racine, and Superior, 
Wis. 
The rules of the school boards of Reading, Pa., and Milwaukee, 
Wis., are given in abridged form to show two general types of 
regulations: 
Reading, Pa.—No member of a secret society shall be eligible to any office of 
a school organization, be a member of the staff of a school publication, represent 
the school in any athletic or intellectual contest, or be permitted to take less 
than four regular class studies each term. (Report, 1911.) 
Milwaukee, Wis.—No pupil of a public high school shall retain or acquire 
membership in any secret society; penalty for violation, suspension or expulsion. 
(Rules and Regulations, 1911.) 
So great has the problem become that appeal has been made to the 
courts in several ‘States. In every instance, however, the rulings of 
the board were sustained. In the case of Dresser v. The Board of 
Education of St. Croix Falls, Wis., the following decision, which is 
typical of decisions in other States, was rendered :* 
The school authorities may suspend a pupil for an offense committed outside 
school ‘hours; and not: in the presence of the teachers, which has a direct and

immediate tendency to influence the conduct of other pupils while in the school- 
room, to set at naught the proper discipline of the school, to impair the author- 
ity of the teachers and to bring them into ridicule and contempt. 
The National Pan-Hellenic Congress of College Fraternities has 
recently taken a firm stand against high-school fraternities, declar- 
ing that they are inimical to the interests of secondary schools. 
Many letters have been received by the Bureau of Education from 
school officials asking for copies of the latest State laws and board 
regulations relating to fraternities. Judging from these letters, the 
secret society in the high school still exists, with its real or imaginary 
faults. To what extent State laws and local school-board regulations 
have controlled or suppressed high-school fraternities it is difficult to 
say. At least one chapter of the Gamma Delta Psi fraternity—that 
at Hartford, Conn.—however, has succumbed to growing opposition. 
The Hartford Daily Courant reports the dissolution of the chapter as 
follows: 
At a meeting of ‘graduate and active members of the Theta Chapter, Gamma 
Delta Psi fraternity, of the Hartford High School, held recently, it was decided 
to dissolve the chapter, because of the extreme antagonism shown to secondary 
school fraternities and secret societies throughout the country. The following 
resolutions were adopted by vote of a large majority of the members present : 
Whereas it appears that the conditions at the Hartford Public High School are 
net favorable for the active continuance of Theta Chapter, both in view of 
service to the school and to the undergraduate members of the society ; and 
Whereas it is believed that the existence of the chapter should be terminated 
when the purposes of its establishment, through circumstances, can not be 
fulfilled, it is 
Resolved, That the committee duly appointed thereunto shall take proper steps 
for the dissolution of Theta Chapter; and in order that its peculiar activities 
in the interest of the school may be continued, it is further 
Resolwed, That the right to publish The Owl Annual be assigned to the high- 
school authorities and the method of publication to be decided by the principal 
ef the school; that the right to continue amateur theatricals under the title of 
“The Mask and Triangle Dramatic Club” be likewise and in the same manner 
assigned; and that the reserve account of the chapter, amounting to $300, be 
given to the Hartford Public High School Alumni Association and kept as a 
separate fund, to be known as “The Theta Chapter Gamma Delta Psi fund” 
(founded 1894, voluntarily dissolved 1913), from the income of which one or 
more prizes may be awarded to a senior, either boy or girl, who shall write the 
best paper on a subject relating to civic duty, the particular title and mode of 
competition to be determined each year by the principal of the school. 
An organization with headquarters at Muncie, Ind., and known 
as the Grand Inter-Fraternity Council, was effected February 27, 
1909, the object of which, according to the preamble to its constitu- 
tion, is to promote the usefulness of preparatory and high-school fra- 
ternities; to place before the public the objects of these organizations; 
and to create a body by which all grievances between fraternities and 
school or civil officials can be fairly terminated. 
There are affiliated with this council 316 active chapters, represent- 
ing 21 high-school fraternities. Membership in the organization is 
restricted to societies of 10 years’ standing and having at least three
-P-A-G-E-185
  
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1911-12. 159 
active chapters. From this it would seem that the high-school fra- 
_ternity itself is attempting to help relieve the tension. 
X. VACATION SCHOOLS. 
A few years ago superintendents, teachers, parents, and children 
would have been astonished at the mention of regular school work 
during the summer months. Vacation schools existed, but they were 
planned primarily to educate through play and to keep the children 
off the streets. Now nearly every large city and even many smaller 
cities have adopted the plan of conducting summer schools for those 
who have lost time and for those who are old and strong enough to 
gain a grade or a half grade. These courses usually cover a period 
of from six to eight weeks. 
The following are a few of the cities that have vacation schools 
either for making up work or for gaining a grade: Little Rock, Ark.; 
Pueblo, Colo.; Sioux City, Iowa; Chicago, Ill.; Kansas City, Mo. 
Ashtabula, Ohio; Pittsburgh, Pa.; St. Louis, Mo.; New York, N. Y. 
Richmond, Va.; Wheeling, W. Va.; Parkersburg, W. Va. 
Complete statistics showing the number enrolled in vacation schools 
have not been collected by the bureau, but judging from fragmentary 
data at hand it is evident that thousands were enrolled in 1912, and 
that the enrollment for that year was much in excess of that for 1911. 
To give an idea of the work that is done in vacation schools the 
following quotations are given from New York City (1912) Report: 
Four thousand four hundred and forty children not promoted in June en- 
deavored to make up deficiencies of the spring term by study in the continuation 
classes. Of this number, 3,180 were successful. This represents a saving of 
1,590 school years for these pupils. Three hundred and five children were 
“skipped” in June, 1912, on condition that they take up the work of the skipped 
grade in the continuation classes. Of this number, 262 completed the work suc- 
cessfully. Six hundred and fifty-six pupils were promoted on condition that 
they repeat the work of the spring term in the continuation classes. Of this 
number 511 were successful. In all, 5,082 children attempted to gain time in the 
elementary school by skipping a grade as a result of their work in the continua- 
tion classes. Of this number, 4,052 were successful. This means that we have 
saved these pupils 2,026 school years, provided they successfully maintain them- 
selves. The total saving for all pupils is 3,616 school years. 
The following is a general summary of the New York City vaca- 
tion schools: Number of schools, 33; teachers, 706; registration, 
33,988; cost, $77,048. 
Supt. J. M. Greenwood, of Kansas City, Mo., in his report for 1912, 
says of vacation schools in his own city: 
In view of the splendid success of this movement, I would recommend the 
opening of more schools next vacation for pupils in all grades to make up work 
which will enable them to advance to the next grade. Summer schools for the 
grade pupils should be provided for those who need strengthening in the com-

mon branches. If the State undertakes to educate its children, they should be 
educated, and not turned loose on the streets half a year.

It is claimed that studying during the summer months is no more 
fatiguing than studying during any other season. In fact, it is 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
  CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1911-12. 161 
claimed that there is less sickness that can be traced directly to the 
schoolroom, as the rooms are better ventilated—no artificial heat with 
closed windows, 
An outgrowth of the six-week vacation school is the all-year school, 
Newark, N. J., is an example of this type. To explain the plan the 
following extracts are taken from the annual report for 1912: 
The organization was easily accomplished by dividing each regular year, or 
grade, into three divisions, called C, B advanced, and A advanced. The course 
of study also was divided into three equal parts of 12 weeks each. The follow- 
ing diagram will illustrate how the two plans work side by side: 
The foregoing diagram is designed to show the coordination of the all-year 
plan with the regular plan, the correspondence of the various grades under 
both plans, the length of time taken by both plans to cover the elementary 
school course and also the comparative progress of pupils by the two plans. 
It will be seen that each year’s work under the regular plan is divided into 
two terms of 20 weeks each; while each year’s (or grade’s) work under the 
all-year plan is divided into three terms of 12 weeks each. Thus the C class 
in each grade will do the first two-thirds of the work of the corresponding B 
class of the same grade under the regular plan. The B advanced class in each 
grade will do the last one-third of the work of the corresponding B class and 
the first one-third of the work of the corresponding A class. The A advanced 
class will do the last two-thirds of the work of the corresponding A class. This 
division makes it comparatively easy to assign a pupil transferred from another 
school to the proper grade with little or no loss of time, or grade, to the pupil 
so transferred. 
The pupil attending four 12-week terms in any calendar year gains one-third 
of a grade’s work over pupils under the regular plan. This means a gain of 
two full grades in six years, enabling the pupil to complete the eight grades’ 
work in six years, instead of eight years according to the regular plan. Thus 
a pupil entering the first grade September 1, 1912, under the regular plan and 
making regular progress will be able to enter the high school September 1, 
1920; whereas a pupil entering the first grade at the same time and progressing 
regularly through the grade of the all-year plan will be ready to enter the high 
school September 1, 1918; that is, two years earlier. 
It is essential, in order that the regular plan and the all-year plan may be 
carried on side by side and without friction, that the dates for the beginning 
and ending of vacations should be, as nearly as practicable, the same. This 
is easily effected because of the fact that the eight added weeks of the year are 
all in July and August when the regular pupils are having their vacation. In- 
stead of the usual 10 week’s vacation in the summer, the all-year pupils get 
but two weeks. At all other times of the year pupils under both plans have 
vacations of the same length and at the same time.

Only one case of illness was attributed to the work of the school. 
The above figures do not include the number enrolled in the six- 
week vacation school. In these schools, 14,371 pupils were enrolled 
in 1912, making a total of 17,220. 
Statistics from other cities, such as Cleveland, Ohio, and St. Louis, 
Mo., would be equally interesting. It is evident that the trend is 
toward more serious work in the summer vacation school; not that 
there will be fewer schools of the playground type, but more of the 
academic type. 
XI. THE PHYSICAL WELFARE OF SCHOOL CHILDREN. 
The year 1911-12 was marked by no especially new developments 
in connection with the health of school children, but several items 
of progress which are of comparatively recent origin have held the 
interest of school men and a wholesome growth in the right direction 
has ensued. Some of these items are medical inspection, open-air 
schools, school lunches, sex instruction, and quiet zones around 
schoolhouses. 
MEDICAL INSPECTION. 
In 1911 the Russell Sage Foundation in its “ What American cities 
are doing for the health of school children,” reported that of 1,038 
cities reporting, 443 had medical inspection, and that this was an 
increase of 420 over the number providing such precaution against 
disease in 1902. Data for 1912 comparable with the statistics of the 
Russell Sage Foundation for the previous year are lacking, but 
numerous reports showing the beginning of medical inspection in 
cities came to the bureau of education during the year, and there is 
every reason to believe that the rate of growth shown by the figures 
for 1902 and 1911 was at least not diminished. In all probability 
medical inspection of school children will be found in every Ameri- 
can city within a very few years. 
OPEN-AIR SCHOOLS. 
The first open-air school in the United States was established in 
Sea Breeze Hospital, Coney Island, N. Y., in 1904. Four years later 
the principle of open-air instruction was applied to public school 
children in Providence, R. I. Children who had been excluded from 
the public schools on account of pulmonary tuberculosis were put 
into an open-air class. The results of the experiment at Providence 
were so successful that other cities soon established similar schools, 
until now there are more than 200 such schools in the United States. 
The real growth has been within the past two years. According to
-P-A-G-E-189
  CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1911-12. 163 
the National Association for the Study and Prevention of Tubercu- 
losis— 
there were in January, 1910, only 13 open-air schools in the United States and 
in 1911 there were only 29. Massachusetts now leads the States with 86 fresh- 
air schools and classes for tuberculous and anemic school children, Boston 
alone having over 80 fresh-air schools. New York comes next with 29, and 
Ohio third with 21. Open-air schools have now been established in nearly 50 
cities, in 19 different States. Based on figures of population and mortality 
furnished by the United States Census Bureau, it is estimated that not less 
than 100,000 children now in school in the United States will die of tuber- 
culosis before they are 18 years of age, or that about 7,000 of these children die 
annually from this one disease. Estimating that on an average each child has 
had six years of schooling, the aggregate loss to this country in wasted educa- 
tion each year amounts to well over $1,000,000. This loss and much of the 
incident suffering could be materially decreased if open-air schools or classes 
for these children and those who are sickly and anemic were provided. 
The association estimates that there should be one such school for 
every 25,000 population, especially in cities. 
The open-air school has demonstrated its ability to fale anemic 
and tuberculous children and convert them into strong, vigorous, 
apparently healthy children. It has also been demonstrated that 
strong, healthy children may be made stronger and healthier by the 
open-air school. 
There is no record of any city that has abandoned the work, but, 
on the other hand, cities that established open-air schools several 
years ago are increasing the number as rapidly as possible. Among 
these are Boston, Providence, Chicago, New York, and Pittsburgh. 
The school committee of Boston has passed a resolution providing 
that each new schoolhouse built in that city must have at least one 
open-air classroom. A number of classrooms in New York City have 
been remodeled, so that they may be used for open-air classes. 
The following quotation from the 1912 report of Oakland, Cal., 
discloses results practically similar to those of other open-air schools: 
We are just closing the second year of the “ open-air school.” At the opening 
two years ago, it was filled by picking from the main school such children as 
were for some cause poorly nourished and generally below par. They were 
such as would naturally lose in weight and vitality in the ordinary classroom. 
Eyery scholar in the main school, as well as the open-air room, was carefully 
weighed and recorded at the beginning of the year, and again at the Christmas 
vacation. The result was markedly in favor of the open-air room. Not one 
lost weight there, while several did on the inside. The average gain in the 
open-air room was 3.7 pounds, on the inside 2.36 pounds. The mental gain was 
equally good. All were promoted and several made more than one grade. 
Everyone visiting the room noted the bright, wide-awake condition of the 
pupils. They were as lively at 3 p. m. as at 10 a. m. Since the first term the 
personnel has been changed frequently. As they get strong, they are replaced 
_by weaker ones; so that it has been impossible to make accurate comparison. 
The gain in all has been steady and no catarrhal troubles have been experienced. 
The gain in weight and mental standing, the freedom from colds and infectious 
disease, the bright and cheerful faces, all call loudly for open-air schools.
-P-A-G-E-190
  164 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
The movement to establish open-air schools has not been confined 
entirely to larger cities. Hazleton, Pa., a city of 25,000 population, 
is maintaining a successful fresh-air school. The superintendent of 
Hazleton reports: 
Two years ago the school board established a fresh-air school for the benefit 
of anemics and children threatened with or suffering from tuberculosis. The 
antituberculosis committee of the United Charities provided Eskimo suits, 
und hot porridge, cocoa, or some similar food for the lunch hour. They also 
provided cots with blankets. The board provided a teacher and assistant, « 
janitor and three rooms—one for a schoolroom, one for a lunchroom, and one for 
a sleeping apartment. The board also provided for the transportation of 
children who live at too great a distance from the school or who were too frail 
to walk, even though the distance was not so great. 
The school opened with 21 pupils, who were admitted upon the recommenda- 
tion of a board of physicians. Since that time, the school has numbered as 
high as 42. Its present number is 23. Of those who have attended, about 80 
children returned to their regular schoolrooms, because of improved condition 
of health. Two or three have been sent to institutions for the care of con- 
sumptives. None, so far as I know, has died. The improvement in the health 
of the children has been remarkable. The schoolroom and the restroom haye 
the windows thrown open all the time. The windows of the lunchroom are 
closed during the lunch hour. 
‘The cost to the school district has been about $4 per month per pupil. The 
State dispensary furnishes milk delivered to the building for the children whose 
parents are too poor to provide it. All children buy a lunch, and those who can 
do so have milkmen deliver their milk at the school building. 
The program consists of regular school work, beginning at 9 a. m.; hot milk 
at the middle of the forenoon, lunch at noon, with hot porridge, cocoa, or some 
other nourishing food, furnished by the antituberculosis committee; an hour 
and a half sleep upon the cots; and two hours of school instruction. 
A result fully as desirable as the improvement of the children of the fresh- 
air school is that of the effect that the instruction of the fresh-air school has 
had upon all of the city schools, namely, a far greater interest in the matter of 
fresh air and lower temperature in the ordinary schoolrooms. Teachers and 
pupils seek to keep the air of the room purer and the temperature lower. 
Grand Rapids, Mich., has an open-air school for sickly children 
who are entirely free from tuberculosis. A certificate of a physician 
to this effect must be furnished. These children are fed three times 
a day: At 9 o’clock in the morning, at 12 o’clock, and at 3.30. The 
menus are made and the food prepared by the teacher of domestic 
science. The superintendent reports that these children have im- 
proved in health and strength and in ability to learn since they were 
placed in the open-air school. 
A summary of the results attained by open-air schools is as fol- 
lows: + 
The results are uniformly good. Few of the children fail to show a gain in 
weight, color, appetite, attendance, deportment, and scholarship. Of reports re- 
ceived for over 875 children in these schools, only 70 showed a loss in weight.

-P-A-G-E-191
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1911-12. 165 
Most of the 70 showing loss in weight were the open advanced cases who were 
admitted too late to expect success. 
In about 90 per cent of the children the rate of gain was greater than for the 
normal child, so that at the end of the year children who were on admission 10 
to 15 per cent below the normal weight, in proportion to height, showed not 
only the normal gain in proportion to increase in height, but gained so that they 
were only 6 to 9 per cent below the normal. 
Where control tésts were made, the open-air children showed a greater gain 
than the normal children in the rooms of the public schools. 
During vacations some loss was almost invariably shown, but where records 
were carefully kept they never showed a loss of all the gain. Tables of weekly 
weights show slight losses at the beginning of the summer before the vacation. 
This same loss is shown in the controls of healthy children of the public schools. 
Marked improvement was shown in the color of nearly all the children where 
records were kept of hemoglobin tests. In a large percentage of cases it 
reached normal, whereas that of the healthy children used as controls on the 
test showed a decline through the spring months, falling below normal. 
The attendance is greatly improved. During the coldest days in St. Louis, 
when the thermometer was below zero, 22 of the 25 children were present. ‘The 
percentage of absentees is much less than in the public schools. 
The progress in their grades is remarkable, even though they work little 
more than half the time. As compared with the children of the public school, 
they not only keep up in the grades, but many (nearly 50 per cent) go ahead. 
The St. Louis open-air class completed in 8 months’ time the usual amount 
of work done in the public schools and 20 per cent more. In other words, they 
did in 8 months the work that the normal child in the indoor public school 
would do in 93 months. One class in New York City, which was 19 per cent 
below grade on admission in October, was only 9 per cent below the following 
June, making the normal progress plus 10 per cent more than the child of the 
public schools. They never seem to fag and are as ready to do arithmetic in 
the afternoon as in the morning and are as fresh and alert when dismissed as on 
arrival. 
In considering these results, it is impossible with the present data to say to 
which of the features these results are due. 
The constant factors present in all the schools are fresh air, proper clothing, 
and proper diet. The other features—rest, recreation, and bathing—are not com- 
mon to all. The good results are obtained with the first, but results are some- 
what better when the latter are added as part of the routine. Another feature 
which should not be lost sight of in considering the results in scholarship is 
the teacher. Usually an exceptional teacher is selected, and she has more 
time with 25 children to make the teaching more individual. The results are 
so satisfactory in every case that the open-air school can no longer be classed 
as an experiment, but may now be relied upon as one of the most practical 
remedies for the mentally and physically subnormal child, and certainly one of 
the cheapest. 
SCHOOL LUNCHES. 
The school luncheon, though of comparatively recent origin in the 
American city, has gained vogue rapidly in recent years. The early 
hour at which some children get their morning meals, the scarcity 
of breakfast in the case of some, the unwholesomeness of confections 
and other edibles sold to them by venders, and the late hour at
-P-A-G-E-192
166 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
which many must get their noon meals at home, all argue forcefully 
for the school lunch and under proper supervision by school authorities. 
As outlining the development and present status of the luncheon 
propaganda in this country the following is quoted from Mrs. 
Louise Stevens Bryant, of the psychological clinic, University of 
Pennsylvania: * 
> 
As in the case of many other educational adjuncts, the United States has 
been slow in following the lead of the European countries in adopting school 
feeding. Long after it had passed the experimental stage in Europe it was 
still regarded as a startling innovation here. Purely charitable work was 
undertaken as early as 1855, when the Children’s Aid Society in New York 
City began to furnish free lunches for the children of the industrial schools. 
Almost from the beginning of his superintendency of the New York schools 
Dr. William H. Maxwell has urged the installation of lunches in the elementary 
schools, where all who. wish may buy at cost a warm, nourishing noon meal. 
Since 1908 lunches in the elementary schools have been conducted by the co- 
eperative efforts of the educational authorities and a committee of social work- 
ers, physicians, and teachers. The Starr Center Association started penny 
lunches in two Philadelphia schools over 15 years ago; a work that with the 
cooperation of other societies has continued and grown until at present there 
are more than 10 schools with some form of school lunch, After two years of 
agitation and investigation, the board of education in Chicago in the fall of 
1910 appropriated $1,200 for the experiment of installing lunch rooms in six 
city schools. It is too early to speak of results. Recent reports show that 
the meals are a success so far as they may be measured by the attendance and 
the children’s interest. In 27 other cities in 14 different States women’s clubs, 
teachers, and school physicians have organized to introduce lunches in the 
elementary schools, and in at least 20 other places the matter is under con- 
sideration. Though there have been no legislative enactments providing for 
school lunches in American cities, at least one important step in this direction 
has been taken in Massachusetts. This takes the shape of a bill favorably re- 
ported by the committee on education of the lower house in the session of 1912 
and provides that school boards shall be empowered to expend school funds 
for the support of lunches in elementary school systems. 
SEX INSTRUCTION. 
It is now generally admitted that there has been a certain timor- 
ousness or false modesty connected with the impartation of knowl- 
edge of the biological facts of the human organism and especially 
cf sex relations, and some efforts have been made to meet the need 
for proper instruction. But there is yet no agreement of opinion as 
to either how this information shall be given to the child or who 
shall be the instructor. The most favored method of instruction 
would seem to be by comparative biology, but this has its limitations 
and lurking dangers. Some favor straight “frank talks” to boys 
and girls when the proper age is reached, preferably in groups and

  CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1911-12. 167 
necessarily with the sexes separated. The use of textbooks on the 
subject is generally disapproved, but perfect frankness is proclaimed 
as preferable to clouded mystery. All would be careful, of course, 
as to the time of beginning the subject. 
The consensus of opinion is that the instructor in this regard 
should be the parent, but as a matter of fact parents do not now 
give such instrittion as it should be given, and, moreover, most of 
them are probably incapable of giving it properly. The position 
of the clergyman has a point of vantage and no doubt his approach 
to the subject would possess the necessary sympathetic and moral 
elements, but he can not reach all children, and the multiplicity of 
denominations in America would militate against effective concerted 
effort. Looking to the field of medicine we find a promising agency, 
and very likely the physician will play a prominent part in sex 
instruction when a definite program is finally evolved, but his method 
will probably be too pathological and will be wanting in sympathy 
and moral direction.» The teacher is the next possible instructor, but 
the cry is that she is already “ overburdened,” and all agree that she 
would have to be “ very wise” in her approach to this delicate sub- 
ject. Moreover, as the vast majority of teachers are women and 
many elementary schools have women principals, the question arises 
as to who would teach the boys. 
Despite the. difficulties which have been indicated, sex instruction 
has found its way into the public schools of some cities, but no claim 
is made that it has passed beyond the experimental stage. When 
found, it is usually given quietly by some sympathetic teacher or 
through formal lectures. Detroit, Mich.; Elmira, N. Y.; Washing- 
ton, D. C., and some other cities have begun with the lecture method. 
Former Supt. Don C. Bliss, of Elmira, N. Y., writes thus of the lec- 
tures given under his supervision :* 
A plan carried out in Elmira this year has so far proved fairly successful. A 
personal note was sent through the mail to the parents of every seventh and 
eighth grade child explaining the need for instruction of this kind and asking 
them to meet at the school on a certain date to discuss ways and means of giving 
the children of the two grades indicated instruction in sex hygiene. At the same 
time they were told that no children would be admitted to-the class unless per- 
mission was first given by the parents, At the meeting about half of the invited 
parents were present. Two physicians, one a woman, the other a man, presented 
the question frankly from a medical standpoint. This was followed by a gen- 
eral discussion. Everyone present agreed that it was absolutely essential that 
sex instruction should be given the children, and nearly everyone felt that it 
eould best be given in the schools by regular physicians. Accordingly, arrange- 
ments were made for a woman physician to give a series of plain talks to the 
girls, and for a man to give a similar series to the boys. The lectures given by 
both were frank. An attempt was made to give accurate information along 
all lines where inaccurate knowledge would probably be acquired from other

sources. Thus far no injurious effects have been noticed. The lecturers say 
that the mental attitude of the children was all that could be asked. Parents 
were not allowed to be present, but those parents who have talked with the 
children since the lectures feel that much good was accomplished. We are now 
waiting to see what the after effects will be. If we have satisfied the natural 
curiosity of the children and prevented them from seeking information from 
undesirable sources; if we have made them recognize that in their attitude to- 
ward the facts of life is one of the fundamental princifles underlying the 
Nation’s highest moral and spiritual growth; if they have been inspired to keep 
mind and body clean, then we shall be encouraged to continue the experiment. 
Should the reverse prove true, the solution of this vital question must be sought 
along other lines. 
The primary object of sex instruction is not to gratify the curiosity 
of the child or to overcome self-consciousness, though these objects 
may well be kept in mind, but it is rather to inculcate correct ideas 
of sex morality and to promote eugenics. It is probable that in dis- 
cussion of the subject too much emphasis has been placed on sew and 
that a better line of approach would be through the broader principles 
of biology and the qualities necessary for the improvement of the race. 
Some entirely new term analogous to “home economics” or “ nature 
study ” would seem to be preferable to such terms as “sex instruc- 
tion” and “sex hygiene.” How to live in one’s relations with the 
opposite sex and how properly to perform one’s function in securing 
the highest development of the race are the lessons really needed, and 
if education can be made to improve present conditions at this point, 
its forces should be enlisted to serve the purposes Certain it is that 
the present system, under which the average child gets its first lesson 
in sex relations from the lips of some companion more precocious in 
the knowledge of evil, should be superseded by a more rational 
method. Regarding this subject Supt. William H. Maxwell, of New 
York City, says:1 
The suffering caused by the twin endemic diseases, gonorrheea and syphilis, 
has given rise to an increasing demand that “sex hygiene” be taught in the 
schools, and in many parts of the United States it has been attempted in various 
forms, often with good and often with bad results. The most favorable results 
have been obtained in schools where sex hygiene has been differentiated into its 
several discrete aspects and adapted to pupils of different ages accordingly. 
These are: 
(1) The Facts of Reproduction: These have be@n successfully taught in corre- 
lation with nature study in the elementary schools, high schools, and colleges, 
though the application to human affairs is seldom made by the pupil or teacher. 
(2) Hygiene of Sexual Organs: The simple facts of the care of the sex organs 
have been taught successfully in connection with personal hygiene. 
(8) Sex Sanitation: The etiology and nature of sex diseases have been taught 
in connection with courses in hygiene and biology with varied success. 
(4) Social Hygiene: The duty of the individual with reference to sex mat- 
ters has been taught from the ethical standpoint, usually in connection with any

or all of the above topics, and it has often met with failure. It is the general 
opinion of school men that this is a doubtful school duty. 
The most successful instruction in this line has been in individual consulta- 
tion by the school or college physician and in lectures to parents. The latter 
is the only form of procedure that I am prepared at this time to recommend. 
“ QUIET ZONES ” AROUND SCHOOLS. 
. 
Several years ago, through the efforts of the Society for the Sup- 
pression of Unnecessary Noise, the board of aldermen of New York 
City established quiet districts in the vicinity of hospitals, and in 
more recent years the same society has brought to the attention of 
educational and health authorities throughout the country the need 
of similar “zones” for schoolhouses. Ready response and indorse- 
ment of the proposal were received from 25 State boards and from 
the educational heads of 70 cities within a few weeks. 
There can be no question that in large cities, where street traffic is 
heavy and often congested, and where neighboring enterprises such 
as blacksmith shops and garages abound, the teacher in the class- 
room is at a disadvantage in the competition with outside sounds. 
The necessity of having to raise the voice is not only trying to the 
teacher, but nerve-racking to the pupil. Furthermore, it is often 
necessary to keep windows closed in order to shut out the din from 
children’s play, the shouts of hucksters and drivers, and the rumble 
of drays and street cars. Thus the ventilation of schoolrooms is 
frequently diminished and the suppression of unnecessary noises 
around the building becomes a question of health. Add to this the 
general impairment of the school’s efficiency because of the numerous 
noises around the building and the necessity for quiet zones becomes 
apparent. In this connection Supt. Martin G. Brumbaugh, of Phila- 
delphia, said in his annual report for 1911:* 
In the first place, it is almost impossible to ventilate these schoolrooms prop- 
erly, for the reason that the moment the window is raised the disturbance from 
these external noises is intensified manyfold. In the second place, these noises 
constitute a continual menace to the proper conditions for instruction in the 
school and produce a state of nervous tension, both in the teacher and in the 
pupil, which is directly opposed to proper conditions of instruction. Many of 
our teachers suffer, by reason of their sensitive nervous organization, from thése 
disturbing noises. Many of the pupils also suffer acutely; and the teachers and 
pupils alike are obliged to speak in a voice that is high and harsh and altogether 
undesirable. Moreover, it not infrequently happens that venders of merchandise 
of one sort or another cry their S under the very windows of the school, 
where, of course, they have no prospect whatever of effecting a sale. Their 
effort is futile to them, but exceedingly disturbing to the school; and also, in 
some cases, factories, foundries, and other mercantile establishments where 
heavy materials are handled, are located so near to the school that they produce 
a constant disturbance and interruption of proper class conditions. For these

reasons I would urge upon the- board and, through the board, upon city councils, 
the importance of taking proper steps by law to establish about the public 
schools of this city zones of silence. 
XU. MISCELLANEOUS ACTIVITIES. 
SCHOOL SOCIAL CENTERS. 
Since the social and recreation centers in Rochester, N. Y., first at- 
tracted wide attention in 1907, the tendency toward the “ wider use 
of the school plant ” has continued with unabated vigor. In all parts 
of the country are now to be found cities in which schoolhouses are 
used for purposes other than the instruction of children during school 
hours. Branch libraries, literary societies, social and civic clubs, 
organizations for the study of music and art, concerts and dramatics, 
gymnasiums, and recreation rooms, and at some places even political 
meetings are to be seen within the walls of the schoolhouse. All this 
exemplifies the tendency to make education more of a social force. 
The Bureau of Education has collected no statistics showing to 
what extent school buildings in cities are used for social and recrea- 
tion purposes, but fortunately such information is at hand in a 
monograph by Clarence Arthur Perry, of the Russell Sage Founda- 
tion. In 1912 Mr. Perry sent to 774 superintendents of city schools 
an inquiry regarding the extended use of their buildings and received 
337 replies. He summarizes as follows the information obtained: 
MAIN FACTS, 
Forty-four cities reported centers at which there were paid workers. (Two 
years ago we could find only 15 cities in this class.) 
In 19 of these at least some of the workers are paid by the board of educa- 
tion. 
Fifty-seven other cities reported schoolhouses which were locally known as 
social or recreation centers, though they were conducted entirely by volunteer 
workers. 
In 84 of the 101 cities reporting centers the heat and light are furnished by 
the school board. 
In 72 the heat, light, and janitor service are provided by the board. 
In 15 the board bears the total expense. 
Total amount of money reported as expended, both by school boards and 
voluntary agencies in the maintenance of school centers, $189,535.73. 
Total number of schools used as centers in the 101 cities, 338. 
Number of cities reporting branch libraries in public schools, 100. 
SCHOOL GARDENS. 
School gardening has become an integral part, of some school sys- 
tems. Not many school officials, however, have been willing to pro- 
vide instruction in garden work, most of the training having been 
left to principals and teachers who volunteer their services.

Tt is claimed by some that if all the unused land now within the 
limits of the average city were put under intensive cultivation 
enough vegetables could be produced to support the sity during the 
summer months. However this may be, it is believed that city chil- 
dren should be given an opportunity to get their hands and feet on 
and in cultivated soil. The chief reasons given for school gardening 
are: : 
Boys are made better boys; girls become more womanly and carry away a 
world of such experience for use in a future household; children become posi- 
tively stronger and healthier; their idle time is profitably occupied; they 
become interested; they learn much of the greatest of all industries—agri- 
culture; they grow to love the beautiful; they learn to do things with their 
hands; the dignity of labor is inculcated; they acquire tastes opposed to con- 
gested living; they become more sensitive to one another’s rights, 
So important is the work considered that supervisors are employed 
in some cities. In Memphis, Tenn., a supervisor of gardening is 
giving all his time to the subject, which has been made a part of the 
school course. Boys of grades 5 to 8, inclusive, are under the super- 
visor from 9 to 10.30 a. m., from 10.30 to 12, or from 1 to 3 p. m., 
once a week. A part of the garden work of the children is to keep 
records of the expenses incurred and the amount of vegetables pro- 
duced from the garden. It is,planned by the Memphis school board 
to procure the use of a school farm of 20 or more acres near a car line 
where the larger boys who are not otherwise employed during the 
summer months may, under intelligent supervision, make truck gar- 
dening profitable and educative. According to the report of Supt. 
L. E. Wolfe the results as shown in Memphis are: (1) Children 
have been interested in plant, life; (2) waste places have been made 
useful and beautiful; (3) children have been provided with some 
spending money without working in a factory; (4) fresh vegetables 
have been furnished for the home; (5) homes have been made more 
beautiful and attractive. 
In Los Angeles, Cal., over 60 school gardens are in operation. The 
largest is at Gardena Agricultural High School, where there are 
nearly 10 acres under cultivation in grains, vegetables, flowers, and 
fruits. These gardens range in size from a small bed or two to lots 
40 or 50 by 200 feet. The latter have usually been loaned by citizens 
who are glad to have the children clear them and improve them with 
sightly flower and vegetable plots. There is a supervisor of garden- 
ing, with five assistants. 
Cleveland, Ohio,? is a notable example of what school gardening can 
accomplish. Garden work in Cleveland was at first conducted jointly 
by the home gardening association and the board of education. In 
  
11912 Report of School Garden Association. 
2 Bulletin 252, U. S. Department of Agriculture,

  172 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
1905 the board assumed control of the work. In the same year a 
department of school gardens was created, with a curator at its head, 
the first position of its kind in the country. ‘ 
At present the children’s part in the school garden is voluntary and not a part 
ef the regular curriculum, though it permeates the entire educational system. 
The garden labels, markers, and stakes are made in the manual training schools; 
the domestic science classes cook or can the vegetables they have raised; flowers 
and vegetables are used for drawing and painting; cotton, hemp, flax, and broom 
corn are raised to illustrate geography lessons; and nature study and language 
lessons have been vitalized by the garden. 
The activities of the school garden work of the Cleveland public schools as 
now organized include the following features: Gardens for the children in the 
graded schools, for defective children, baekward children, and delinquents; 
a botanic garden, an economic and kitchen garden, a nursery of trees and shrubs, 
propagating centers, the improvement of school grounds, and illustrated lectures, 
Sixty illustrated lectures were given in the schools last winter to illustrate the 
principles of soil propagation, cultivation, seed planting, crop rotation, and 
harmonious color schemes in gardens. 
Minneapolis' had, in 1911-12, 10 school gardens, covering 12 acres 
of land; 4 of them on school property, 3.in parks, and the remainder 
on private land. The gardens were under the direction of the depart- 
ment of hygiene and physical training. The board of education paid 
one-half of the chief supervisor’s salary and one-fourth ef the four 
assistants’ salaries. The children worked three hours a week during 
school time. This was divided into two periods and the work was 
voluntary. 
In Philadelphia there are nine garden centers where the theory 
and practice of gardening were taught during 1912. There were 877 
plots under cultivation. The spirit of gardening has been caught by 
the children and their parents, with the result that more than 8,000 
home gardens were planted under the supervision of the teachers. 
In Buffalo, N. Y., three phases of school gardening have been in 
operation for a long time—gardening done by teachers of certain 
schools on the school lot; winter gardening in the schools and in the 
homes of pupils; and school gardening conducted by outsiders. 
SCHOOL SAVINGS BANKS. 
The first savings bank inaugurated in a public school of the United 
States was started in 1885 by Mr. John H. Thiry, at School No. 4, in 
Long Island City, N. Y. The primary object of such banks is to 
inculcate habits of thrift, the saving of money by pupils being in 
itself incidental. After organizing the institution in Long Island 
City, Mr. Thiry, with true philanthropic spirit, devoted much of his 
time until his death in 1911 to promoting the establishment of similar 
banks throughout the country. Seeing the educational and economic

advantages of the system, many educators and bankers took a lively 
interest in it and helped in its spread to other sections. The Woman’s 
Christian Temperance Union and some other benevolent organiza- 
tions have also exerted a wholesome influence in this direction. 
Mr. Thiry bequeathed his books, papers, and other material regard- 
ing school savings banks to Mrs. Sara Louisa Oberholtzer, of Phila- 
delphia, Pa., and since his death she has continued his work in fur- 
therance of the propaganda. The following summary, made from a 
tabular report of Mrs. Oberholtzer, will show the extent of the school- 
savings movement on January 1, 1912. This summary, however, does 
not contain statistics from 13 cities and towns which, according to her 
report, have systems of school savings but give no figures. If Okla- 
homa and West Virginia, from which no statistics were available, be 
included, it will be seen that public schools in 25 States now have 
scliool savings banks.

PLAYGROUNDS. 
As showing the recent progress and present status of the play 
movement in this country, quotation may be made from the official 
organ of the Playground and Recreation Association of America.t 
‘The data given are for November 1, 1912. When it is remembered 
that in 1900 only five cities had public playgrounds with expert 
  
1The Playground, 6:408, February, 1913.
-P-A-G-E-200
174 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
supervision, the significance of these facts becomes more striking. 
The quotation follows: 
Reports have been received from 285 cities maintaining regularly supervised 
playgrounds and recreation centers. These 285 cities during the year ending 
November 1, 1912, maintained 2,094 playgrounds and recreation centers, and 
employed 5,320 workers, of whom 2,195 were men and 3,075 women. In the 
‘cases of 50 workers the report failed to indicate whether the persons employed 
were men or women. Sixty-three cities employed 655 workers the year round. 
These figures indicate an increase over last year of about 22 per cent in the 
number of playground workers. In addition to the recreation workers, 1,353 
caretakers were employed. A total expenditure of $4,020,121.79 was reported. 
Of the 285 cities, 245 reported a total average daily attendance of 433,660 dur- 
ing July and August. Forty-five cities reported an average daily attendance of 
33,639 during January and February. 
In 33 cities, playgrounds and recreation centers were maintained by play- 
ground or recreation commissions, in 51 by playground associations, in 11 by 
playground associations in combination with other organizations, in 35 by 
school boards, in 33 by park boards, in 9 by park and school boards in com- 
bination, in 5 by park commissions and playground commissions, in 11 by park 
boards in combination with other organizations. In 12 cases they were carried 
on by special departments of the city government, in 10 by individuals, in 19 
by clubs, in 18 by playground committees, in 50 by other agencies or by several 
agencies combined. 
In 99 cities the centers were supported by municipal funds, in 90 cities by 
private funds, in 94 cities by both municipal and private funds. In 2 cities 
the sources of support were not given. 
In 71 cities 299 centers were open throughout the year. One hundred and 
eighty cities reported that 1,142 centers were open only during July and August. 
In 88 cities 543 centers were open for periods ranging from 8 weeks to 10 
months; of these, 143 centers were open for 8 months, 33 for 4 months, 59 for 
5 months, 87 for 6 months, 154 for 7 months, 19 for 8 months, 88 for 9 months, 
29 for 10 months. Thirty-one were open for periods of less than 83 months, In 
153 cities centers were open on holidays and in 71 on Sundays. 
The returns for this year show 129 cities having playground associations, 47. 
having playground or recreation commissions, and 7 having both. 
One hundred and three cities reported 442 centers open evenings. The total 
average daily attendance for the 66 cities which made a report on attendance 
was 47,204. 
It was reported that 47 out of the 285 cities maintained training classes for 
playground workers. ‘This number includes the cities holding weekly confer- 
ences for their workers during the playground season. Four cities reported 
that training classes are in process of organization. In 19 of the 47 cities the 
returns show 1,180 student workers. 
Seventy-one cities stated that their schoolhouses were used as recreation cen- 
ters. Sixty-six of these cities reported 276 such centers, 10 of which were 
spoken of as civic centers. Three reported that their centers were used for 
lectures and evening schools and class work only. In addition to these, 43 
cities, which do not appear in the table, reported that their schoolhouses were 
used as recreation centers. Forty cities reported 81 such centers. 
In 10 cities streets were set aside for play; 61 cities reported that coasting in 
the streets was permitted.

CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1911+12. 175 
In 172 cities organized efforts to promote public athletics were made through 
the public-school athletic leagues, Young Men's Christian Associations, inter- 
school meets, and other school athletics. One hundred and four cities reported 
public-school athletic leagues. 
The number of cities reporting special recreation center activities are as 
follows: Boy Scouts, 56; Camp Fire Girls, 21; debating, 15; dramatics, 37; 
evening entertainments, 53; folk dancing, 182; gardening, 67; industrial work, 
112; instrumental music, 38; lectures, 36; libraries, 56; moving pictures, 35; 
pageants, 44; self-government, 52; singing, 84; social dancing, 42; story telling, 
143; summer camps, 27; swimming, 83; tramping, 74; wading, 75. 
In 85 cities 385 centers had separate spaces for boys and girls. 
In 41 cities land has been donated for playground purposes. The combined 
yalue of this property in 14 of these cities was estimated at $457,459. 
In 19 cities bond issues for recreation purposes were authorized during the 
year to the amount of $2,524,775. In addition to these, 6 cities, which do not 
appear in the table because their centers were not regularly supervised, report 
bond issues amounting to $1,260,629. 
Forty-three cities stated that supervised playgrounds were opened for the 
first time during the year ending November 1, 1912. 
Forty-nine cities reported centers carried on under no supervision other than 
caretakers. Nine reported centers under volunteer supervision. In these centers 
and in the school grounds—many of which were reported under the supervision 
ef regular. school-teachers during the day—many special playground activities 
were carried on. Forty-two reported Boy Scout activities; 62, efforts to promote 
organized activities; and 81, public-school athletic leagues.

THE INTEREST IN RURAL SCHOOL AFFAIRS BEARING RESULTS. 
The increased interest in rural school affairs evident during the 
past few years is now bearing results in activity for the improvement 
of rural educational conditions. Still greater activity may be ex- 
pected in the next few years, and much will undoubtedly be done 
to make the opportunities for education in rural districts more 
nearly equal to those in urban communities. The movement for im- 
proved rural schools has come from an increased and more definite 
knowledge of the actual rural-school situation. Comprehensive 
studies have been made in several States and information regard- 
ing the results of the studies has been distributed widely. These 
have been made by special commissions or by special officers of 
State departments of education appointed to devote their en-

tire time to rural schools. As a result the rural schools have been 
thoroughly examined, and more accurate knowledge of them and 
their efficiency exists than ever before. 
It is not yet generally appreciated that the status of rural education 
is a matter of concern to all people, regardless of whether they are 
urban or rural. If people remained in the community or county or 
State in which they were educated, the problem would be local. The 
fact is that they do not remain there; probably at no time in the 
history of the country has there been a greater movement than during 
the past 10 years from one community to another, from the country 
to the city, and from State to State. It is not possible to calculate 
the exact extent of the movement from one community to another 
within the States. The movement from State to State, however, may 
be closely estimated from figures published by the United States 
Bureau of the Census, which show that in 1910 only 66.5 per cent of 
the total population were then living in the State in which they were 
born; 18.8 per cent were born in other States, and 14.7 per cent in 
foreign countries. As would be expected, the number living in the 
State of birth was lower in the Western Division than in other parts 
of the country; but if the 11 States in the Rocky Mountains and on 
the Pacific coast be omitted, the number for the remaining 37 States 
living in the State of birth is but 69 per cent of the total population. 
A rough estimate of the movement from the country to the city 
may be made from the census figures for 1910 by comparing the 
urban and rural increase. The rate of urban increase for the entire 
country in the 10 years ended in 1910 was more than three times the 
rate of rural increase, the figures being 34.8 per cent and 11.3 per 
cent, respectively. The urban increase exceeded the rural increase 
by 6,049,785. Part of this urban excess was undoubtedly due to immi- 
gration from foreign countries, but the total number of foreign-born 
persons in the entire United States in 1910 was greater than the 
number in 1900 by only 3,174,610, and according to the census report 
but 77.6 per cent of the arrivals since January 1, 1901, were residing 
jn 1910 in urban communities. No part of the greater urban rate of 
increase can be accounted for by the natural increase; the number of   
1It would seem to be a very easy matter to continue the calculation, based on the 
figures presented, thus: Increase in number of immigrants living in cities, 2,463,057; 
in the country, 811,553; difference, 1,651,504. Excess of total urban increase over rural 
increase, 6,049,785, of which 1,651,504 may be ascribed to immigration; therefore 
4,398,281 persons must have moved from the country to the city. 
Little reflection is required to show that such a conclusion would be fallacious. 
Much of the urban increase comes from the extension of the corporate lines of cities. 
Still more of it comes from the transfer of places from the rural to the urban classifi- 
cation, because a slight increase in population has carried them above an arbitrary 
statistical line. No “movement” of population is implied in the first factor and not 
much in the second. 
The author writes advisedly of “a rough estimate.” It is evident that he does not 
intend the figures to be used for a precise calculation in this connection.—Epiror.

RURAL EDUCATION, 179 
rural children is greater than the number of urban children, both in 
actual number and in proportion to the total population. The aver- 
age rural family, according to the census report for 1910, contained 
4.6 persons; the average urban family 4.5 persons. The larger part 
of the urban increase has come, therefore, from the migration from 
the country to the city. The city is therefore vitally concerned in 
the amount and quality of the education given to children in the 
rural sections from which it draws its population, and should assist 
through a State educational fund in the support of good rural schools 
where the cost of maintaining such schools proves too heavy a burden 
for the local communities. Every State is concerned not only with 
what every community within itself is doing to educate its people, 
but also with what every other State is doing. Education is no 
longer a matter of local concern only; it is a matter of State and of 
National concern. 2 
The urban school situation in the United States is fairly satis- 
factory. The city school systems are well organized, the schools are 
on the whole well managed, adequately supervised, taught by persons 
with good general education and with professional training, and are 
housed in buildings which are moderately suitable, sanitary, and well 
equipped with facilities for teaching. All these essentials are lack- 
ing in the rural schools, except in a few States and in a comparatively 
few counties in others. It may be said that in probably two-thirds 
of the States the rural schools are unintelligently and uneconomically 
managed, are not supervised in any effective or efficient way, are 
taught by untrained teachers, and are housed in buildings which are 
largely unsuitable and are often insanitary. Of course, it goes with- 
out saying that there are exceptions to the above statements; never- 
theless they are generally true. A recent study has been made by the 
Bureau of Education of the rural school situation. A preliminary 
report has been published in a bulletin entitled “The Status of Rural 
Education.” It is not necessary, therefore, to repeat here what is 
presented in the bulletin, except perhaps a few figures which will 
- indicate some of the features of the rural school problem. The total 
population and illiteracy figures are from the Census Report for 1910. 
The other figures were compiled in the Bureau of Education. It is 
worthy of note that while 53.7 per cent of the total population is 
classed as rural 58.5 per cent of the children of school age (6 to 20, 
inclusive) are rural. This means that the 53.7 per cent of the total 
population who are living in rural territory have 58.5 per cent of 
the children to educate, while the 46.3 per cent classed as urban have 
only 41.3 per cent of the children to educate. It is noteworthy also 
that the rural illiteracy 10 years of age and over is twice the urban 
illiteracy, and this in spite of the great numbers of illiterate foreign- 
born persons included in the urban population. This larger rate of  
-P-A-G-E-206
  180 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
rural illiteracy is due largely to the lack of adequate and efficient 
rural schools. The real test of the service of a school is the amoufit 
of illiteracy it leaves about it. The definition of urban and rural in 
the bulletin mentioned above and in the table following is that of 
the Bureau of the Census. An incorporated city, town, or village of 
2,500 population or over is classed as urban; all places of less than 
2,500, rural. For New England the township with 2,500 persons or 
over is considered as urban, townships with less than that number 
as rural.

The following pages are devoted largely to an account of recent 
progress in rural education. They include also a brief statement of 
the recent legislation intended primarily to affect rural schools. 
A report is also included of some of the most important agencies 
now actively engaged in the work of the improvement of rural 
schools, together with an account of their principal activities. They 
mention briefly books on rural education that have appeared during 
the past year, and some of the more important bulletins from the 
Federal Bureau of Education, from State education departments, 
and educational institutions. 
DIVISION OF RURAL EDUCATION IN THE BUREAU OF EDUCATION. 
In the United States Bureau of Education a division of rural 
education was created November 1, 1911. This was made possible 
by a provision included in the legislative, executive, and judicial 
appropriation bill for the year ended June 30, 1912, approved on 
March 4, 1911. This congressional. act provided the sum of $6,000 
to be expended “ for the investigation of rural education, industrial 
education, and school hygiene, including salaries.” 
During the one year of its existence the work of the division has 
been largely a study of the status of rural education in the United 
States, the results of which are included in Bureau of Education 
Bulletin, 1918, No. 8. This publication contains data relative to the 
rural population, illiteracy, school enrollment, attendance, and the 
one-teacher school; also a summary of the present status of the rural 
school teaching force, the supervision and the organizations for the 
management of school affairs, The information for the bulletin was 
 
-P-A-G-E-207
  
RURAL EDUCATION. 181 
obtained from State reports, from the Bureau of the Census, and 
from personal visits to rural schools by representatives of the bureau. 
The division also collected the material, and with the assistance of 
President Robert H. Wright, of the East Carolina Teachers’ Train- 
ing School, Greenville, N. C., prepared and published Bureau of 
Education Bulletin, 1913, No. 2, Training Courses for Rural Teach- 
ers. It also assisted in preparing for publication several other 
bulletins mentioned under the section on recent publications on rural 
education included later in this chapter. 
The division has affiliated with it about 50 special collaborators, 
each appointed at a nominal salary, to cooperate in keeping it in 
touch with the best things done in rural education. These collabo- 
rators are all persons whose work is directly connected with rural 
education in State departments of education, in State normal schools, 
or in other similar positions. Several of them are making special 
studies for the division on various phases of rural education, the 
results of which will probably be published by the bureau.t 
In the appropriation bill approved August 23, 1912, the amount 
allotted for “rural education, industrial education, and school 
hygiene” was increased from $6,000 to $15,000. As a result the

THE RURAL COMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. 
The National Council of Education at the annual meeting of the 
National Education Association, held at San Francisco in July, 1911, 
upon the motion of E. T. Fairchild, then State superintendent of 
public instruction of Kansas, voted that a committee of 11 be ap- 
pointed “to investigate the present condition of rural schools and 
make recommendations for their improvement.” The committee 
appointed was the following: 
E. T. Fairchild, president of New Hampshire College of Agriculture and 
Mechanic Arts, Durham, N, H., chairman. 
L. H. Bailey, dean of the State College of Agriculture, Ithaca, N. Y. 
Henry C. Morrison, State superintendent of public instruction, Concord, N. H. 
A. C. Nelson, State superintendent of public instruction, Salt Lake City, Utah. 
Edward C. Elliott, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis. 
Miss Adelaide Steele Baylor, State Department of Education, Indianapolis, 
Ind. 
T. H. Harris, State superintendent of public education, Baton Rouge, La. 
John R. Kirk, president, State Normal School, Kirksville, Mo. 
Edward Hyatt, State superintendent of public instruction, Sacramento, Cal. 
Luther L. Wright, State superintendent of public instruction, Lansing, Mich. 
James Y. Joyner, State superintendent of public instruction, Raleigh, N: C. 
Charles H. Keyes, president of Skidmore School of Arts, Saratoga Springs, 
N. ¥., and president of the National Council of Education. (Added to the com- 
mittee by vote of the council.) 
An appropriation of $1,000 for the expenses of the investigation 
was made by the board of directors of the National Education 
Association. The first meeting of the committee was held at Chicago, 
November 18 to 20, 1911. The United States Commissioner of Edu- 
cation and a representative of the division of rural education met 
with the committee. : 
A report on the organization of the committee and the character 
and scope of the work contemplated was made at the meeting of 
the Department of Superintendence at St. Louis, in February, 1912. 
The board of directors voted another $1,000 for expenses. A pre-
-P-A-G-E-209

liminary report was made at the Chicago meeting of the National 
Education Association in July, 1912, and the. committee was con- 
tinued another year. 
SUBJECTS CHOSEN FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION 
COMMITTEE ON RURAL SCHOOLS, 
It is conceded that “the rural school is the one laggard in the educational 
procession.” The conditions governing the country schools of to-day and the 
Jack of adequate results are well known to the students of education. The 
indictment is in part as follows: 
Of the 12,000,000 rural school children less than 25 per cent are completing 
the work of the grades. The teaching body is immature and lacks proper train- 
ing. ‘Terms are too short. School buildings are poor, insanitary, and iil 
equipped. The school enrollment is constantly decreasing. The supervision is 
wholly inadequate. High-school privileges are denied to the great majority of 
these boys and girls. The strong, virile rural school of a generation’ ago has 
gone, and in its place is a primary school weak in numbers and lacking in effi- 
ciency. The country boy and girl of this strenuous and complex twentieth 
century are not afforded equal educational opportunities with the city children. 
With this knowledge, it seems unnecessary to enter upon an extensive inyes- 
tigation having as its aim the gathering of information relative to the present 
rural school situation. The committee on rural schools, therefore, will address 
itself to the problem of suggesting ways and means for the betterment of these 
schools and for awakening the public to a definite sense of the needs of the rural 
schools. 
In pursuance of this policy the following were agreed upon as proper subjects 
for investigation and recommendation by the committee on rural schools— 
ORGANIZATION. 
1. The unit of school organization.—A consideration of the several units—dis- 
trict, township, and county—with a view to urging the general adoption of that. 
one which affords the best results. 
2. Consolidation.—A presentation of the advantages and of the imperative 
need of consolidation or centralization of schools from considerations of economy 
and efficiency. 
8. Classification —The adoption of a plan of systematic classification or stand- 
ardization of rural schools with official recognition by the State of those schools. 
which fulfill prescribed conditions, in the form of a moderate amount of State 
aid. 
4. Minimum term.—The enactment in every State of a law fixing the minimum 
length of the school year, with provision for State aid to those districts which 
without such aid would not be able to maintain school for the prescribed period. 
ADMINISTRATION, 
5. Funds—Their source and distribution.—A study of means of increasing 
school revenues, and a rational basis for the distribution of State and county 
school funds. 
6. Compulsory attendance.—A thorough study of the compulsory school laws 
of the several States, and a general investigation of means of increasing the 
attendance in rural schools. 
7. The school plant.—Model school grounds and buildings and a standard 
equipment for rural schools. 
77236°—xp 1912—vor 1——14
-P-A-G-E-210
184 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
8. Libraries.—Providing a minimum number of suitable general and reference 
books in the form of permanent or traveling libraries. 
9. Supervision.—(a) Closer supervision. The development of a plan for 
closer and more effective supervision; e. g., the Oregon plan, which provides for 
every 50 schools a supervisor under the direction of the county superintendent. 
(b) County superintendents. The system of county supervision, including the 
qualifications, manner of selection, duties, tenure of office, and compensation of 
county superintendent. 
{c) State rural school supervisors. The need in each State of one or more 
rural-school supervisors or visitors, under the direction of the State department 
of education. 
10. Records and statistics.—Systematic records that shall reveal real facts as 
to (a) rural school population; (6) enrollment; (c) average attendance; 
(d) length of term; (e) number of rurai-school pupils completing the work of 
the grades; (f) comparative per capita cost of town and country system; 
(g) comparison per pupil of valuation of taxable property, town and country; 
(h) comparison of average mill levy in town and country; (4) comparison of . 
value of school property, buildings, ete., per pupil, town and country; (j) com- 
parison of enrollment per teacher, town and country; (k) comparison of aver- 
age number of school days attended in town and in country. 
INSTRUCTION. 
11. Uniform courses of study.—A provision in the several States for the prepa- 
ration and compulsory use of a course of study for rural schools and suggestions 
as to gradation and a minimum number of classes; and, in view of the general 
recognition of the need of a reorganization and redirection of the work of 
these schools, the feasibility of introducing additional vocational work, particu- 
larly in agriculture, and of providing at State or county expense special instruc- 
tors therein. 
12. Textbooks.—The adoption of textbooks that recognize more intimately 
country life and country environment. 
13. (a) Preliminary preparation of teachers.—The enactment of laws provid- 
ing for a more adequate preliminary training on the part of applicants for teach- 
ers’ certificates. 
(bv) Teacher training courses in high schools ——A system of teacher training 
courses in high schools for the purpose of securing a better-trained class of 
teachers in the rural schools. 
14. Appointment and tenure of teachers.—The appointment or nomination of 
teachers by an educational expert, as the county superintendent, with greater 
permanence of tenure. 
SOCIAL ELEMENTS. 
15. (a) Cooperation.—Cooperation of social forces—the home, church, 
grange, farmers’ institutes, extension work of colleges, papers and magazines. 
(b) The school as a social center.—The use of school buildings as centers 
for the various social activities of the community. 
16. The home and the school.—A close inquiry based upon the theory that 
the progress, discipline, qualifications, and development of the youth depend 
more largely upon the right kind of parental influence than upon all others 
combined. This may well include the question, To what extent approximately 
does the influence of incompetent parental supervision affect the capabilities, 
adaptation, discipline, and efficiency of the average pupils in our public schools?
-P-A-G-E-211
RURAL EDUCATION. 185 
The State may provide for its boys and girls great opportunities, the acceptance 
of which the parent may easily prevent. 
17. Organized games and plays.—The appropriateness of play as an educa- 
tional agency and the utilization of the child’s instinctive interests as a means 
of promoting his intellectual and moral growth. 
RURAL SECONDARY HDUCATION. 
18. (a) Free tuwition—The value of high-school training for country youth 
and the necessity and means of providing free high-school privileges for every 
eligible boy and girl. 
(b) Consolidated, township, and county high schools—The plan of insti- 
tuting and maintaining consolidated, township, and county high schools, and 
the introduction of vocational training for preparation for country life and 
pursuits. 
STATE RURAL SCHOOL COMMISSIONS. 
During the past year three States, Iowa, North Dakota, and Wis- 
consin, have had special commissions studying the rural schools of 
their respective States with a view of making recommendations for 
their improvement. 
TOWA. 
In Iowa the commission is a subcommittee of a State commission 
known as the Better Iowa Schools Commission. This commission 
results from the action of the State teachers’ association at the reg- 
ular meeting in November, 1911. By unanimous vote the association 
set aside $2,000 for the expenses of a commission to investigate 
public-school conditions in the State, and to report its findings with 
recommendations. In accordance with the provisions of the resolu- 
tion the State superintendent of public instruction appointed a com~- 
mission of 21 persons, which met in Des Moines in February, 1912. 
The committee was divided into nine subcommittees, each to inves- 
tigate a different phase of the Iowa school problem. The various 
subjects were as follows: 1. School administration in Iowa—State, 
county, and local. 2. The rural schools. 3. The graded schools. 
4. The high schools. 5. Industrial education. 6. State aid for pub- 
lic schools. 7. The school as a community center. 8. Committee on 
publicity. 9. The facilities for the training of teachers. 
The recommendations of several of these committees pertain in 
part to rural education. Such parts will be presented here, although 
the report of the investigation itself will not be included. 
The committee on school administration recommend among other 
things: 
1. An increased salary for the superintendent of public instruction; that his 
term of office shall be four years; and that the method of nomination be non- 
partisan. 
2. The appointment: of a rural-school inspector in the State department of 
education,

3. That county superintendents be paid at least $1,800 per year and_be elected 
by a nonpartisan or appointive method for a term of four years. 
4. A county board of education composed of men directly interested in schools. 
5. That all school officers be required to attend an annual meeting or’ con- 
ference called by the county superintendent. 
6. That the township be the unit of organization for the management of 
rural schools, with a township school board of five members. 
The committee on rural schools report that they find— 
the Iowa rural school shows unwarranted weakness. This is due to several 
causes rather than to any one. There is no definite purpose in the minds of 
patrons to improve the schools. They are meagerly equipped and in some in- 
stances very much neglected. There is a lack of definite standards of work on 
the part of teachers, and in many instances the schools are presided over by 
young teachers of little training or experience. Close supervision under the 
present sy: s an impossibility * * *. The greater sources of weakness 
in our rural schools are a dearth of properly trained teachers, a cumbersome 
system of government, a lack of close superyision, and failure to apply a 
thorough business policy in handling them.    
    The committee make eight recommendations, as follows: 
1. We favor voluntary consolidation for Iowa schools, with a minimum area 
of 16 sections, with State aid annually from $500 to $1,500, to be classified by 
the department of public instruction; the teaching of agriculture and domestic 
science to be required, and no consolidated school to have less than two 
departments. 
2. We recommend that the rural independent districts be discontinued. 
3. We recommend that rural schools be under the inspection and supervision 
of the department of public instruction. 
4. We recommend one rural inspector, one grade inspector, and one high-school 
inspector, under the supervision of the department of public instruction. 
5.. We recommend that provisions be made to properly safeguard the health of 
rural school children. 
6. We recommend that practical courses of study be adopted for the rural 
schools. 
7. We recommend the enactment of a law providing a suitable and sane plan 
for the adoption of textbooks, which will protect the people. 
8. We recommend that additional normal schools be established and that 
normal training be provided in every high school that can successfully carry on 
such a course.    
    The members of the committee making the above recommendations 
represented many different interests. The names and occupations are 
as follows: B. W. Newman, chairman, Strawberry Point, lawyer, ex- 
State senator; Thomas H. Barnes, Crawfordsville, farmer; J. A. 
Woodruff, Storm Lake, county superintendent of schools; Arthur 
Springer, Wapello, lawyer, member of former educational commis- 
sion; Robert Rienow Elkader, superintendent of schools; Frank D. 
Joseph, Des Moines, deputy State superintendent of public instruction.

RURAL EDUCATION, 187 
The committee on industrial education made a special investiga- 
tion as to the needs of the farm boys and girls with regard to voca- 
tional training. They recommend— 
1. That the county educational board be empowered to employ two special 
supervisory teachers to have charge of the industrial work of the rural schools. 
2. That some form of State aid be granted counties employing special 
teachers. 
3. That State aid be given to township high schools when a satisfactory 
course in industrial work is offered. 
4, That all State-aided schools be required to maintain courses in agri 
domestic science, and manual training and be under the direct supe 
State inspectors. 
  ulture, 
sion of    
The committee also recommend the adoption of a more effective 
teaching of agriculture and suggest the following needs: 
1. An extension of normal training facilities to all high schools of the State 
which can properly qualify for it. 
2. Legislation providing for a knowledge of the subject of agricultuve on the 
part of those who are to teach. 
8. Further summer-school facilities for the instruction in agriculture of 
teachers who are already in the service but not qualified to teach agriculture. 
4. Courses of study which shall classify and outline the work in elementary 
agriculture and suggest methods of procedure which will enable the great mass 
of the teachers to apply effectively the teaching of agriculture along with the 
other essential branches in the general courses of study. 
5. Further provision for training special teachers of agriculture for work as 
high school and normal school instructors. 
The committee on State aid in their report include a recommenda- 
tion that the State teachers’ association ask at the next session of the 
legislature the enactment of a law giving aid to Iowa public schools 
as follows: 
Consolidated schools of four or more departments shall receive annually as 
State aid the sum of $1,500. 
A consolidated school of three departments shall receive as State aid the sum 
of $1,000. 
A consolidated school of two departments shall receive as State aid the sum 
of $500. 
Any high school that shall meet the requirements fixed by the law providing 
for normal training in high schools shall receive as State aid the sum of $500. 
NORTH DAKOTA, 
The North Dakota Rural School Commission was also created by the 
teachers of the State at the annual meeting of the North Dakota 
Educational Association in October, 1911. The commission was ap- 
pointed “to recommend effective measures for the permanent uplift 
of the schools of the State.” Their recommendations include princi- 
pally a plea for the adoption of State laws which would require: 
(1) Longer terms and better attendance; (2) better financial sup- 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
188 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
port; (8) better school board organization; (4) consolidation of 
schools; (5) improved supervision and better teaching; (6) a cam- 
paign of education for rural school uplift and improvement. 
They recommend that the term be at least 9 months and that all 
children from 8 to 15, inclusive, be required to attend; that the county 
tuition fund be increased to about 10 mills and be distributed on the 
basis of teachers employed and aggregate attendance of pupils, and 
that the State tuition fund should be distributed on the same basis; 
a county board of education to take over the work of local school 
boards in rural districts, with powers similar to city boards of educa- 
tion; a State board of education to prescribe rules for classifying 
schools, issuing certificates, conducting teachers’ institutes and sum- 
mer schools, and appointing inspectors and the State superintendent ; 
a 1 mill county tax, and $100,000 from the State annually to promote 
consolidation; a minimum wage of $60 per month for teachers; and 
county superintendents to be appointed for five years by county 
boards of education with field deputies to assist in supervision. 
WISCONSIN. 
The Wisconsin committee is known as the “ committee of fifteen.” 
It was appointed by the State superintendent of schools to make a 
study of the condition of the common schools of the State, in the hope 
that as a result of their work public attention would become centered 
more upon the common schools than it has been in the past. The 
committee was organized into five subcommittees, one on each of the 
following subjects: Consolidation of rural schools; preparations and 
qualifications of teachers; supervision; social center movement; 
higher education for country communities. 
The committee on consolidation have prepared a bulletin which has 
been printed by the State department of education. They recommend 
that the State law under which consolidation is effected be simplified 
and that a law be provided requiring the transportation of pupils 
when consolidation is effected. They recommend a county board of 
education to have the immediate charge of the consolidation of 
schools and that consolidation be made compulsory When the attend- 
ance falls below a certain point and where it is possible to make 
provision for the children to attend neighboring schools. They rec- 
ommend further the transportation to be paid from State funds. 
The committee on the preparation of teachers recommend that no 
new teacher shall be permitted to teach in any public school of the 
State without at least one year of professional training in addition 
to two years of high-school work. The committee on supervision 
recommend a county board of education to have general oversight of
-P-A-G-E-215
RURAL EDUCATION. 189 
the schools of the county, to select the county superintendent, and to 
provide assistants to him in supervising the schools of the county. 
The committee on the social-center movement recommend that the 
use of the schoolhouse as a social center for the community be encour- 
aged. ‘The committee has in preparation a bulletin containing reports 
of what has been done in this field and offering suggestions for social- 
center work. They recommend further that the school be made a 
center for the social activities of the pupils, and a meeting place for 
all gatherings, such as farmers’ meetings, farmers’ clubs, socials, or 
community observance of special days; they recommend also the em- 
ployment of a teacher who understands community life and is capable 
of being a leader in practical affairs. The committee as a whole 
recommend the adoption of the county as a unit of taxation for 
school affairs, that the present compulsory-attendance law be amended 
so as to reach every child, and that special aid be given to rural 
schools reaching a certain definite standard. 
STATE SUPERVISORS AND INSPECTORS OF RURAL SCHOOLS. 
At least 20 States now have in connection with the State depart- 
ments of education special agents devoting their entire time to the 
rural schools, either as supervisors or inspectors or as special investi- 
gators to study their conditions and needs. 
In 12 Southern States officers known as “ State supervisors of rural 
schools,” are appointed by the State education authorities and are 
paid jointly by the Southern Education Board and the Peabody 
Education Fund. It is their duty to assist in the development of a 
State system of elementary rural schools, to know intimately the 
rural school conditions in their respective States, and ‘to conduct a 
campaign for improvement. A report of the work accomplished by 
them is given in another place in this chapter. The States in which 
these supervisors are employed are Virginia, West Virginia, North 
Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, 
Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Arkansas. In Virginia, Ken- 
. tueky, and Arkansas “second State supervisors” are appointed to 
devote their entire time to rural elementary schools for negroes. 
The other States employing special agents for rural schools are as 
a rule the States that provide special financial aid to rural schools. 
In Massachusetts one of the agents of the State board of education 
devotes his entire time to rural schools, particularly to the State-aided 
schools in the poorer townships. The third assistant commissioner of 
education of New York has special oversight over rural education in 
that State. A “rural school inspector” is employed in each of the 
States of Missouri, Oklahoma, North Dakota, and Wisconsin. IIli- 
   
-P-A-G-E-216
  190 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
nois has two. “ State supervisors of country and village schoois.” 
Minnesota employs a “ State rural school commissioner.” 
The southern group of State supervisors.—These officers are legally 
appointed State officials in the departments of education and, under 
the general oversight of the State superintendents of public instruc- 
tion, have charge of the administration and improvement of the 
rural schools. The office is permanent, so that, the efficient super- 
visor may devote his life to his work. Eight were appointed in 
1910, the other four in 1911. 
It seemed wise after the appointment of these supervisors that a 
definite program of procedure for all be adopted. Accordingly a 
meeting was called in connection with the Conference for Education 
in the South at Jacksonville, Fla., in April, 1911. There three prin- 
eipal lines-of effort were agreed upon: First, a campaign for in- 
creased local taxation; second, a campaign for consolidation, with 
transportation at public expense; and, third, the establishment of 
demonstration schools at, strategic centers. It was agreed also to 
work as far as possible with and through the county superintendents. 
The State supervisor, therefore, visits rural schools with the county 
superintendent, studying with him the conditions and needs of the 
schools and suggesting ways and means of improvement. While in 
the county he takes an active part in the local movements for eflicient 
schools, which are usually efforts to secure a local tax or to increase 
a previous levy, to consolidate weak schools, or to secure new build- 
ings to replace old ones. 
In two years the State supervisors have accomplished a great, deal. 
Much of the great movement in the South for better rural schools 
is due to their work. Their activities in the field are indicated by the 
reports from 12 States for nine months in 1912, which show that 
they aided in 137 local tax campaigns, in 172 consolidation efforts, 
and in 226 campaigns for new buildings. They attended 438 com- 
munity meetings. They spent 1,069 days in visiting schools in 511 
counties, in the majority of which they were accompanied by the 
county superintendents. They met, with 75 county boards of educa- 
tion and with 300 district boards of trustees. They visited 826 
schools, 334 teachers’ meetings, and assisted at 88 teachers’ institutes. 
They have addressed 846 public meetings, furnished 269 articles to 
newspapers, and mailed 38,127 circular letters and 77,485 pamphlets 
to rural public-school teachers. 
The teachers have received special attention from the supervisors. 
Tt was early realized that the larger number of teachers in the South- 
ern States were young women with practically no professional train- 
ing. It was realized, too, that these teachers must be instructed and  
-P-A-G-E-217
    
- RURAL EDUCATION. 191 
directed. To do this teachers’ manuals for the elementary schools 
have been prepared by the State supervisors in eight States and 
issued by the State departments of education. These give the teach- 
ers in detail the principal points and the work to be done and the 
best methods of putting them into practice. The other States will 
issue manuals as soon as possible. 
The work of establishing demonstration schools has been put into 
operation in a few States only. In Kentucky Mr. T. J. Coates, State 
supervisor of rural schools, has been particularly active along this 
line. In the session 1910-11 he selected 10 schools in each of 10 
counties, well distributed throughout the State. These schools were 
placed under his immediate direction by the county superintendents. 
In each of them an efficient teacher was placed, who managed the 
school as directed by the State supervisor. With each demonstration 
school were grouped seven or eight other schools in the surrounding 
territory. For each group an extra teacher, called “ substitute,” was 
engaged. This substitute teacher took the place ofthe regular 
teacher in each school in the group in turn so that the regular teach- 
ers, one at a time, spent one or two weeks at the central school. In 
the past session the number of schools was increased to 200. With 
the appointment of. county supervisors during the present year, as 
mentioned in another place in this chapter, the immediate oversight 
of the demonstration schools is placed in their hands. It is expected 
that the effect of the demonstration schools will gradually extend to 
all schools in the county and in the State, as it has now spread to the 
schools in the immediate vicinity. It is expected also that in time 
they will absorb many of the weaker schools in the vicinity. 
A beginning has been made for a similar plan in Arkansas. Dem- 
onstration schools are directed by the State supervisors in all coun- 
ties having county superintendents. There are about 100 such schools 
located in 15 counties. In Mississippi plans are now under way for 
the establishment of 250 demonstration schools similar to those in 
Kentucky and Arkansas. Other Southern States are making a 
“beginning. 
The State supervisors have been active also in promoting the em- 
ployment of county rural-school supervisors. At a meeting held in 
Morgantown, W. Va., in June, 1911, the West Virginia system of 
district supervision was studied. Previous to this, one county super- 
visor had been employed by each of several of the State normal 
schools in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and 
Louisiana, their salaries and expenses being paid from an appro- 
priation by the Peabody Education Fund. Although connected with 
the State normal schools, the work of these supervisors was done in 
each case under the general supervision of the State supervisor.

COUNTY RURAL SCHOOL SUPERVISORS, 
County rural school supervisors, as assistants to county superin- 
tendents, have begun work in over 100 counties in the Southern States 
during the past year. These supervisors are trained teachers, able 
to give expert advice and direction to the rural teachers and to assist 
them in the management of their schools and in their instructional 
work. Their appointment was due largely to the efforts of the State 
supervisors of rural schools who have been, during the past two years, 
conducting an active campaign for expert supervision of the work of 
rural teachers. In four States—Virginia, North Carolina, South 
Carolina, and Mississippi—the State supervisors received a small 
amount of money from the Peabody Education Fund to be divided 
among the counties securing county supervisors as a part of the 
salaries of these officers. In the other States no outside aid has been. 
used. 
As far as information is at hand, Alabama in the fall of 1912 had 
6 county supervisors; Arkansas, 1; Georgia, 8; Louisiana, 6; Ken- 
tucky, 70; Mississippi, 3; North Carolina, 3; South Carolina, 10; 
Tennessee, 5; and Virginia, 7. In South Carolina one of the county 
supervisors is employed by the State Normal and Industrial College 
at Rock Hill. West Virginia has district supervisors in 56 magis-  
-P-A-G-E-219
RURAL EDUCATION. 193, 
terial districts. In one of these districts, each of three graded-school 
principals has the oversight of four rural schools in the vicinity of 
his graded schools, dividing the time between teaching and super- 
vising. 
The appointment of supervisors in Kentucky was authorized by 
the legislature in June, 1912; in many of the other States no legal 
authorization exists. In Alabama the supervisors in Calhoun and 
Marshall Counties are paid from the county school funds as teachers 
and are detailed for supervisory work throughout the county. The 
next legislature will be asked to authorize the employment of county 
supervisors and the payment of their salary from the county funds. 
Among the other States with county supervision several have pro- 
vided special supervisors for rural schools, usually, however, under 
the title “assistant county superintendent.” Maryland now has as- 
sistant county superintendents in 4 counties and also has rural super- 
visors in 2—Baltimore and Anne Arundel Counties. Pennsylvania, 
in the new school code adopted in 1911, requires the appointment of 
assistant superintendents in every county with over 200 teachers, and 
2 assistants in every county with over 400 teachers. They are 
appointed by the officers of the county association of township school 
directors and are paid from the State school funds. In Indiana 3 
counties have engaged assistant superintendents during the year. 
North Dakota has now such officers in 10 counties. Information to 
show the exact extent to which this movement has spread has not 
been collected. It is, however, becoming generally recognized that 
the county superintendent in the average county can not supervise 
the schools in any effective way unless some assistance is given to him. 
Perhaps the most complete State system recently adopted for rural 
supervision is in Oregon. In each county with 60 or more school 
districts the county superintendent, by act of the legislature ap- 
proved in June, 1911, is required to appoint a county board of edu- 
cation. This board is required to divide the county into supervisory 
districts, each to contain from 20 to 50 school districts, and to ap- 
point a “district supervisor” for each district so created. This dis- 
trict supervisor must devote his entire time to supervision for at least 
10 months in the year, and he may be engaged for 12 months. He isa 
county officer, responsible to the county through the county superin- 
tendent, and is paid by the county. 
COUNTY RURAL SCHOOL INDUSTRIAL SUPERVISORS, 
Another plan of aiding county superintendents in their supervisory 
work with the rural schools has met with considerable success in 
many of the Southern States. It consists of the appointment of a 
rural school “ industrial teacher,” working in all parts of the county  
-P-A-G-E-220
194 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
under the direction of the county superintendent. The work of this | 
teacher consists in visiting the rural schools for the purpose of intro- 
ducing industrial work, such as sewing, cooking, gardening, estab- 
lishing cooking clubs, canning clubs, corn and tomato clubs, and 
school improvement associations. While not directly concerned with 
the academic work of the school, the effect of the visit of such a 
supervisor has been to’ produce an awakening in the entire life and 
work of the school. They have proved their value by showing them- 
selves able to make many suggestions regarding the management of 
the school, the arrangement of the program, and methods of teaching 
of especial value to inexperienced county teachers. 
The first industrial teacher was employed by the Jeanes fund in 
October, 1908, in Henrico County, Va. A negro woman, Virginia E. 
Randolph, who had taught 13 years in the county and had achieved 
notable success as a rural teacher, was appointed the first industrial 
supervisor. There were 23 negro schools in her county. The indus- 
trial teacher during the first year organized the parents into im- 
provement leagues, and through these leagues secured very marked 
improvements in the conditions of the buildings and the grounds. 
She introduced into the schools work in cooking, sewing, mat making, 
and elementary agriculture. 
Following the Henrico County plan, industrial supervision has 
been introduced among negro schools throughout the Southern 
States. The system is now the Virgina plan. Its adoption has been 
due almost wholly to the Jeanes Foundation, a fund for the benefit 
of negro education in the South. The industrial teachers are paid 
in whole or in part from the Jeanes fund, and are in part under the 
direction of the trustees of the fund. The teachers are appointed by 
the county superintendents and work under their immediate direc- 
tion. In Virginia, where a second State supervisor of rural schools 
has been appointed to give his time wholly to negro schools, the negro 
industrial supervisors are in large measure under his control. 
During the past year negro industrial supervisors were employed 
in 117 counties in 12 Southern States, as follows: Alabama, 173; 
Arkansas, 6; Florida, 3; Georgia, 13; Louisiana, 10; Maryland, 1; 
Mississippi, 15; North Carolina, 12; South Carolina, 8; Tennessee, 
3; Texas, 6; Virginia, 17; and 6 other special teachers. Of this num- 
ber 28 are men and were paid an average salary from the Jeanes 
fund of $357.50; 75 are women and received on an average $320.36. 
The term of service was about 7$ months during the year. The total 
amount paid by the Jeanes Foundation for supervisors during the 
past year was $35,782.50. 
Some of the definite results of the work of the supervising teachers 
may be shown from the following figures, taken from report of 17 
teachers in Virginia for the past year. In the territory covered by
-P-A-G-E-221
  ‘RURAL EDUCATION, 195 
these 17 teachers there are 469 negro schools, of which number 299 
were visited regularly. During the year 9 new buildings were erected 
and 12 were enlarged at a combined cost of $6,268, which does not 
include labor and material contributed; 12 schools were painted, 69 
whitewashed; 37 sanitary outhouses were built; 102 schools were 
supplied with individual drinking cups. There were 348 improve- 
ment leagues organized, and they raised for school improvement 
nearly $14,000. 
One of the most interesting developments of the work of the negro 
industrial supervisors is their cooperation with the farm demon- 
stration agents in working during the summer months with clubs of 
girls who cultivate home gardens and can vegetables and fruits for 
winter use. This plan has been carried out in Virginia more than 
in any other State, 8 of the supervisors being employed for 12 
months. During the past year there were 267 girls in garden clubs 
with 202 separate gardens. The girls “ put up” nearly 4,000 jars of 
tomatoes and other vegetables from their gardens, and ‘in addition 
6,000 jars of materials raised by the girls were “ put up” by their 
mothers. In addition to the garden work and instruction in canning, 
the supervisors gave regular lessons during the summer to the club 
girls in sewing, cooking, simple dressmaking, housekeeping, poultry 
raising, and in improving the general appearances of their homes on 
the inside and out. z 
Rural school supervisors of this kind are, however, not confined 
to negro schools. Virginia has the present year 7 white supervisors 
working among the white schools in 6 counties. They are appointed 
by the State department of education and are paid from the State 
school funds. ‘They are found in the following counties: Albemarle, 
Rockingham, Charles City, New Kent, Buchanan, Henrico, and 
Halifax. The last-named has 2 supervisors. 
Similar industrial teachers for white schools have also been pro- 
vided in Georgia and Louisiana, in about 12 counties. Their appoint- 
ment in these States has come about through the initiative and the 
generosity of Mr. N. O. Nelson, of New Orleans and St. Louis, who 
paid their salaries for the first two years. The first of these super- 
visors was put to work in Putnam County, Ga., in September, 1909. 
She was placed in charge of the county superintendent. She began 
work by getting acquainted with the teachers and pupils, and she 
was invited to the homes and became acquainted with the parents. 
She talked to teachers, pupils, and parents about sewing and cook- 
ing, shopwork, gardening, and the general improvement of the 
schoolhouses and grounds. She introduced into the schools sewing 
and cooking for girls and shopwork for boys, established school and 
home gardens for both boys and girls, and organized canning clubs  
-P-A-G-E-222
  196 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
and school improvement associations. She raised a library fund 
and a little money for extending the length of the school term. Her 
services were very much in demand, and she was freely sent for and 
entertained in all parts of the county. She was regarded not as an 
instructor, but as .a supervisor and leader. Three additional teachers 
were secured the second year, and the work was inaugurated in 
Louisiana. The plan has proved so successful that several counties 
have taken over the supervisor and are now paying the salaries. 
STATE ORGANIZERS OF SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATIONS. 
Another movement which is accomplishing widely extended and 
definite results in rural school improvement, particularly in the 
South, comes from activities of State, county, and local school im- 
provement associations. These associations are composed of the 
school patrons, both men and women, who meet regularly at the 
school buildings for the purpose (1) of improving in every possible 
way the school building and grounds; (2) of placing in the school 
facilities for health and comfort as well as for education; (8) of 
making the school yard suitable for a playground; (4) of planting 
trees, shrubs, and flowers to make the yard and building more beau- 
tiful and attractive; (5) of making the school a social center and 
thus creating a more active interest in the school on the part of the 
patrons. School improvement associations as local organizations 
have existed in many States, both North and South, for many years, 
in Maine and Ohio particularly. Only in 6 Southern States, how- 
ever, has their organization been made a function of the State depart- 
ment of education. 
Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkan- 
sas each has in the State department of education a State organizer 
of school improvement associations. At the present time the posi- 
tions are occupied by Mrs. L. R. Dashiell, in Virginia; Miss Virginia 
P. Moore, in Tennessee; Mrs. Charles P. Weaver, in Kentucky; Miss 
Susie V. Powell, in Mississippi; Miss Agnes Morris, in Louisiana; 
and Miss Eva Reichardt, in Arkansas. They were appointed by the 
State departments, but are paid by the Southern Education Board and 
the Peabody Fund. 
Their work consists largely in assisting in organizing county and 
local school improvement associations and in stimulating the asso- 
ciations when organized into continued activity for the betterment 
of the schools they represent. The State organizers have issued 
publications explaining to the county superintendents and others 
interested and to the teachers how to organize county and local 
associations. The most complete of these publications are those

  RURAL EDUCATION. 197 
Tn a recent bulletin prepared by Miss Powell is outlined in full 
the plan of rural school improvement through the school improve- 
ment associations. It gives full directions for organizing county and 
local associations and includes suggestive programs for the observ- 
ance of special days: Clean-up and beautify day, in October; Health 
day, in November; Library day, in December ; Arbor day, in January; 
Club day, in February; Field day, in March. The names suggest the 
purpose of the special days. Directions are given showing also how 
the special-day programs which are given by both pupils and patrons 
may be correlated with the instructional work of the school. 
The activities of the State organizers include visiting rural schools, 
usually with the county superintendents, meeting with citizens to 
organize improvement leagues, attending meetings of local and 
county leagues, making public addresses, preparing articles for news- 
papers and circular letters and pamphlets for teachers, and in per- 
sonal correspondence with league officers and teachers on matters 
pertaining to the improvement leagues. In several cases the State 
organizers of improvement associations are also State agents for the 
promotion of girls’ tomato and canning clubs. 
Nearly all the other Southern States have State and county school 
improvement associations without official status. The services of 
their officers and members are purely voluntary. 
BOYS’ AND GIRLS’ AGRICULTURAL CLUBS, 
The boys’ and girls’ agricultural-club movement is becoming more 
closely connected with the school and the work of the clubs a definite 
part of the school program. The growth of the movement through- 
out the United States has been rapid during the past year. This 
has been due largely to the activities of the Bureau of Plant In- 
dustry of the United States Department of Agriculture, through 
the Farmers’ Cooperative Demonstration Work, which has been 
engaged in fostering the movement in the 12 cotton States for the 
past 7 years, and the section of field studies and demonstrations-club 
work of the Office of Farm Management, which began similar work 
July 1, 1912, in other States. 
Boys’ and girls’ corn clubs and other agricultural clubs have been 
in existence as local district, county, or State institutions for at 
least 16 years. Among the first clubs were those established in Penn- 
sylvania, Llinois, Iowa, and other States of the Middle West. The 
national club movement, however, began in 1907 in Holmes County, 
Miss., while W. H. Smith, now State supervisor of rural schools, was 
county superintendent. It was organized as a part of the farm 
demonstration work in the Southern States, begun in 1904 under
-P-A-G-E-224

198 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
the direction of the late Dr. Seaman A. Knapp, special agent in 
charge of farmers’ cooperative demonstration work of the United 
States Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Plant Industry. 
The first clubs organized were corn clubs for boys from 10 to 18 
years of age, in which each boy cultivated on his father’s farm one 
acre of corn in competition with other boys in the club. There were 
162 members of the Holmes County club in 1907. The number has 
grown from this as a beginning until in 1912 there were approxi- 
mately 100,000 boys enrolled in corn clubs in the Southern States. 
In 1910 girls’ garden and canning clubs were organized in South 
Carolina and Virginia. There were 325 girls enrolled the first year 
and about 3,500 the second year. In 1912 approximately 30,000 girls 
are enrolled, each growing one-tenth of an acre of tomatoes and can- 
ning for home use and for market her own garden products. Cotton 
clubs, potato.clubs, pig clubs, poultry clubs, ete., have also been 
established. 
According to the statement of the Farmers’ Cooperative Demon- 
stration Work, the movement was inaugurated with the following 
purposes in view: 
1. To afford the rural teacher a simple and easy method of teaching practical 
agriculture in the school in the way it must be acquired to be of any real sery- 
ice, mainly by actual work upon the farm. 
2. To prove that there is more in the soil than the farmer has ever gotten 
out of it; to inspire boys with a love of the land by showing them how they 
can get wealth out of it by tilling it in a better way, and thus be helpful to the 
family and the neighborhood. 
3. To give the boys a definite, worthy purpose, and to stimulate a friendly 
rivalry among them. 
It was designed also to secure rural cooperation. Wherever the 
work has been inaugurated county superintendents of education, the 
school teachers, county demonstration agents, business men, news- 
papers, ministers, and parents have all united for carrying forward 
the movement in a way which has fostered rural progress along all 
lines. 
Corn was selected for demonstration because it may be grown profit- 
ably in nearly all parts of the United States. A more common 
knowledge of it is possessed by country boys than of any other one 
crop.” It yields more food to the acre than any other green crop, and 
a good crop means cheaper food for men and animals. Its cultivation 
is comparatively easy, and the principles of agriculture learned in its 
cultivation are fundamental and are of broad application. 
The work usually is organized with the county for a unit and is 
initiated through the county superintendent, who secures the co- 
operation of the teachers. Each teacher explains the plans to her boys
-P-A-G-E-225
  RURAL EDUCATION. 199 
and secures the names of those who desire to belong to the county 
eorn club. The boys of the entire county are then assembled in some 
central place for organization and instruction. For the first year it 
has been found advantageous to furnish seed, so that every boy in the 
contest is assured of first-class material to plant. The boards of trade, 
bankers, and business men often provide funds for purchasing the 
seed. After the first year each boy selects his own seed. Merchants 
and business men are asked to provide prizes. : 
When the organization is completed the names and addresses of the 
boys enrolled are sent to the United States Department of Agri- 
culture. Each boy agrees to raise 1 acre of corn in accordance with 
the directions furnished him. The department sends them circulars 
of information giving instruction in regard to seed selection, the 
preparation, fertilization, and cultivation of the soil, etc. They also 
send a special form which, when filled by the boy, gives a complete 
record of his work in cultivating his acre of corn, including a descrip- 
tion of the method of cultivation and an estimate of the cost and the 
value of the crop. The following rules govern the clubs: 
(1) Boys joining clubs and entering contests must be between 10 and 18 years 
of age on January 1 of any given year. 
(2) No boy shall contest for a prize unless he becomes a member of a club. 
(3) The members of the clubs must agree to study the instructions of the 
Farmers’ Cooperative Demonstration Work. 
(4) Each boy must plan his own crop and do his own work.. A small boy may 
hire help for heavy plowing in preparing the soil. 
(5) Exhibits must be delivered to the county superintendent of education on 
or before November 1. 
(6) The land and corn must be carefully measured in the presence of at least 
two disinterested witnesses, who shall attest the certificate of the boy. 
(7) In awarding prizes the following basis shall be used:

ib) Ge rentont yield per Aeneas eee ee 30

  (ce) Best written account showing history of crop_. 20 
(d) Best showing of profit on investment based on the commercial price of

The results from an agricultural standpoint have been wonderful. 
In 1911, for instance, three boys made records which are probably 
better records in corn production than ever before made: 
Julius Hill, of Attalla, Ala., produced 2124 bushels on 1 acre, at a 
cost of 8.6 cents per bushel. 
Bennie Beeson, of Monticellé, Miss., produced 2273 bushels on an 
acre, at a cost of 14 cents per bushel. 
Ben Leath, of Kensington, Ga., produced 2143 bushels on an acre, 
at a cost of 14.2 cents.

200 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
Four other boys produced from 210 to 225 bushels on their acres, 
at a cost of from 20 to 35 cents per bushel. 
The following statements, taken from the official report of the 
Department of Agriculture, will give some idea of the records made: 
Fifty-two boys in Georgia received diplomas, signed by the governor and 
other officials, for producing more than 100 bushels per acre each, at an average 
cost of less than 30 cents per bushel; 21 Georgia club members, from the 
seventh congressional district alone, grew 2,641 bushels, at an average cost of 
23 cents per bushel; 19 boys in Gordon County, Ga., averaged 90 bushels, 10 
of them making 1,058 bushels. The 10 boys who stood highest in Georgia 
averaged 169.9 bushels and made a net profit of more than $100 each, besides 
prizes won. In Alabama 100 boys averaged 97 bushels, at an average cost of 
27 cents. In Monroe County, Ala., 25 boys averaged 78 bushels. In Yazoo 
County, Miss., 21 boys averaged 111.6 bushels, at an average cost of 19.7 cents. 
In Lee County, Miss., 17 boys averaged 82 bushels, at an average cost of 
21 cents. Sixty-five boys in Mississippi averaged 109.9 bushels, at an average 
cost of 25 cents. Twenty Mississippi boys averaged 140.6 bushels, at an average 
cost of 23 cents. Ninety-two boys in Louisiana grew 5,791 bushels on 92 acres; 
10 of these boys went above 100 bushels, although the weather conditions were 
very unfavorable in that State. In North Carolina 100 boys averaged 99 
bushels. In the same State 432 boys averaged 63 bushels. In Buncombe 
County, N. C., 10 boys averaged 88 bushels. In Sussex County, Va., 16 boys 
averaged 82 bushels. Fifteen boys in the vicinity of Memphis, Tenn., where 
the business men contributed about $3,000 to aid the work, averaged 127.4 
bushels, at an average cost of 28 cents per bushel. 
In each of the cotton States a State prize is given for the best 
record. The prize usually consists of a trip to Washington, and is 
furnished by interested individuals or associations. The winners 
for 1912, as certified by the United States Department of Agriculture, 
were as follows:

The organization and methods. of the girls’ garden and canning 
clubs are similar to those of the boys’ corn clubs. The usual crop 
raised is one-tenth of an acre of tomatoes. The girls cultivate the 
crop under the directions furnished by the Department of Agricul- 
ture. They preserve the tomatoes in glass or tin cans. The object 
of the work is— . : 
First, to stimulate interest and wholesome cooperation among mem- 
bers of the family in the home. 
Second, to provide some means by which the girls may earn money 
at home and at the same time get the education and viewpoint 
necessary for the ideal farm life. 
Third, to encourage rural families to provide purer and better food 
at a lower cost and to utilize the surplus and otherwise waste prod- 
ucts of the garden and orchard. 
Fourth, to furnish earnest teachers a plan for aiding their pupils 
and helping their communities, 
The work in the Northern and Western States, begun in July, 
1912, by the Office of Farm Management, was made possible by the 
appropriation bill for the Department of Agriculture for the fiscal 
year 1912-13. By it the sum of $300,000 was provided to “ investi- 
gate and encourage the adoption of improved methods of farm man- 
agement and farm practice and for farm demonstration work.” This 
is in addition to the $332,960 provided to continue the work in the 
South inaugurated by the late Dr. S. A. Knapp. Part of this amount 
will be used for the encouragement of boys’ and girls’ agricultural 
clubs in the Northern and Western States. While they will be 
organized along similar lines to those in the cotton States, they will 
be more closely connected with the State colleges of agriculture. 
Each State club agent will be employed jointly by the State college 
of agriculture and by the Bureau of Plant Industry. This will con- 
uect the national work with the boys’ and girls’ agricultural clubs 
already established by the State colleges in the greater number of 
States. 
Sixteen States are now organized in cooperation with the Office of 
Farm Management for national club work, with two or more coop- 
erative agents in each State. The work is planned for the farm 
and home, rather than from a school or pedagogical point of view. 
Its purpose is to teach the children to grow a crop economically and 
efficiently. The work is initiated in most instances through the agency 
of the school and may, therefore, be made a definite part of the 
educative work of the school by the school authorities. Special in- 
structions are furnished to all club members by the Office of Farm 
Management in accordance with the line of work pursued by the 
club, which, in the Northern and Western States, is not confined

SCHOOL CREDIT FOR HOME INDUSTRIAL WORK. 
A movement is growing throughout the country to connect more 
definitely the home life and the school life of the child through the 
device of crediting the child in school for household or farm work
-P-A-G-E-229
  RURAL “EDUCATION. 203 
--done'at home. Tt may be as a required part of the school work, or as 
optional work supplementary to the school. work which, if done and 
done satisfactorily, gives the pupil a higher school rating. 
There are two distinct schemes in operation, differing principally 
in the character of the work for which credit is given and the relation 
of the work to the school: 
First. A single definite piece of work selected to be done at home 
in part under the direction and supervision of the school, which can 
be carried through from the beginning to the completion, and requires 
supplementary reading and study in the school. 
Second. The ordinary tasks that require doing daily in the home 
and on the farm. Credit is given for doing the task; extra credit 
for doing it well. The parent is the judge of the home work and 
rates the child according to the quantity and quality of the work 
done. 
The first scheme is becoming generally known as the “home- 
project ” plan. This expression as used in this connection probably 
orignated in Massachusetts, where it is applied to the practice work 
in the departments of agriculture in rural high schools and where the 
work is done at the home and not on a school farm. According to the 
regulations of the Massachusetts State department of education, 
every hoy studying agriculture in the State-aided departments of 
agriculture in public high schools must carry out some farming proj- 
ect at home. The project and the study necessary to carry it out 
require about one-half of the pupil’s time. The “ farming project 
is a thing to be done on the farm, which, in the preparation for doing 
it and in carrying it to a successful result, would involve a thorough- 
going educational process.” Projects suggested are: Keeping a pen 
of poultry; caring for a select part of an orchard; raising a specified 
crop of potatoes; caring for one or two cows, including the feeding, 
cleaning, mjlking, and testing the milk. In all cases the farm 
project includes keeping careful and accurate records of the work. 
This plan has been adopted widely by individual schools through- 
out the United States. Elementary schools, as well as high schools, 
have taken it up, and household projects for girls are included as 
well as farm projects for boys. 
For boys below the high school the home project consists usually 
of the cultivation of a plat of corn, potatoes, or some other common 
crop; and for the girls breadmaking, plain cooking, canning, and 
sewing, including such work as making aprons or other articles of 
clothing. 
The plan seems to be effective. It requires, in the case of the farm 
project, that the school-teacher visit the home for inspection of the 
work. The home projects both for boys and girls are made the
-P-A-G-E-230
204 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
bases for much reading and study at the school and for classroom 
discussion. 
The second scheme attempts to encourage the pupil to help in the 
regular home work and to do his part well. As a rule where it is 
‘in operation no direct attempt is made to make the work educative, 
except as the pupil receives instructions from his parents. No 
attempt is made to correlate it with the work inside the school. It 
makes teachers of the parents, as far as the home duties are con- 
cerned, and puts upon the parents the responsibility of judging the 
quantity and quality of the work done. This plan is in operation in 
many sections throughout the United States. Perhaps more has been 
done in Oregon than in any other one State. State Supt. L. R. Alder- 
man has issued a small pamphlet explaining the plan as in operation 
in Oregon. The following is taken from his pamphlet: 
The plan costs no money, will take but little school time, and can be put into 
operation in every part of the State at once. It will create a demand for expert 
instruction later on. It is to give school credit. for industrial work done at 
home. The mother and father are to be recognized as teachers, and the school- 
teacher put into the position of one who cares about the habits and tastes of 
the whole child. Then the teacher and the parents will have much in common. 
Every home has the equipment for industrial work and has some one who uses 
it with more or less skill. 
The school has made so many demands on the home that the parents have in 
some cases felt that all the time of the child must be given to the school. But 
an important thing that the child needs, along with school work, is established 
habits of home making. What one does depends as much upon habit as upon 
knowledge. The criticism that is most often made upon industrial work at 
school is that it is so different from the work done at the home that it does not 
put the child into that sympathetic relation with the home which, after all, is for 
him and the home the most important thing in the world. Juvenile institutions 
find that they must be careful not to institutionalize the child to the extent that 
he may not be contented in a real home. In my opinion it will be a great thing 
for the child to want to help his parents do the task that needs to be done, and 
want to do it in the best possible way. The reason that so many country boys 
are now the leading men of affairs is because early in life they had the responsi- 
bility of home thrust upon them. I am sure that the motto “ Everybody helps ” 
is a good one. 
But one says: “How can it be brought about? How can the school give 
credit for industrial work done at home?” This may be accomplished by 
printed slips asking the home to take account of the work that the child does 
at home under the instruction of the home, and explaining that credit will be 
given this work on the school record. These slips must be prepared for chil- 
dren according to age, so that the child will not be asked to do too much, for 
it must be clearly recognized that children must have time for real play. The 
required tasks must not be too arduous, yet they must be real tasks. They 
must not be tasks that will put extra work on parents except in the matter of 
instruction and observation. They may well call for the care of animals. and 
should include garden work for both boys and girls. Credit in school for home 
industrial work (with the parents’ consent) should count as much as any one 
study in school. 
 
-P-A-G-E-231
    
RURAL EDUCATION. 205 
The general plan as worked out by one Oregon school is as follows: 
A schedule of home tasks and the credits to be allowed was prepared, 
the credits being expressed in minutes. A few of these tasks are: 
Building fire in morning, 5 minutes; milking a cow, 5 minutes: 
cleaning horse, 10 minutes; feeding hens, 5 minutes; making and 
baking bread, 60 minutes; preparing breakfast for family, 30 min- 
utes; washing and wiping dishes, 15 minutes; washing and ironing 
own clothes that are worn at school, 120 minutes, ete. No pupil is 
obliged to do any of this work. The parent sends to the teacher 
each morning a signed list containing the record of the work of the 
child the previous day. The list is prepared by the child. When the 
total number of credits for any pupil amounts to a day, the pupil is 
entitled to a holiday. At this particular school prizes are given to 
the six pupils obtaining the most credits during the term, and every 
pupil carrying out the work has 10 per cent added to his standing in 
the regular school work. ; 
In Missouri considerable headway has been made with a similar 
plan which is used in all the schools of several counties. Its intro- 
duction has come about largely through the adoption of a school 
report card known as the “ parent-teacher partnership report card,” 
prepared by Mrs. Mary E. De Garmo, of St. Louis, chairman of the 
country life department of the National Congress of Mothers. 
Mrs. DeGarmo’s card contains a printed list of school subjects, 
reading, arithmetic, ete., with blank spaces for each month in which 
the teacher indicates the pupil’s standing in each subject. The card 
is then sent to the parent. It contains also a printed list of home in- 
dustrial subjects, with blanks for each month in which the parent 
is asked to indicate by the letters E, G, M, and P, denoting excellent, 
good, medium, and poor, the progress made by the child in the differ- 
ent industrial subjects. The card is then returned to the teacher. 
The subjects for girls are sweeping, dusting, bread making, cake 
making, sewing, washing dishes, and ironing. For boys the subjects 
are feeding stock, milking, cleaning horses, providing fuel, and feed- 
ing poultry. Other subjects may be added by the parent if they are 
regular work for the boy or girl. It is to be noted that no record of 
time is asked of the parent, simply a record of progress in the quality 
of the work done by the child. The teacher in rating the pupil for 
the term or year regards the home industrial work as one subject in 
the pupil’s course of study equal, as far as the standing of the pupil 
is concerned, with any one of the regular school subjects. 
This particular plan of giving credit for home work has been 
formulated with two special facts in view: First, many farm boys 
and girls have their entire time outside of school taken with farm 
and home duties, and consequently in their school work are apt to fall 
behind the pupils who have little or no home work; second, when the
-P-A-G-E-232
  206 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
home work is taken into account in determining the school standing 
of the pupil, it becomes dignified in the eyes of the pupil and its 
performance a pleasure rather than a drudgery. It, was devised 
especially to encourage the boy and girl doing many home tasks; also 
to make the home duties educative and their importance appreciated 
both by parents and by the children. 
IMPORTANT LEGISLATION AFFECTING RURAL EDUCATION, 
During the scholastic year 1911-12 the legislatures of 14 States 
met in regular session, namely: Arizona, Georgia, Kentucky, Loui- 
siana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Jersey, New 
Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, and 
Virginia. Important legislation affecting rural schools primarily was 
passed in only a few of these. The following paragraphs note briefly 
the most important: 
dientucky—The Kentucky enactments will probably prove far- 
reaching in their effect. The power of the State superintendent of 
public instruction has been greatly increased by a provision authoriz- 
ing him to inspect and examine all schools receiving funds directly 
or indirectly from the State. For this special. duty $1,500 is added 
to his annual salary, and two assistants are provided at $1,000 each, 
to whom he is authorized to give full power of attorney to act for 
him; $2,000 was appropriated for extra clerical work in the depart- 
ment office. The State disbursement for common schools was, in 
1910-11, approximately $3,105,105, of which amount $2,459,865 was 
expended on the rural schools. As every public school maintaining 
a session of at least six months receives a part of this fund, the State 
department of education is now in a better position than ever before 
to give effective assistance in the improvement of the rural schools. 
Two measures looking toward more and better supervision were 
passed. The county superintendent now must devote his entire time 
to the duties of his office. The minimum salary has been increased 
from $400 to $600 and the maximum from $1,500 to $2,500. The 
county boards of education have been authorized to employ “super- 
visors” for rural schools as assistants to the county superintendents. 
They will be paid from county funds. In addition to the supervisory 
duties they also must act as truant officers to enforce the compulsory 
education laws. No limit is fixed to the number that may be employed 
in any county. This provision was approved by the governor of the 
State in June, 1912. Before the opening of the schools for the school 
year 1912-13 approximately 50 supervisors had been engaged. In 
December, 1912, there were 70. 
A new method for the distribution of the school funds has been 
authorized. The county board may now place in one common school
-P-A-G-E-233
  RURAL, EDUCATION; 207 
fund the money received from the State and that raised in the county 
by tax levy, and distribute the common fund in the county in what- 
ever way will best make an efficient system of schools for the county. 
The State fund will be used for teachers’ salaries, which may range 
from $35 to $70. The amount paid to any teacher is to be based on 
and regulated by her qualifications and the number of children actu- 
ally in attendance in proportion to the total number of school age in 
the district. In determining the amount the county officials must 
conform to the rules of the State department of education. 
The law makes provision also for the consolidation of rural schools. 
The county board is empowered to lay off a territory including sev- 
eral subdistricts and submit to the voters thereof the proposition of 
consolidation and of a tax sufficient to provide for a consolidated 
school and the transportation of pupils to it. Districts already 
consolidated are authorized to pay for pupils’ transportation, and pub- 
lic funds already used for such purposes are validated. Several con- 
solidated schools had been established during the past few years and 
pupils had been transported at public expense. A question had arisen 
regarding the legality of the expenditures for these schools and for 
the transportation of pupils. This has been definitely settled by the 
action of the legislature. 
South Carolina—The South Carolina Legislature passed two acts 
which will probably do much to improve rural schools. Under the 
old law county superintendents were elected for two or four years 
in the fall, taking office the 1st day of January. The activities of the 
superintendents before election time on other than school affairs and 
the many changes resulting from the elections occurring in the middle 
of the school year, both worked to the injury of the school. This 
situation will be largely remedied by the new law which extends for 
six months the terms of all superintendents now in office and begins 
the new terms on July 1 instead of January 1. 
To encourage the establishment of union and consolidated schools 
to replace the one-room one-teacher schools, the State has provided 
special aid. Not less than $15,000 is to be appropriated annually 
* “to assist rural districts in establishing, maintaining, and improving 
rural graded schools.” Either $200 or $800 may be received by a 
school. The first amount is paid on the following conditions: The 
district must levy a special school tax of at least 4 mills, employ two 
certificated teachers for a term of not less than six months, maintain 
a school with an enrollment of at least 50 pupils and with an average 
daily attendance of not fewer than 30, provide a comfortable and 
sanitary building with the minimum equipment prescribed by the 
State board of education, and use a course of study and a classifica- 
tion approved by the State board. The second amount is paid to 
larger districts under the same general conditions. Each district, 
however, must maintain a school seven months in the year, with three

208 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
certificated teachers, and an enrollment of 75 pupils, 40 of whom 
must be in daily attendance. The school trustees with the consent of 
the county superintendent may use the money provided by the State 
to furnish transportation. 
The provisions of the South Carolina act are very similar to a 
Virginia act passed in 1910 which appropriated $25,000 a year for 
two years. Evidently it has proved a successful and popular enact- 
ment in Virginia, as the legislature has increased the appropriation 
for 1913 and 1914 to $75,000 for each year. 
New Jersey has provided for the appointment of county superin- 
tendents by the State commissioner of education with the advice and 
consent of the State board of education, instead of by the State board 
as formerly. The appointee must hold the highest teachers’ certifi- 
cate issued in the State and must have been a resident of the county 
for three years immediately preceding his appointment. All county 
superintendents are to be paid $3,000 per year in the future and they 
must devote their entire time to the duties of the office. 
RECENT PUBLICATIONS ON RURAL EDUCATION. 
An increased amount of literature on rural schools and rural edu- 
cation has appeared during the past Year. A few of these only may 
be mentioned here. : 
“Country Life and the Country School” is the title of a book 
written by Mabel Carney, director of the country school department 
of the Illinois State Normal University. Miss Carney discusses the 
farm problem, the country home, the country church, the grange, 
farmers’ institutes, the agricultural press, the country road, and the 
country school. Her book deals especially with the present status of 
these rural agencies and makes suggestions concerning their possi- 
bilities. Under the country school she treats the school as an agency 
in the solution of the farm problem, the consolidated school, the work 
of the teacher and country school supervision. The book contains 
much information of interest and many valuable suggestions. 
“The Country School,” by Homer H. Seerley, president of the © 
Iowa State Teachers’ College, has recently appeared. The scope of 
the book may be seen from the following topics which are included: 
The country community, the country school, country life, what educa- 
tion can do, the organization of the school,-the organization of a 
country community, the program, school management, the recita- 
tion, supervision, the place of recreation, taxation and the State, co- 
operation, the proper unit in school organization, standardization, 
the teacher supply conditions, and prospects. 
Miss Jessie Field, formerly county superintendent of Page County, 
Iowa, has published a book entitled “ The Corn Lady,” which gives  
-P-A-G-E-235
RURAL EDUCATION. 209 
the story of a successful country teacher’s work in a series of letters 
written to her father. 
Prof. E. P. Cubberley, of Leland Stanford Junior University, is 
the author of a little book entitled “ The Improvement of Rural 
Schools.” This is one of the Riverside educational monographs 
edited by Henry Suzzallo, of Teachers’ College, Columbia Univer- 
sity. In this book Mr. Cubberley discusses the rural-school problem, 
the need of better support, of better organization, and of better 
supervision. 
“The Farm Boys and Girls” is the title of a new book in the rural 
science series edited by L. H. Bailey. This book was written by 
W. A. McKeever, professor of philosophy at the Kansas State Agri- 
cultural College. In it he discusses the various agencies entering into 
the life of the farm boy and girl. Among these is included a chapter 
on the rural school, what schooling the country boy should have and 
what schooling the country girl should have. The entire book may 
be said, however, to be a book on rural education as the various 
agencies discussed are all viewed from the standpoint of their in- 
fluence on the development of the mind and the heart and the body of 
the boy and girl. 
Mr. C. Walter Fiske, in his book which has recently appeared, en- 
titled “The Challenge of the Country,” discusses education for 
country life among other topics relating to the rural problem. 
The 1912 Yearbook of the National Society for the Study of Edu- 
cation is devoted to the question of school supervision, Part I to 
urban supervision, and Part IT to rural Sa The second

  210 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
Included in the literature on rural education issued by State de- 
‘partments of education and by educational institutions during the 
past year have been a number of valuable bulletins on consolidation 
or centralization of rural schools and transportation of pupils at 
public expense. Some of the most important of these bulletins that 
‘have come to the bureau are as follows: 
The state department of North Carolina has issued a publication 
prepared by L. C. Brogden, State supervisor of rural schools, which 
discusses in a very complete way the efficiency and economy of the 
one-teacher system of rural schools and of the consolidated system. 
The bulletin contains the results of a study made in 21 counties in 
North Carolina, including the number of white rural schools with 
one teacher, the enrollment, length of the annual session, cost per 
pupil, the length of the recitation periods, the number of recitations 
per day, and the amount of time during the year which the county 
superintendent spent inthe school. It contains also the results of a 
study of consolidation in the country as a whole and of several 
typical consolidated schools in Virginia and elsewhere. 
A bulletin prepared by F. B. Frazier, State supervisor of rural 
schools of. Tennessee, gives the results of a study made in Tennessee 
by Mr. Frazier similar to that made in North Carolina by Mr. Brog- 
den. This bulletin also describes several consolidated schools in 
various parts of the country. 
Teachers College, Columbia University, has issued during the 
year a valuable publication giving the results of a study into two 
types of rural schools by Ernest Burnham, director of the rural 
school department of the State normal school at Kalamazoo, Mich. 
Mr. Burnham has made a study of the economic and social conditions 
of a township with the district school system and a township with a 
consolidated system.

PROGRESS IN SEVERAL STATES. 
The following notes on the progress in various States were pre- 
pared from reports made by some of the special collaborators of the 
bureau. : 
Alabama.—A State supervisor of rural schools was appointed early 
in 1911. Two county rural supervisors, one in Marshall and one in 
Calhoun County, began work in September, 1911. They are expected 
to devote their entire time to supervision and are under the direction 
of the county superintendents. Their duties and those of similar 
supervisors in other Southern States who are beginning work this 
year are described more fully on page 192. Rural industrial super- 
visors for negro schools, paid from the Jeanes fund, are now em- 
ployed in 17 counties. Further information regarding their work is 
given on page 193. 
The new county-institute law, passed by the legislature in 1910, 
designed to improve the teachers in service, has gone into effect. 
Attendance on the part of every teacher in the State is compulsory. 
They must be present at an institute lasting one week or their cer- 
tificates may be revoked. The institutes were held during the sum- 
mer months, and it is the intention to continue to hold them at that 
time. Each county institute was in charge of the county superin- 
tendent. Two instructors, one of whom was a primary. teacher, were 
assigned to each by the State department of education. The institute 
conductors were assembled in June at the capital of the State by 
the department of education and instructed regarding their duties. 
Tn some instances two and three counties united in holding an in- 
stitute. The teachers paid from 50 cents to $1 in fees. The money 
was used to pay local expenses and in part for the instructors. The 
balance required for the instructors was paid by the State department. 
Another law passed by the 1910 legislature, providing State aid 
for school libraries, is now in operation. Under those provisions 
451 school libraries have already been established. The law pro- 
 
-P-A-G-E-239
  RURAL EDUCATION. 213 
e 
vides that the school district, the county, and the State shall each 
contribute $10. “The district and the county may contribute more, 
and in several instances have done so. The money raised is ex- 
pended for books, which must be taken from a list prepared by the 
State department of education. Only “rural towns and village 
schools ” may participate in this State fund, and it is not available 
“to any school located in a town or city of more than 1,000 popula- 
tion.” The books are not for the use of the pupils only, but are also 
for the use of the entire community. 
Colorado—Interest in the rural-school problem is evidenced by 
the establishment of a special course for rural teachers in the State 
Teachers’ College at Greeley and a department of rural schools in 
the State Agricultural College at Fort Collins. Both of these in- 
stitutions are now attempting to give a training fitting primarily 
for the school in the open country. A marked activity in consoli- 
dating rural schools has been shown and several new consolidated 
schools have been built. 
Connecticut.—About 900 schools, located in 91 townships, are 
under the direct supervision of the State board of education. Ap- 
proximately 500 of these are one-room schools. During the past 
year model one-room schools have been established in many town- 
ships. It is the intention of the State department to have one in 
every township. These model schools are to afford observation of 
good procedure to the other teachers, particularly to the untrained 
and the beginning teachers. In all townships under the State super- 
vision teachers are required to visit schools designated by the local 
supervisors. Difficulty has been experienced in finding schools of 
observation which were wholly satisfactory. The State department 
decided, therefore, to select certain schools and make them as nearly 
ideal as possible and send the teachers to visit them. The buildings 
in which the model schools are held are all one-teacher buildings. 
They are typical of the one-teacher country school, but are sanitary, 
properly heated, ventilated, and lighted, and are equipped with such 
facilities for teaching as are possible in every country school. A 
good teacher has been placed in charge of each school. The visiting 
teacher has an opportunity, therefore, to see a properly built and 
well-arranged school building and good equipment as well as good 
teaching. 
Georgia.—The rural schools have been making a steady gain dur- 
ing the year. The impetus given them by the boys’ and girls’ agri- 
cultural club work is particularly noticeable. Rural industrial super- 
visors for the schools for white children have been put in 10 or 12 
counties. This has been made possible through the generosity of Mr. 
N. O. Nelson, of New Orleans and St. Louis. County supervisors
-P-A-G-E-240

(see p. 193). have been engaged in 8 counties. The school fair move- 
ment has spread rapidly throughout the State, and exhibits have been 
shown consisting largely of the products of the corn, garden, canning, 
and sewing clubs. Three elementary school inspectors were created by 
the legislature two years ago. These inspectors work under the guid- 
ance and direction of the State school superintendent. Each has 
charge of a particular section of the State, and gives stimulation and 
instruction to school officials, to teachers in their institutes, and to the 
people in public addresses. The results of their work are now begin- 
ning to appear. Twenty-nine counties of the State have adopted 
county local-tax school systems, and many school districts within 
the counties have voted an additional tax upon themselves in support 
of the schools. 
A new normal school at Valdosta, which will devote itself almost 
wholly to preparing teachers for rural schools, is under construction, 
and will open for students about the 1st of January, 1918. Mr. R. H. 
Powell, formerly State supervisor of rural schools, has been elected 
president. 
A department of rural economics and sociology has been established 
by the board of trustees of the State Normal School at Athens, and 
Mr. E. C. Branson, formerly president of the institution, has been 
made head of the department. The department will continue the 
work begun by Mr. Branson several years ago in his classes in rural 
sociology and in “The Georgia Club,” organized for the study of 
rural sociology. The courses offered by the department will be much 
more complete than it was possible to offer before. 
Indiana.—An industrial commission appointed two years ago by 
the governor to investigate industrial conditions and needs is ex- 
tending its study to cover rural life and education. The principal 
progress of the year has been in improved buildings, equipment, and 
sanitary arrangements and in the methods of supervision. Several 
counties now employ special supervisors for their rural schools, 
whose business it is to look after the specific work in the course of 
study and to advise and direct the teachers. The department of 
agriculture of Purdue University has begun a State-wide campaign 
in the organization of corn clubs for boys, tomato-raising and can- 
ning clubs for the girls, and potato clubs for both boys and girls. 
Eight counties are already organized. It is expected that before the 
close of the year the work will be inaugurated in every county. 
Kentucky.—By an act of the legislature passed in June, 1912, 
rural supervisors have been appointed in many counties. About 70 
are already engaged. Further information relative to these 
supervisors and their work and the law which authorized their 
appointment is given on page 206. The State normal schools are 
establishing courses of study to fit supervisors for these positions.    
-P-A-G-E-241
  
RURAL EDUCATION. 215 
The rural school supervisor of the State has prepared and pub- 
lished for use in the schools a course of study which is complete and 
practical. It will do much toward standardizing the rural work. 
The high-school supervisor has prepared a manual and course of 
study for use of high schools. This contains outlines for work, equip- 
ment, and laboratory teaching, and much other information of value. 
It will probably do for high schools what the other course of study 
will do for elementary schools. 
The School Improvement League of the State has established 
county school improvement leagues in approximately one-half of 
the counties. The work of the various leagues is beginning to show 
in increased cleanliness, better sanitation, and improved ornamenta- 
tion. 
The growth of the boys’ corn clubs and girls’ domestic-science 
instruction has been phenomenal. School fairs were held the past 
fall all over the State. Products raised by the boys and specimens of 
cooking, preserving, baking, and sewing done by the girls were on 
exhibition. The school fairs were made educational rallies and 
were attended by parents and other adults in large numbers. A part 
of the program at each fair includes addresses to: the people upon 
general questions relating to improved educational facilities. Prof. 
Fred Mutchler, of the State Normal School at Bowling Green, was 
appointed State agent in charge of the boys’ and girls’ agricultural 
work. 
The State department of education has published a bulletin upon 
school buildings, devoting much attention to the rural school. It is 
hoped through this to disseminate information which will help to 
house the country schools in buildings properly suited to school 
purposes. Model rural schools, called “ demonstration schools,” have 
been established by the State supervisor of rural schools. Informa- 
tion concerning them is given on page 191. 
A movement for the eradication of illiteracy in the State was 
inaugurated by Mrs. Cora Wilson Stewart, county superintendent 
of Rowan County, two years ago. Night schools for adults were 
held in almost every rural school in the county. Eagerness and 
enthusiasm were manifested by persons of all ages and classes. They 
became known as “ moonlight schools,” as sessions were held on the 
moonlight nights of the autumn months in order that the people 
might find their way over the rugged roads to the schoolhouses. The 
regular teachers contributed their services and taught the evening 
classes. They entered into the spirit of the enterprise very heartily 
and not only gave volunteer service in teaching, but campaigned 
their districts prior to the opening of the schools to explain the 
purposes of the movement and to invite attendance. In 45 schools 
there were no classes smaller than 10, and some were as large as 50. 
77236°—xp 1912—von 1——16
-P-A-G-E-242
  216 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
Not only young men and women, but fathers and mothers and 
grandfathers and grandmothers were in attendance. Current events 
were correlated with reading, the reading test being a little news- 
paper prepared by the county superintendent especially for begin- 
ners. This saved the adults the humiliation of using a primer and 
gave them something of interest for the reading lesson. Classes in 
all the elementary subjects were established, reading, writing, com- 
position, arithmetic, history, and geography proving most popular. 
Bible study was one of the most attractive subjects, especially to the 
old men and women who had passed their fifties and even sixties. 
It is worthy of note that these people, upon learning to read, turned 
first to the Bible to practice their new-found art. Some of the 
adults, after but two weeks’-practice, learned to write a legible letter. 
The result of the session of the first year proved far greater than 
had been anticipated. The schools were again opened in the fall of 
1912, and 1,600 pupils, mostly adults, were in attendance. The 
movement has spread to several other counties. 
A second State supervisor of rural schools was appointed during 
the year, who is to devote his attention to the schools for negroes. 
The establishment of this position and the work of the supervisor 
have resulted in increased activity among the negro schools. The 
colored women’s clubs of the State have taken up the subject of rural 
education and have assisted in establishing 14 “ parents’ leagues.” 
Many new buildings have been constructed and demonstration schools 
have been established in every county in the State where there is a 
sufficient colored population to justify their establishment. 
Maine.—A campaign for the improvement of rural schools has been 
inaugurated by Hon. Payson Smith, State superintendent of public 
schools. He is urging the school superintendents throughout the 
State to place before the citizens of their own towns a definite state- 
ment of the needs of the schools and a plan for meeting them. 
Granges and other organizations interested in rural life have been 
urged to give special emphasis during the year to a discussion of 
rural education. The State superintendent asks that public sentiment 
be aroused and a sense of public responsibility created especially on 
the following points: 
(a) Better qualified and better paid teaching force. 
(6) Better buildings, especially in regard to heating, ventilation, 
and sanitary surroundings, 
(ce) Larger school grounds. 
(d) Better equipment of books, material, and apparatus. 
(e) More careful supervision. 
(f) Better organized course of study. 
(g) More sympathetic support and interest from the community. 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
RURAL EDUCATION. Q17 
The movement has resulted in a State-wide discussion of the rural 
school which has already resulted in marked improvement. 
Massachusetts —Interest in the rural school problem is evinced 
by the State normal schools, which are developing their facilities for 
training teachers, especially for rural-school service. The Lowell 
Normal School has added to its training department rural schools in 
which its students may observe and practice under almost ideal con- 
ditions. Salem, North Adams, and Hyannis are also increasing their 
facilities for fitting rural teachers. 
There is a widespread movement throughout the State for an ex- 
tension of the activities of the schools through social gatherings, 
lecture courses, and night schools. School-improvement associations 
have been formed in many towns. Granges, women’s clubs, and other 
organizations are manifesting a great interest in rural-school im- 
provement and in the improvement of rural living conditions. 
Michigan.—Under provisions of the recent act of the legislature 
permitting the adoption of the township as a unit of organization for 
the management of school affairs in the southern peninsula, four 
townships (to April, 1912) have given up their district system and 
adopted the township unit. The northern peninsula has been organ- 
ized on the township basis for several years. 
Mississippi.cRecent progress in rural education has taken place 
along several lines. The interest in the proper distribution of school 
buildings has been very marked. A movement to consolidate many 
of the one-teacher schools and the transportation of their pupils at 
public expense is well underway. This has been due largely to the 
efforts of the State supervisor of rural schools. The legislature has 
authorized the expenditure of public money for the transportation of. 
pupils living two miles or more from a consolidated school. In Har- 
rison County, 16 schools have been consolidated into 7, with 6 trans- 
portation wagons. Covington County has now 4 schools taking 
care of the children that formerly attended 15. Experiments in con- 
solidation were made in 1911 in Claiborne, Lauderdale, Wayne, Al- 
corn, Madison, Holmes, and Leake Counties. The law was found to 
be inadequate for the best development of the schools. The legisla- 
ture in 1912 passed an act providing for a tax levy in the district of 
a consolidated school and giving the consolidated schools all the 
privileges of separate school districts. This will make rapid devel- 
opment possible. 
The consolidation of schools has been a potent factor in the move- 
ment for good roads. The State has recently issued $5,000,000 in 
bonds for the purpose of assisting in road building. Counties in 
which good roads are to be built with the assistance of the State are
-P-A-G-E-244
  218 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
raising from $100,000 to $400,000 each. With the good roads which 
will result in the next few years, the number of consolidated schools 
will greatly increase. 
The annual sum of $25,000 has been added to the State appropria- 
tion in support of county agricultural high schools. There are now 
27 of these schools. They are in reality more than the name implies; 
they are county high schools, with agriculture and household science 
as the chief vocational elements in the course of study. Their work 
is yet in an unformed state, but they are becoming schools for 
country life, taking leadership in making country homes more at- 
tractive, in making farming more attractive, and in developing an 
efficient education. 
A State normal school was opened in September, 1912, at Hatties- 
burg. The school has large and suitable buildings, costing $260,000, 
and 110 acres of land donated by the city of Hattiesburg. It will 
devote its energies to preparing teachers especially for rural schools. 
The school improvement association movement has grown rapidly 
in the past year. ‘The State department’ in addition to a supervisor 
of rural schools has a State organizer of school improvement asso- 
ciations. About 60 counties have now county associations and local 
associations. The State organizer has issued bulletins suggesting to 
the‘country teachers how local organizations may be formed, and 
giving directions for holding general meetings. Several special-day 
programs have been arranged, namely: Clean-up and beautify day, 
in October; health day, in November; library day, in December; 
arbor day, in January; club day, in February; field day, in March. 
The State organizer is known officially as the supervisor of school 
improvement. This officer has charge of the girls’ tomato clubs, as 
well as of the school improvement work. 
A: State supervisor of corn clubs has succeeded in establishing 
clubs in all parts of the State. Corn raised by these boys has been 
exhibited at the county and State fairs. As the club work is done 
through the school, it has created a stimulus to progress in all the 
school work. The average yield of corn in the State has increased 
in two years from 144 bushels to 19 bushels per acre. It seems evi- 
dent that the boys’ corn clubs have figured to some extent in this 
increase, as several of their members have produced over 200 bushels 
to the acre and few less than 100. 
Another important work of the State closely related to the rural- 
school problem is the State-wide health campaign, which has made 
significant advance during the year. This has been carried on by 
the State health department. Information has been disseminated on 
the principles of sanitation, and particularly as to the sources and 
prevention of tuberculosis and hookworm disease. Much of this
-P-A-G-E-245

work has been done through the schoo], and the school-improvemeat 
associations have furnished a definite crganization through which 
the sanitary officials could act. 
Missouri—A wider interest in rural education and rural life has 
resulted from several causes. Among these has been a survey made 
of the three counties in the northern part of the State by the rural- 
school department of the Kirksville Normal School in conjunction 
with the country-church and country-life department of the Presby- 
terian Board of Home Missions. The interest has been manifested 
by holding rural-life confernces, and a recommendation passed by 
the Missouri State Teachers’ Association for a State rural-life com- 
mission to be established by legal enactment. 
Several acts of the legislature of 1910 are now bearing fruit. 
State aid is distributed partly upon the number of teachers em- 
ployed and partly upon the aggregate attendance. This has resulted 
in more teachers, better average daily attendance, and longer annual 
session. A sliding scale for teachers’ certificates has been provided, 
under which no one will be permitted to teach in the schools of the 
State after 1918 who has not completed a full four-year high-school 
course or its equivalent. Transportation of children at public ex- 
pense has been authorized, and the movement for consolidation of . 
schools has thereby received impetus. The compulsory attendance 
laws were strengthened, increasing the school enrollment, particularly 
in the rural schools. 
The State department of education has now a rural-school in- 
spector, who is very actively engaged in assisting the 114 county 
superintendents in their work. A bill now before the legislature 
provides for the appointment of five assistant State inspectors. The 
State university has established a department of rural education. 
The normal schools offer special course for the preparation of rural 
teachers, containing subjects of especial value to the teacher in the 
country school. Summer schools for teachers have been held by all 
the State educational institutions and by several private colleges. 
During the past year 7,000 teachers have attended these schools. 
Boys’ and girls’ agricultural courses and girls’ household economics 
clubs have spread rapidly throughout the State and are doing much 
to vitalize the work of the rural schools. 
North Carolina.—Assistant county superintendents have been ap- 
pointed in several counties. Well-trained and well-qualified women 
have been selected as a rule. The law makes no direct provision for 
such supervision, but it is probable that the legislature will be asked 
to authorize it at the next session. 
All State educational institutions held summer schools for teacher 
training during the past summer. This was in accordance with the 
provision of the act of the legislature passed at the recent session.
-P-A-G-E-246
220 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
Fully 1,000 teachers availed themselves of the opportunity for sum- 
mer training. Increased interest and special emphasis have been 
placed upon the teachers’ institutes held biennially in the several 
counties of the State. They have been made more effective and 
definite by the action of the State superintendent of public instruc- 
tion, who called the corps of institute instructors together before 
they began their duties and gave them definite and specific instruc- 
tions as to what was expected of them during their two weeks’ work 
with the teachers. 
Craven County has taken advantage of a provision of the school 
law passed by the legislature of 1911 permitting the organization of 
a county farm-life school. A principal has been selected and the 
school will open its doors next year. A special committee, including 
the State superintendent, the county superintendent, and members 
of the county board of education, visited several agricultural schools 
in various States for the purpose of getting information concerning 
the possibility of a farm-life school. It is desired to establish in 
the county a school which will serve all classes. 
As a result of the deliberations of several educational meetings held 
in the State, the legislature of 1913 will be asked to make several 
amendments and additions to the present school law. Those concern- 
ing primarily the rural schools are: First, a uniform system of exam- 
ination for the certification of teachers of the State, requiring as a 
minimum qualification graduation from a four-year high school or 
its equivalent; second, increasing the minimum term from four to 
six months; third, in order that funds may be available for this pur- 
pose, a special tax of 5 cents on each $100 worth of property. 
South Carolina.—An. experimental school has been established in 
connection with the Winthrop Normal and Industrial College at 
Rock Hill, under the direction of the normal school and the State 
supervisor of rural schools. The school is attempting to develop 
a program of studies which may be used in the ordinary country 
school by a teacher of average ability, training, and experience. A 
building on one corner of the Winthrop College campus, separated by 
a grove from the other college buildings, was slightly remodeled and 
utilized for the school. The building contains a schoolroom, a 
kitchen, and a shop. The schoolroom is supplied with a large table 
about which the children may sit for study and recitations, a book- 
case with more than 100 books adapted to the primary grades, and 
a plentiful supply of blackboard. The kitchen is furnished with a 
good range and cooking utensils. The shop is supplied with three 
workbenches and with simple carpenter tools. Running the entire 
length of the school building is a broad piazza. This piazza is sup- 
plied with a large table and chairs and with a blackboard, and much 
of the school work is done on it. A school garden of three-quarters
-P-A-G-E-247
  
RURAL EDUCATION. 221 
of an acre adjoins the school building and the school is supplied with 
enough hoes, rakes, and other garden tools to allow all the children 
to work at one time. The yard surrounding the building is filled 
with fruit trees and blooming shrubs. 
The object of the experiment is to develop a course of study based 
on rural activities. The usual conventional work of the ordinary 
school is pushed into the background and in a certain way becomes 
incidental to the activities of the kitchen, garden, and shop. The 
conventional work is based upon or grouped about these activities. 
Some work has to be done in books, but as far as possible this is 
connected closely with the kitchen, garden, and shop activities of 
the child. The children work in groups; an older pupil works with 
several younger ones. He not only does his work in such a way that 
the younger ones use it as a model, but he helps them to do theirs. In 
this way he gets a double benefit from the lesson. All of the pupils 
are engaged in the same line of work—boys and girls, from the 
youngest to the oldest. The older pupils go into more elaborate 
detail than the younger ones. One illustration will serve to make 
the plan a little clearer. To each child is assigned a plat in the 
garden, and he is taught how to prepare the seed bed, to fertilize 
the soil, and to plant the seed. In laying out the plat he is taught 
how to use the foot and yard measure and to make simple measure- 
ments. Each child draws a plan of his garden. The youngest ones 
draw simple rectangles, the older ones draw to a scale, and the oldest 
draw to a scale and in addition indicate the dimensions and directions 
on their plans. 
Among other things, the potato is planted. Before planting the 
children gather around the table to study the potato. One is given to 
each child. They describe the potato and as they do so the words 
developed are written on the blackboard. These later in the day 
form the basis for a language lesson and a spelling lesson. They all 
make a drawing of the potato. The youngest pupils model it in clay. 
They discuss together how the ground was prepared for planting and 
how the potato should be planted. They then plant their seed. Each 
child keeps a notebook in which he describes as far as he is able what 
he has done. The older pupils and the more advanced are, of course, 
expected to have notebooks much more complete than the younger 
pupils. The more advanced pupils learn something of the history 
and uses of the potato from books. All the pupils, boys and girls, 
learn how to cook the potato, and as a part of the same lesson on 
potatoes they go to the kitchen and actually cook.them. They are 
cooked in several different ways by different pupils. When cooked 
the pupils eat them as a part of their lunch. At lunch they discuss, 
under the guidance of the teacher, the various uses of the potato.
-P-A-G-E-248
222 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
The potato becomes the basis for the work in reading, composition, 
language, and spelling while it is studied. The activities of the pupils 
in cultivating and harvesting their potatoes form a subject for part 
of the reading and composition work during the entire season. 
Tennessee.—Special activity has occurred during the past year in 
the consolidation of weak, inefficient schools into centralized graded 
schools. Thirty-seven county superintendents report the abandon- 
ment of 149 old schools and the establishment of 65 consolidated 
ones: The average cost of the new buildings was $2,023. The 65 
schools contain approximately 200 rooms and serve an area on the 
average of 14 square miles each. They all have at least eight years’ 
work. An increase in the enrollment of 2,339 is noted over the en- 
rollment in the old schools. 2 
The State department of education has issued a bulletin on con- 
solidation of schools and transportation of pupils. This has greatly 
increased the interest in this movement, and within the next year 
many new consolidated schools will be established. 
Four counties in Tennessee have in the past year employed county 
school supervisors to assist the county superintendent in supervising 
the rural schools. The question of such officers is under consideration 
in several other counties, and it is expected that other supervisors 
will be employed before the close of the year. 
The efficiency of the persons obtained for county superintendents 
has been greatly improved by the results of an act passed by the 
last legislature providing that county superintendents should receive 
a portion of their salaries from the State, the maximum amount 
paid by the State to a county being $350. During the past year 
nearly $30,000 has been added to the salaries of the county superin- 
tendents by the State. 
Two years ago the State began to assist local communities in es- 
tablishing rural-school libraries by paying one-half as much as was 
raised by the community up to $40. In this way 1,140 school libraries 
have been established. In these there are approximately 100,000 vol- 
umes. School improvement associations have been organized in . 
practically every county in the State. Boys’ corn clubs and girls’ 
tomato clubs have been organized in 20 counties. 
The State superintendent has inaugurated a campaign against illit- 
eracy which is attracting considerable attention and is doing much 
good wherever county authorities engage earnestly in the work. The 
plan includes night schools in schoolhouses, churches, and elsewhere, 
taught by school-teachers, ministers, and any other competent per- 
sons who volunteer their services. :

themselves more fully for their work. Of the 8,500 teachers em- 
ployed, 2,400 were enrolled in summer schools the past summer. On 
account of the comparatively large salaries paid in the rural and 
semirural schools, the State draws a great many teachers from eastern 
States, including a large number of college and normal-school grad- 
uates. 
In some districts of the State cottages have been built in the past 
for the teachers. It is proposed to ask the legislature to enact a law 
authorizing school authorities to erect such cottages whenever they 
see fit. The attorney general has recently given opinion that the 
school boards have no such authority at the present time. 
About one-third of the counties of the State maintain circulating 
libraries, which send out books to all the schools within their juris- 
diction. 
The Bellingham, Ellensburg, and Cheney State Normal Schools 
all have model rural schools for observation and training. These 
schools are used for demonstration purposes for the people of the 
county, as well as for training schools. The Cheney Normal School 
has model schools in Lincoln, Adams, Stevens, and Pend Oreille 
Counties. They are used by the county superintendents as demonstra- 
tion schools for the other teachers to visit and as an experimental 
school for the county superintendent. They are under the direction 
and supervision of the rural school department of the normal school. 
In each of them last year a lecture course was maintained. These 
courses were self-supporting and were given to illustrate what can 
be done in any community without outside help. Regular social 
gatherings, literary entertainments, plays, ete., were held to demon- 
strate what the rural school may do for the social life of its patrons. 
A National Country Life Congress was held at Spokane in Novem- 
ber, 1911. This congress convened for a week, and each day special 
programs on different phases of farm life were given. A model 
country school, with all modern furnishing and equipment, was 
exhibited, and on country school day the teacher and pupils from 
the model rural school at the Cheney State Normal were there, and 
school was conducted as in its own building. Considerable interest 
was created in rural education by this means. 
West Virginia—Within the past year 12 rural high schools have 
been established in the State. Most of them began with a two-year 
course, but all are extending their work when their students are ready 
for more advanced courses. There are now 125 high schools in the 
State, of which 75 are rural. A new course of study for the high 
schools has been provided by the State board of education, as re- 
quired by law. It includes a course of agriculture covering from one 
to four years.  
-P-A-G-E-250
  224 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
In 1911 a law was passed by the legislature directing the State 
department to class the high schools of the State for the purpose of 
distributing the State funds. The benefits resulting from this law 
have exceeded expectations and have more than justified the ex- 
penditure of the money appropriated. First, it has put into effect a 
definition for the term “high school” for the State. Before the 
enactment of the law there were schools in the State known locally 
as high schools, but in which no work of high-school grade was done. 
Second, it has aided in the establishment and development of new 
high schools. Third, it has created a desire on the part of the au- 
thorities and communities for improvement in their high schools, 
in order that they might be ranked as high as possible. Fourth, it 
has resulted in the employment of additional teachers and has estab- 
lished a uniform standard of scholastic training for high-school 
teachers. Fifth, it has induced many high-school teachers to prepare 
themselves more thoroughly for their work. Sixth, it has raised the 
standard of compensation for high-school teachers. Seventh, it has 
resulted in the expenditure of $43,921 within the year for apparatus 
and other high-school equipment. 
The act requires that high schools be divided into three classes, 
depending upon the number of years’ work, the number of properly 
qualified teachers employed, and the number of weeks in which the 
school is in session during the year. To the high schools in the first 
class $800 is provided from the State funds; to those in the second 
class, $600; to those in the third class, $400. 
The most effective movement in the State for the improvement of 
the rural schools is that for district supervision. The number of 
district superintendents in 1912 increased from 36 to 58. Now 17 
per cent of the rural districts have district supervisors, and 30 per 
cent of the rural teachers of the State are under their supervision. 
These superintendents are doing a very important work. In 1911-12 
the attendance in the districts under the 36 superintendents then 
engaged was greater by 14 per cent than the attendance in the State 
as a whole. One superintendent was able in a single year to bring 
up the average daily attendance from 73 per cent to 94 per cent. By 
personal supervision of the schools, by monthly or bimonthly teach- 
ers’ meetings, and by private consultation with the teachers they have 
improved very greatly the quality of the work of the schools. 
Beginning in 1911 the State department of education at- 
tempted to standardize both the rural school buildings and the school] 
by means of score cards. The State department furnishes the cards, 
The county superintendents inspect the buildings and schools an 
indicate on the score cards their estimation of the schools. Th 
score includes 100 points. The greatest possible number of poin 
      
   
     
     
             
   
   
-P-A-G-E-251

that may be awarded on each of the various parts of the school are 
as follows: Ground, 15 points; the building, 10; light and ventila- 
tion, 8; decorations, 8; water supply, 10; equipment, 22; the teacher, 
27. Each one of these topics is subdivided into from 3 to 12 sub- 
topics, the maximum number of points assignable to each being indi- 
cated on the card. 
A revised course of study has just been prepared by the board of 
education, with the assistance and advice of a special committee of 
five of the leading educators of the State. The boys’ and girls’ corn 
club work has spread rapidly within the year. There are about 
6,000 now enrolled. This work will be assisted to some extent by 
the appointment of the county farm demonstration agents, who are 
already engaged in six counties. 
The State normal school at Fairmont has just established a model 
rural school for observation purposes. The building is an ordinary 
country school, 1 mile from the car line and 4 miles from the normal 
school. It has been repaired, remodeled, and made modern in every 
way. A competent teacher is in charge of it. The students of the 
normal school preparing for rural work will be required to visit it 
for observation purposes. The Glenville and Shepherdstown Nor- 
mal Schools are offering courses in rural sociology. 
Wisconsin.—The annual school board conventions required by law 
to be held each year by the county superintendents since 1904 have 
devoted their attention the past two years principally to a study of 
the general rural-school situation. As a result great interest has 
been aroused in rural-school improvement, and particularly in the 
relation of the home to the school and the method of interesting 
the people in education. A committee, known as the committee of 
fifteen, has been at work during the year studying Wisconsin educa- 
tional conditions. Their report is reviewed elsewhere in this chap- 
ter. A State board of public affairs, created by the legislature of 
1910, has been investigating the condition of the rural schools of the 
State. They have had the expert assistance of the Bureau of Munic- 
ipal Research of New York City. Mention of their report is also 
made elsewhere in this chapter. 
During the year two new county training schools have been estab- 
lished, making 27 in all. The new schools are located in Outagamie 
and Taylor Counties. A training department for rural teachers has 
been added to the Stevens Point Normal School, so that there are 
now departments for country-school teachers in five State normal 
schools, namely, La Crosse, Oshkosh, River Falls, Stevens Point, and 
Whitewater.

  CHAPTER VI. 
ROMAN CATHOLIC SCHOOLS. 
By Herpert F. WRicHT, 
Instructor, Catholic University of America. 
The following report of the schools maintained by the Roman 
Catholic Church in the United States has been compiled from 
authoritative Catholic publications, principally from those of the 
Catholic Educational Association and from the Official Directory, 
published by P. J. Kenedy & Sons, of New York. This bureau has 
made no attempt during the year to collect first-hand data on paro- 
chial schools of any denomination, except as they are included in the 
general statistics on private schools which are reported by the State 
departments of education. The bureau does collect annually from 
the Catholic colleges data which are published in the chapter on uni- 
_versities and colleges in the United States in the second volume of 
the annual report. Bulletin, 1912, No. 22, “ Public and Private High 
Schools,” contains under the heading of private high schools and 
academies a list of such institutions, with data regarding the number 
of years in their courses, the number of teachers, the enrollment, ete. 
The Catholic high schools and academies, as far as they reported to 
the bureau, are included in this list. 
The figures in the Official Directory are furnished by the diocesan 
authorities to the publishers. In a few instances the figures of enroll- 
ment are identical for 1911 and 1912, indicating that data for 1912 
were not obtained; and the 1911 figures were used. In some other 
cases the figures would appear to be estimated rather than reported 
from actual records. The estimates are undoubtedly close; so that 
the totals are probably as nearly accurate as they can be made. 
It was not found possible in this chapter to report the data by 
States. The unit of organization of the Catholic parochial school 
system is the diocese. While in most instances the diocese is a State 
or a part of a State, in several cases the diocese lies partly in each of 
two adjoining States. 
The highest, authority within the diocese in school affairs as in all 
ecclesiastical affairs is the bishop. Therefore, in order that the sys- 
tem of administration of the parochial schools may be understood, 
227 
   
-P-A-G-E-254
228 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
it is necessary to include here a brief statement of the organization 
for the management of all the affairs of the church. 
The administration of the affairs of the Catholic Church in the 
United States is apportioned among 14 well-defined districts called 
“ provinces.” The province usually comprises a State or several 
States. In a few instances a State lies in two different provinces. 
For instance, the province of Milwaukee includes the entire State of 
Wisconsin and the northern part of the State of Michigan. Part 
of Florida is in the Baltimore province, the rest in the province of 
New Orleans. The provinces are presided over by archbishops, who 
in three instances are cardinals as well. The province takes its name 
usually from the city in which the residence of the presiding officer is 
located. The States included in the several provinces are given in 
Table 2 (pp. 239-241). 
The province is divided into several districts, called dioceses, each 
presided over by a bishop. For instance, the province of Chicago 
contains five dioceses—Alton, Belleville, Chicago, Peoria, and Rock- 
ford. The 14 provinces include 99 dioceses. They are indicated 
also in Table 2. The archbishop is the bishop of one diocese in his 
province, as well as the presiding officer in meetings of the bishops of 
the province. His diocese is called the archdiocese of that province. 
The diocese, as well as the province, takes its name from the city in 
which its presiding officer resides, although its extent is by no means 
confined to the city’s limits.1 For example, the diocese of Salt Lake 
includes not only Salt Lake City, but also the entire State of Utah 
and the eastern part of the State of Nevada. One exception to the 
statements regarding the name of the province and diocese should be 
noted—the province of Oregon and the archdiocese of Oregon City. 
In this case the residence of the archbishop, which was formerly at 
Oregon City, has been changed to Portland. 
The diocese is again divided into districts, called parishes, in which 
there is a church and a resident pastor. 
SCHOOL ORGANIZATION. 
The development of the Catholic school system had its seed in the 
individual parish school. 
In the organization and administration of the parish school three elements 
of authority meet which are, practically speaking at least, sharply distinct—the 
diocese, the community, and the parish. Hach has authority over the school; 
but, following the law of the division of labor, the rdle of each has gradually 
so shaped itself as to be confined chiefly to a special sphere. The diocesan 
authority, in the first place, exercises a general supervision over all the schools 
of the diocese comparable with that of the State superintendent over the 
public schools of the State; but besides this, the diocesan supervision extends| 
  
1See map in Cath. Encycl., XV, 178-179.
-P-A-G-E-255
  ROMAN CATHOLIC SCHOOLS. 229 
to individual schools also.° The immediate religious superior, again, controls 
the actual carrying on of the work of the school, much after the manner of the 
public-school principal, while the higher religious superiors, controlling, as they 
do, the teachers as well as the teaching in a large number of schools, possess 
a practical power over the school which is comparable in some respects with 
that of the diocesan authority. The parish priest, finally, is the ordinary and 
immediate representative of the diocese in the management of the school. He 
is by right the school principal, but he does not usually exercise this right, except 
to a limited extent. He carefully supervises the teaching of Christian doctrine, 
if he does not teach the class himself or have his assistant do so. The measure 
of actual school responsibility which the pastor has to bear is not small, how- 
ever, for upon his shoulders falls the full burden of providing for the material 
and moral support of the school.* 
DIOCESAN SCHOOL BOARDS. 
In every diocese, as has been said, the bishop is the head of the 
school system. As the work of the bishop increases with the multi- 
plication of churches and of schools, it has been the tendency in the 
various dioceses for the bishops to intrust in large measure the 
management of the school affairs to a diocesan school board or to 
several division boards appointed by the bishops. Fifty-eight 
- dioceses now have such boards. These dioceses are given in Table 1. 
The table contains the name of the governing board of educational 
affairs in each diocese, and in parentheses the number of members 
constituting the board. The dioceses are arranged alphabetically by 
provinces. The titles of these governing boards vary. In 46 dioceses 
they are called “school boards” or “ diocesan school boards”; in 5 
dioceses, “examiners of schools”; in 2 dioceses (Marquette and 
Superior), “school commissions”; in 2 dioceses (Portland and Fall 
River), “school visitors”; in 1 diocese (New Orleans), “Catholic 
board of education”; and in 1 diocese (Monterey-Los Angeles), “ in- 
spectors of diocesan schools.” The duties of these boards, however, 
are practically the same, namely, visiting and examining the pa- 
rochial schools of the diocese and exercising a general control and 
supervision over them and their work. 
In 11 dioceses (Baltimore, Richmond, Wheeling, Rockford, De- 
troit, Davenport, Omaha, Brooklyn, New York, Syracuse, and Tren- 
ton) the school boards have been divided, for convenience of man- 
agement, into two or more district boards. The division is made by 
counties in the dioceses of New York and Brooklyn, but in the other 
dioceses it follows no definite civil unit. In addition to the central 
governing board, 6 dioceses (Trenton, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Provi- 
dence, Detroit, and Omaha) have examiners of teachers; 1 diocese 
(Leavenworth), a diocesan high-school board; 1 diocese (Provi-   
1Burns: Growth and Development of the Catholic School System in the United States, 
1912, pp. 197, 198.

dence), examiners of schools. The governing board of the diocese of 
Nashville is called “examiners of teachers and diocesan school 
board.” In the diocese of Omaha the chairmen of six local boards 
are ex officio members of the diocesan school board. All the boards 
take their members from the priesthood, except the Catholic board 
of education of the archdiocese of New Orleans, which is composed 
of 11 priests and 5 laymen. In all, there are 100 school boards 
distributed among 58 dioceses, varying in membership from 2 to 25 
members. 
PROFESSIONAL SUPERVISION. 
The same table contains the names and titles of the professional 
supervising officers of diocesan schools, where such officers are em- 
ployed. There are 26 of these, distributed among 22 dioceses. The 
archdioceses of Philadelphia and New York and the dioceses of 
Buffalo and Springfield each employ an assistant supervising officer. 
The titles of the supervisors vary. In 5 dioceses they are called 
superintendents; in 7, superintendents of schools; in 3, superintend- 
ents of parochial schools; in 3, inspectors of schools; in 2, supervisors 
of schools; and in 2 others, diocesan school visitors and school exam- 
iners, respectively. Though their titles vary, their duties are prac- 
tically the same. They are priests trained in the principles and 
practices of education and experienced in school affairs. They devote 
practically their entire time to the duties of these positions, which do 
not differ materially from the duties of the supervisor in the public- 
school system. 
It will be noticed from the table that in 6 dioceses (Boston, Hart- 
ford, Springfield, Dallas, Erie, and Fargo) there are supervisors but 
no school boards, the supervisors working under the immediate di- 
rection of the bishop. In 16 dioceses the supervisors work in con- 
junction with school boards, in large measure as the executive officers 
of the boards. Annual reports are published by the superintendents 
of parochial schools of the archdioceses of Philadelphia, St. Louis, 
and New York, and by the superintendents of the dioceses of Pitts- 
burgh and Newark. 
This system of a central board of control and a professional super- 
intendent of instruction seems destined to be the norm of diocesan 
educational government, although 42 dioceses still have the simple 
school-board system and 35 dioceses are without any formal educa- 
tional organization. Most of the latter, however, either are newly 
formed, and therefore not completely organized, or are dioceses con- 
taining few parochial schools. As indicated in Table 2, the number 
of parochial schools in 29 of these dioceses is 50 or less; in 21 it is 
25 or less; and 9 of these dioceses have 10 parochial schools or less.

THE EXTENT OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
Table 2 gives data, by dioceses, indicating the number of Catholic 
‘schools and the number of children enrolled.. The figures are taken 
from the 1912 and 1913 Official Catholic Directories. They are the 
school data for the fall of 1911 and 1912, respectively. 
Column 1 gives the names of the 14 provinces; it also gives the | 
States included in each province. Column 2 gives alphabetically the 
dioceses in each province, the archdiocese being designated by an 
asterisk. Since 1911 no new provinces have been made, but a new 
diocese has been formed by the division of the diocese of Lincoln 
into the diocese of Lincoln and the diocese of Kearney, making a 
total of 99 dioceses in 1912, as against 98 for 1911. 
Seminaries—Columns 3 and 5 give the number of seminaries in 
the years 1911 and 1912, respectively; columns 4 and 6 the number 
of students attending the seminaries. The term “seminary” as 
used here is applied only to institutions whose sole purpose is to 
train young men for the priesthood. The length of the course of 
study pursued in these institutions is at least 6 years. It will be seen 
that there is an incerase of 2 in the total number of seminaries, new 
institutions having been established in the dioceses of Galveston and 
Altoona, making the total number 85. There are now two or more 
seminaries in each of 19 dioceses and one in each of 22, making 41 
dioceses which have seminaries. The number of students in these 
institutions has increased by 163, so that the total number is 6,169, 
the average attendance being 72 per institution. 
Colleges and academies.—Under the heading “ colleges and acad- 
emies” is given the number of such institutions for boys and for 
girls. Both standard colleges and institutions doing junior college 
and secondary school work are included. Parish high schools, how- 
ever, are not included. No data are given by the Official Directory 
to show the number of colleges and academies separately, nor the 
enrollment either separately or combined. Information concerning 
the colleges may be obtained, however, in the chapter on universities 
and colleges in Volume II of the Annual Report of the Commis- 
sioner of Education. Information concerning the academies may

be obtained from Bulletin, 1912, No. 22, Public and Private High 
Schools and Academies. It may be noted that there are colleges and 
academies for boys located in 77 dioceses and for girls in 95 dioceses. 
Parochial schools—Columns 11 and 13 contain the number of par- 
ishes maintaining parochial schools and the number of pupils attend- 
ing them, respectively, for the year 1911; columns 12 and 14 contain 
the corresponding figures for the year 1912. Under parochial schools 
are included all schools, either elementary or high, which are supported 
by the individual parishes of the various dioceses for the children 
of the parishes. The figures show an increase of 187 during the 
past year in the number of parishes maintaining schools and an 
increase of 26,975 in the number of pupils in these schools. 
Orphan asylums.—The number of orphan asylums and the number 
of inmates are included in the table, since practically all of them 
maintain schools for their inmates. Many of the children are below 
the ordinary school age, probably one-fourth or one-third of the total 
number, but the great majority are receiving instruction in regular 
school subjects. The table shows 289 asylums in 1911 with 47,111 
inmates, and 288 in 1912 with 47,415 inmates. There has been a 
decrease of 1 in the number of asylums, but an increase of 304 in the 
total number of orphans. The diocese of Oklahoma failed to report 
the number of orphans in 1911, but reports 40 in 1912. The increase 
is therefore somewhat less than 304, but is greater than 264. The 
diocese of Crookston, with 1 asylum in 1911 and 2 in 1912, has failed 
to report the number of orphans in both years. The totals show the 
average number of orphans in orphan asylums in 1911 to be 163 per 
asylum, while in 1912 it was over 164.4 per asylum, an increase of 
nearly 1.5 per asylum. 
Grand totals—Columns 19 and 20 contain the grand totals of chil- 
dren in or attending Catholic institutions. This includes not only the 
attendance of the parochial schools and orphan asylums, but also the 
attendance of the colleges and academies for boys and girls, for 
both of which no separate totals have been given. There are in 1912 
approximately 1,593,316 children in Catholic institutions, an increase 
of 53,267 over the figures for the previous year. 
SPECIAL SCHOOLS. 
Included in this grand total of children in Catholic institutions are 
those in special institutions for Indians, for negroes, and for the 
deaf, dumb, and blind. The total number of Indian schools is 80, 
of which 55 are boarding schools and 25 are day schools. They are 
located in 22 different dioceses. The total number of Indian children 
attending these schools is 4,765. 
There are several Catholic sisterhoods whose members devote them- 
selves exclusively to the education of the negro youth, two of them 
taking their members from the colored race, The larger of these, the

Oblate Sisters of Providence, founded in 1825 in Baltimore, now 
numbers 135. The other, the Congregation of the Holy Family, 
founded in 1842 in New Orleans, now numbers 111 members, and its 
schools are attended by 1,300 pupils. The total number of negro 
schools at the present time is 150, with an enrollment of 13,393. The 
schools are in 30 dioceses. 
Catholic schools for the deaf and dumb in the United States number 
14, with an enrollment of 1,270 pupils. Most of the schools are in 
charge of religious communities of women and are in 11 dioceses, as

institutes for the instruction of the blind. The exact enrollment in 
the former is not given in the directory. In the latter it is 104.

THE HIGH-SCHOOL MOVEMENT. 
The establishment of high schools as a part of the parochial school 
system has been rapid during the past few years. It has been a 
natural development, brought about by a demand for more advanced 
work from pupils completing the grades already provided. It has 
been accomplished by gradually increasing the number of grades in 
the school until the course covered the secondary curriculum. The 
grades doing secondary work have become high schools or high-school
-P-A-G-E-260
  
234 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
departments. In many instances, however, elementary schools are 
still giving one or two years of secondary subjects without definitely 
indicating it as high-school work. 
A study of the extent of Catholic secondary education in the United 
States, exclusive of the preparatory departments of colleges, has 
recently been made by a committee of the Catholic Education Associa- 
tion. In January, 1911, this committee sent an inquiry to all schools 
reported in the Official Directory as having six or more teachers. It 
was felt that a school with fewer teachers was not likely to have more 
than the eight elementary grades. The list contained 1,474 schools. 
Inasmuch as the primary purpose was to ascertain as far as possible 
the strength of the high-school movement in so far as this was an 
outgrowth of, or at least connected with, the parish schools, prepar- 
atory departments of colleges and academies and schools for girls 
only were excluded from the inquiry. 
Of the 1,474 schools addressed, 886 replied, and 295, or 33 per cent, 
reported high-school grades. If this ratio would hold for the 588 
schools that did not reply there would be approximately 485 with 
high-school grades, or one-third of the total number. It is not cer- 
tain that this ratio would hold, but it is certain that many with high 
schools did not report. Thus in the archdiocese of Cincinnati the 
latest report of the superintendent of parochial schools shows that 29 
of the parish schools have high-school grades, while only 8 of these 
answered the inquiry of the committee. : 
Some of the most interesting data collected, taken from the report 
of the committee, are given below :* 
Complete and incomplete high schools——The total number of boys and girls 
doing work above the elementary grades in these 295 high schools is 14,062. 
The number of boys is 7,902. One-half of the high schools have four grades. 
Of the remaining half, 64 have three grades, 57 have two grades, and 27 have 
only one grade. 
It is plain that our growing system of high schools is passing through a stage 
of development which is easily discernible in studying the history of the public 
high schools. Many cities and towns were able at once to start full-fledged 
four-year public high schools. In many places, however, the public high school 
came into being only grade by grade. In fact, a condition analogous to that 
which we are considering exists even in the public high-school system of to-day. 
Of the 10,218 public high schools given in the report of the Bureau of Education 
for the year ending June, 1910, 3,792, or ever one-third, had courses of only 
from one to three years. 
Teachers.—Not quite so creditable a showing is made in the matter of teach- 
ers. The 148 schools with four grades average a little less than 4 teachers 
to the school. But these schools engage 174 teachers for part of the time; so 
that if the time given by these latter to high-school work were counted in 
there would probably be an average of 4 teachers to a school. For the 147 
schools with less than four grades, having a total of 333 grades, there are only 
214 teachers giving their whole time to high-school work, which means an aver- 
  
1 Catholic Educ. Assoc., Bull, No. 2, 1912. Rep, of committee on secondary education.
-P-A-G-E-261
ROMAN CATHOLIC SCHOOLS. 235 
age of about 2 teachers to every three grades. There are, also, in these 147 
schools 97 teachers who give part of their time to high-school work. Here, 
then, in the matter of the number of teachers there is undoubtedly a weak spot. 
Yet if comparison be made with the public schools the weakness may not ap- 
pear so great, for if the 9,875 public high schools outside the cities of 8,000 
population and over are considered the averages for this large number of 
schools—constituting, in fact, nine-tenths of all our public high schools—show 
a little less than 3 teachers to the school. 
Nearly all the Catholic high schools are conducted by religious. Brothers 
teach in 68 schools and sisters in 220. 
Connection with parish schools.—If we are to have a system of Catholic 
high schools, it is supremely important that these schools should fit in with our 
existing well-established systems of parish schools and colleges, and form a 
connecting bond between them. The statistics which have been gathered 
furnish some illuminative information here. Two hundred and fifty-two of 
these high schools are directly connected with only a single parish school, 
while only 15 of them are directly connected with several parish schools. No 
other fact, perhaps, so clearly reveals the inchoate character of this secondary 
school development. Nearly all these high schools are the offshoots of single 
parish schools. Even in towns and cities which boast of a number of large 
and well-equipped parish schools, with thousands of pupils, no attempt is made, 
as a rule, to build up a central high school with which all the existing parish 
schools would be made to fit in. 
Academic standing.—But, it may be asked, are these new high schools com- 
petent to do the work of the preparatory departments? Our colleges have, 
generally speaking, added to their entrance requirements in recent years, and 
lengthened out their own preparatory curriculum to four years. The entrance 
requirements of our stronger colleges are, I think it may be said, quite as 
high and rigid as those of the big non-Catholic colleges and State universities. 
Can our high schools—even the strongest of them—measure up to the standard 
of such requirements? 
A ready answer might be offered by pointing to the fact that 34 of these high 
schools are recognized by the board of regents of New York; 13 are connected 
with reputable non-Catholic colleges or State universities, 19 with Catholic 
colleges, and 9 with State normal schools. But the committee, realizing the 
importance of this question and its special interest to college men, has made 
a closer study of the matter. It has ascertained just what subjects are taught 
in each of these 295 high schools, with the number of semesters covered by each 
subject. The results formed one of the clearest evidences of the strength and 
permanency of this new high-school movement, as well as one of the most hope- 
ful signs, in the judgment of the committee, for the future of Catholic higher 
education. 
Out of the 295 schools investigated, 209 are found to have courses in Latin. 
How many of these, now, offer a curriculum of studies that is practically 
equivalent to the preparatory curriculum of our colleges? Or, in other words, 
how many of them can prepare boys to enter the freshman year of our colleges? 
By the term “ practically equivalent” is meant the offering of such courses as 
would enable the boy to gain freshman standing, although he might, in some 
instances, be conditioned for lack of a year’s study in some particular branch, 
such as a science or a modern language, algebra, or geometry. Again, it is 
necessary to distinguish between the colleges. Many of our colleges will not 
admit without Greek, and, in the case of these, comparatively few of the high 
schools could offer the equivalent of the preparatory department, for not many
-P-A-G-E-262
236 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
of them teach Greek. But some of our stronger colleges do not require Greek, 
and permit the offering of the modern Janguages in its place. We will select 
one of these colleges, therefore, and, as a matter of convenience, it shall be 
the University of Notre Dame, as I am more familiar with the entrance require- 
ments there, both as to quality and quantity. 
Taking, then, the department of letters and the department of history and 
economics in Notre Dame University, which require, for entrance, 4 years of 
Latin, 4 of English, 3 of history, 3 of mathematics, 3 of modern languages, and 
2 years of science, and bearing in mind the quality of the matter required under 
each of these subjects, I find that 101 of these high schools offer a curriculum 
that is practically equivalent to the preparatory curriculum or the entrance 
requirements of Notre Dame University in these two departments. Twenty- 
eight high schools, moreover, offer Greek, generally from two to three years. 
The total number of boys following high-school courses in these 101 schools is 
8,541. There are, in addition, a considerable number of schools which offer a 
curriculum that would enable a boy to enter the freshman year in the general 
science course at Notre Dame, for which only two years of Latin are required. 
It may be said, then, that fully one-half of our high schools which teach Latin 
are competent to prepare boys for the freshman year of those of our colleges that 
do not require Greek for entrance or for the non-Catholic colleges generally. 
THE CATHOLIC EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
This association, organized in 1904, is an outgrowth of the Associa- 
tion of Catholic Colleges, which was organized in Chicago April 12, 
1899. The association has for its object the promotion of the general 
interest of Catholic education. Any person desiring to assist the 
association may become a member. It is composed of three depart- 
ments—the seminary department, the college and university depart- 
ment, and the parish-school department. 
The influence of the association upon the development of the 
Catholic school system is noteworthy. Burns, in his “Growth and De- 
velopment of the Catholic School System in the United States,” says: 
The growth of the Catholic high-school movement, as well as the general 
effort that is being made to perfect the curriculum, the teaching, the organiza- 
tion, and administration of the parish schools, as has been described under these 
topics, shows that the Catholic school system in the United States has been, 
within recent years, undergoing a rapid development. The keynote of all these 
progressive movements appears to lie in the general recognition of the need of 
a greater unification of all Catholic educational forces. The present study of 
the growth and development of the school would therefore not be complete, 
within its professed scope, unless some account were given of the Catholic 
Educational Association, which, although not organically connected with the 
parish-school system, has unquestionably done much to foster the movement for 
unification. Indeed, the association is probably the chief factor in the present 
healthful stir which is apparent throughout the entire field of Catholic 
education. 
The idea of a general union of Catholic educational societies was in the mind 
of Bishop Conaty and other members of the Catholic association when it was 
first suggested in the Chicago meeting, in 1900, that representatives of the 
diocesan school systems be invited to form an affiliated organization. The actual 
accomplishment of the projected union was due chiefly to the Right Rey. Mgr.

Dennis J. O’Connell, who made it one of his principal concerns on his assuming 
the rectorship of the Catholic University in 1903. (P. 237.) 
The growth of the association and its influence are also indicated by the ex- 
pansion of the departmental work. The college department has organized three 
sections for the more effective prosecution of its work in the special fields of 
languages and literature, mathematics and science, and philosophy and history; 
while in the parish-school department there is a section whose membership is 
made up of the diocesan superintendents of schools, and another which is 
devoted to the study and discussion of educational work among Catholic deaf- 
mutes. (P. 379.)

CHAPTER VII. 
RECENT MOVEMENTS IN NEGRO EDUCATION. 
By THOMAS JESSE JONES, 
Specialist in the Bureau of Education. 
Conrents: Public schools; the work of the Jeanes Fund; State rural supervisors; farm 
demonstration work; teachers’ associations; the negro organization society of Vir- 
ginia ; denominational boards and home missions council; negro schools and self-help 
in education ; conference of rural industrial schools for colored people in the South. 
The past year has witnessed a number of interesting and sig- 
nificant movements for the improvement of education for the negroes 
of the Southern States. The most notable of these are the activities 
of the Jeanes Fund, under the direction of Dr. J. H. Dillard; the 
farmers’ cooperative demonstration work; the appointment of State 
supervisors of rural schools in Virginia, Kentucky, and Arkansas; 
the increase of efficient supervision by several of the religious boards 
that maintain schools for colored people; the organization of a com- 
prehensive study of the private and higher schools for the education 
of colored people by the United States Bureau of Education and the 
Phelps-Stokes Fund; and numerous educational conferences dis- 
seminating information and inspiration among the workers in colored 
schools. Interpreting education broadly, there must be added to the 
above list the noteworthy building campaigns of the Young Men’s 
Christian Association among colored people, and the successful meet- 
ings of the national and State associations of colored teachers. 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
It is very difficult to ascertain the nature and extent of the efforts 
of public officials for the education of the colored people. Last year 
the Commissioner of Education sent the following list of questions 
to the various State superintendents, church boards, school presi- 
dents, newspaper editors, and others throughout the South who are 
interested in educational work among colored people: 
What improvements in the public schools for negroes have been made by 
the State, county, or city officials of your State within the year ending June 
80, 1912? How have the colored people themselves helped in this improvement? 
Please record changes in the building, equipment, or course of study. 
243,  
-P-A-G-E-270
244 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
Have the institutions controlled by religious or other private boards made 
any notable changes? 
What conventions, fairs, conferences, or other meetings of educational value 
to the negro race have been held in your State during the year ending June 
30, 1912? 
Have any organizations, clubs, or movements such as boys’ corn clubs, farm 
demonstration movement, or health organizations for the improvements of 
colored people been carried on during the year ending June 30, 1912? 
Many of those to whom the questions were sent failed to reply, 
and in most cases the answers received were not sufficiently full and 
concise to make possible any extensive tabulation or classification 
of the data. The replies show, however, with a considerable degree 
of uniformity throughout, the States, a few very important facts 
concerning the improvement in the school facilities and the edu- 
cational progress of the colored people. Replies were received from 
more than half of the superintendents of Southern States. These 
replies indicate, in a measure, the attitude toward negro schools. 
One State superintendent writes: 
There has never been any serious attempt in this State to offer adequate 
educational facilities for the colored race. The average length of the term 
for the State is only four months; practically all of the schools are taught in 
dilapidated churches, which, of course, are not equipped with suitable desks, 
blackboards, and the other essentials of a school; practically all of the teachers 
are incompetent, possessing little or no education and having had no pro- 
fessional training whatever, except a few weeks obtained in the summer 
schools; the schools are generally overcrowded, some of them having as many 
as 100 students to the teacher; no attempt is made to do more than teach 
the children to read, write, and figure, and these subjects are learned very 
imperfectly. There are six or eight industrial supervisors financed in whole 
or in part by the Jeanes Fund; most of these teachers are stimulating the 
negro schools to do very good work and are gradually inducing them to base 
their work upon the practical things of life. A few wide-awake negro teachers 
not connected with the Jeanes Fund are doing the same thing. It can prob- 
ably be truthfully said that the negro schools here are gradually improving, 
but they are still just about as poor and inadequate as they can be. 
Another says: 
The only notable improvement made in the public schools for negroes, so 
far as I am informed, is the appointment of two additional supervisors by the 
Jeanes Fund in two counties of the State. These supervisors were appointed 
at the request of the county superintendents and, as you know, are paid out 
of the Jeanes Fund. 
A third reports: 
There has been no special work for the colored schools during the past year. 
Our State gives each colored school about $196 a year for every teacher it 
employs. The law requires the district to raise not less than $50 by taxes for 
every teacher it employs. The district is seldom able to raise more than $50 
by taxation, though it is noticeable that they are attempting to increase the 
amount raised. The State has built quite a number of schools for colored 
pupils this past year and repaired a great many more. Practically all the 
 
-P-A-G-E-271

schools and the repairs to buildings have to be made by the State. Our build- 
ings for the colored pupils are being put into better shape every year. One of 
the noticeable improvemen’s has been in the way of better qualified teachers, 
who are graduates of the State College for Colored Students and from institu- 
tions in other States. This is a hopeful sign. 
Still another says: 
‘I have your circular letter asking for information concerning progress of 
negro education. I am unable to give much light on these matters; * * * 
I have no definite information in regard to its progress. 
The reply of another is: 
We have no marked improvement to record for the negro public schools of 
this State during last year. Our annual report shows that the sum of $635,000 
was expended by the State on the common schools for negroes. In addition, 
through private, denominational, and other sources, large amounts have been 
expended for industrial, secondary, and collegiate education. In some instances 
the colored people have helped, but this has not been the rule. 
Different in tone is this reply: 
In response to your circular inquiry, inclosed with your letter of the 3d 
instant, regarding negro education, I advise that it is very difficult to secure 
definite information, because none of the items in the reports to this office are 
segregated, except the population, enrollment, and attendance. The average 
daily attendance of negroes in the public schools for the year ending June 30, 
1911, was 66,958; for the year ending June 30, 1912, it was 68,040. I can safely 
say, however, that there has been a decided improvement in negro education 
along’ all lines within the past few years—better buildings and longer terms, 
even in the rural communities. Much of this is due to the rapidly growing 
sentiment that practical education of the negro is an economic profit. ‘The 
desire for industrial education is growing among the negroes, and several 
private institutions of this character are now being promoted. Several counties 
have flourishing negro teachers’ associations and the State association is well 
attended each year. We now have county superintendency in 15 counties, and 
the superintendents, with the aid of the Jeanes Fund agents, are doing much to 
raise the standard of rural negro schools to some degree of efficiency. The 
negro schools in all our towns and cities compare in all matters of equipment 
yery favorably with the schools for the white children, having the same length 
of term, I believe, in all instances. 
Another interesting reply follows: 
Under our law the colored schools of the district, which are separate from 
the white, are continued for the same length of term and their teachers are paid 
the same rate of salary as for the white schools. It is true that the average 
salary of the colored teachers is lower than that of the white teachers, but this 
is due to the fact that the average grade of certificate is lower. In the second 
place, we have two State institutions for colored pupils doing work of a sec- 
ondary nature, with part of it ranking as college work. We have undertaken little 
in the way of special organization, but we have given the support necessary for 
standard work, and under State authority standard results are required. We 
do not have a large number of colored farmers, but the county demonstrator of 
this county and the extension workers of the university give assistance to the 
colored farmers on the same conditions that they do to the white.

  246 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
Mr. W. K. Tate, State supervisor of elementary schools of South 
Carolina, reports for that State: 
During the current year the negro schools of the State enrolled 193,440 pupils. 
The greater part of the pupils were in the country schools of the State, and 
these schools show an increased enrollment of negro pupils every year. The 
education of the negro in South Carolina is in the hands of the white race. The 
white trustees apportion the funds, select the teachers, and receive the reports. 
The county superintendent has the supervision of these schools in his hands. 
The State expended last year $349,834.60 in the support of negro schools. 
Mr. Tate thinks a large part of this money is wasted for want of 
better qualified teachers and more adequate supervision, and that the 
State is missing a great opportunity in not making these schools 
better. He says the negro schoolhouses are usually without comfort, 
equipment, proper lighting, or sanitation. 
Nearly all the negroes of school age in the district are crowded into these 
miserable structures during the first term of the school. Most of the teachers 
are absolutely untrained and have been given certificates by the county board, 
not because they have passed the examination, but because it is necessary to 
have some kind of a negro teacher. 
Among the negro rural schools which I have visited I have found only one 
in which the highest class knew the multiplication table. The teacher is at- 
tempting to use the books and follow the course of study provided by the State 
board of education and intended primarily for white schools. 
The books used have little significance for the negro children, and 
the lessons little relation to the present or future lives of the children. 
No attempt is made to help the untrained and incompetent negro 
teachers to adapt to the special needs of the negro schools a course 
of study and textbooks designed primarily for white children. 
The negro is now, and will be for years to come, the tenant farmer of South 
Carolina. His welfare and the prosperity of the white race depend largely on 
his efficiency as a farmer. I believe that the time has now come for us to 
attack the negro school problem with the serious intention of adapting the 
school to the special needs of the negro farmer, in an endeavor to teach him 
agriculture, to encourage manual training, cooking, sewing, personal cleanliness, 
and hygienic conditions in his home, along with the elements of a common- 
school education. The school should endeavor to set for him a better standard 
of living and to increase those ever-present and insistent wants which center 
about a well-kept home, thus securing for him a better existence, and for the 
landowner a more constant labor supply. This problem has not yet been 
solved, and the “ well done” of the whole State awaits the county superintend- 
ent and trustees who will attack it vigorously. 
THE WORK OF THE JEANES FUND. 
The work of the Jeanes Fund, which has been mentioned above 
as one of the factors contributing to the improvement of negro educa- 
tion, is described in the following statement by Dr. James H. Dillard, 
president of the fund: 
The work began four years ago. Miss Jeanes, the donor of the fund, desired 
to aid in improving the small rural schools for megroes, and the plan of supply-

ing to county or parish superintendents the salary for a trained industrial 
supervisor was hit upon as the most effective way of using the resources of 
the fund. Last session there were industrial supervisors in 121 counties. Our 
average appropriation to the counties was $297.56.

What was done may be seen from an article by Supt. J. P. Oliver, 
of Tallapoosa County, Ala., in the Progressive School Journal, of 
which the following is a summary: 
Perhaps no one thing has claimed the attention of our educators of,late that 
means more for our rural schools than efficient county supervision. If anything 
more was needed to convince me of its supreme importance, or what it means 
for the advancement of the rural schools, I have but to call to mind what it has 
done for our colored schools in Tallapoosa County during the present scholastic 
year. 
Through correspondence with Dr. J. H. Dillard, of New Orleans, I secured the 
services of Prof. Thomas J. Edwards, his expenses to be defrayed from the Jeanes 
Fund. On November 1, 1911, Edwards reported to me for work, with a letter 
from Dr. Dillard, placing him under my direction. 
After mapping out his line of work, Edwards commenced visiting the colored 
schools in the county, making weekly written reports to me, and getting 
further directions for each ensuing week. He commenced at once to organize 
in each colored school visited a school improvement association, cooperative 
corn and cotton clubs, where the school children and patrons cultivated the 
grounds, taking lessons in agriculture at the same time. It was agreed that 
the proceeds arising from this work should inure to the benefit of the school, in 
adding to the equipment, extending the length of the school term, and intro- 
ducing manual labor, both for boys and girls. 
Edwards has kept me fully posted as to his work, and it is simply wonder- 
ful how much has been accomplished in so short a time. I have visited several 
of these schools in person, and the improvement is most striking. The school 
yards have been cleared off and planted in trees and flowers, corn and cotton

clubs organized and work done on the little farms, and manual art and domestic 
science introduced into most of the schools; the children learn woodwork, raflia 
and straw basket-making, and sewing; they seem cheerful and industrious, and 
they are making progress; moreover, this work does not seem to decrease their 
interest in their books. 
About two months ago an exhibition of the work done in these schools was 
given in the colored Baptist Church in Dadeville, and it was a revelation to all 
attending. The several schools vied with each other. The boys exhibited axe 
and hammer handles, shuck foot mats, etc., of their own make, and told also 
of what they were doing on the school farms, while the girls showed baskets 
and hats of all sizes and shapes wrought from raffia, straw, and shucks, as well 
as all kinds of needlework, from coarse fabrics to the finest hand-embroidered 
centerpieces. This general interest, brought about by social contact and com- 
munity cooperation, has resulted in lengthening school terms from two to three 
months and the organization and establishment of the Tallapoosa County Col- 
ored Fair, to be held in the New Adka community, in this county, on November 
14-15, 1912, at which premiums are offered to encourage manual art in schools 
and increase agricultural production by colored farmers. 
I have written about this because it is something new in our colored schools. 
If this kind of supervision does so much for colored schools, what may we 
expect for our white schools if our new law for county supervision is made effec- 
tive by our county boards of education, giving such clerical aid to our county 
superintendents as will enable them to give most of their time in visiting and 
supervising our white rural schools? 
It should be added that the supervising industrial teacher is appointed by the 
county or parish superintendent and works under his direction—is, in fact, one 
of his corps of teachers. In some instances the local school authorities add 
to the amount of appropriation, either by augmenting the salary of the super- 
visor or by contributing to the expenses of traveling over the county. 
I believe that this plan, which has been called the Henrico plan, because in 
that county in Virginia it was first put into effective operation over a whole 
county, will be adopted very generally. It is most gratifying to note the hearty 
indorsement which it has received from State and county superintendents 
throughout the South. To some readers in Louisiana it may be of interest 
to know that Iberville Parish was the first place in which was inaugurated this 
method of having an industrial teacher make the rounds of a number of rural 
schools. 
STATE RURAL SUPERVISORS. 
A most important outgrowth of the Jeanes Fund work in coopera- 
tion with the extension department of Hampton Institute has been 
the appointment of Mr. Jackson Davis as State supervisor of rural 
schools in Virginia. This appointment is a cooperative arrangement 
between the General Education Board and the Virginia State De- 
partment of Education. Mr. Davis is engaged in the direction and 
encouragement of rural schools for negroes. The “ Henrico plan,” 
described above, originated under his supervision in Virginia. Dur- 
-ing the past year he has directed county supervision in 18 Virginia 
counties. The value of this work is indicated in Mr. Davis’s report 
for 1911-12. This report shows that the schooi terms in these 18 
counties was lengthened an average of 1 month; that 9 new build-
-P-A-G-E-275
  
RECENT MOVEMENTS IN NEGRO EDUCATION. 249. 
ings were erected at a cost of $5,200; that 12 buildings were enlarged, 
costing $1, 068; that 12 buildings were painted and 69 whitewashed; 
that 37 sanitary outhouses were built; that individual drinking cups 
were introduced in 102 schools; that 348 improvement leagues were 
formed among school patrons; and, most significant of all, that 
$13,744 in cash was raised and considerable labor and material con- 
tributed by the colored people themselves of these 18 counties. In 
addition to supervision of the schools, the summer work of the super- 
vising industrial teachers in Virginia is no less noteworthy. The 
work consists chiefly of the formation of garden and preserving clubs 
among the girls. Mr. Davis’s report shows that in 8 counties alone 
267 girls were in garden clubs; 202 gardens were planted, of which 
140 were well cared for; 67 girls planted vegetables for fall; 172 
canning demonstrations were given; 3,946 jars of vegetables were put 
up by the girls; 6,006 jars were put up by their mothers; and 86 
cooking lessons were given. 
In view of the excellent possibilities indicated by the work of 
Mr. Davis in Virginia, it is of real significance that through the 
cooperation of the General Education Board State supervisors of 
rural schools have been appointed in Kentucky, Arkansas, Alabama, 
and North Carolina. Other States have decided to appoint similar 
officers. 
FARM DEMONSTRATION WORK. 
Closely allied with the work of the Jeanes Fund and the State 
supervisors is that of the farm demonstration work which was begun 
by the late Dr. Knapp. This work is carried on under the direction 
of the United States Department of Agriculture in cooperation with 
the General Education Board. 
There were 32 negro farm demonstrators in 1912, distributed 
among the States as follows: Virginia, 10; Alabama, 7; South Caro- 
lina, 7; Georgia, 2; North Carolina, 2; Florida, 1; Oklahoma, 1; 
Arkansas, 1; Mississippi, 1. In speaking of the work of these agents, 
Mr. Bradford Knapp said in his recent report to the General Educa- 
tion Board: 
I believe that it is safe to say that these, together with the negro farmers 
and tenants who are receiving direct instruction through white agents, will 
bring the total of negroes being instructed up to about 20,000. 
As an illustration of the work of the negro demonstrators, Mr. 
Knapp describes the activities of one of them in the Wellville com- 
munity, in Virginia: 
The improvement in the Wellville community under the special superintend- 
ence of J. B. Pierce is a source of great interest and presents a showing that 
is little short of remarkable. Some of these negro farmers are making yields 
of corn from 50 to 200 per cent larger than they did formerly, and are doing it 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
  250 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
at less cost, per bushel. They have become immensely interested in grass 
demonstrations, and some of them have produced as high as 2 tons of hay per 
acre, while formerly they grew no grass whatever. Seventy-five per cent of 
these farmers are now growing wheat and 35 per cent of them are growing 
oats, and the acreage has vastly increased over what it was before. They are 
building up their soils by the use of cowpeas, crimson clover, soy beans, rye, and 
buckwheat. Before the demonstration work began in this community only one 
crop was grown on the cornland and the land was continuously cropped to the 
one crop, year in and year out. Now fully 40 per cent of the farmers with 
whom this work is conducted have adopted two or three year rotation of crops. 
TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATIONS. 
Colored State teachers’ associations have been organized and have 
held meetings during the year in the following States: Alabama, 
Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mary- 
land, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Ten- 
nessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia. A National Association 
of Colored Teachers was organized in 1904 and has held meetings 
annually each year since that time. Teachers representing 21 
States were present at the last meeting. These meetings are having 
a wholesome effect in creating higher ideals, better methods, and a 
mutual cooperation among teachers in meeting the problems of their 
communities in the best possible way. The numerous State superin- 
tendents who replied to the questionnaire mentioned above spoke in 
the highest terms of the State associations of colored teachers. 
THE NEGRO ORGANIZATION SOCIETY OF VIRGINIA. 
The Negro Organization Society of Virginia represents a unique 
movement to combine all sorts and conditions of organizations of 
colored people in Virginia and to direct their efforts to the realiza- 
tion of the society’s motto, namely: “ Better schools, better health, 
better homes, better farms.” 
DENOMINATIONAL BOARDS AND HOME MISSIONS COUNCIL. 
Within the past two years many of the church boards in control of 
schools for colored people have appointed field agents or inspectors 
to supervise the work of their schools. The religious boards that 
have been especially active in the management of their schools are: 
The American Missionary Association, the American Baptist Home 
Mission Society, the American Church Institute of the Protestant 
Episcopal Church, and the Freedmen’s Aid Society of the Methodist 
Episcopal Church. These four boards are not only studying their 
own schools, but they are also cooperating through a committee of 
the Home Missions Council in order to avoid duplication of effort

RECENT MOVEMENTS IN NEGRO EDUCATION. 251 
and be mutually helpful in all their work. The Board of Missions 
of the Presbyterian Church has also increased its supervision within 
the last few months. Of the colored boards the African M. E. Zion 
is considered one of the best organized and most efficient in the gen- 
eral management of its schools. The supervision carried on by these 
church boards is of great value, and the results of their endeavors 
appear in many phases of school activities. Inasmuch as a very large 
proportion of all the teacher training received by colored teachers is 
provided in these schools, the increased effectiveness of their work 
should in time extend to the public schools. 
Owing to the incompleteness of the replies to our inquiries, it is not 
possible to give a statement of the financial contributions of these 
boards or of the additions in equipment which they have made to the 
schools for colored people. The replies received, however, indicate 
that a number of good buildings have been erected and other im- 
provements made within the last year by the denominational organi- 
zations. 
NEGRO SCHOOLS AND SELF-HELP IN EDUCATION. 
The sources of information as to the education of colored people 
are of uncertain value. This is especially true of the information 
pertaining to the provisions for negroes in public school systems. 
With due allowance for this uncertainty of sources, a recent com- 
pilation of statistics made by Mr. Monroe N. Work, of Tuskegee In- 
stitute, presents a view of the situation that is worthy of attention. 
Mr. Work’s article is in part as follows: 
PROGRESS IN NEGRO EDUCATION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
It appears that the greatest progress now making in the public elementary 
schools of the South is in lengthening the school term and in providing more 
and better schoolhouses. There are 9 States which report the length of the 
colored school term separately. According to the latest available information, 
the length of term in days was as follows: Alabama, 96; Florida, 96; Geor- 
gia, in counties, 109, in special systems, 164; Louisiana, 92; North Carolina, 93; 
South Carolina, 70; Texas, 124; Virginia, 122; Maryland, 188. In Maryland, 
Texas, and Virginia, the term for the colored is more than six months; in 
Alabama and Florida there has been considerable fluctuation in the length of 
the school term. In Alabama, in 1908, the average length of the school term 
for the colored schools was 95 days; in 1909 it was 98 days; in 1910, 90 days; in 
1911, 95 days; and in 1912, 96 days. In Florida the average length of the 
colored school term in 1907 was 96 days; in 1908, 99 days; in 1909, 90 days; and 
in 1910, 96 days. In Georgia in 1911 the term was 4 days longer than in 1910 
and 7 days longer than in 1909.

In Florida, the increase in the value of negro school buildings and sites for 
the year 1910 was $25,500; for the four years, 1906 to 1910, the increase was 
$72,000. In Alabama, the increase for the year 1912 was $56,000; the increase 
for the nine years, 1903 to 1912, was $449,590. For the seven years, 1903 to 
1910, the value of school property in Georgia increased $280,000. The prin- 
cipal increase in negro public school property, by means of public funds, has 
been in cities. In the rural districts, the increase has been largely by means 
of money raised directly from the people. 
The reports of 15 of these States, and the District of Columbia, give data 
from which information concerning the amount of expenditure for negro public 
schools can be obtained. These States, and their annual expenditures for this 
purpose, are as follows:

  In Alabama the expenditures in 1912 were $17,600 greater than in 1911 and 
$45,000 greater than in 1910. In Florida they were $411,800 greater in 1910 
than in 1909, and $42,300 greater than in 1907. In Georgia they were $100,800 
greater in 1911 than in 1910.
-P-A-G-E-279
RECENT MOVEMENTS IN NEGRO EDUCATION. 253 
The total expenditures for negro elementary education in the South in 1912 
were about $8,700,000. Wherever there has been an increase in expenditure, it 
has been mainly to pay the increased number of teachers. 
TEACHERS’ SALARIES AND CERTIFICATES. 
Hight States give information about salaries, and nine report the grades of 
certificates of teachers in colored public schools. These facts are given in the 
following table:

It does not appear that in recent years there has been any striking change 
in the relative number of teachers holding first, second, and third grade cer- 
tificates. It appears that one of the reasons why there is not a larger percentage 
of first and second grade teachers is because of the small salaries paid. The 
higher educational institutions and the rapidly developing negro business enter- 
prises pay much larger salaries and therefore obtain the best equipped colored 
men and women. The percentage of trained teachers in negro elementary 
schools is small, and the majority of them are in the city schools. In order to 
do more effective work in both city and rural schools, there must be a large 
number of efficient teachers. One result would be that the masses who are 
dependent upon these schools for their education would receive training better 
fitted to their needs. Another result would be that the higher schools would get 
students prepared to do their work. These schools would then not be com- 
pelled, as they now are, to spend so much of their resources in giving elementary 
training. 
There are probably 100,000 students enrolled in these higher schools. Of those 
in public high schools, 17 per cent are in elementary grades. Of those in the 238 
secondary and higher schools for which information is available, 58 per cent 
are in elementary grades. There is every reason to suppose that in those 
schools for which information is not available, the percentage of those in ele- 
mentary grades is still greater. The enrollment in the 136 public high schools 
in 1911 was 10,897, of whom 1,855 were in elementary grades. In the 238 
secondary and higher schools there were 70,095 students enrolled. Of these, 
5,813 were in collegiate and professional classes, 23,884 were secondary stu- 
dents, and 40,945 were elementary pupils. 
The annual expenditures for negro secondary and higher education are esti- 
mated to be about $4,500,000. It is estimated that the total value of the
-P-A-G-E-280
254 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
property, including equipments, grounds, and buildings owned by the institu- 
tions for secondary and higher education, is about $20,000,000. The endow- 
ments or productive funds of these schools total approximately $6,100,000. Of 
this amount $2,100,000 is credited to colleges and universities and $4,000,000 
to normal and industrial schools. 
SECONDARY AND HIGHER SCHOOLS, 
Concerning the more than 600 institutions for secondary and higher train- 
ing of the negro, there is available but meager information. Many of these 
institutions are colleges and industrial schools in name only, and are, in fact, 
doing elementary school work. The leaders of the race are discouraging the 
tendency to increase the number of these institutions; they advise instead that 
those now existing be improved. There is a widespread movement for improved 
school plants, increased efficiency in teaching, and greater emphasis upon com- 
munity uplift. The general conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, at its 
recent session in Minneapolis, designated 1913 as a jubilee year for the schools 
of the Freedmen’s Aid Society, and launched a campaign to raise a half million 
dollars during the present year for their support. The American Missionary 
Association, at its meeting in Buffalo in October, 1912, set on foot a movement 
to raise $1,000,000 by October, 19138, for the secondary and higher education of 
the negroes of the South. - 
SELF HELP IN EDUCATION. 
As the colored people of the South grow more prosperous, they contribute 
more largely to the expense of their education. It is estimated that through 
churches and other movements they are raising each year about $1,000,000 
for the support of schools. There are about 175 colleges and industrial 
schools that are supported by negro religious denominations. The colored Bap- 
tists have the largest number of these schools; the statistical secretary of the 
denomination enumerates 125 in his last report. According to the report of 
the Freedmen’s Aid Society, negroes comprise one-tenth of the membership 
of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and the colored conferences raised $32,387 
of the $157,712 raised by the church for negro education in 1910-11. The 
African Methodist Episcopal Church, for the support of its 20 colleges and normal 
schools, raises each year about $150,000. The Colored Methodist Episcopal 
Church raised last year for education $115,000. The negro Baptists of Ala- 
bama, in addition to supporting a number of district academies, raise each 
year something like $30,000 for the support of Selma University. The 
women’s auxiliary of the National Baptist convention reported for the past 
fiscal year $26,968 raised. Of this amount, $18,992 was reported to have been 
spent on the National Training School for Girls at Washington, D.C. It was also 
reported that local organizations had raised $8,000 for this institution. Much 
of the negro self-help in education is in the direction of supporting public 
schools. During the past year at Barlow Bend, Clarke County, Ala., the 
colored people built a two-room schoolhouse at a cost of $1,200 and deeded it 
to the State. The only financial aid they received in the undertaking was 
$200 from the State building fund; the bulk of the money was raised by the 
colored people themselves. This is an example of what is done in every sec- 
tion of the South. 
The following “Memorandum Regarding New Schools,” recently 
issued by Dr. Booker T. Washington, indicates an attitude toward
-P-A-G-E-281
  
RECENT MOVEMENTS IN NEGRO EDUCATION. 255 
schools for colored people which is held by an increasing number of 
thoughtful people: 
After considering the whole matter very carefully with prominent educators 
representing various parts of the South, I am thoroughly convinced that it is 
a matter of doubtful wisdom to encourage, except under peculiarly favorable 
circumstances, the starting of additional new and independent schools in the 
South for our people. These schools, to accomplish any good, ought to be well 
managed, under a competent board of trustees, and not represent the mere 
personal ambition or activity of any one individual. In many cases the money 
given for such schools is more than wasted, not. only because of improper or- 
ganization and supervision, but also in large items for traveling expenses. 
It is the consensus of opinion of all who have studied the subject that the 
time has come when money ought to be concentrated upon strengthening of 
existing institutions rather than the starting of new ones. In many cases 
much harm.has been done by establishing additional schools in the same 
locality. I know of special cases where persons are striving to build schools 
within a few miles of other and existing well-organized schools. It would, 
by far, be the better plan in the future, in my opinion, rather than to start 
additional small schools, depending upon the public for an uncertain support, to 
spend the money in strengthening the public schools. In many cases these 
small, poorly organized schools not only accomplish little good, but are weak- 
ening the public-school system. The public-school system, of course, is per- 
manent, and has the advantage of supervision. Instead of starting new 
schools, I advise that the old schools be strengthened or that the money be 
given in a way to strengthen the work of the public schools in the various 
localities of the South. 
CONFERENCE OF RURAL INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS FOR COLORED PEOPLE IN THE 
SOUTH. 
Representatives of a number of educational institutions for negroes 
met in New York City recently for a conference on the rural indus- 
trial schools for colored people in the South. It was planned to 
weld into one system the isolated schools for negroes throughout the 
Southern States. 
The most perplexing problem discussed was that of raising funds 
for these schools, which are now in danger of losing ground. Other 
topics of interest were the adoption of standard courses of study, 
uniform system of accounting, the joint purchasing of stock supplies, 
and the elimination of unworthy schools. 
At the close of the discussion the following resolution was adopted: 
The committee on permanent organization reports the belief that a perma- 
nent organization of the principals or heads of industrial schools for colored 
people is desirous for various reasons, primarily for the purpose of presenting 
their case and their needs to the public, and again for holding annual confer- 
ences, not only to exchange views and to profit by mutual experience, but 
actually to help economize time and expenditure of money in business man- 
agement and mutually to improve the operation of the courses of study. They 
recommend for the first year a simple organization, comprising a president, 
vice president, secretary, and treasurer, and a small board of directors, not to

exceed seven; that the founders be such of the schools represented here as have 
authority to join or are willing to join after hearing from their representatives 
here in attendance; that the dues shall not exceed $10 per school for the first 
year; that another conference be held in October or November, 1913, to com- 
plete the organization, adopt the constitution and by-laws, select the permanent 
secretary, and hear the report of a committee comprising the officers and direc- 
tors as to future activity. 
The committee also recommends that the officers and directors be a com- 
mittee to report upon the adoption of a standard system of accounting and a 
standard curriculum, and the feasibility of cooperation in the purchasing of 
stock supplies.

  CHAPTER VIII. 
PROGRESS OF THE MOVEMENT FOR THE BENEFIT OF 
THE EXCEPTIONAL CHILD, IN THE YEAR 1912. 
By Maxrminian P. HE. GroszMann. 
The year 1912 has marked a turning point in the interest and work 
for the exceptional child in this country. 
In the first place, it has been a year of intense activity on behalf 
of the movement which is intended to bring relief to this class of 
children who are still under a tremendous handicap. Investigations 
in city and State school systems and all over the United States 
were made, which succeeded in developing a great number of im- 
portant facts as to the number and kinds of exceptional children. 
The causes and conditions of retardation, of criminality and prosti- 
tution, of dependency and defectiveness were earnestly discussed. 
The courses of instruction in our public and private schools were 
carefully and often minutely dissected and criticised, so as to estab- 
lish their effect upon the production of retardation and vocational 
unfitness among the American school population. 
The pedagogical and psychological courses in many colleges and 
universities added to their schedules a study of the causes and con- 
ditions of exceptional development in children; and even in the 
medical world there has been great activity along these lines. The 
problem of adjustment of public school work, of provisions for cer- 
tain classes of exceptional children, and of preventing undesirable 
developments and the reproduction of defective classes, has occu- 
pied a number of State legislatures and municipal administrations. 
The United States Bureau of Education has paid considerable atten- 
tion to the significance of this problem, and a new agency for the 
study of childrens’ handicaps has been established by organizing a 
Children’s Bureau as a part of the Department of Commerce and 
Labor. The relation of child labor and social conditions to growth 
and mental development will thus be more thoroughly studied than 
was possible heretofore. 
257 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
  258 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
In all the conventions of leading societies the problem of the ex- 
ceptional child was considered with great earnestness, so that it is 
now recognized as one of the most important problems of the age. 
The most notable of these discusions were those at the midwinter 
_ meeting of the American Academy of Medicine at Lehigh Uni- 
versity, at the International Congress of Hygiene and Demography 
in Washington, and at the Congress on Mental Hygiene in New York 
City. The National Association for the Study and Education of 
Exceptional Children devoted a notable convention to the entire 
perspective of the problem, with special reference to the needs of the 
exceptionally bright child and of the retarded child. This con- 
ference was a distinct protest against the agitation of the alarmists 
who endeavor to confine public attention to the feeble-minded and 
degenerate, and against the tendency to overstate the importance of 
that part of the problem. The fact that the Commissioner of Edu- 
cation of the United States, and Dr. George S. Davis, president of 
the Normal College, New York City, were the presiding officers of 
this conference testified to its importance. 
Perhaps the most notable progress that has been made in the year 
1912 in the handling of this problem is the effort to adopt a more 
generally accepted and complete terminology. The confusion in 
terms has been one of the most unfortunate difficulties in the discus- 
sion of the various phases of exceptional development, and certainly 
one of the causes why the problem of the exceptional child has been 
so often misunderstood. It is not merely, or to any great extent, 
the problem of the so-called defective, of the subnormal, and of the 
abnormal child. In fact, even-in studying the causes of criminality, 
it is well to realize that the stupid and weak-minded criminal, un- 
desirable a factor as he may be in society, is not as dangerous as the 
clever and intellectual criminal. Moral perverts are not necessarily 
imbeciles in other mental operations. Again it is often a matter of 
misdirected potentials in really gifted minds, and consequently the 
result of environmental causes which can be studied and regulated. 
The problem of pubescence and adolescence plays a great part in 
the problem of criminality. Vocational failure, owing to improper 
vocational education, must also be considered as a contributory factor. 
Racial differences in temperament and historical spirit, and difficul- 
ties of social adjustment in a nation which has grown through immi- 
gration, contribute their part to predispose for the breaking of laws. 
It is often the exceptionally bright child, even the genius, whom we 
find on the wrong side. 
All these distinctions can be satisfactorily made only when we have 
learned to classify properly and to use generally applied terms. The 
United States Bureau of Education has accepted the general term
-P-A-G-E-285
  MOVEMENT FOR BENEFIT OF THE EXCEPTIONAL CHILD. 259 
“exceptional” to designate all deviations from the average type, 
upward as well as downward. The terms “ atypical,” “ subnormal,” 
and “abnormal” are becoming more and more restored to their re- 
spective places in a complete scheme of classification. In some 
places the term “ atypical ” is still unfortunately used as a euphonic 
term for mentally defective and feeble-minded. 
It is a matter of course that in classifying and diagnosing various 
degrees and kinds of exceptional development in children, it is neces- 
sary to establish certain definite criteria and to develop a scale of 
intelligence and a system of mental tests which would allow the in- 
vestigator to make a reliable diagnosis. The Binet-Simon tests have 
been widely used for examining children and placing them into 
groups or strata. They have been very helpful, especially in deter- 
mining degrees of feeble-mindedness; yet it was found that the tests 
in their original form were not easily adaptable nor easily applicable 
to American children, and presented other imperfections, so that 
efforts have beeh made to readjust and develop them. A number of 
American psychologists have published during the year the results 
of their experiments and their suggestions for amplifying and artic- 
ulating the tests. Some very notable contributions to the psychology 
of mental development in childhood have thus been produced. A 
new method of testing the intellectual status and the possibility of 
mental growth in children has been published in the year 1912 by 
the National Association for the Study and Education of Excep- 
tional Children. This method is based upon certain facts of genetic 
child psychology not heretofore fully recognized. 
The Legislature of the State of New Jersey was the first to enact 
a law which provided for the establishment of special classes in the 
public schools for different kinds of exceptional children; and while 
still a disproportionate emphasis is given to provisions for the feeble- 
minded child, the other classes of exceptional children are at least 
considered in this legislation. 
There was an increasing activity in providing special classes and 
schools in a number of American city school systems, and special 
supervisors and medical examiners were detailed for such work. 
This movement naturally created a great demand for teachers trained 
to work with children of difficult mental development, and this de- 
mand has induced several normal schools and the pedagogical and 
psychological departments of some universities and colleges to open 
training courses for teachers of special and ungraded classes. In 
the summer of 1912 an unusually large number of such courses were 
carried on. The National Association for the Study and Education 
of Exceptional Children, which had suggested the need of such 
courses years ago, and had given opportunities to individual teachers
-P-A-G-E-286
260 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
in connection with its own laboratory school for some time past, had 
also opened its first regularly organized summer course. 
The difficulty has been that these special and ungraded classes, 
with the exception of those which have been organized in some 
cities for crippled, anemic, tuberculous, and similarly afflicted chil- 
dren, have so far been imperfectly graded. They contain a great 
variety of difficult children, mostly those who are distinctly defective, 
mentally or morally, and may be broadly classed as feeble-minded. 
The expense connected with these classes has been considerable in 
comparison with those for ordinary pupils, and the criticism has 
been justified that the money thus expended represents an un- 
profitable investment; for a feeble-minded child can not be really 
educated, and must be considered a permanent burden on society. 
It has become more and more recognized that the place for the per- 
manently deficient and feeble-minded child is not in the public 
school, but that he can be much more profitably and effectively 
maintained in custodial institutions. The function of the special 
and ungraded classes is seen to be that of furnishing opportunities 
for the potentially normal child to receive the attention commensu- 
rate to his needs and peculiarities, so that he may be either returned 
to the ordinary grades or placed in special schools or institutions 
which would develop his particular talents and facilities so that he 
may find his vocational groove and become a useful member of so- 
ciety. In the same way the exceptionally bright child will be bene- 
fited by such special and adjusted training as will inspire him with 
the right motives and enable him to use his gifts for constructive 
purposes. It has been justly said that we should have special classes 
or schools for the training of our leaders and our great men in such 
manner as to make them leaders for good and not misleaders, dema- 
gogues, and trouble-makers. 
It has been gratifying that the special and ungraded classes are 
utilized as a sort of educational clearing house. In fact, in our 
eastern metropolis a municipal clearing house for exceptional chil- 
dren under the Department of Charities has been established, which 
undoubtedly will have an opportunity for splendid work. 
Naturally provisions for the subnormal child, the blind, the deaf 
and dumb, the epileptic, the child of arrested or of primitive devel- 
opment, are also of importance, and the year 1912 has brought an 
era of awakening also in this respect. It is more and more intelli- 
gently understood that all these problems are one great problem, 
which is social as well as educational. 
Thus the year 1912 has brought us face to face with the fact that 
there must be an intelligent and united effort on the part of edu- 
cators, medical men, social workers, charity organizations, child-
-P-A-G-E-287
  MOVEMENT FOR BENEFIT OF THE EXCEPTIONAL CHILD. 261 
welfare societies, juvenile courts, and other agencies dealing with 
the results of the failure properly to handle exceptional conditions 
in childhood. This can be done only if there are legislative enact- 
ments making every child, ordinary or exceptional, normal or sub- 
normal or abnormal, a public responsibility. So far the physically 
or mentally handicapped child is in a measure exempt from the 
workings of the compulsory-education laws. The very children who 
need special attention and who may become burdens and dangers 
to society are dependent for their education, special training, or cus- 
tody upon the good will of their parents, who are often enough dis- 
inclined to follow the right course. The provisions that exist in 
States and municipalities are so divided among various agencies with 
conflicting authority that it is difficult to carry out even those meas- 
ures which present laws would permit. At present boards of edu- 
cation, boards of health, departments of charity and correction, 
juvenile courts, children’s aid societies, commissions in lunacy, and 
similar agencies are each dealing separately with cases which would 
be handled better by some central authority. We need legislation 
which would establish the right of the Commonwealth to direct the 
education and training of every child, and which would secure to 
the State and municipality an authority which can not be super- 
seded by parental prejudices. 
We also need legislation which would establish such a board or 
boards as can regulate and determine the disposition which is to be 
made of every child according to his needs and to the good of society. 
In this connection it may not be amiss to call attention once more 
to the resolutions which were originally adopted by the Department 
of Special Education at the Boston meeting of the National Edu- 
cation Association in 1910, and in a modified form were accepted 
unanimously by the San Francisco meeting in 1911: 
Realizing the fact that a large percentage of children whose physical and 
mental peculiarities require special methods of education are still to a great 
extent outside the scope of the compulsory-education laws, and that the pres- 
ence of the exceptional child in our modern civilization constitutes a problem of 
the greatest import, it is the sense of this association that the compulsory- 
education laws of States and communities should be so amended, developed, 
and extended that they shall apply to all children of school age, without ex- 
ception, and provide for their training; further, that the laws should recognize 
the difference between the chronological age of a child and his maturity, and 
that the school-age limit of each individual child should be determined by re- 
* quiring the child to meet physical and mental tests, even though the child be 
in years above the age standard; in other words, a child’s actual age should be 
determined by physio-psychological data corresponding to the normal standard 
for the age limit required by law. All children or persons failing to meet such 
maturity test at the extreme school-age limit should remain under public super- 
vision and control, either until they reach maturity or permanently.
-P-A-G-E-288
262 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
The same principle should be the guide in determining whether a child is fit 
to be employed in any occupation. Not when a child is 14 or 16 years of age, 
but when he possesses the maturity of body and mind proper to a normal child 
of that age, should he be released from the guardianship of the State or the 
community. Child-labor laws should be so modified as to meet this requirement. 
At no time before have all these things become so plainly recog- 
nized, and at no time before has there been such a remarkable activity 
on behalf of the problem of the exceptional child as in the year 1912. 
For this reason, I repeat it, it may well be called the turning point 
in the history of this movement.

CHAPTER IX. 
A REVIEW OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN 1911-12. 
By F. B. Jenks, 
Specialist in charge of land-grant college statistics, Bureau of Bducation. 
With questions of the tariff, the high cost of living, credit, and 
currency reform occupying the minds of the people, it is but natural 
that agricultural education should be widely discussed. ‘They alt 
have to do with the solution of country-life problems. It is intended 
in this chapter to indicate the trend of agricultural education and to 
call attention to some of the numerous agencies which are actively 
engaged in promoting it. 
A few years ago agriculture was taught only in agricultural col- 
leges. The nature-study idea for the elementary school was largely 
developed through the teachers of science, particularly biological 
sciences, in these institutions. One phase of nature study developed 
into the school garden and later into the study of agriculture in the 
upper grammar grades. At a still later date agriculture was intro- 
duced into the high school. As nature study in the elementary 
schools grew into agriculture, so the courses in nature study in the 
normal schools are being changed to meet the demand for teachers 
of agriculture. To-day these four branches of the educational sys- 
tem—the agricultural college, the normal school, the high school, 
and the elementary school—are teaching agriculture along different 
lines, but all toward the same final result—the betterment of rural 
conditions. 
The high school is likely to become (if it is not already) the most 
important factor in agricultural education so far as strictly voca- 
tional teaching is concerned, but the agricultural college is naturally 
the leader in its development. The high school looks to the agricul- 
tural college not only for teachers but for subject matter, since all that 
is known of agriculture as an organized science or as a teachable 
subject has come through the efforts of these colleges, with their 
research laboratories and experiment stations. The work of these 
institutions is supplemented by the United States Department of 
Agriculture and the graduate school of agriculture.

  264 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
THE GRADUATE SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURE. 
In 1902 Thomas F. Hunt, then dean of the schoo! of agriculture 
of Ohio State University, conceived the idea of a graduate school 
of agriculture to furnish the opportunity for somewhat extended 
discussion of topics of interest in agricultural science by the lead- 
ing teachers or investigators in the field. His plans were carried 
out, and the first session was held under the auspices of the Ohio 
State University at Columbus, Ohio. Sessions have since been held 
under the auspices of the Association of American Agricultural 
Colleges and Experiment Stations, as follows: 1906, at the Univer- 
sity of Illinois; 1908, at Cornell University (New York) ; 1910, at 
Towa State College of Agriculture and Mechanics Arts; and in 1912 
at Michigan Agricultural College. 
At the 1912 session, among other conferences held were those of 
college instruction in agriculture, secondary instruction in agri- 
culture, and agricultural extension teaching. The enrollment of 
180 represented 34 States, Porto Rico, and 4 foreign countries. 
Most of the agricultural colleges also offer graduate work in agri- 
culture. Courses are offered in 41 of these institutions leading to 
the master’s degree, and 10 give the doctor’s degree. 
AGRICULTURAL COLLEGES. 
As stated by President K. L. Butterfield, in his report to the 
trustees of the Massachusetts Agricultural College: 
There are three main types of service which the college may render: In- 
vestigation, instruction, and extension service. 
Investigation may be called the search for truth about agriculture and rural 
affairs ; instruction, the incarnation of this truth in trained leadership; ex- 
tension service, the dissemination or democratization of this truth—its distribu- 
tion among ali the people interested. 
Thus the college has a threefold task, not three tasks, but one task to be ful- 
filled in these three fairly distinct methods or types of work. 
Of these three phases of the work of agricultural education the 
most attention until very recently has been given to investigation, 
and the result is a vast amount of knowledge accumulated but com- 
paratively little accomplished in either instruction or extension. 
There is still need for investigation, but the most urgent need is the 
placing of agricultural information in the hands of the farmers who 
are to receive the direct benefit from it. 
INSTRUCTION. 
Agriculture is taught in 67 institutions in the United States, in- 
cluding 17 separate schools for negroes. that are receiving Federal
-P-A-G-E-291
REVIEW OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION, 1911-12 265 
aid under the land-grant act of 1862 and subsequent acts. Of the so- 
called agricultural colleges, only one, Massachusetts Agricultural 
College, is an exclusively agricultural college; 23 are colleges of agri- 
culture and mechanic arts; and 26 are colleges or departments of 
universities, AIl of these institutions give courses in agriculture that 
are designed to prepare the boy for successful competition in one or 
more of the various lines of commercial agriculture. That they are 
succeeding is shown by the increasing number of agricultural college 
graduates who are returning to the farm and making it pay. Special 
education in agriculture has been proved not only so valuable but so 
essential to successful farming that the demand for agriculture in 
both the high school and the elementary school has become almost 
universal. 
Ten of the agricultural colleges have courses specially designed for 
training teachers in agriculture; 23 have courses in psychology and 
general education; and 13 have departments of agricultural education 
which give courses in methods of teaching agriculture, as well as in 
general pedagogy. Several of these agricultural education depart- 
ments are supervising the teaching of agriculture in high schools of 
the States. 
It is generally agreed that the teachers of agriculture in the high 
school should have their special training for this work in the agri- 
cultural college. Although the land-grant institutions are offering 
such courses, the reports from these institutions show that a very 
small number of students are availing themselves of the opportunities. 
Courses are offered of varying lengths, from the summer course of 
four to nine weeks to a full four years’ course. By far the largest 
number of teachers in these institutions who take the special courses 
for teachers are taking only the summer course. ‘ 
Seven institutions reported 100 students in four-year teachers’ 
training courses in agriculture in 1912; 2 institutions reported 32 
students in two-year courses; 4 institutions reported 63 students in 
one-year courses; 11 institutions reported 1,698 in summer-school 
courses. This, however, does not give the total number of students 
who are preparing to teach agriculture. Several institutions offer- 
ing courses in agricultural education do not list their students in 
these courses separately as teachers’ training courses. 
During the past year the following institutions added the special 
courses for training teachers as described : 
Purdue University (Indiana) —A. summer school for teachers, 
offering instruction in agriculture, domestic science, and manual 
training, was opened July 17; term, 5 weeks; enrollment, 87. 
Massachusetts Agricultural College—A system of major subjects 
was established, beginning with September, 1912. Each member of
-P-A-G-E-292
  266 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
the junior class will be required to elect one of the major subjects 
offered by the institution. Among the majors offered is one in agri- 
cultural education, which is designed for the special training of 
teachers of agriculture for the high school. 
University of Minnesota.—The three-year course in the school of 
agriculture has been increased to five years and includes normal 
work in the fourth and fifth years, with special reference to rural 
school teaching. 
State College of Washington—A summer school of agriculture 
(for teachers) has been established in western Washington, at Puyal- 
lup, the only subjects taught being agriculture, home economics, and 
mechanic arts. 
West Virginia University—The term of the summer school has 
been lengthened from six to nine weeks. 
EXTENSION SERVICE. 
Forty-three institutions have directors of agricultural extension. 
'They receive appropriations from the States in varying amounts 
from a few hundred dollars to fifty thousand dollars. In their 
efforts to reach the largest possible number their activities have been 
conducted along widely differing lines, such as lectures, publishing 
and distributing bulletins, correspondence courses, reading courses, 
traveling libraries, movable schools, educational trains, demonstra- 
tion farms, educational exhibits at fairs and other places, moving 
pictures, supervision of agricultural teaching in both secondary and 
elementary schools, boys’ and girls’ clubs, etc. 
It is estimated that above 24,000,000 copies of bulletins and circu- 
lars are issued annually by the State experiment stations and the 
Department of Agriculture. About one-fourth of the bulletins issued 
by the Bureau of Education in 1912 were on topics bearing directly 
on agricultural education. 
According to the reports of the presidents of the agricultural 
colleges, there were 220 movable schools in 21 States in 1911-12. 
These schools varied in length from one to six days and cdvered 
practically all phases of agriculture and home economics. In all 
cases the things of most interest and importance to the local com- 
munity were emphasized. 
There were 93 educational trains reported in 31 States the same 
year. The attendance at the lectures and demonstrations given in 
this connection aggregated 1,121,943 (estimated by officials in charge 
of trains). 
Supervision of agricultural teaching by the agricultural colleges 
is becoming more common each year. This has perhaps been most 
systematically developed in Porto Rico, where a plan has recently 
 
-P-A-G-E-293
  REVIEW OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION, 1911--12. 267 
been adopted which places the teaching of agriculture, mechanic 
arts, and home economics in both secondary and elementary schools, 
under the direct supervision of the University of Porto Rico. This 
is made possible on the part of the university by using a large por- 
tion of the Federal appropriation (the so-called Nelson fund) for 
this purpose. 
AGRICULTURE IN HIGH SCHOOLS. 
- According to the most reliable information obtainable, there were 
more than 2,000 high schools teaching agriculture in 1911-12. Of 
this number about 360 were giving courses of two or more years in 
length. This list includes 46 State schools of agriculture, 40 dis- 
trict schools, and 62 county schools. There are also 16 departments 
of agriculture in high schools reported. 
The Bureau of Education gathered from 125 teachers of sec- 
ondary-school agriculture some information concerning salaries re- 
ceived, theoretical training, and teaching experience. 'The following 
brief summary is indicative both of the demand for specially trained 
teachers and the increased salaries commanded by those so trained: 
1. There has been a great increase during the past four years, not only in 
the number of secondary schools offering courses in agriculture, but in the 
number offering agriculture for two or more years. 
2..A large majority of the latter schools employ men trained in the subject 
in agricultural colleges; whereas four years ago very few high schools had 
teachers with any more special preparation than that afforded by attending 
one or two sessions of a summer school. If the teacher in charge of a well- 
organized agricultural department has not attended an agricultural college for 
one or more years, he has usually supplemented a good scientific preparation 
in college with summer-school work in agriculture. 
8. The most usual salary paid teachers with college agricultural training is 
$1,200, and the average of all is about that figure. 2 
4. Half the men teaching high-school agriculture taught it for the first time 
during the school year 1911-12. Most of these were graduated from agricul- 
tural colleges in 1910 or 1911. 
5. The teachers without the training in college agriculture average as large 
a salary when they are high-school principals as the others; otherwise the 
average is much lower. 
6. The length of teaching experience of all kinds, in the case of the men 
with college agriculture, is 3} years, as compared with 8 years for those with 
other training, though the former receive higher salaries. 
7. The average yearly increase in the salaries of teachers with college agri- 
culture has been $158, as compared with $110 for the other group, due in part 
to their ability to obtain good-paying principalships although having little 
experience in teaching. The former begin teaching agriculture at a salary 
$50 higher than the latter. 
8. Three-fourths of the teachers estimate that they are better paid on account 
of teaching agriculture, as follows: In general high schools about $800 extra 
 
-P-A-G-E-294
  268 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
a year, and in special agricultural schools about $550 a year, more than they 
could otherwise earn.’ 
Lack of properly trained teachers as reported from all parts of the 
United States presents the greatest problem to be met at the present 
time. It often becomes the duty of the science teacher with no special 
training, and perhaps no practical experience in farming, to teach 
agriculture. Often when well-trained teachers are secured they are 
asked to teach several other subjects. This is true not only in the 
high schools, but in the normal schools as well. 
In the normal schools reporting courses in agriculture 18 teachers 
devote their entire time to this subject; 72 teach agriculture and 
nature study, science, or some other subject; 9 teach agriculture and 
two other subjects; 1 teaches agriculture, pedagogy, didactics, history 
of education, civics, child study, and school management. Some of 
these are well-organized and comprehensive courses, but a large 
number are inadequate to meet the needs of the prospective teacher. 
Of the 500 summer schools of all classes reporting to this bureau, 
118 gave courses in agriculture in 1912. While a few schools report- 
ing courses in 1911 did not report such work in 1912, the increase in 
the number so reporting in some States was very marked, as, for 
example, Minnesota with 6 in 1911, 15 in 1912; Texas with 8 in 1911, 
17 in 1912. While most of the courses in agriculture are intended 
for elementary-school teachers, there is a considerable increase each 
year in the number of courses designed for high-school teachers. 
One of the newest forms of vocational agricultural education, and 
one that is proving very successful, is the part-time or project method 
adopted for the State-aided agricultural departments of high schools 
in Massachusetts. This scheme follows the recommendations of the 
special committee of the Massachusetts State Board of Education 
appointed to investigate the needs of agricultural education. The 
findings of this committee were discussed in a chapter on agricultural 
education in the Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1911. 
This plan is now followed in the high schools at Hadley, Petersham, 
Northboro, and Harwich, and at Smith’s Agricultural School, North- 
ampton, Mass. Some idea of the success of this method is shown 
by the report of Mr. R. W. Stimson, State agent for agricultural 
education, who has supervision of this work. According to this 
report, out of a group of 25 boys (5 from each of the 5 schools) 2 
earned more than $300 each, 12 earned more than $200 each, and only 
3 earned less than $100 from their home-project work in 1912. The 
total farm earnings for the 25 boys exceeded $5,000. In “The 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Bulletin of the Board of Educa-

REVIEW OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION, 1911-12. 269 
tion, 1912, No. 4,” Mr. Stimson gives suggestions for school officers 
and agricultural-project study, from which the following is taken: 
PRODUCTIVE WORK AND RELATED STUDY. 
The project and part-time plan of vocational agricultural education embodies 
two distinct features. One is productive farm work, supervised by a special 
agricultural instructor, or group of agricultural instructors; the other is study 
directly related to that productive work. Both are essential, and for each care- 
ful provision must be made. 
Of the two, it may, perhaps, prove to be an easier task for the special in- 
structor to inspire and to direct competent agricultural production than to 
amplify and organize the training of his pupils so as to insure thoroughgoing 
study directly bearing upon their individual enterprises. 
PROJECT STUDY SUITABLE FOR VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENTS IN SELECTED 
HIGH SCHOOLS. 
(1) State aid.—The Massachusetts Legislature of 1911 provided State aid, to 
the amount of two-thirds of the special agricultural instructor’s salary, for the 
maintenance of vocational agricultural departments in selected high schools. 
The project method of instruction is prescribed for such departments. 
(2) Necessary groupings.—Iin order to enable one agricultural instructor to 
direct the project work and study of each of his pupils during a full half of 
the school time through a four-year course, groupings by years and projects 
like those following are necessary. Such groupings must hold during the fall 
and spring terms. Certain other studies, like those above stated as open to 
separate agricultural school pupils, may be taken during the winter and during 
the fall and spring terms; but, if taken, must be so timed as not to interfere 
with the agricultural project work and study.

  270 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
(3) Agriculture first—The regulations governing these departments further 
require that when conflict is unavoidable, or when, as at planting time, con- 
tinuous application for a number of consecutive days to his projects becomes 
necessary, all else must yield to the pupil’s proper agricultural instruction, no 
matter at what cost for the time being to his other studies. 
Productive projects fundamental.—First and without fail in vocational educa- 
tion should come the projects termed “ productive.” 
The scale of the improvement and experimental projects may be modest. 
The scale of the productive projects must be extended, occupy as much as pos- 
sible of the time, and engage as much as possible of the energy of the pupil. 
Entering upon a productive project szould be an indication of the pupil’s de- 
termination to go just as far as he can in any given year, not only toward learn- 
ing how to become a self-respecting and self-supporting producer of farm 
products, but also toward putting that knowledge into practice. 
Vocational agricultural education, in short, means, if it means anything, the 
constant interworking of ideas and action. It means the educational unity of 
two practically simultaneous processes, the processes of earning and learning. 
The logic of making the productive projects fundamental is the logic of life. 
First, man must provide his subsistence; next, a surplus for barter, sale, or 
other use. Then out of his surplus he may rightfully take risks, or make non- 
productive investments of time or capital. And this holds true no matter how 
slight the risk nor how modest the nonproductive outlay. 
Happily, projects primarily productive, involving, as they must do, considera- 
tions of quality no less than those of quantity, are not without vital elements 
of training in attractiveness, order, and fitness. Moreover, the boy’s success 
in his enterprises aimed at profit is more than likely to be directly proportion- 
ate to his daring enlistment under the leadership of the newer agriculture. 
Productive projects alone, therefore, may contribute to the education of the 
pupil something of those elements which are the more direct aims of projects 
termed “experimental” and “improvement.” 
The agricultural instructor, in laying out or in approving projects to be under- 
taken by his pupils, will, therefore, make no mistake. His primary concern 
must be vocational agricultural education through productive projects. Pro- 
ductive projects may, in any given year, and at a pinch in all years, be taught 
to the exclusion of all others. “ Improvement” and “experimental” projects, 
where found feasible, are desirable. ‘“ Productive” projects are fundamental. 
  SUGGESTIONS FOR THE AGRICULTURAL INSTRUCTOR. 
(1) Projects.—Suit the size of the project to the capacity of the pupil. Then 
require good work. 
(a) Not too small.—Speed up the boy’s work by making his project big 
enough to require attack and dispatch for its competent execution. Make it so 
big as to avoid all tendency toward habits of dawdling and pottering. Let it 
be big enough to arouse his enthusiasm by making the profit he may reasonably 
expect to get appeal to him as being a real prize. Make the project big enough 
so that a competing job shall not get the boy away from school. In short, let 
each boy’s project be such that it shall serve not an avocational but a vocational 
end of commanding importance. > 
(b) Not too big.—At the same time do not permit a boy to undertake more 
than he can carry out in a thoroughly workmanlike manner. If slow work is 
likely to be finical, fussy, and uneconomic, slovenly work is discreditable. 
Good habits of work should be formed and bad habits either avoided or sharply
-P-A-G-E-297
“REVIEW OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION, 1911-12. 271 
corrected. Projects just within the grasp of the boy may be, and should be 
required to be, capably carried out. 
(2) Project clothes.—Require that ail project work shall be done in working 
clothes. Provide lockers for the ordinary school clothes and shoes and require 
a change of dress when project work is to be done on the school premises. 
Provide, also, conveniences for cleaning up after the work is done. 
This should be looked upon as a perfectly reasonable rule, the nonenforce- 
ment of which would be absurd and must make the project work appear 
ridiculous. 
A uniform course of study was adopted for the district agricul- 
tural schools of Georgia. This was recommended to be put into 
operation at the opening of the schools in 1912. This course, which 
is given below, offers less of the vocational and more of the general 
high-school subjects:

The farm-school idea is gaining rapidly-in popularity. In 1907 
Holly Springs School, in Wake County, N. C., began the cultivation 
of its school grounds. In 1912 there were 17 schools that utilized the 
school grounds for growing of farm crops. An average of more 
than $100 per school was realized from the 14 to 44 acres cultivated. 
The money received for the crop was used to lengthen the school 
term or otherwise increase its efficiency.
-P-A-G-E-298
  272 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
A large part of the labor was done by the pupils, but the parents 
assisted, and thus made it a community enterprise. Usually the best 
farmer of the community was chosen as superintendent, and every 
effort was made to make the school farm a demonstration of the best 
type of farming. Not only did the farmers come together to plant, 
cultivate, and harvest the crop, but night meetings were organized, 
where general farm problems were discussed.t 
A law passed by the North Carolina Legislature and approved 
March 3, 1911, made provision for “county farm-life schools” for 
the training of boys and girls for farm life and home making. The 
Jaw requires that these schools be located in the rural districts, with 
a farm of not less than 25 acres, with necessary barns, also dormi- 
tory accommodations for 25 boys and 25 girls. The State pays $2,500 
toward the maintenance of these schools, when approved by the State 
board of education. One county has such a school in operation and 
another has plans under consideration, a favorable vote having 
already been taken. 
COOPERATION AMONG FARMERS. 
Cooperative societies among farmers have been largely a series of 
failures until within the last two or three decades—failures largely 
due to distrust of one another and to lack of knowledge of best 
methods. Cooperation in the United States has been influenced by 
the recent marked success of such organizations among farmers in 
most European countries, which has been especially notable in Den- 
mark, Italy, France, and Germany. Immigrants from these coun- 
tries are prominent in the development of such organizations in the 
United States. This is particularly true in the Middle West, where 
cooperative creameries and elevators are common. 
Cooperation among farmers is usually considered from the mone- 
tary standpoint, yet it is fairly possible that its chief significance is 
not that of economic gain. While it is true that the economic motive 
has been the dominant influence in the organization of the various 
cooperative societies, and while this has been fully justified by the 
cash return, it is possible that the cooperative influence of the farmer 
as a man and as a citizen is much more important. 
These organizations develop the cooperative spirit, which is one 
of the first essentials of education. They create interest in farming 
and farm methods and develop enthusiasm in community enterprises| 
which finds expression in good roads, schools, churches, law enforce- 
ment, needed legislation, the beautifying of farm buildings, ete.— 
general education of country people that may realize a new concep- 
tion of community consciousness and fuller citizenship.

THE GRANGE, 
Education has been an important factor in the life of most per- 
manent farmers’ organizations. This is instanced in the history of 
the grange (officially known as the Order of Patrons of Husbandry). 
Its purposes are fraternal, social, educational, political, and financial. 
Organized in 1867, it grew very rapidly, particularly from 1873-1875, 
during which three years more than 20,000 subordinate granges were 
organized. During this period the work of the grange was largely 
political and financial. The decline was almost as rapid as the rise, 
and in i880 it was considered dead, except in New England. The 
revival began about 1890, when the social and educational features 
became prominent and appealed to the better class of farmers. 
Since that time they have received greater emphasis and the growth 
has been a slow but constant process, until to-day the grange has 
come to a recognized position as the largest and most influential 
national organization of farmers, with 30,000 subordinate granges, 
and more than 1,000,000 members. 
The educational feature forms a large part of the evening’s pro- 
gram, and is known as the “lecturer’s hour.” Not only are series 
of lectures on agricultural topics arranged, but often a systematic 
form of study of some agricultural problem is carried out. In some 
instances classes are formed and college work is undertaken through 
correspondence courses. It would be difficult to estimate the in- 
fluence of the grange upon the introduction of agriculture into the 
public-school system, as well as the part it has played in the general 
awakening of the people to the needs of the rural school. Since 
1878 the grange has urged that agriculture should be taught in the 
public schools. A Massachusetts granger says: 
Of the four great causes for which the grange of Massachusetts is now 
fighting, three bear directly on the education of the youth. 
The following excerpt is taken from an article on “The educa- 
tional value of the grange,” by Miss Jennie Buell, lecturer, Michigan 
State Grange: 
By far the larger number of men and women now operating farms have had 
scarcely a common-school education, with no special training in agriculture or 
home economics; yet many of them are more than slightly familiar with the 
scientific side of their work. We must look for the source of such knowledge 
outside the accepted educational institutions. These people have been educated 
in one or more of the great schools out of school—of which the grange is cne— 
whose curricula is not so formal as the others, but no less real. 
“J,shall never forget,” one of these grange-educated persons has often been 
heard to say, “the hour that it really came to me that I was connected with 
  
1 Business America, vol. 18, No. 1, pp. 50-54.

274 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
an educational institution through my grange membership. I sat with hun- 
dreds of other attendants upon a national grange session, all of us then guests 
at a State university. The body of the auditorium was filled with grange 
people, while the gallery was occupied by students. On the platform sat the 
university president and the masters of a score of State granges. The presi- 
dent’s address was excellent, though I have forgotten it, but it was when the 
soldierly master of the national grange, with clearly-cut thought and forceful 
language laid bare the vast field of grange educational opportunity, that such 
a thrill ran over me as I had never known before. Never since, as before, 
have I so sorely envied college students because they have what I have not 
had.” 
The grange was instituted among farmers 46 years ago. During these years 
it has carried on quietly a powerful work in the way of discovering and 
training leaders among its own people. Previous to its organization a gather- 
ing of country people was presided over by a lawyer or minister. The grange 
required that it be manned by one of its own, and so, stumblingly, with halt- 
ing and embarrassment, the training process went on until, to-day, there is 
scarcely a corporal’s guard to recall the days when farmers did not conduct 
their own meetings. 
AGRICULTURAL FAIRS. 
Agricultural fairs have been utilized for some time by agricultural 
colleges as a means of carrying agricultural extension both by ex- 
hibits and demonstrations, and in more recent years by lectures as 
well. The benefit is mutual; the fair furnishes a ready. means for 
reaching the people with agricultural information, and the college 
has strengthened the fair associations by its educational exhibits and 
the skilled demonstrators and expert judges. 
About three-fourths of the State institutions regularly send exhibits 
to county and State agricultural fairs in charge of demonstrators, 
who explain the work of the institution and answer questions. 
Some institutions have as many as 9 or 10 demonstrators at a single 
fair. More than 100 fairs had educational exhibits from agricul- 
tural colleges last year. 
Among the advantages claimed by the institutions from their ex- 
hibition at these fairs are: 
(1) Opportunity to meet farmers personally and explain the work of the 
institution. 
(2) Opportunity to secure cooperation in demonstration work. 
(3) Opportunity for the college to conduct agricultural schools and short 
courses and demonstrations while the exhibition is in progress. 
(4) Opportunity to initiate new movements for the improvement of agricul- 
ture. 
(5) Opportunity for the education of fair managers in the conduct of agri- 
cultural exhibitions. 
(6) Opportunity for collecting into one place the results of field dem@pstra- 
tions for the inspection of the public. 
(7) Providing a place for exhibiting the results of contest work by school 
children and country youth. 
   
-P-A-G-E-301
REVIEW OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION, 1911-12, 275 
(8) Enabling the college and station to secure the names and addresses of 
representative farmers and of young people with whom to correspond in dis- 
seminating agricultural information, and in securing cooperation in projects for 
rural improvement. 
The significance of the possibilities in this field may be more readily 
understood when we consider the fact that there are more than 2,500 
fairs and exhibitions devoted to agriculture and related subjects. 
THE FARMERS’ INSTITUTES. 
Farmers’ institutes constitute another form of college extension 
work. They have been in active existence only about 30 years, yet 
the number of sessions held during 1912 was almost 16,000. From 
the beginning the speakers have been largely agricultural college and 
experiment station men, and they have conducted a continuous cam- 
paign of education. The institute worker has not only advocated 
better farming, but better schools for farmers’ children. Every 
problem that confronts the farmer or that has to do with rural life 
finds a place on the farmers’ institute program. While the farmers’ 
institute was organized solely for the farmer’s benefit, the reaction 
has had a great deal to do in shaping policies of the agricultural 
college and experiment station. In these meetings the farmer has 
spoken freely his idea as to what the college should do for him. 
WOMEN’S CLUBS. 
Women’s clubs have done much to quicken the intellectual life of 
the communities in which they have flourished. The activities of 
women’s clubs in the field of agricultural education are particularly 
noticeable in rural towns and villages of Massachusetts. Rural 
women’s clubs are turning their attention to the improvement and 
beautification of the country and the country home, and notwith- 
standing the claim that “country women prefer the sewing society 
to the literary society,” they have organized lecture courses that deal 
with practical farm-life problems. The extension departments of 
the agricultural colleges are frequently asked to furnish the lecturers 
for women’s club meetings. 
“ CHAUTAUQUAS.” 
. The Chautauqua movement becomes each year a more decided fac- 
tor in the education of the farmer. The programs, which in the 
early history of the movement consisted principally of Bible study 
andgrecreation, have been broadened year by year until they have 
become varied and inclusive. Special features dealing with farm 
life are becoming more popular and more frequent, and it is now a 
common occurrence to find these programs offering courses in
-P-A-G-E-302
276 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
stock judging, poultry raising, soils, seed testing, household economy, 
ete. Scores of such gatherings are being organized each year, and 
the favorite field is the rural district. Over 500 local Chautau- 
quas were held the past season in Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, 
and Missouri, more than 100 being held in towns with an average 
population of 500. In some cases, notably Clarinda, Iowa, boys’ 
and girls’ clubs have been formed in connection with the Chautau- 
quas, and exhibitions and demonstrations of their work have been 
made a special feature. 
AGRICULTURAL PRESS, 
Georgia State College of Agriculture has one-third more students this year 
than last, in spite of short crops. The sudden jump in interest over the oppor- 
tunities offered by scientific courses may be traced to three sources: (1) The 
persistent propaganda of the daily and farm press. (2) The Government 
farm demonstration work, in which the college has itself cooperated. (3) The 
“college on wheels,” operated by the college and by different railroads, that 
has penetrated every portion of Georgia, carrying the gospel of scientific and 
diversified agriculture 
While perhaps not all would assign the agricultural press first 
place, as noted in the above quotation from an agricultural paper, 
there is no doubt of the increasing influence of these periodicals. . 
The 500 periodicals devoted to agriculture, with their present circu- 
lation, would, if properly distributed, give several copies monthly to 
each individual engaged in agriculture. The amount of agricultural 
literature for free distribution is enormous, having more than 
doubled in the last five years. 
The dailies are giving an increasingly large amount of space to 
discussions on agricultural topics and to reports of agricultural 
meetings. This has led to the employment of press agents or bureaus 
by some of the agricultural colleges, whose duties are to put inte 
concise, clear statements, and in form that may be used by news- 
papers, the current work of the institution and notices and reports of 
agricultural meetings held under the auspices of the college. 
STATE LEGISLATION. 
Only 14 State legislatures were in session in 1912. Ameng those 
the following legislation bearing on agricultural education is noted: 
       
  Arizona.—Fach high school employing teachers that meet the qualifications 
fixed by the State board of education and providing suitable classrooms and 
laboratory facilities, land, and equipment according to regulations established 
by said board of education, shall receive State aid for teaching agriculturgand 
other vocational pursuits, not to exceed $2,500 per annum; but in no case shall 
he State aid exceed one-haif of the total sum actually expended on such course, 
which must continue not less than eight months each year. Normal schools 
shall participate upon identical terms with high scheols.
-P-A-G-E-303

. 
Kentucky.—An appropriation of $50,000 is made to Eastern Kentucky Normal 
and $25,000 to Western Kentucky Normal, “a necessary part of which shail be 
used to meet as far as possible the pressing demands for agriculturai instruction 
and instruction in domestic science.” 
Massachusetis.—Of the amount given to the agricultural fairs, $200 is set 
aside for premiums on animals and farm crops raised and for excellence in 
stock judging and for general premiums, open to youths under 18. 
MississippimAnnual appropriation of $1,500 is made to each county agri- 
cultural high school, provided that those schools having over 30 boarding 
students shall receive $2,000, and those having over 40 boarding students shall 
receive $2,500. 
New Mexico.—Provides for a State director of industrial education. The 
State board of education is authorized to prescribe and adopt a course of study 
in industrial education. 
Rhode Island.—One-half of cost of maintenance of manual training and house- 
hold arts courses that are approved by the State board of education will be 
paid by the State. 
INDIANA COMMISSION ON INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
A committee of seven was appointed in accordance with a legis- 
lative act approved March 4, 1911— 
to investigate the needs of education in the different industries of Indiana and 
how far the needs are met by existing institutions and what new form of 
educational effort may be advisable to meet those needs. 
This commission found that: 
The shop has never been very successful as a schoolmaster. The principal 
part of education to be gained in a shop is skill in processes. The schools 
must supplement the shop and the two must cooperate to prepare the worker 
properly. But the actual training by the school must be given by teachers who 
have had success and experience as well as adequate knowledge. 
co * * * * * * 
The investigations of the commission disclosed that the people are not only 
ready but anxious for the enlargement of the school work, so as te include 
the best possible preparation for life work for all people, whether they earn 
their living with their heads or their hands. Farmers, employees, employers, 
labor leaders, educators, and social workers who appeared before the commis- 
sion advocated strongly that definite, whole-hearted plans be made. The prob- 
Jem which confronted them was not that it should or should not be done, but 
how it could be done effectively. 
The State board of education has partially opened the way for high 
sehools to introduce vocational subjects and at the same time conform to 
the requirements for college entrance. The colleges are recognizing the change 
made in the high-school curriculum and are giving credits for such work. 
Some chance is thus given to the students to pursue industrial subjects without 
fear that if they later decide to go to college they would lack the qualifications 
for entrance. 
a * cd * * * * 
The largest problem in carrying out industrial and agricultural education 
was found to be in the lack of teachers trained to do the work. If the voca- 
tional subjects are to find and hold the place that is due them in the common
-P-A-G-E-304
  278 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
schools of the State, the teachers must be eZucated to handle them more 
effectively than they have been able to handle such subjects in the past. 
The beginnings of such preparation have been made. It has been demon- 
strated that teachers can be supplied on a small scale and the commission be- 
lieves that adequate provisions will soon furnish adequately equipped teachers 
for a State-wide system of vocational education. 
The report of this committee contains an excellent summary of 
the work of the committee and constitutes a valuable addition to 
the literature upon the subject of industrial education. Their recom- 
mendations, which have recently been incorporated into law, are as 
follows: 
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE INDIANA COMMISSION ON INDUSTRIAL AND AGRICUL- 
TURAL EDUCATION TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE, 
I. That school authorities in cities, towns, and townships be given power to 
establish and maintain such vocational schools and departments for industrial, 
domestic science, and agricultural education as their local situation may war- 
rant, and levy a tax to support the same. 
II. That State aid equal in amount to two-thirds the sum expended in in- 
struction in vocational and technical subjects and such other related subjects 
as are necessary to complete well-rounded courses in industrial, domestic 
science, and agricultural schools or departments as are approved by the State 
board of education be given to the cities, towns, and townships supporting such 
vocational schools or departments. Such aid to be granted only for vocational 
work for pupils above 14, and the courses to be of less than college grade and 
designed to meet the vocational needs of those who are able to profit by the 
instruction offered. 
III. That the State board of education ‘mela three persons of known in- 
terest in and sympathy with vocational education, including a representative 
of employers and of employees; that the superintendent of public instruction 
be the president and executive officer of the board; and that the board be re- 
lieved of the detail work of inspection of high schools by the appointment of 
e@ high-school inspector. 
IV. That the State superintendent, with the approval of the State board of 
education, appoint a deputy to work under the superintendent in the super- 
vision of industrial education, at a salary to be fixed by the board, and who 
shall be removable by the board only for cause. 
V. That the State superintendent make arrangements with Purdue Univer- 
sity by which some person actively connected with the agricultural work of 
Purdue shall be engaged in a dual capacity in supervising agricultural educa- 
tion as an agent of the State superintendent of public instruction and as an 
assistant at Purdue. 
VI. That the teaching of agriculture in the rural elementary and high schools, 
industrial work in city and town schools, and domestic science in all elementary 
and high schools be required in such form as may be outlined as a minimum 
for each by the State board of education. 
VII. In view of the wide difference in the kind of preparation and experi- 
ence required for teachers of different vocational subjects and the diffaalty 
of securing competent instructors in practical as well as theoretical training, 
such teachers should be subject to a separate and distinct system of tests and 
certification, and the board of education should be authorized to pass upon the
-P-A-G-E-305
REVIEW OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION, 1911-12. 279 
qualifications of teachers for vocational schools either by formal certification 
or as a feature of the work of the school. 
That all teachers of elementary agriculture, domestic science, or industrial 
work in schools other than those approved by the State board and securing 
State aid shall be required to pass an examination in such subjects by the 
beginning of the school year 1915. 
VIII. That children between 14 and 16 years be required to attend school 
unless regularly employed. That every child going to work secure first a cer- 
tificate from the school authorities stating that he is of the required age and 
that he has completed the fifth grade or its equivalent. ‘That the certificate be 
kept by his employer, and when he leaves his employ be returned by the em- 
ployer to the official issuing jit. 
IX. That when the school authorities have established vocational courses ap- 
proved by the State board for boys and girls from 14 to 16 and have formally 
accepted the provisions of the act permitting it they may require every boy and 
girl from 14 to 16 who is employed to return to the day school for instruction for 
at least five hours per week, employers to be required to allow time off for 
such instruction. 
X. That whenever courses in domestic science of practical value have been 
established the school authorities shall require girls to take such courses at 
some time in the elementary schools, and no girls under 16 years of age should 
be allowed to leave the schools who have not had such courses. 
XI. That contracts of apprenticeship shall specify that the child shall be 
given at least five hours per week of instruction in the day schools in English, 
citizenship, physiology and hygiene, use of safety devices, and such other sub- 
jects as may be approved by the State board of education. 
XII. Whenever the county board iof education of any county shall deter- 
mine to establish a county agent for the purpose of advancing agriculture, 
domestic science, and industrial work, and the necessary appropriation has been 
made by the county council to provide for the maintenance of such agent, State 
aid shall be granted equal to one-half the salary of such agent, but not to exceed 
$1,000 to any one county, so long as the work of the county agent is approved 
by the State board of education. Such agent to be appointed by Purdue Uni- 
versity with the approval of the county board of education and the State board 
of education. 
The county agent shall cooperate with farmers’ institutes, farmers’ clubs, 
and other agricultural organizations in the county and conduct practical farm 
demonstrations, boys’ and girls’ clubs and contest work, and other movements 
for the betterment of country life, and shall on the request of the county 
superintendent give aid and advice to the superintendent or teachers of the 
county in agricultural instruction. 
XIII. That wherever the schools of a township have been consolidated a 
full course in agriculture be offered, modified to meet the vocational needs of 
the community, and a fair-sized demonstration form be operated by the school 
for practical instruction. 
That where consolidation has not taken place the township may provide 
demonstration plats in connection with each school or a central demonstration 
farm. The director should be an itinerant teacher, giving ‘instruction in all 
the schools of the township and supervising the teaching of agriculture in the 
giggles. 
Two or more townships should be authorized to combine, wherever feasible, 
for the establishment of a demonstration farm or plats and maintenance of 
schools or an itinerant teacher.

XIV. That the agricultural extension department of Purdue University be 
liberally supported, to the end that the present practical work in agriculture 
and domestic science be extended and enlarged and that facilities be provided 
for active cooperation with the agricultural work to be established in the 
schools. That Indiana University and the State Normal be liberally supported 
in the preparation of teachers of domestic science, industrial or agricultural 
subjects, and the investigation of the educational problems connected with 
vocational education. 
XV. That the public libraries should cooperate with the schools and the in- 
dustries in providing sufficient material for extension work. Every library 
should be a center for industrial workers, where the literature of their craft 
should be available in convenient form for serious study. Libraries in the rural 
districts should do a like service for agricultural workers. 
XVI. That the State charitable and correctional institutions which maintain 
industrial, domestic science, and agricultural instruction be under the super- 
vision of the State board of education in an advisory way as to such instruction. 
XVII. That facilities be provided for vocational guidance by a survey of the 
vocational possibilities of the community, by a central bureau of information 
and investigation, and by concerted action by teachers to guide youths to the 
wise choice of a vocation.

CHAPTER X. 
PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 
By ©. A. PRossEr, 
Secretary National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education. 
The years 1912 and 1913 have been harvest time for the cause of 
vocational education in the United States. More advancement has 
been made in this period than in any previous five years since the 
beginning of the movement on this side of the water. The ground 
gained will be discussed under the heads of—I. Progress in legisla- 
tion. II. Progress in public opinion. III. Progress in the recogni- 
tion of principles and policies. IV. Progress in localities. 
I. PROGRESS IN LEGISLATION. 
It is the purpose of this statement to point out, in a general way, 
both what was accomplished in the year 1912, and the legislation 
which is under consideration in different States of the Union for the 
year 1913. 
LEGISLATION FOR 1912. 
Wisconsin.—On the ist of January, 1912, the Wisconsin law 
went into effect requiring all employed children between 14 and 16 
who had not graduated from the elementary school to attend part- 
time and continuation schools and courses not less than five and not 
more than eight hours per week. 
Massachusetts—The Massachusetts act of 1911, codifying and re- 
vising the vocational education law, was amended by chapter 106 of 
the acts of 1912. Up to the passage of this act, State aid for even- 
ing instruction was confined to those classes which were made up 
entirely of those who were employed during the daytime in occu- 
pations for which the work of the evening class gave more or less 
direct preparation. Notwithstanding a strong feeling that evening 
classes in household arts for factory girls, who are not employed in 
the home during the day, were greatly needed and should receive 
encouragement, it was impossible to aid them by State grants. The 
act of 1912 (ch. 106) extended aid from the treasury of the Common- 
wealth to classes in the household arts, approved by the board of 
education. for women, no matter how engaged during the day. 
281
-P-A-G-E-308
282 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
The Page and Lever bills—These two measures provided Federal 
aid for vocational education. The Lever bill—House 22871—for 
extension teaching in agriculture to mature farmers, $3,500,000 an- 
nually, and the Page bill—Senate No. 3—a final total of $14,000,000 
annually for extension teaching in agriculture for farmers, branch 
testing and breeding stations, preparation of teachers for service in 
vocational schools, and for vocational schools giving instruction 
through all-day, part-time, continuation, .and evening classes for 
the farm, the home, and the shop. 
The Lever bill having passed the House, and the Page bill iiving 
passed the Senate, the inability of the friends of these two measures 
to agree upon a satisfactory compromise in Joint Conference Com- 
mittee between the two Houses in the closing hours of the last Con- 
gress caused both bills to die in conference. The working out of this 
problem raises questions as to the relationship of the National Gov- 
ernment to the States in the field of education which will be of in- 
terest not only to educators, but to every student of our constitutional 
Government. 
: VOCATIONAL LEGISLATION, 1913. 
Indiana.—The commission on industrial and agricultural educa- 
tion for this State, appointed in 1911, presented to the legislature, in 
connection with an excellent report on the subject of vocational 
education, a series of bills which were made laws practically without 
opposition. 
The compulsory education laws of the State were codified and 
some excellent changes made in the machinery for their enforcement. 
A State board of truancy, consisting of the State superintendent of 
public instruction, a member of the State board of education, and the 
secretary of the State board of charities was created to enforce the 
new law. It will be impossible within the limits of this statement 
to even point out all the praiseworthy features of this codification. 
No child under 16 years of age is permitted to enter employment until 
he has passed the fifth grade in the common schools. All children 
between 14 and 16 years of age must be either in school or at work. 
When they lose their employment, they are required to return to 
school. 
In what is probably the most comprehensive statute yet enacted, 
the Indiana Legislature established a State system of vocational edu- 
cation, giving State aid for training in industries, agriculture, and 
domestic science, through all-day, part-time, continuation, and eve- 
ning schools. This work is to be carried on either in separate schools 
or in departments of regular high schools, In every case the local 
control is vested in the regular board of education for the commu-
-P-A-G-E-309
PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 283 
nity and the laws are to be administered as a whole by the State 
board of education. 
The meaning of such terms as “ vocational education,” “ indus- 
trial education,” “ agricultural education,” “ domestic science,” “ eve- 
ning class,” “ part-time class,” as used in the law, is defined in the 
first section, and the definitions themselves are, with some slight 
modifications, taken from the Massachusetts act of 1911. 
An “approved school or department” is defined to mean an organi- 
zation, under a separate director or head, of courses, pupils and 
teachers approved by the State board of education. In a sense, when 
the approved work is given under the same roof with other public 
school activities, the work remains separate, in order that it may 
realize its dominant purpose of fitting for wage earning. 
The instruction which is to receive State aid is to be of less than 
college grade and designed to meet the vocational needs of children 
over 14 years of age who seek preparation for their work, most of 
whom come to the vocational schools without having finished the 
elementary school course. Attendance upon such day or part-time 
classes is restricted to persons over 14 and under 25 years of age; and 
upon evening classes to persons over 17 years of age. The State 
board of education, which is charged with the administration of the 
act, has been reorganized so that seven of its members must be profes- 
sional educators and five may be laymen. Two of these laymen must 
be citizens of prominence, three of them shall be actively interested in 
and of known sympathy with vocational education. One of these last 
three shall be a representative of employees and one of employers. 
The State superintendent of public instruction is made the exec- 
utive officer, and a deputy superintendent is to be placed under him, 
in charge of industrial and domestic science education. The agricul- 
tural work is to be directed by another deputy or agent who shall 
combine with his duties as assistant at Purdue University, the agri- 
cultural and mechanical college of the State, that of supervising the 
agricultural education under the State superintendent. 
Local communities are required to supply the plant and equipment 
for carrying on the work which, when it has been approved by the 
State board of education, is to be reimbursed out of the State treas- 
ury to the amount of two-thirds the salary of each teacher giving in- 
struction either in vocational or technical subjects. 
In order to secure the benefit of the knowledge and cooperation of 
the layman, local school authorities are required to appoint, subject 
to the approval of the State board of education, advisory committees 
composed of members representing local trades and industries, whose 
duty it shall be to counsel with and advise the board and other officials 
in the conduct of the affairs of the school. “ »
-P-A-G-E-310
284 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
A special tax of 1 cent on each $100 of taxable property in the 
State is authorized. Any part of the fund remaining at the close of 
the fiscal year, not allotted to schools under the act, is to be placed 
in a permanent fund for the support and encouragement of vocational 
education. 
Pennsylvania.—A bill is now pending before the Pennsylvania 
Senate which passed the House on the 10th day of March, 1913, by a 
vote of 182 to 2, and which seems certain to become a law at an early 
date. This bill is very similar to the Massachusetts act of 1911 and 
to the Indiana act of the present year. Such terms as “vocational 
education,” “industrial education,” “agricultural education,” are de- 
fined in the same way. The State board of education administers the 
act, with the State superintendent of public instruction as the exec- 
utive officer. 
The schools established give training in agriculture, trades, in- 
dustries, and home economics, in day, part-time, and evening classes. 
Local communities are required to build and equip the school. When 
their work has been approved by the State board of education the 
community is reimbursed in an amount equal to two-thirds the salary 
of the instructors. 
The regular board of education is in charge of the local schools. 
They are required to appoint advisory committees composed of mem- 
bers representing local trades, industries, and occupations, to aid them 
in making the work practical and effective. 
New Jersey.—A bill creating a State system for vocational educa- 
tion is on its way through the New Jersey Legislature and will 
doubtless be passed. In general, this measure is similar to those of 
Massachusetts, Indiana, and Pennsylvania. The terms employed are 
similarly defined in the opening section. The work is to be admin- 
istered by the State board of education and local boards of education, 
and may be carried on in either approved schools or departments; 
these departments must consist of separate courses, pupils, and 
teachers. 
Advisory committees are not provided for in the act, but it is 
expected that these will be required under authority conferred upon 
the board of education by previous legislation. The State aid for 
schools which have met with the approval of the board of education 
is to be equal to one-half the amount appropriated for the city or 
district for the current expenses of the schools. Not more than 
$10,000 is to be given by the State as reimbursement to any one school 
or department, and not more than $80,000 is to be expended under the 
terms of the act. 
Connecticut—In 1909 this State established a system of State trade 
schools administered by the State board of education, through its
-P-A-G-E-311
  PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 285 
secretary, as the executive officer. Two schools have been established 
under this act—one at New Britain and one at Bridgeport. 
A law is now before the Connecticut Assembly which bids fair to 
pass, extending the scope of the act of 1909.1. The State board of 
education is authorized to establish part-time, continuation, and eve- 
ning schools, and the school authorities in every city, town, or district 
are empowered to establish all-day, part-time, or evening schools, 
giving instruction in trades, useful occupations, and vocations. In 
such cases the local community must supply the plant and the equip- 
ment. When the work has been approved by the board of education, 
the State shall pay one-half the expenses of instruction, not to exceed 
in any case $50 per scholar in average attendance. The State board 
of education and local authorities are required to appoint advisory 
committees composed of employers and employees to give advice and 
assistance in the operation of these schools. 
When part-time and continuation classes are established by local 
authorities they are empowered to make the attendance upon such 
classes compulsory upon any or all children between 14 and 18 years 
of age who are not attending other schools. Such attendance shall be 
required for not less than 340 hours per year. Both parent and 
employer are already responsible for this attendance. 
New York.—By the act of 1910,? a system of State aided vocational 
schools was established to be administered by the State board of 
education and local boards of education through the State. A law | 
now pending, which seems certain to pass, extends the grants by the 
State, from day schools of various kinds giving training in agricul- 
ture, home economics, and trades and industries, to part-time, con- 
tinuation, and evening schools as well. The aid is increased from 
$500 for the first teacher employed in a vocational school, and $250 
for each additional teacher, to two-thirds the salary of the first teacher 
and one-third the salary of each additional teacher. On the new 
basis, this aid will amount to about 28 per cent of the operating ex- 
penses of the school in larger.centers, and about 39 per cent in rural 
communities; the remainder of the cost of maintenance being made by 
the local communities. An additional aid of $200 is given in some 
eases for the salary of instructors in agriculture in rural schools, 
so that they may be employed 11 months during the year, and thus 
be able to supervise summer work on the home farms of the pupils. 
Another law which will doubtless receive favorable consideration 
at the present session, authorizes local communities to establish part- 
time and continuation schools and to require permit children, so 
called, between 14 and 16 years of age, who have not graduated from 
the elementary school, to attend for from four to eight hours a week,

-P-A-G-E-312
  286 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
between 8 a. m. and 5 p. m., for not less than 36 weeks per year. This 
is purely a local option measure, putting into the hands of the local 
board of education the power to extend the compulsory education 
Jaw in this way. 3 
In cities of the first and second class, permit boys between 14 and 
16 have been required to attend evening schools. Under this pro- 
posed legislation, it is possible for these cities to substitute attendance 
upon part-time and continuation classes during the day, as described 
in the foregoing, in place of such evening attendance. 
Iinois—Two bills are now pending before the Tlinois Legisla- 
ture, one known as the Blair bill and one known as the Cooley bill. 
The former proposes to carry on, with State aid, vocational education 
through the regular public schools of the State, and the latter through 
a separate State board of control and a separate local board of control, 
entirely independent of the regular public school system. The former 
is sometimes known as the “ unit” system and the latter as the “ dual” 
system. Every circumstance seems to indicate that neither of these . 
bills will pass at the present session, and therefore they need not be 
discussed here, as they do not seem to represent prospective legislation. 
Washington.—A bill is now pending before the Washington Legis- 
lature, which does not seem likely to pass at this session, modeled on 
the same lines as what is known as the “Cooley” or “dual” system 
bill of Illinois. Inasmuch as the intent here is to discuss only actual 
and prospective legislation this measure will not be treated here. 
Massachusetts —The act of 1911, chapter 471, is likely to be 
amended so as to authorize school committees, with the approval of 
the State board of education, to require every child between 14 and 16 
years of age who is regularly employed not less than six hours a day 
to attend school at the rate of not less than four hours per week 
during the school year. The course of study for these children must 
be approved by the board of education. The attendance must be 
during the daytime between 7 o’clock in the morning and 6 in the 
evening of any working day or days. 
Another measure which will probably become a law raises the com- 
pulsory school age from 14 to 15 for all children and for illiterates 
from 16 to 17. Attendance on a vocational school of children 14 years 
of age is accepted as school attendance. 
Rhode Island.—Chapter 845 of the acts of 1912 grants State aid to 
the amount of one-half the operating expenses to towns carrying on 
instruction in agriculture and training in the mechanic and other 
industrial arts which are approved as to equipment, instruction, ex- 
penditure, supervision, and conditions of attendance by the State 
board of education. The work of the manual training high schools 
and other secondary schools maintaining manual training depart-
-P-A-G-E-313
  PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 287 
ments is specifically exempted from State grants under this act. Five 
thousand dollars is appropriated to meet the allotments of money 
under the act. 
New Mexico—tIt adopted a law, chapter 52, acts of 1912, which, 
while it does not grant money out of the State treasury for the benefit 
of vocational schools, did empower the State board of education to 
_ prescribe and adopt a course of study in industrial education for the 
public schools; required the teaching of this course in the schools and 
authorized the appointment by the State superintendent of public 
instruction of a State director of industrial education, whose duties 
were defined in the statutes and whose compensation was appropriated. 
Il. PROGRESS IN PUBLIC OPINION. 
The press fairly teems with editorials and signed articles, which 
indicate an overwhelming sentiment in favor of enlarging and ex- 
tending the scope of education in this country to include the training 
of the great mass of our workers for wage-earning occupations of 
every kind. ‘The friends of antichild labor have joined hands with 
the friends of industrial education to use the part-time and continu- 
ation schools both as a means of reducing the number of hours of 
employment of children under 16 years of age, and as a means of 
giving these children, so long neglected, both a general and practical 
education which they need as their way out to happiness and effi- 
ciency. Social workers advocate vocational training as the largest 
factor in a program for increasing the efficiency of the individual 
worker, to the end that he may earn a better wage and have a higher 
standard of living. Economists declare that only by making the 
individual a better workman can wages keep pace with the rising tide 
of prices and the struggle for shorter hours, and the minimum wage 
succeed on a permanent basis. Thoughtful statesmen recognize that 
only by a nation-wide system of practical education, a step which 
Germany took 30 years ago, will we be able to maintain our present 
position in the markets of the world. Employers and employees are 
beginning to find common ground in a mutual effort to conserve the 
skill of the American workingman. Educators see in the movement 
for vocational education a means to reduce the waste pile of human 
life, to reach groups of children long neglected, and to democratize 
the public schools in the country in a true sense. 
Practically every great national organization in, this country— 
commercial, industrial, social, economic, and educational—has voiced 
the sentiment of its State and local branches everywhere, both by 
resolutions and more or less active work, in behalf of this great cause. 
All of these gave their support to the attempt to secure national     
-P-A-G-E-314
  38 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
grants for vocational education at the last Congress. Among the 
organizations that favor practical training are the following: 
National Metal Trades Association. 
National Association of Manufac- 
turers. 
American Federation of Labor. 
National Society for the Promotion of 
Industrial Education. 
National Child Labor Committee. 
National Committee on Prison Labor. 
American Association for Labor Legis- 
' dation. : 
National Education Association. American Society of Equity (repre- 
senting more than 6,000,000 farmers). 
National Farmers’ Grange. 
National Farmers’ Congress. 
Department of Superintendence, Na- 
tional Education Association. 
International Congress of 
Women. 
American Foundrymen’s Association. 
National Domestic Science Association. 
National Committee on Agricultural Farm 
Education. 
American Education and Cooperative 
Farmers’ Union. 
Chamber of Commerce of the United 
States of America. American Society for the Prevention 
and Study of Infant Mortality. 
Southern Commercial Congress. 
Southern Educational Association. 
General Federation of Women’s Clubs. 
‘United Textile Workers of America. 
Resolutions favoring vocational education have been framed by 
many organizations. 
The National Association of Manufacturers, in its meeting of 
May 21, 1912, after reciting that the loss of some 50 per cent of the 
children to the schools in the middle of the elementary course repre- 
sented a loss to the Nation in human resources of $250,000,000,000, 
pledged “its earnest support of the following principles of educa- 
tional betterment as essential to society and to the spiritual, social, 
and physical welfare of the youth ”: 
1. Continuation schools for that half of the children who leave school at 14 
years of age, and mostly in the fifth and sixth grades, these continuation schools 
to be liberally cultural and at the same time to be extremely practical and re- 
lated as directly as possible to the occupations in which the several students are 
engaged. 
2. The development of a modern apprenticeship system wherein by contract 
the respective and equal rights of employer and employee are fully recognized, 
the entire trade is taught, together with such other subjects as are essential to 
good citizenship. 
3. The development of secondary continuation or trade schools, by which 
the more efficient of the great army of boys and girls who will enter the con- 
tinuation schools may progress from these lower continuation schools, as in 
some other countries, to the foremost places in industry and commerce. 
4. Compulsory education through adolescence, being until the 17th or 18th 
year, attendance being in the all-day school until the 14th year, and thereafter 
in either the all-day schools or in the continuation schools for not less than one- 
half day per week, without loss of wages for hours in school. 
5. The strengthening of all truancy laws and the development of public 
sentiment in support thereof. 
6. The training of teachers in thoroughgoing methods of industrial practice, 
including as part of such training extended experience in actual shopwork.
-P-A-G-E-315
  PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. e 289 
7. The establishment of independent State and local boards of industrial 
education, consisting of one-third each, professional educators, employers, and 
employees, thereby insuring, as in the more successful European countries, the 
proper correlation of the schools and the industries. 
8. The development of the vocational and creative desires of the concrete, or 
hand-minded children now in the grades, discouraged, anxious to quit, and often 
called backward, only because the education now tendered them is abstract and 
misfit. 
9. The establishment of shop schools and part-time schools whenever 
practicable. 
10. The establishment of departments or centers of vocational guidance, so 
that the great majority of the children who now enter industry at 14 with no 
direction, 85 per cent falling into the “blind alley” occupations, may with the 
reversal of these figures, as in some other countries, enter, under advice, in- 
telligently and properly into the progressive and improving occupations. 
Resolwed by the National Association of Manufacturers, That it is the im- 
perative need of the industrial workers and employers of the country that 
. thoroughgoing systems of industrial education be everywhere established, so 
that our factories may be more constantly and better employed, that standards 
of skill and of output may continuously be improved, and that foreign and 
domestic markets may be better held and extended. 
The National Education Association on July 10, 1912, urged upon 
“the educational people of this country, as well as upon others who 
are engaged in social work,” the necessity of definite progress along 
the line of vocational guidance for youth; that such guidance be car- 
ried on under the direct control of a vocational adviser, or expert, 
who shall-be appointed by and subject to the control of a council of 
laymen in the several local communities; that the courses of study in 
the elementary schools be so enriched as to make it possible to dis- 
cover the tastes, tendencies, and abilities of the child previous to the 
time when such vocational decisions are to be made; and that the 
Federal Government pass a law carrying with it an appropriation 
sufficiently liberal to render possible its operation, which shall have 
for its end the ultimate improvement of the home, shop, and farm 
through vocational training. 
The General Federation of Women’s Clubs, in July, 1912, em- 
phasizing the restoration and preservation of the fertility of our soil, 
as a matter of supreme importance urged the passage of the Lever 
agricultural extension bill, then before Congress, and pledged the 
cooperation of its clubs with agricultural colleges and household 
economics departments in holding household conferences in every 
community, and in an endeavor to open such departments in the 
public schools for extension purposes, and thatthe clubs would study 
those phases of home economics that will introduce into the home the 
same scientific standards as prevail in other fields of labor. 
The American Federation of Labor, in its annual convention in 
Rochester, November 19, 1912, urged “a greater interest in the edu- +
-P-A-G-E-316
  290 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
cation of the 25,000,000 children of school age in the United States, 
50 per cent of whom leave school by the end of the sixth grade at 
approximately 14 years of age.” 
It commended the Page bill then before Congress, and said: 
‘The Page bill * * *. creates a plan for Federal grants to secondary 
public schools, thus giving direction to a complete scheme of education in which 
all the children of the Nation should receive a just and equitable share of at- 
tention. 
Much time and attention has already been given to this bill by the president 
of the American Federation of Labor, as well as by the legislative committee, 
and considerable hope has been expressed for its ultimate success. * * * 
Every effort should be made to secure such legislation, guaranteeing high Fed- 
eral standards with the widest possible latitude within the States, for adapta- 
tion to the specific needs of the various communities. 
Ill. PROGRESS IN THE RECOGNITION OF PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES. 
At its annual convention in December, 1912, the National Society 
for the Promotion of Industrial Education adopted, by practically 
a unanimous vote, after a prolonged discussion, a statement of prin- 
ciples and policies in State Jezislation for vocational education, which 
it is believed promises to secure the best results in adapting practical 
training to the social, economic, industrial, educational, and adminis- 
trative conditions of the various States of the Union. This declara- 
tion follows (condensed) : 
State aid is necessary to stimulate and encourage communities to carry on 
work in vocational education. 
Vocational education includes all forms of specialized education, the control- 
ling purposes of which are to fit for useful occupations, as industrial education, 
agricultural education, commercial education, and household-arts educaticn. 
Industrial education denotes the field of vocational education designed to 
meet the needs of the manual wageworker in the trades and industries-and the 
household. 
Agricultural education is that form of vocational education which fits for the 
occupations connected with the tillage of the soil, the care of domestic animals, 
forestry, and other useful work on the farm. 
Commercial education denotes the field of vocational education designed to 
meet the needs of the wage earner employed in such business and commercial 
pursuits as bookkeeping, stenography, typewriting, clerical work, salesmanship. 
Household arts education is that form of vocational education which fits for 
nonwage-earning occupations connected with the household. 
Vocational schools include all agricultural, industrial, commercial, and house- 
hold arts schools, the controlling purpose of which is to fit for useful occupa- 
tions, and which deal with pupils above 14 years of age and below college grade, 
as indicated below. 
An all-day vocational school is a school giving training to young persons over 
14 years of age who can give one or more years to such preparation before 
entering employment. 
A part-time vocational school is a school foe persons engaged in useful em- 
ployment which affords instruction during a portion of the working time of 
the pupils that is supplementary to such employment.
-P-A-G-E-317
  PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 291 
Eyening schools or classes in industry or agriculture are schools or classes 
attended by persons over 16 years of age, already engaged in useful employment, 
which provide instruction directly related to such employment. 
Evening schools or classes in household arts are schools or classes giving 
instruction in home making to pupils over 16 years of age, however employed 
during the day. 
The proper expenditure of State moneys for vocational schools should be 
fully safeguarded, but initiative should be left to local authorities. State aid 
should be sufficient to justify participation by the State in control and ad- 
ministration. Experience seems to show that the best results are secured 
when the local community furnishes the plant and equipment and pays ap- 
proximately half of the operating expenses. 
Legislation should leave large discretion to the State boards of 
control in the definition of principles and standards for the inspec- 
tion, supervision, approval, and reimbursement for the work. At- 
tendance should be free upon a State-aided vocational school for all 
persons in the State otherwise eligible, whether they are or are not 
residents of the community in which the school is maintained. 
For the purpose of this statement of principles, it is necessary to 
distinguish sharply between administrative and executive functions. 
Administrative control is that exercised by a State board of educa- 
tion or a State commission over vocational education or a local 
educational authority in such matters as expenditure of moneys, 
courses of study, employment of teachers, etc. Executive functions 
are those exercised by a superintendent of schools, commissioner 
of education, or the director of an industrial school, in carrying out 
the decisions of the board of control and in other necessary executive 
~work, 
Effective adminstrative control of both vocational and general 
education requires the existence of a State board possessing sufficient 
powers to supervise effectively all forms of education receiving 
financial aid from the State. It may be necessary sometimes to 
establish a special administrative board of control for vocational 
education. Effective local administrative control of both vocational 
and general education requires the existence of a local school board 
or committee possessed of ample power to establish and maintain, 
under proper State supervision, general and vocational schools, and 
it may sometimes be necessary to procure the creation of a special 
board of control for vocational education. Wherever practicable 
representatives of both employers and employees should be on admin- 
istrative boards. 
For effective executive or expert control the following features 
should be recognized: (1) The creation by law of a separate depart- 
ment for vocational education, whether under the regular State 
board of education or otherwise; (2) the placing at the head of this 
department of a competent deputy commissioner, superintendent,  
-P-A-G-E-318
  292 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
director, or supervisor, who shall be an expert in vocational educa- 
tion and shall be familiar with industrial conditions; (3) a salary 
sufficient to attract and hold a competent man, and such conditions 
of tenure of office as would remove him from the ranks of political 
employees; (4) the delegation to this official of large powers and 
responsibilities for superintending the work. 
Efficiency in vocational education requires different methods of 
school administration, different courses of study, different qualifica- 
tions of teachers, different equipment, different ways of meeting the 
needs of pupils, and a much greater flexibility in adapting means to 
ends than is possible of development under the ordinary routine of 
the public-school system. For these reasons, whether administered 
by regular public-school authorities or a separate board of control, 
and whether conducted in a separate building or under the same roof 
as the regular school, the work in vocational education should be 
carried on separately and independently from that of general edu- 
cation. Experience seems to prove that, where conditions admit, 
separate schools are best. 
Should the State desire to give aid to vocational departments in 
the regular schools, such a department should be defined in the law 
as a department having a separate head with a separate organiza- 
tion of classes, teachers, and courses of study, and separate facilities 
for shopwork. The academic work should be such as. meets the needs 
of the pupils of this department. 
The unquestionable tendency in American edueation is toward 
broadening the responsibility of the State for the educational conser- 
vation of the child up to 16 years of age. In this forward movement 
the following principles and steps seem to be demanded in con- 
nection with vocational as well as general education: (1) The State 
should have the care and the responsibility for the training and 
educational welfare of all children, at least until they become 16 
years of age. (2) No child under 16 years of age should be permit- 
ted to go to work unless he is at least 14 years of age and has reached 
a prescribed minimum educational standard which should not be 
less than that necessary to meet the test for entering the sixth grade 
of the regular schools or its equivalent. (3) All children between 14 
and 16 years of age should be compelled either to attend school or 
to enter employment, and when not employed should be required to 
return to school. (4). Where State-wide action is not yet practicable, 
local communities should be authorized by law to decide either by a 
referendum or by the action of a local board of control, whether 
children between 14 and 16 years of age, employed during the day, 
should be required to attend part-time classes for a period of not 
less than four hours a week out of their working time. (5) As fast
-P-A-G-E-319
PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 293 
as conditions permit, we should move in every State in the direction 
of State-wide compulsory part-time education for those between 
14 and 16 years of age, who are employed as wageworkers. 
This forward movement has received prompt and favorable rec- 
ognition at the hands of the United States Commissioner of 
Education through the following bulletins issued by the Bureau 
of Education in 1911, 1912, and 1913: 
1911: No. 2. Opportunities for graduate study in agriculture. 
1912: No. 1, Courses of study for rural school teachers. 
No. 4. Mathematics in technical secondary schools. 
No. 6. Agricultural education in secondary schools. 
No. 9. Country schools for city boys. 
No. 18. Teaching language through agriculture and domestic science. od 
No. 20. Readjustment of an American rural high school to the needs of 
the community. 
No. 28. Cultivating school grounds in Wake County, N. C. 
1918: No. 2. Training courses for rural teachers. 
No. 6. Agricultural instruction in high schools. ; 
The demand for teachers with trade training already far exceeds 
the supply now available, and the rewards promise to be greater than 
for regular teachers, as they must ‘be to attract the successful artisan 
tothe work. Eight States are this year either creating or extending 
the scope of a system of State-aided vocational schools. Not less 
than ten others are making plans to set up such a system next year. 
Federal aid for vocational education at an early date is certain. We 
are rushing into a large program of practical education in this 
country, not only without teachers properly qualified by training 
and experience for the work and practically without any successful 
scheme for dealing with the problem of making the artisan and the 
mechanic a teacher of his own calling, but also without even the 
beginning of well-considered attempts to deal with the problem and 
without even a clear knowledge of what a training class could and 
should do for him, Only by experimenting with schemes which 
promise well will we learn how to face this great and important task. 
Recognizing the great need for prompt action in dealing with this 
question, and that this action should be preceded by a recognition 
of the principles and policies that should be observed in the attempt 
to gather persons with trade experience from the trades and prepare 
them to meet the demands of the service in the great number of 
industrial schools of every kind which are soon to be established, a 
great deal of attention was given to the question by the national 
society at its last annual convention. 
A statement of principles and policies to be observed in the train- 
ing of teachers for boys’ work was drawn up by Dr. David Snedden, 
commissioner of education for Massachusetts, and Mr. C. R. Allen,  
-P-A-G-E-320
  294 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
agent of the Massachusetts State Board of Education; and of.those 
to be observed in the training of teachers for girls’ work, by Mrs. 
Mary Schenck Woolman, president Women’s Educational and 
Industrial Union, Baston, Mass., and Miss Florence M. Marshall, 
principal, Manhattan Trade School for Girls, New York City. The 
statement as to teachers for boys’ work follows: 
TBACHERS FOR BOYS’ WORK. 
1. One of the most serious problems of the industrial school of the future is 
to deal with adolescents, taking them as they come and fitting them for prac- 
tical tests of social and industrial efficiency. 
2. The ordinary type of pedagogical training given to prospective teachers 
will not serve to adequately prepare them for successful service in such in- 
dustrial schools. 
8. Successful teaching must be based upon the real experience in the line 
taught. 
4. Trade training alone will not make good teachers. 
5. The industrial school has problems peculiar to itself, which call for 
special training for teachers in such schools. 
6. We are not likely to secure good teachers for industrial schools by draw- 
ing teachers from regular public schools and giving them additional training. 
7. Pseudo-experience, such as is gained by ordinary students in school: and 
college shops, will not replace actual practical experience. 
8. “Student ” experience under real conditions, such as is gained by a short 
period of contact with industrial environment, will not replace real experience. 
9. A person who has passed through college, whether general or technical, 
by a continuous school process, is not likely to make a successful industrial 
school-teacher, nor to afford good material for a special training course for 
such teachers. 
10. We can not secure, as teachers in industrial schools, those competent to 
hold desirable and profitable positions in industry as long as we pay them on 
the same basis as regular public-school teachers. 
11. In training competent industrial school-teachers, we must expect a 
greater per capita cost than we are in the habit of expecting in the training 
of ordinary school-teachers. 
12. A scheme for training industrial school-teachers, starting with adults who 
have already had successful experience as teachers in regular schools, is not 
likely to succeed. 
13. A scheme of training will not be efficient which proposes to deal with 
those who bring to it only a general secondary school preparation, and which 
proposes to give them during the college phase of their education all necessary 
training to fit them for successful teaching in industrial schools. 
14. The evening course, which proposes to train persons with experience em- 
ployed during the day, is only a partial solution of the problem, owing to its 
inability to afford an opportunity for observation and practice in teaching 
during the course. 
15. The German experience shows that the most effective teachers must be 
drawn from the industries. 
16. The most effective scheme known thus far is the German scheme, in- 
volving the following steps: (a) A technical training in the middle technical 
school, followed by (0) a prolonged experience as an actual worker in the in-  
-P-A-G-E-321
  
PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. : 295 
dustry which is to be taught; (c) a return to a training course giving special 
training for teaching in an industrial school, accompanied by an experience as 
an assistant teacher in an actual school. 
17. In view of the fact that (@) we must get our efficient teachers from the 
industries, and (b) that these people can not afford to take full-time day 
courses, the most promising plan would seem to be a course which provides for 
a series of evening unit courses, each unit dealing with some specific phase of 
the special instruction required for an efficient teacher; following this by em- 
ployment in industrial schools as an assistant teacher, with an obligation on 
the part of the industrial school to conduct a certain amount of further nor- 
mal training work with these assistant teachers. 
18. The most promising plan for training teachers for industrial schools 
would involve the following steps: (a) The gathering of the pupils with suc- 
cessful experience in the industries; (0) evening unit courses for the student 
while he continues to work at his calling; (c) each unit dealing with some 
phase or factor of the preparation required for an efficient teacher; (d) fol- 
lowed by employment as an assistant teacher in an industrial school; (e) with 
obligation on the part of the school to give a certain amount of additional 
normal training to him after he enters the service. 
IV. PROGRESS IN LOCALITIES. 
State commissions and studies are being carried on in a number of 
Commonwealths as a basis for later action. The Indiana Commis- 
sion on Agricultural and Industrial Education has just made its 
report, 1913, to the legislature. Massachusetts has completed the 
study of the possibilities of part-time and continuation schools, in a 
special report from its~State board of education to the general 
assembly. 
Studies and. investigations Special committees, sometimes under 
the auspices of the board of education and sometimes under local 
chambers of commerce, are making investigation’ of the needs and 
possibilities of industrial education at various places in the country. 
Among these places are New York City (through the Public Educa- 
tion Association, Vocational Guidance Survey, and the census 
bureau of the New York public schools), Philadelphia (through its 
Public Education Association), Buffalo and Rochester (through the 
chamber of commerce), Cleveland (through the chamber of com- 
merce and the local Young Men’s Christian Association), and 
through local school authorities in such places as Springfield, De- 
catur, and Moline, Il., Hammond and Lafayette, Ind., Grand Rapids, 
Mich., Middletown, Ohio, and Washington, D. C. 
Schemes for the training of teachers with trade experience through 
evening schools are being carried on for 1912-13 by the Boston 
Young Men’s Christian Association, the Boston Evening Industrial 
School, the Buffalo State Normal School, the Albany State Normal 
School; in the city of Milwaukee by the extension department of the 
University of Wisconsin. There will also be several carefully con-

  296 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
ducted experiments in the training of teachers with trade experience 
in the city of New. York by educational institutions. This plan of 
fitting artisans for teaching through evening schools seems to promise 
the best results in inducing men from the industries to fit themselves 
for service in the schools. 
Massachusetts—In its report for 1918 the State board of educa- 
tion gives the following figures to indicate in part the extent of 
vocational education in Massachusetts: 
Number of cities and towns where some form of vocational education is 
     
  
  being maintained Hee 35 
Number of pupils attending State-aided vocational schools__. 7, 164 
Number of pupils attending certain institutions not State aided___ 3, 686 
Total number of pupils. -- 10, 850   
The following new schools were approved provisionally for the 
year ending 1911-12: 
Boston Continuation School of Homemaking. 
Everett Independent Evening Industrial School. 
Holyoke Independent Evening Industrial School. 
Lowell Independent Industrial School. 
Quincy Independent Evening Industrial School. 
Somerville Industrial School for Girls. 
Springfield Day Industrial School for Boys. 
Watertown Evening Industrial School. 
Westfield Day Industrial School for Boys. 
Worcester Trade School for Girls. 
Wisconsin.—Near the close of 1912, the State commission for in- 
dustrial and agricultural training of Wisconsin, reported more than 
12,000 children in attendance upon part-time and continuation 
schools. Schools have been organized or are in process of organiza- 
tion in the following cities: Appleton, Ashland, Beaver Dam, Beloit, 
Chippewa Falls, Baraboo, Eau Claire, Fond du Lac, Grand Rapids, 
Green Bay, Janesville, Kenosha, La Crosse, Madison, Manitowoc, 
Marinette, Marshfield, Menasha, Menomonie, Merrill, Milwaukee, 
Neenah, Oshkosh, Portage, Racine, Sheboygan, South Milwaukee, 
Stevens Point, Superior, Two Rivers, Watertown, Waukesha, Wau- 
sau, West Allis, Kaukauna, and Antigo. 
New York—tIn New York State, the number of pupils in voca- 
tional State-aided schools grew from 945, four years ago, to 8,388, 
for thc school year 1911-12. These were taken care of in 387 in- 
dustrial schools, having a force of 208 teachers, and costing for 
maintenance, $324,438 for 1911-12, of which the amount of State 
aid was $47,110. These figures do not include the pupils in the even- 
ing trade schools in such places as Buffalo, Rochester, and New York 
City; such schools not receiving State aid under the present statutes.

General.—No attempt is made here to give anything more than 
a partial list of the number of new schools that have been established 
for industrial, trade, and technical education in the various parts 
of the country, as the writer is not in possession of information 
sufficient to justify the claim to a comprehensive list. No listing of 
agricultural schemes is made. Some form of -industrial or technical 
instruction is under way in each of the following cities: Hammond, 
Lafayette, Muncie, Indianapolis, Terre Haute, Vincennes, Ind.; Sagi- 
naw, Kalamazoo, Grand Rapids, Detroit—Cass Technical High 
School and the Detroit Technical Institute, Detroit University, 
Mich.; Harrisburg, Scranton, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Lancas- 
ter, Pa.; Hartford, Waterbury, Bridgeport, New Britain, Conn.; 
in Chicago, the Lewis Institute part-time class carried on under the 
auspices of the National Metal Trades Association; the Lucy Flower 
Technical High School, the Crane Technical High School, and the 
Lane Technical High School and evening industrial classes; Moline, 
Decatur, Springfield, Joliet, Rock Island, Rockford, Tl.; David 
Ranken, jr., School of Mechanical Trades in St. Louis, Mo.; Bayonne, 
Paterson, Newark, Trenton, Jersey City, Passaic, in New Jersey; 
Cleveland, Toledo, and Cincinnati, Ohio, through cooperative part- 
time and continuation courses; Portland, Oreg., Chattanooga, Tenn., 
Baltimore, Md., Boise, Idaho, and Providence, R. I.

CHAPTER XI. 
TYPICAL HEALTH-TEACHING AGENCIES OF THE 
UNITED STATES. 
By F. B. Dresstar, 
Special Agent of the Bureau of Education, 
A world-wide movement which has for its purpose the education 
of all the people in matters pertaining to health is rapidly develop- 
ing. Societies or committees have been organized to protect the 
health of infants; others to teach school children to care for their 
teeth; others for the specific purpose of educating expectant mothers; 
others to teach people the value of fresh air, good food, and proper 
sanitation in the fight against tuberculosis. Scores of others are di- 
recting their energies more or less exclusively to the dissemination 
of prophylactic and hygienic information designed to give help in 
the prevention of certain specific diseases. 
Literally hundreds of such organizations are now at work through- 
out the United States, most of which are doing valuable service, 
while there is scarcely a city or county without its central health 
committee. Thus far there has been no successful attempt to organize 
all these individual agencies into one general body for united and 
cooperative action; but it is only a matter of time when this must 
be done in order that the widest and most effectual results may be 
achieved for the time, the labor, and the money expended. 
The spirit prompting the service of most of the organizations 
whose work is herein briefly outlined, is commendable in the highest 
degree. This spirit is in a very definite sense the product of modern 
social conditions, and the conviction is growing that reform in any 
line of human activity must ensue from a clearer knowledge of the 
facts involved. This spirit is at times perhaps not sufficiently ap- 
prized of the tremendous difficulties involved in changing the habits 
and attitude of the masses. Education is a process, as well as a 
product. The mere information offered, though it may be kindly 
received by those people or the class of people it designs to help, 
will not necessarily bring them to that point where it will compel 
change of habits or intellectualize the action proposed. It remains 
299
-P-A-G-E-326
  300 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
to be seen how many of these attempts are bona fide attempts at 
education, or whether they merely represent more or less sporadic 
expressions of a desire to do something, with more consciousness of 
the joy of doing than of the final end to be attained. Those organiza- 
tions which have the vision to “ look into the future,” which have the 
knowledge of how best to do that which is necessary to be done, and 
the faith and the patience to persist in their endeavors, will do real 
educational work. Readers of the brief accounts herein will, I be- 
lieve, realize that a new and impressive conception of the national 
as well as the personal value of good health, both from the economic 
and spiritual point of view, has dawned upon the world. It may be 
that “ the earth will be as cold as the moon before all men learn that 
the only real wealth is health,” as Mr. Collier has recently suggested, 
but there is no escape from the fact that a mighty army of enthusiasts 
is now enlisted to bring this knowledge to all men long before the 
cooling processes of this planet have made any rapid progress. 
If one undertakes to search out the elements which have entered 
into this simultaneous awakening of the world at large, he is balked 
by insufficient knowledge or lack of that prophetic faith which easily 
turns mountains into molehills. Still there are some glimpses of 
truth visible, and these may be sketched as follows: 
(1) The rapid development of knowledge concerning the bacterial 
causes of disease has emphasized the work of prevention, and made 
it clear that diseases are not providentially appointed means for 
inflicting punishment, but the results in most cases of the attacks 
of parasitic enemies which we may learn to recognize and destroy. 
(2) Science has made it possible to anticipate the poisonous influ- 
ence of toxic products produced by pathogenic germs in a few dis- 
eases, by the inoculation of well people with preparations known as 
virus, serums, etc., so that they are rendered comparatively immune 
to the harmful effects of these diseases. For example, the dreadful 
ravages of smallpox, so common two centuries ago, have been reduced 
almost to the minimum in those countries in which all people are 
compelled to submit to proper vaccination. Despite the multitude 
of facts which can be cited to substantiate this statement, there are 
yet in this country many persons who deny the facts, and who resist 
all attempts to compel the people at large to profit by them. The 
serum treatments for diphtheria and typhoid fever have proved 
their value, and they offer opportunities for much added protection. 
Little by little public health gains are thus made through science, 
but it is a herculean task to teach the people to take advantage of 
these safeguards. 
(3) We know in part that vigorous health is one of the best meas- 
ures for protection against any infectious disease. Parasitic bac- 
teria have first to overcome the natural resistance and the vigorous 
 
-P-A-G-E-327
  
TYPICAL .HEALTH-TEACHING AGENCIES. 301 
assaults against them made by a healthy, well-nourished, and, there- 
fore, heavily armed individual, before they can inflict on him the 
injury they are capable of inflicting. 
(4) The growing faith in the value of the results of specialized 
scientific experimentation and scientific teaching is one of the hope- 
ful signs of the modern world. Patent medicines and superstitious 
concoctions are still veritable ogres preying on our people, but the 
scalpel and microscope, the test tube, and the retort will in time—a 
long time—drive them into oblivion. Slowly but surely the teachers 
and the scientific workers the world over are accumulating the means 
of defense and are training the people how to fight these enemies. 
The establishment and maintenance of research laboratories and 
hygienic museums, the hundreds of scientific journals and maga- 
zines, and the almost innumerable meetings of associations and 
congresses are all aiding directly and indirectly to democratize 
scientific health knowledge and to make it really and truly useful. 
(5) A new page was turned in the book of hygiene when the dis- 
coveries were made that many diseases are transmitted by insects 
and that apparently well people may be carriers of disease germs 
and thereby become dangerous to the community. With no mos- 
quitoes there will be no malaria or yellow fever; with no rats or 
mice, no plague; no stable flies, no infantile paralysis; sanitary 
sewerage, no flies, pure water, pure milk, pure food, and proper pro- 
tection against all typhoid carriers, and typhoid fever will be elimi- 
nated. 
(6) All these results of science have forced the conclusion that 
in general sanitation is a thousandfold more powerful than attempts 
at cure after disease has been contracted. Hence there has arisen a 
strong movement for the conservation of life and health from the 
economic and humanitarian point of view, both for the individual 
and for the Nation. This conservation program is still in a more or 
less inchoate stage of evolution. It began in strong sentiment and 
must be coordinated into an intelligently directed educational en- 
deavor. Sentiment is a strong and useful factor in life, but it often 
leads people into false emphasis. More people are dying in this 
country every day from preventable causes than were lost in the 
Titanic disaster; but the latter, not the former, called forth the sen- 
timent and immediate relief, as far as it was within the power of 
man to relieve. The health and sanitation of a nation must come 
through a systematic, scientific, and unceasing education. That edu- 
cation must include the prenatal care of the Nation’s mothers, and 
extend from the ground floor of school-teaching upward until the 
entire educational system is saturated with the need for the knowl- 
edge of health and the desire to make wholesome living one of the 
Nation’s chief ideals. 
 
-P-A-G-E-328
302 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
There has been no attempt to make this inventory of health teach- 
ing exhaustive. It is merely a beginning; and those societies, or 
other agencies not mentioned here, though engaged in this work, 
can have no reason to feel slighted, for at this time it is practically 
impossible to search them out and formulate the programs of their 
work. Later a more persistent effort will be made to get the facts 
and to correlate and interpret them. 
It is hoped that the accounts herein given will typify the general 
movement for health conservation and furnish some incentive for 
more effective correlation and cooperation of those agencies, both 
public and private, which are trying to help in this very significant 
educational undertaking. 
VARIOUS NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETIES ENGAGED IN 
GENERAL HEALTH WORK. 
The United States Public Health Service, through its division of 
sanitary reports and statistics, is doing a great educational work 
throughout the country. The work is especially helpful, because it 
is done by men of high scientific attainment and under favorable 
conditions. The health reports are issued weekly and contain: 
(1) Current information of the prevalence and geographic distribution of 
preventable diseases in the United States in so far as data are obtainable, and 
of cholera, plague, yellow fever, and smallpox throughout the world. (2) 
Copies of the laws and regulations being enacted or adopted by State and mu- 
nicipal authorities for the safeguarding of the public health. (8) Articles 
relating to the cause, prevention, or control of disease. (4) Other pertinent 
information regarding sanitation and the conservation of the public health. 
The reports are intended primarily for distribution to health officers, members 
of boards or departments of health, and those directly or indirectly engaged in 
or connected with public health or sanitary work. 
Perhaps the most important function of this service is the scien- 
tific investigations made and the expert service rendered to various 
State health officers and others in connection with epidemics of con- 
tagious diseases and sanitary matters affecting the safety of the pub- 
lic in general. 
The United States Public Health Service is the new name given 
to the reorganization and enlargement of what was formerly known 
as the Public Health and Marine-Hospital Service. Surg. Gen. 
Rupert Blue is the responsible head of this service. 
The American Public Health Association has for many years been 
an educational agency of significant value. Through the papers 
* presented at its annual meetings, through its published proceedings, 
and at present through its Journal it has taken a leading place in 
directing the attention of the expert sanitarian to the doctrine and 
means of preventing disease and securing better sanitation.

Its attitude toward the problems of educating the people deserves 
especial commendation, for while its membership has been largely 
drawn from the medical profession it has emphasized the value of 
hygienic living, sanitation, and preventive measures more than 
the value of medicine. Its membership is drawn from the United 
States, Canada, Cuba, and Mexico. 
No detailed account of its educational work is possible save to 
say that its educational influence has been felt more among the health 
officers than among the medical profession as a whole. : 
The American Association for Labor Legislation is a branch of an 
international association, and is managed by an executive committee 
and a general administrative council. This committee and council 
are composed of men and women of national reputation. The presi- 
dent of this association is Prof. W. P. Willoughby, of Princetor 
University. The following account of its health work was pre- 
pared by its secretary, Mr. John B. Andrews, of New York City: 
The problem of preventing industrial disease is among the most important 
of those engaging the attention of the American Association for Labor Legis- 
lation. The association strives to reach its end by two means, (1) legislation, 
(2) publicity. 
The publicity campaign comprises: 
(a) Annual public meetings of the association, at which industrial disease 
topics are discussed, along with other matters; annual conferences of the ad- 
ministrative council; biennial national conferences on industrial diseases, and 
occasional informal conferences to discuss pressing developments. 
(0) Publications, including the American Labor Legislation Review, which 
deals authoritatively and exhaustively with the various phases of the subject, 
including full reports of the annual and biennial meetings; special leaflets on 
“Jndustrial hygiene,” ‘‘Phossy jaw,’ “Reporting of industrial diseases,” 
“Preventing of industrial diseases, with special reference to lead poisoning,” 
many of which contain standard uniform bills upon the subjects with which 
they deal; pamphlets, such as “ Memorial to the President on occupational dis- 
eases,” “Industrial diseases and occupational standards,” “ Occupational dis- 
eases in the mining industry,” and “ Protection against occupational diseases.” 
The association also distributes the monthly bulletin in English of its inter- 
national labor office at Basle, Switzerland, and other valuable material from 
abroad issued by the other 15 national sections of the International Association 
for Labor Legislation, with which it is affiliated. 
(ce) Information bureau, which handles requests for information made by 
Government officials, manufacturers, physicians, legislators, lawyers, insurance 
actuaries, trade-unionists, social workers, teachers, clergymen, lecturers, writ- 
ers, and students from all over the country. 
(d) Press service; 865 daily and weekly papers, in all parts of the United 
States, are on the association’s mailing list and receive periodic news articles 
under a release date. Special departments are also conducted in the Survey 
(New York) and Life and Labor (Chicago), in which the latest developments 
in labor legislation, including matters of industrial hygiene, are treated: 
(e) A traveling exhibit has been carefully built up, with artistic charts and 
photographs, illustrating dangerous industrial processes, and presenting sta- 
tistical tables as to the results and simple and effective advice as to the
-P-A-G-E-330

methods of protection. Occasional lectures are delivered by members of the | 
association staff before organizations requesting their services. i 
In the legislative part of the work standard bills are drafted by experts, 
after careful investigation, to meet adverse conditions in industry. These bills 
are introduced in the several State legislatures or in Congress and vigorously 
pushed to adoption. Popular interest and education are thus made to go hand 
in hand with the legislation in which they are crystallized. 
The work of the committee of one hundred on national health, of 
the American Association for the Advancement of Science, is so well 
known and has been of such marked service that no comprehensive 
account of its work need here be given. It has had a very large 
influence, not only in scientific lines, but in legislative and general 
educational work. Besides, its most effective service has been along 
the line of helping to establish the United States Public Health 
Service and in calling attention to conservation movement as applied 
to health matters. 
Prof. Irving Fisher, of Yale University, is president of this 
committee. 
The committee has issued over twoscore publications, among them 
“National Vitality,” the report of President Roosevelt’s conservation 
commission. In summing up the chief facts presented in this report, 
Dr. Schieffelin, chairman of the executive committee, says: 
It showed that out of the entire population 1,500,000 die annually, and of 
this number nearly half die many years before they should. It also showed 
that there are constantly 3,000,000 sick beds in the country, and that if hygienic 
knowledge now available were used at least one-half of these people might be 
among the well instead of among the sick. a 
In a memorial relating to the conservation of human life, as con- 
templated by a bill providing for a United States Public Health 
Service, prepared by Prof. Fisher, and published as Senate Document 
No. 493, Sixty-second Congress, the whole problem of conservation 
of human life from a national point of view was briefly summarized. 
This document had a large influence in helping to pass the bill pro- 
viding for a United States Public Health Service, and in addition 
has been of signal service in a general educational way. Those who 
wish a fuller account of the work of this committee in connection 
with its legislation should refer to this document. 
The American Civic Association was organized— 
to make American living conditions clean, healthful, attractive; to extend the 
making of public parks; to promote the opening of gardens and playgrounds 
for children and recreation centers for adults; to abate public nuisances, includ- 
ing objectionable signs, unnecessary poles and wires, wasteful smoking factory 
chimneys, unnecessary noises; to exterminate the typhoid fly; to make the 
buildings and surroundings of railway stations, schools, and factories attractive; 
to protect existing trees and to encourage intelligent tree planting.

TYPICAL HEALTH-TEACHING AGENCIES. 805 
There are two departments of work which are distinctly along public-health 
lines. First, a systematic crusade against the smoke nuisance, in connection 
with which valuable bulletins have been issued, laying stress upon the dangers 
to health condition as well as to the beauty of cities. 
For the past three years an energetic crusade against the house fly has been 
conducted, presenting strong argument for the elimination of the fly. We have 
used the expression “ Kill flies and save lives,” and, as a most important phase 
of the work, have urged that, if the motive for cleaning back yards for the 
sake of beauty was not sufficient, there was the additional motive of preserva- 
tion of life and health in clearing away débris, particularly manure piles about 
stables, in which the flies breed. The plea has not been so much against the 
mature fly as it has been the fly in the egg, larva, and pupa state in the manure 
pile or other disagreeable breeding places. 
Under the direction of the chairman of our fly-fighting committee, Mr. 
Edward Hatch, jr., of New York City, who last year was chairman of the fly 
committee of the Merchants’ Association of New York City, a remarkable series 
of photographs was taken in England illustrating in minutest detail the habits 
of the fly in its breeding, showing it enlarged to the size of a Plymouth Rock hen 
as it burrows in the manure pile for a nesting place, showing the development 
of the eggs through the larve and pup states into the adult fly. 
These films have been sent out through the 5 and 10 cent theaters of America, 
reaching just the people we most desired to reach, and without doubt sending 
them to their homes determined at least to get rid of the flies that may be 
found in their homes, and in many cases to become ardent and enthusiastic 
coworkers in the general campaign for the complete extermination of the fly. 
Reports received from many film distributors show that the fly pictures have 
been very popular. In many cities they have been presented under the auspices 
of the local civic associations. 
As a natural feature of our crusade we have issued bulletins pointing out the 
dangers of the fly and suggesting methods for its extermination. We have 
devoted practically all of our efforts toward impressing upon people the im- 
portance of doing away with the breeding places of the fly. 
The National Conference of Charities and Correction, an organiza- 
tion which has been in existence for 40 years, was primarily organized 
to consider the care of defectives and delinquents. They find, how- 
ever, that a good part of their endeavor has necessarily been given 
to the promotion of health conditions and the education of the general 
public with regard to better sanitary and preventive measures in 
connection with the care of such charges. This conference is an 
annual meeting where people exchange views on subjects relating to 
charity and correction. They publish their proceedings in an annual 
volume. Their efficient secretary, Mr. Alexander Johnson, of Angola, 
Ind., states that in recent years many articles published in this volume 
have had to do with general health matters, among which the following 
are noted: “ Prevention of disease,” “ Care of the sick in hospitals,” 
“Cooperation between hospitals and relief societies,” “ Warfare 
against tuberculosis,” “'The open-air treatment for consumptives,” 
“Visiting nursing,” “The educational opportunity of the visiting 
nurse in the prevention of disease,” “A broader motive for school
-P-A-G-E-332
  306 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
hygiene,” “ The duty of society to the child at school,” “ The Nation’s 
outlook for health,” and “ Prevention of blindness from ophthalmia 
neonatorum.” 
The conference to be held at Seattle in July, 1918, will have a com- 
mittee on “health and productive power.” It is proposed by this 
committee to correlate as far as possible questions of public health 
with those of industry and social service of every kind. 
The National Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, in addition 
to its great and well-known work in the cause of temperance, has 
departments of physical education, social purity, and health and 
heredity, through which many publications bearing on these topics 
have been published and distributed. Their main health work, how- 
ever, has had to do with propaganda relating to scientific temperance 
instruction and in teaching the world the physical and moral effects 
of the use of alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and all narcotics. This 
society has done a vast amount of good. 
The National Congress of Mothers consists of the federation of 36 
States, each State having presidents, officers, and committees. Mrs. 
Walter S. Brown, chairman of the child hygiene committee of this 
congress, says each State child hygiene chairman is provided with 
literature and suggestions and is instructed to work out local prob- 
lems. As an illustration of how this organization works, instance is 
cited of the city of Des Moines: 
We have 40 women’s clubs, with a membership of 40 to 100 and more; we 
estimate that in this city we reach directly something like 2,500 homes, and 
what is true of the city of Des Moines is true to a large extent of many cities 
throughout the country. 
The educational organ of the National Congress of Mothers is the 
“ Child-Welfare” magazine, published monthly, devoted to all 
phases of child welfare, including many articles on sanitation and 
hygiene. 
The Iowa branch of the National Congress of Mothers reports that 
one of its most important educational agencies for better health is 
their baby health-contest work. Reports from that State declare 
that this work “met with very great success, and plans have been 
completed to make it a nation-wide movement.” The General Feder- 
ation of Women’s Clubs, with a membershap of nearly 1,000,000, is 
undertaking to introduce the same work through its public health 
committee, : 
The women’s department of the National Civic Federation on 
Dangerous and Unhealthful Industries, through its chairman, Mrs. 
L. W. Bates, has published the results of an extensive investigation 
into mercurial poisoning in the industries of New York City and 
vicinity. This report, among other discussions, gives figures con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-333
TYPICAL HEALTH-TEACHING AGENCIES. 807 
cerning the extent of mercurial poisoning, an account of its symp- 
toms, and some account of the cures. In this section she says: 
The saddest feature about the occurrence of this occupational disease is that 
the greater part of it is needless. Remedies may be of two kinds, industrial 
and medical. Yndustrial consist of correct hygiene through adequate ventila- 
tion and best mechanism for a definite process; fumes must be eliminated; dust, 
floating fur, ete, must be eliminated. The doctor’s one prescription for cure 
is “Leave the employment.” 
In another illustrated pamphlet, entitled “ Welfare work, cloth- 
ing manufacturers, New York City,” the conditions of the shop and 
workers are set forth, in order that not only the public may be edu- 
cated to the conditions that exist, but that those who enter such em- 
ployment may know the dangers incident thereto. 
The committee is seeking to increase the number of inspectors, and 
to create a sentiment strong enough to compel the managers to pro- 
vide sanitary conditions for the workers. 
They further attempt to educate the employees by printed matter and 
by such direct educational efforts as they can command. They state 
that “Welfare Work” expects to educate along the following lines: 
(a) Sanitary work places: System for providing pure drinking 
water; for ventilation, including the cooling of superheated places 
and devices for exhausting dust and removing gases; for lighting 
work places and for guarding machinery; washrooms with hot and 
cold water, towels, and soap; shower baths for molders and station- 
ary firemen; emergency hospitals; locker rooms; seats for women; 
laundries for men’s overalls or women’s uniforms; the use of ele- 
vators for women; and luncheon rooms. The beginning of all wel- 
fare work should be directed toward meeting the pressing necessities 
for the physical well being of employees in their work places. 
(0) Recreation: The social hall for dancing parties, concerts, theat- 
ricals; billiards, pool, or bowling, the gymnasium, athletic field, roof 
garden, vacations and summer excursions for employees, and rest 
rooms or trainmen’s rest houses. 
(e) Educational: Classes for apprentices in cooking, dressmaking, 
and millinery; first aid to the injured; night classes for technical 
training; kindergartens and libraries. 
(d) Housing: Home rented or sold to employees, and boarding 
houses. 
(e) Provident funds: For insurance, pensions, savings, or leading 
money in times of stress. 
The American Institute of Child Life, an endowed corporation, 
with headquarters at Philadelphia, states that the purpose of the 
corporation— : 
is to advise parents in regard to the mental training, moral guidance, health, 
recreation, and amusements of children by means of correspondence, circula- 
tion of books, pamphlets, magazines, exhibits, lectures, etc.
-P-A-G-E-334
  308 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
The department of investigation of the institute has outlined a 
comprehensive form of organization and activities, and proposes to 
issue “a series of five volumes, each volume to contain approximately 
400 pages, 400 words to the page,” with the general title “A Survey 
of Childhood.” The chapters of these proposed volumes to be written 
by well-known specialists. The first volume is to deal with the 
physical life of the child. 
The American Society for the Study of Alcohol and Other Nar- 
cotics was organized in 1870 by physicians and persons interested in 
the physical study of the drink problem. It has held annual and 
semiannual meetings up to the present time, for the reading and 
discussion of papers, confined entirely to the scientific side of the 
problem. 
In 1876 this society established the Quarterly Journal of Inebriety 
as its organ, which is still published. The society was the first of 
its kind to discuss this subject. - 
The American society and its journal has created and established 
interest in this line of work and has been a leader in the movement. 
Over 500 papers have been read and discussed at the annual meetings, 
and these have become a large part of the literature bearing on 
scientific temperance. A dozen volumes have been written by its 
members on this subject. In 1909 the Government published Senate 
Document No. 48, containing the transactions and papers of this 
society’s meeting. Dr. T. D. Crothers, of Hartford, is secretary. 
The work of the National Housing Association, through its secre- 
tary, John Ihlder, makes the following report with reference to the 
active interest of that organization in sanitary inspection and general 
educational work connected with such opportunities as its work 
affords: 
At its two national conferences, 1911 and 1912, it laid great stress upon the 
relation of housing to health, having papers by health officials and others on 
“Health departments and housing,” “Privy vaults,” “Alleys,” “Garbage and 
rubbish,” “Sanitary inspection of tenements,” “Room overcrowding and the 
lodger evil,” etc., all of which emphasized the health side of housing. At these 
conferences a large proportion of the delegates were health officers from all 
parts of the United States and Canada. 
Besides these papers the National Housing Association has published a series 
of pamphlets, several of which deal directly with public health, as “ What bad 
housing means to the community,” ‘Teaching the tenant,” “Housing and 
health,” “The survey and the smaller city,” “The home as a factor in public 
health,” and “'The work of a housing committee.” 
One of the most valuable parts of the association's work has been the aid it 
has given in drafting legislation which will increase the healthfulness of a 
community by requiring more wholsome construction and more sanitary con- 
ditions in dwellings. It seeks to set a standard for all the dwellings in the 
community, the chief purpose of its recommendations being to safeguard the 
health and the morals of the people. It is untiring in its efforts to secure 
 
-P-A-G-E-335

adequate appropriations for health departments, so that they may maintain 
an efficient inspection service. 
The Playground and Recreation Association of America, through 
its secretary, Mr. H. S. Braucher, furnished the following brief 
statements of the educational work of this association: 
The Playground and Recreation Association of America attempts to give 
recreation its rightful place in the life of the American people, and to give 
every person, young or old, rich or poor, in city or country, a life rather than a 
living. 
Methods of work: 
1. By sending field secretaries to organize local recreational work on a com- 
prehensive basis and to give expert advice on difficult problems. 
2. By answering through correspondence the many requests for information 
and advice which come to the office. 
3. By consultation with individuals who come to talk over their problems. 
4, By publishing a monthly magazine called The Playground. Also through 
leaflets, pamphlets, and other publications. 
5. By loaning lantern slides, cuts, and photographs, and sending publicity 
material to aid in conducting local campaigns. 
6. By collecting information regarding recreation work in all the cities and 
towns of the country, and making this information available for all interested 
in recreation. 
7. By holding annual meetings and institutes where workers may learn of 
each other’s experiences and have the benefit of expert advice. 
8. By helping recreation officials to find capable recreation secretaries, super- 
visors, directors, and play leaders. 
Mr. Manford P. Welcher, field secretary of the Anti-Cigarette 
League of America, Eastern Division, includes in his field of work 
public and private schools for both boys and girls, coeducational 
school, Sunday schools, business schools, theological seminaries, a 
few colleges, the organization of the Boy Scouts and other similar 
associations. In addition to preparing and distributing a vast 
amount of printed matter bearing on the evils of cigarette smoking, 
Mr. Welcher spends much of his time in the field, lecturing to young 
and old on this topic. He states that the instinct for collecting pic- 
ture cards, buttons, and other inserts from cigarette boxes and return- 
ing them as coupons for prizes is one of the causes leading to boys 
smoking cigarettes. His educational program consists largely in 
lecturing, distributing printed matter, and collecting facts regarding 
the evils and dangers of this habit. 
The educational work of the American Red Cross is largely limited 
to their first-aid department, in charge of Maj. Charles Lynch, Medi- 
cal Corps, United States Army, who has furnished the following 
brief statement of their work: 
The first-aid-to-the-injured department of the American Red Cross was 
erganized in 1910. On its committee are representatives of both capital and 
 
-P-A-G-E-336
310 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
labor interests, as well as first-aid experts. The office is conducted in Washing- 
ton, D. ©., where books are prepared and several classes of supplies designed 
and stored. Books, charts, and other first-aid supplies are sold at cost price. 
Three physicians are teaching first aid in the field, as representatives of the 
American Red Cross. One of these is assigned to special districts or special 
plants, and the two others teach on first-aid cars, which have now covered 
nearly all the railroads of the United States. Besides this, we teach schools, 
police and fire departments, ete. 
We have affiliations with the Young Men’s Christian Association, Young 
Women’s Christian Association, and the Boy Scouts, acting as their represen- 
tative in first-aid instruction. 
For the past three and a half years our representatives have traveled some 
150,000 miles and have instructed over 250,000 people. 
As a branch and extension of this work recently organized might be men- 
tioned the classes in first aid and home nursing for women. A number of 
first-aid courses have been given to women, but it is now intended to extend 
instruction of this character by giving home nursing and household economic 
courses. Miss Marion L. Oliver is in charge of organizing classes in first aid 
and home nursing. So far as the nursing part of this instruction is concerned, 
this is under the general direction of Miss Jane A. Delano, chairman nursing 
committee, American Red Cross. 
     
    
      
    
               
      
      
   COMMITTEE OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION FOR PUBLIC 
HEALTH EDUCATION AMONG WOMEN AND ITS AFFILIATED 
ORGANIZATION". 
The American Medical Association in July, 1909, organized a com- 
mittee for public health education among women, with Dr. Rosalie 
Slaughter Morton, of New York City, as its first chairman. 
The purpose of the committee was to interest. women’s clubs in study for the 
prevention of disease. It was soon found that organizations of men were inter- 
ested equally with the women. At the end of the third year, July, 1912, work 
was organized in 45 States, 238 counties, Alaska, Philippines, Hawaii, and the 
Canal Zone. 
During the year July, 1911-July, 1912, talks were given to women’s clubs, 
mothers’ clubs, Young Women’s Christian Associations, Young Men’s Christian 
Associations, men’s and women’s factory clubs, labor organizations, fraternal 
organizations of men and women, farmers’ institutes, teachers’ institutes, normal 
schools, public schools, and other organizations of men and women, as well as 
to the general public. Single talks were given to approximately 3,500 general 
audiences and 1,000 audiences of school children, in addition to 50 series to the 
public and 6 series to school children. Audiences for the year were over 
300,000, making-a total for the three years since the organization of the com- 
mittee of over 600,000 men, women, and children to whom talks were given 
for the purpose of education in the prevention of disease. 
The work on the part of the speakers and committee members is entirely 
gratuitous; the only expense is that of correspondence in the central office. 
The effort of this committee during the six months from July, 1912, to 
December, 1912, has been to secure a more complete organization by inducing 
State medical societies to appoint committees for public health education, th: 
duty of which shall be to coordinate the work done in the county societies an 
to cooperate with the State chairmen under this committee. In this way th 
American Medical Association committee will be able to coordinate the wor
-P-A-G-E-337
  TYPICAL HEALTH-TEACHING AGENCIES. 311 
done in the States and to disseminate knowledge of methods found most 
effective. 5 
During this half year the number of county organizations has been increased. 
Each organization adds a large number of individuals to the instructing force. 
There has been a corresponding increase in organizations applying for lectures. 
The list of books on the prevention of disease compiled by a subcommittee, of 
which Dr. Jane L. Berry, New York City, is chairman, includes 257 volumes 
classified under 12 headings. This list of books has been sent to each library 
in the United States not technical in character and containing 5,000 or more 
volumes. Cooperation on the part of the librarian has been sought, and in 
Imany instances these books are being put into public libraries. 
In many counties the county committee, together with the public librarian, 
are reviewing books on hygiene in the library and publishing short lists for the 
use of the public. In a few places a traveling library on hygiene has been 
provided. 
The New Jersey committee on public health education among 
women, a division of the national committee, reports, through its 
State chairman, Dr. Maria Mitchell, of East Orange, N. J., that: 
There were given during 1912 about 100 lectures on subjects pertaining to 
preventive medicine, hygiene, and sanitation. These lectures were, many of 
them, given in clubs federated with the State Federation of Women’s Clubs. 
Some were given in schools, others in parent-teachers associations: A few 
were given in factories, libraries, public meetings of medical societies, ete. 
This year we are trying to arouse interest in every county, through its county 
medical society, and to take up work in factories and labor unions, and do 
further work in schools and clubs. We have also published in various daily 
and weekly papers articles on health subjects. We have given series of lectures 
in Newark for two years and in Glenridge. We are cooperating with all 
organizations that desire assistance in learning better how to improve health 
and prevent race suicide. 
The following list of subjects will indicate the nature of the work 
undertaken : 
Foods—their uses and abuses. 
Relation of flies and insects to contagious disease in mankind. 
Work, play, and exercise for children. 
Uses of vaccines, antitoxins, and serums in the treatment and prevention of 
disease. 
Relation of adenoids, tonsils, and decayed teeth to growth and development. 
Relation of feeding to the production of summer diarrheas. 
Necessity of early treatment of deformities in children. 
The catching-cold phobia, winter weather, and clothing. 
Care of the ears and eyes. 
Eugenics. 5 
Teaching of sex hygiene to children. 
The Minnesota Federation of Women’s Clubs reports that— 
for the last two years the health and hygiene committee has been chiefly 
concerned in disseminating information throughout the State concerning the 
prevention and spread of tuberculosis. In addition to sending out pamphlets, 
leaflets, etc., on tuberculosis to all federated clubs in the State, additional litera- 
ture on the fly, the common drinking cup, and pure milk has been distributed.

  312 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
Recently efforts have been confined to the support of bills pending in the legis- 
lature to appropriate money for county sanatoriums, where those suffering 
from this disease may be received and properly treated. 
The committee is planning as the next immediate work a cooperative program 
with the State board of health in enforcing present laws and regulations con- 
cerning the welfare of children during infancy and the school period. 
Dr. Rosa H. Gantt reports that— 
The committee on public health education in South Carolina is teaching the 
people by means of lectures given to organizations of men and women, and also 
by lectures and exhibits to school children. In some instances the lectures are 
illustrated by stereopticon slides. Whenever possible, the moving-picture 
houses are used to attract people who will not attend a regular lecture. The 
newspapers in the State are supplied with articles on public health, which they 
very generously publish. The schools in Spartanburg County are supplied with 
stickers to be pasted in one or more books of each public-school child. 
The sticker is entitled “How to Keep Well.” ‘The directions are given in a 
series of “ Don’ts.” I hope next year they will change this to a series of 
“Do's.” 
The Kentucky Federation of Women’s Clubs prepared last year 
a bulletin on health topics, which was sent to all school-teachers, 
club members, ministers, and doctors throughout the State. Fly 
posters (21,000) were distributed in the State. Active work was 
undertaken with reference to establishing a law to abolish the com- 
mon drinking cup and to establish a tuberculosis commission. The 
secretary, Mrs. M. Riker, says: 
We are now sending out 7,000 letters, one to each club woman in the State, 
asking for help in the fight against hookworm disease. This work is done in 
cooperation with the State board of health. 
The Georgia branch of the public health education committee of 
the American Medical Association reports that— 
Through medical societies we have sought the appointment of a board of 
health, or at least a health officer in every town; of medical inspectors of 
schools, prisons, and almshouses; better drainage laws, especially in middle 
and lower Georgia, where we have 2,500,000 acres of wet lands; better regula- 
tion of birth and death registration. We have also arranged open meetings for 
the discussion of subjects of public health. 
Through women’s organizations we have urged systematic study of such 
subjects as food values, domestic economy, prevention of infant mortality, 
cause and prevention of common diseases of locality, as malaria, typhoid, hook- 
worm, etc.; advantages of open-air homes and schools, importance of civics 
and sanitation, Also the women’s clubs have rendered invaluable service in 
pehalf of better child-labor laws and better housing conditions in factory and 
negro settlements. 
The chairman, Dr. Cora B. Lattin, of the New York committee 
for public health education among women, reports— 
that 36 counties of New York State are organized under county chairmen for 
securing lecturers and audiences, mainly in women’s clubs, school organizations, 
teachers’ institutes, granges,. Woman’s Christian Temperance Unions, and 
church “organizations.

Two hundred and twenty-six lectures were given to audiences numbering. 
about 25,000 people. In addition to the general lectures, an attempt has been 
made to secure individual drinking cups and towels in public places, to arouse 
interest in public-school inspection, open-air schools for defectives, segregation 
of defectives from regular classes in the schools, for the education of industrial 
workers, and in prevention of industrial diseases. In some of the counties 
county medical societies are actively cooperating in this work. 
The Iowa Federation of Women’s Clubs’ health committee directed 
all the women’s clubs associated in the federation last year to study 
the following health topics and to take such action as conditions in 
various localities called for: 
The black plague and its control by quarantine; conservation of infant life 
and health; health contests and score cards. The work of inspection of schools 
and visiting nurses was directed along the lines of the following topics: Air, 
light, heat, ventilation, sanitation, dental hygiene, adenoids and tonsils, defects 
in sight and hearing, early detection of communicable diseases, teaching of sex 
hygiene based on biology (when teachers can be secured who are fitted by train- 
ing and temperament to impart such instruction), the promotion of public play 
places outdoors and under cover, how to abolish the public drinking cup and 
what to substitute. 
Other topics outlined for study were: 
The fly as a carrier of disease and how to exterminate it; The board of health 
im my community, Is it living up to its scope and power? Tuberculosis; Sale 
by local merchants of the Red Cross Christmas seal; Study of city ordinances 
relating to slaughterhouses; Expectoration; Contagious diseases; Milk and its 
sale; Inspection of all places where goods are sold and stored; Drainage sys- 
tem and disposal of garbage; Inspection of public places, especially moving- 
picture theaters; Federal and State food inspection and sanitary provisions; 
The unventilated church as an extravagant waster of religious effort and a 
breeding place for germs; A study of divorce conditions and their relation to 
the health movement; A health special, a car fitted with appliances for the 
demonstration and teaching of human health to children and adults, such as 
that sent out by the Louisiana Board of Health; Clean food, sanitary score 
cards, and clean lists; The hospital plan for counties and communities. 
The Educational Department of the Woman’s Clinic, Washington, 
D. C., makes the following summary of its educational work along 
health lines: 
This department was organized in the spring of 1911 to satisfy the growing 
demand for popular education on subjects of personal health, public sanitation, 
first aid in emergencies, and the means of preventing and combating disease. 
It is in charge of a special committee on education, Dr. D. S. Lamb, chairman. 
- In October a leaflet was issued setting forth the purposes of the department. 
The subjects offered were divided into five groups: First aid in emergencies; 
Contagious and infectious diseases; Physiology and hygiene of the child; Sex 
hygiene and education; and Miscellaneous. The names of 38 prominent phy- 
sicians and scientists were announced as lecturers. Through the cooperation 
of the board of education and the superintendent of schools many calls were 
received for lectures from parent and teachers’ associations. So great was the 
demand for these free popular health lectures that it was necessary to increase 
the number of lecturers. ;
-P-A-G-E-340
314 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
During the school-year of 1911-12, 160 lectures were given under the auspices 
of the Woman’s Clinic to audiences aggregating over 9,500. The most popular 
subjects, judging from the demand, with parent and teachers’ associations, 
mothers’ clubs, and normal students were “Sex education” and “ Social 
hygiene.” Forty lectures were given by Drs. Elnora C. Folkmar, E. H. Egbert, 
and © Tignor on these topics. The next most popular group of subjects was 
that of “Child hygiene.” A number of lectures were given on “ How to pre- 
vent nervousness in the child,” “The care of the teeth,” and “The care of the 
eyes.” : 
Several classes in “ First aid in emergencies” were organized for boy scouts, 
camp-fire girls, and club women. The course comprised 12 lectures. Those who 
passed a satisfactory examination at the close of the course were granted a 
certificate by the American Red Cross Association. 
For the general public a number of lectures were given at the Public Library 
under the combined auspices of the Woman’s Clinic and the Medical Society 
of the District of Columbia. These lectures were given by men in the Govern- 
ment bureaus or by physicians from outside the District. The subjects treated 
were: “Pure and adulterated foods,” “ Patent medicines and nostrums,” “ Pre- 
vention of typhoid fever,” “The mad dog and its bite.” “ Hookworm disease,” 
“Open-air schools for tubercular children,” and “ Social hygiene.” Among the 
lecturers were: Drs. Lumsden, Stiles, Stimson, Warren, of the Public Health 
Service; Drs. Bigelow and Kebler, of the Bureau of Chemistry, and Dr. Prince 
A. Morrow, of New York City. 
For the school year 1912-13 the most demanded subjects are those of “ Sex 
education and sex hygiene.” Next to these is the call for lectures on the ‘‘ Care 
of nervous children.” This year the calls are coming from the same class of 
organizations as last, and in addition from a number of church groups. 
On invitation of the public health education committee of the American 
Medical Association the educational work of the Woman’s Clinic was affiliated 
with the educational work of the American Medical Association. 
STATE BOARDS OF HEALTH. 
The State boards of health have in the past few years turned their 
attention largely to educational campaigns. They realize that, while 
they must continue to quarantine and forcibly control epidemics of 
communicable diseases, in the long run general education in sanita- 
tion is far more effective. 
As typical instances of their educational work the following are 
cited: 
Dr. W. S. Rankin, secretary of the North Carolina State Board of 
Health, states that his board uses education as a means of doing 
public health work in four ways: 
First. This department issues a Monthly Bulletin. We have 40,000 names 
on our mailing list, and reach about one-seventh of the white families in the 
State. We also get out during the year a teachers’ edition of the bulletin. We 
have on our mailing list about 8,000 of the 10,000 public school teachers of 
North Carolina. We recognize that a permanent foundation for a sanitary 
civilization can be built in the pliable minds of childhood. 
Second. This office issues weekly and daily newspaper articles on questions 
of public health. These articles are sent to all of the newspapers in the State, 
and about 60 or 65 per cent of them are used. | Through the cordial cooperation
-P-A-G-E-341
  
TYPICAL HEALTH-TEACHING AGENCIES. 315 
of the State Press Association this office is having distributed to the newspaper- 
reading public of North Carolina about 200 miles of newspaper column health 
literature each year. 
Third. A great many addresses on health subjects are delivered to the school 
teachers’ meetings in this State. In one county of North Carolina the county 
medical society has arranged a series of health lectures to be given by the 
yarious members of the county medical society before every school in the 
county. Before the school year has expired most of these schools will have 
heard sanitary addresses from the medical men of their county on all the 
important preventable diseases. 
Fourth. We are using all the influence we can bring to bear upon the school 
people of the State to teach the subject of sanitation and hygiene to the chil- 
dren; we are stressing these subjects as being more important than physiology 
or anatomy. 5 
Finally, we recognize that 90 per cent of our work at present is of an educa- 
tional character, and that we seek the cooperation of all school people in the 
task of teaching people how to live. 
An interesting experiment in connection with the State Board of 
Health of Minnesota was reported by Dr. H. B. Wood, of Rochester, 
Minn. He states that: 
Upon my own initiative a number of investigations have been made in the 
rural schools. Of 303 rural-school children examined, 80, or 26 per cent, 
showed physical defects needing correction, exclusive of eye conditions. Of 
those tested for vision, in 19 per cent glasses were recommended. Only about 
8 per cent of the rural-school children were vaccinated, At the rural schools 
a few talks on hygiene were given. The typical school of this region which is 
situated wholly in the country, may be described as follows: “A one-room 
painted frame house, on elevated or exposed ground which has been donated 
by some farmer who could not use the ground-for other purposes; without 
trees or exterior decorations; without adequate water supply, a pail of water 
being carried from the nearest-farm, and one-half the schools using individual 
cups, the other half drinking from common dippers; a few schools with basins 
for washing but without towels; open-box toilets, usually in good repair and 
moderately clean; ample window space; ample desk room with sufficient 
small seats and desks; With black painted, wooden blackboards, some using 
chalk and others crayon; a large stove burning wood, with surrounding iron 
shield in some cases; a few portraits of notable Americans and maps; and 
some walls showing an array of drawings made by the pupils.” The 136 
strictly rural schools have an average attendance of approximately 17 scholars, 
some of whom walk 2 miles to school. Each school is located to accommodate 
4% square miles. No books are used for teaching hygiene, but the teachers are 
supposed to give talks upon such information as they obtain from physiology 
books. 
Throughout this investigation certain educational talks were 
given, and conferences were held to bring to the attention of teachers 
and pupils the lessons of hygiene through environment. 
MUNICIPAL HEALTH ASSOCIATIONS, COMMISSIONS, BOARDS, ETC. 
Probably all of the larger cities have regularly and legally con- 
stituted boards of health, and in addition other voluntary organiza-

tions whose purpose is to secure more wholesome sanitary conditions. 
The work of those herein cited will illustrate their general educa- 
tional attempts in this direction. 
The New York Association for Improving the Condition of the 
Poor, through its superintendent, Mrs. H. Ingram, has furnished the 
following information with reference to health education as carried 
on by this association: 
The relief department reaches through the year 11,000 families. These are 
families where advice and material assistance are needed. In 40 per cent 
sickness is the cause of distress; and the visitors and nurses must, therefore, 
constantly advise both remedial and preventive measures. 
The Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor entered definitely, 
70 years ago, on a campaign against the social causes of poverty, and to-day 
has a definite concrete answer for this question as applied to each cause of 
poverty, an answer which calls upon all the activities of the association itself 
and upon all the resources of the agencies which in city and State offer their 
helpful cooperation. 
Where sickness causes poverty, the visitor arranges for medical examina- 
tion, diagnosis, advice, and treatment, for hospital or sanatorium care if the 
physician so recommends, or for home care of the patient by a visiting nurse 
who also instructs some members of the family in the simple method of nurs- 
ing. When the illness is temporary and the patient reaches the convalescent 
stage, arrangements are made for a visit at a convalescent home. When the 
illness is of a contagious nature, proper precautions are taken, in cooperation 
with-the department of health, to prevent its spread. When the illness is 
chronic or incurable, a suitable hospital or institution may be found for per- 
manent cure, or home care can be systematized and lightened by the pro- 
vision of needed appliances, wheel chair, couch, crutches, or cushions. 
From the beginning the well members of the family are guarded from too 
close contact with the patient, and their general health is fortified by good 
food and nurse’s advice. If the illmess has attacked the breadwinner, the 
lowered. income is supplemented in such measure that it may not result in 
lowered vitality. If the illness is bringing a new baby to the home, the mother 
has the care and instruction of a visiting nurse, .a specialist in maternity 
cases, and mother and infant go to Caroline Rest, the association’s beautiful 
Hartsdale Home, which is its “school for mothers,” to grow well and strong 
and to form those habits of good, sensible care and living which after the 
return home will go far toward maintaining the health of the whole family. 
If the illness has been induced by insanitary surroundings or unhealthy 
working conditions, a change of residence, to better rooms or from city to 
suburbs, is effected, or a change of occupation to healthier employment. 
But the association has from its earliest days done larger things toward the 
cure and prevention of disease and the preservation of health than the care 
given to individual families. Its epochs of advance show the following results 
accomplished through its plans and efforts: 
1845. Housing conditions investigated. 
1848. Plans for model tenements distributed. 
1851. Demilt Dispensary founded. 
1852. Northwestern Dispensary founded. 
Public washing and bathing establishments built. 
1857. Investigation into defective dwellings, sewerage, and filthy streets. 
 
-P-A-G-E-343
TYPICAL HEALTH-TEACHING AGENCIES, 317 
1860. Popular lectures on hygiene. 
1862. Hospital for Ruptured and Cripples founded. 
1864. Pure-milk legislation secured. 
1865. Special sanitary methods to check cholera epidemics. 
1878. Cooperation with board of health in tenement-house inspection. 
1883. Fresh-air parties to Coney Island begun. 
1891. People’s Baths built, the city’s first public bath. 
1892. Sea Breeze Fresh-Air Home started. 
1896. City and Suburban Homes Co. organized. 
1902. Three municipal baths established. 
1904. Milbank Memorial Bath opened. 
Sea Breeze Hospital opened for children with nonpulmonary tubercu- 
losis, the first American experiment in seaside open-air treatment 
for crippled children. 
1906. Committee on physical welfare of school children. 
Junior Sea Breeze opened. 
$250,000 raised for a seaside hospital. 
1907. Caroline Rest for convalescent mothers founded at Hartsdale, N. Y. 
Home instruction by visiting nurses. 
1908. Seven milk depots opened, with 36 Mothers’ Conferences. 
Home visiting from dispensaries started. 
1910. Instruction to mothers on recreation piers in diet and hygiene. 
1912. Home ilospital opened. An éxperiment in the care of 20 tubercular 
families, housed in a city model tenement, combining the comforts 
and advantages of both home and hospital. 
The whole fresh-air campaign of the association—five Sea Breeze months 
during the summer and Caroline Rest opened during the entire year, Sea Breeze 
Hospital with its 43 little patients and the Home Hospital with its 20 fami- 
lies—has for its object not only the return to normal health following sickness, 
but that physical upbuilding which prevents illness and wards off its recurrence. 
The Caroline Rest and School for Mothers was founded and en- 
dowed by Mr. George H. F. Schrader in honor of his mother, and is 
under the management of this society. Its purpose is to receive and 
furnish poor mothers a chance to rest and recuperate. after confine- 
ment. Any case of maternity reported to the Caroline Rest nurses 
will be visited and helped until the arrival of the infant, and after 
the mother is able to be up. In order that a mother may not be 
worried about the other children, all under 10 are brought with her. 
The mothers receive instruction in sewing, cooking, personal and- 
home hygiene, and in all that has to do with better home life. The 
older children who come with their mothers have an ideal diet, 
special health care, and a great farm in the open country to roam. 
The women are from the very poorest parts of New York City. At 
present 30 families are cared for. While the direct educational in- 
fluence of this Rest reaches a comparatively small number, its in- 
direct influence will be very great. It is an ideal home, out in the 
clean air and sunshine of the country. 
In December, 1912, the Rochester Public Health Association, 
through the cooperation of various agencies, conducted a health 
 
-P-A-G-E-344
  318 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
week, during which meetings were held afternoons and evenings, and 
various subjects concerning health were discussed. Surveys of fac- 
tories have been made, mainly for the purpose of discovering tuber- 
culosis among the employees; the association has distributed litera- 
ture championing the cause of medical inspection of school children; 
has secured the passage of local ordinances forbidding the sweeping 
of sidewalks during hours when the public are going to work; has 
prevented the displays of food in the street before groceries and 
markets, and has abolished the common drinking cup and towel. It 
cooperates with the moving-picture houses by furnishing lantern 
slides, designed to educate the public in matters of health, and gives 
many illustrated lectures with stereopticon outfit before labor or- 
ganizations, fraternal bodies, mothers’ clubs, etc. . 
The Visiting Nurse Association of Detroit reports through its 
superintendent, Mrs, L. E. Gretter, that for 1912 they employed 16 
graduated nurses, who ministered to and instructed in 2,130 homes; 
treated 4,673 patients in dispensaries, and made 27,074 visits.- In- 
struction included practical demonstrations in personal hygiene and 
cleanliness, bathing, ventilation, bed-making, preparation and care 
of food, care of mothers and new-born babies, prevention and treat- 
ment of ophthalmia, and proper dressing of infants and children. 
Sanitation of homes, back yards, and other premises was taught. 
They gave 622 mothers guidance in proportion of milk for babies. 
Specific instructions were also given to 1,703 tuberculous patients. 
The Visiting Nurse Society of Philadelphia, in its annual report 
for 1912, modestly states that “the object of this society is to give 
to the poor and to those of moderate means the best home nursing 
possible under the circumstances.” This society has been in exist- 
ence 26 years, and, judging from its detailed report of the past year’s 
work, has earned the gratitude of many homes for kindly help and 
instruction in time of need. The nurses employed made 73,231 visits 
during the year, and helped in many ways, besides nursing the sick, 
to make life more enjoyable to those in distress. 
The Providence Nursing Association, established 10 years ago, 
seeks to provide trained nurses whose duty it is to visit persons de- 
prived of proper care, to care for them in their homes, to give them 
such attention as is imperatively needed, and to instruct members of 
the household in the simple rules of hygiene. This association is 
for the benefit of the public, and no society or physician has any 
special claim on it. During the year 1911, 5,776 cases were attended 
and over 70,000 visits made. 
The Milwaukee Child-Welfare Commission was authorized in May, 
1911, by the common council of that city to study conditions which 
affect the lives of children and to formulate plans for saving the lives 
of babies. The chairman of this commission is Dr. John M. Beffel,
-P-A-G-E-345
  TYPICAL HEALTH-TEACHING AGENCIES. 319 
and he has furnished the following condensed account of its remedial 
and educational work: 
(1) The establishment of a child-welfare station with four nurses in attend- 
ance, one of whom is the head nurse. These nurses devote their whole time to 
the work of a small district in the Fourteenth ward, comprising 33 blocks, with 
a population in which there were 400 mothers with babies under 1 year of age. 
The station was centrally located and the mothers with babies under 1 year 
of age were organized into classes, each class meeting on a definite day the 
same physician week after week. Here the mothers were taught by the doctors 
and nurses the general lessons of hygiene and the care of the baby. 
(2) The nurses of the station made as many calls on as many babies under 
1 year of age as possible. It was found that one nurse could visit approxi- 
mately 100 babies a week. During the year from September 1, 1911, to Septem- 
ber 1, 1912, the nurses of the child-welfare station made over 21,000 calls, 
observing and recording on a carefully printed questionnaire the facts obtained 
from their visits; thus at the end of a year a large amount of material was 
gathered which is now being investigated and compiled by Mr. W. C. Phillips, 
former secretary of the child-welfare commission. 
(3) The midwives of the district were organized and taught by physicians in 
the district and others the general points which are so essential for these 
women. to know. 
(4) The physicians of the neighborhood were also organized and assisted 
enthusiastically in the work throughout the whole year. The station had a very 
decided influence upon the physicians of the district, even to such an extent 
that one of them has gone to New York for special work in children’s diseases. 
(5) The public was informed along special lines through editorials in the 
daily papers, all daily papers in the city publishing an editorial on child-welfare 
work. These editorials appeared daily and simultaneously and were written 
by a physician under the direction and supervision of the child-welfare 
commission. 
(6) Numerous lectures on child-welfare work were given throughout the 
year before various civic and philanthropic clubs of the city; as a result of all 
of this a great amount of public sentiment was stirred up in favor of child- 
welfare work. 
At present the child-welfare work is done wholly under the direction and 
supervision of the health department. An ordinance was passed making the 
child-welfare work a subordinate work of the health department, and each 
position in the work was provided for in this special resolution, naming salaries 
paid to each worker. This was necessary in order to legalize the work. As a 
result of the year’s work in the district the actual number of deaths among 
babies under 1 year of age during the year mentioned was reduced from 68 to 
48, an actual decrease of practically 333 per cent. The death rate in this 
whole ward for babies under 1 year of age, in proportion to the births, was 15 
per cent, whereas in the year mentioned this death rate was cut to 10 per cent 
in the 33 blocks in which the child-welfare work was done. 
The Division of Child Hygiene of the Department of Health of 
the City of New York represents a forward movement in the health 
care of the children in the larger cities. The functions of this 
division of the department are stated by the director, Dr. Josephine 
Baker, as follows: 
(1) The control and supervision of midwives; (2) the reduction of infant 
mortality ; (3) the supervision of foundling babies boarded out in private homes;
-P-A-G-E-346
  820 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912, 
(4) the inspection and sanitary supervision of day nurses; (5) the inspection of : 
institutions harboring dependent children; (6) the medical inspection and exam- 
ination of school children; (7) the vaccination of school children; (8) the 
enforcement of that part of the child-labor law which relates to the issuing of 
employment certificates. 
It is impossible to give any concise or complete account of the 
educational work of this department; it covers such a broad field and 
furnishes so many opportunities for teaching the people better care 
of their children that it will be unnecessary to attempt to speak in 
detail ofthis work. By study of the report of this division to the 
health authorities of the city, it is practically obvious that a larger 
emphasis is placed on preventive measures than on mere cure. Spe- 
cific directions are furnished to all the institutions and agencies 
cooperating with this division, and in this way much information is 
disseminated and great good must necessarily result. 
The question of whether medical inspection and examination of 
school children should come under the control of the board of health 
or the board of education is still an open one, but the trend is directly. 
in favor of bringing this division of the city’s health under the 
control of the board of education, in cooperation with the department 
of health. 
The South End House Women’s Residence, of Boston, is devoting 
its energies to health education under the following divisions: 
(1) Prenatal instruction in its various phases for expectant mothers and 
fathers, in informal classes at the House and in visits to the home. (2) Weekly 
conferences for mothers with babies from 2 weeks to 2 years old. (3) Physical 
examination of children of kindergarten age. The nurse visits in the homes; 
instructs parents as to preventive and curative measures. (4) Cooperation with 
the city school nurse and city visitor in preventing the spread of pediculosis. 
(5) Personally conducting groups of young people to hear regular series of 
health talks given in hospitals and dispensaries in the neighborhood. (6) Giving 
talks to mothers’ clubs on personal health, home nursing, care and feeding of 
children. 
The committee on infant social service of the Women’s Municipal 
League of Boston, reports that its work is principally devoted to pre- 
natal care, which is given by a graduate nurse under medical super: 
vision. j 
The work of the nurse in general is under our direction, but she carries out 
the physician’s orders for individual cases. 
Our practice is to visit every case at least once in 10 days, however well 
the patient may be, and as much oftener as is necessary if there is anything 
unfavorable in her condition. Directions are given to the patient with regard 
to her diet, exercise, work, clothing, and general mode of life. The nurse in- 
structs the patient in the importance to her child of the care of her own health 
and also gives her advice with regard to the care of the baby after birth. We 
have a set of baby’s clothes, a basket, mattress, ete., but our principal effort 
is devoted to giving prenatal care to the patient herself, for the sake of the

baby, for we believe that to be more important to the child than any later 
care, We also find that the nurse is often successful in persuading mothers to 
keep their babies with them when they had previously intended to board 
them out. 
We do not confine ourselves absolutely to prenatal conditions, but we are at 
present endeavoring to have the care of babies made a part of the course. in 
household economics for the girls of the seventh and eight grades of the 
grammar schools. 
The Infant Welfare Society of Chicago undertakes to “ keep babies 
well by advice, by encouraging breastfeeding, by instructions to the 
mothers in the rules of hygiene, and by furnishing certified milk 
below cost.” In their annual report for the year ending December 
31, 1911, their educational work is summarized in the following di- 
rections to mothers and nurses: 
Mothers, nurse your babies. The greatest good you can do your children is 
to nurse them during the first year. ; 
Nurse your baby only four times during the day; at 6a. m., 10 a. m., 2 p. m., 
6 p. m. and once at night. If the infant cries between feedings, give it some 
boiled water. A baby cries oftener from thirst than from hunger. 
Dress your baby only in loose-fitting clothes, so that it can move its arms 
and legs. z 
The baby should have only one feeding between 6 o’clock at night and 6 
o’clock in the morning. 
The baby ought to sleep alone. 
The best and safest way to raise your baby is to nurse it. 
Ten bottle-fed babies die to one that is breast fed. 
Before weaning the baby come to an infant welfare station. 
Do not pick up the baby each time that it cries. Teach it from the beginning 
to be content alone. 
The baby must have a tub bath every day, and in very warm days sponged 
with cool water once or twice daily. 
Do not feed the baby anything that the doctor has not prescribed. 
Keep your milk bottles in the icebox or in cold water. 
Use a fresh bottle for each feeding. Do not pour the milk into another 
bottle. Warm bottles before feeding the baby. 
All nipples and bottles should be cleaned and boiled once each day. Keep 
the nipples dry, in a clean covered glass. 
Do not feed the baby oftener than every four hours. The stomach must 
have a chance to rest or the baby will get sick. 
An oyerfed baby is usually an irritable, crying baby. A normal baby sleeps 
from 18 to 20 hours a day. The more fresh air and sunshine the baby gets, 
the better it will sleep. 
Keep the windows open all day and all night, except during the heat of the 
midday sun, 
Screen your windows and doors, as flies are carriers of disease. Many 
eases of summer diarrhea are due to germs carried by flies. Keep decaying 
vegetables and fruits covered; garbage attracts flies. 
Have the baby vaccinated when a few months old. 
If the baby has diarrhea stop all food, give only boiled water, and see your 
doctor immediately.

  322 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
The Infant Welfare Association of New Haven, Conn., undertakes 
the following work, as outlined by its secretary, Mrs. Eleaner C. 
Daggett: 
The aim of the Infant Welfare Association is the training of mothers to the 
intelligent care of their infant children. To this end the methods were en- 
tirely changed in 1912, and instead of maintaining milk stations as in three 
former years, where milk was put up and distributed at certain hours at a 
nominal price, conferences were held regularly, from May 1 to October 1, in 
four localities to which mothers brought their babies for weighing and inspec- 
tion and were carefully and thoroughly taught to put up the formulas indicated 
by the doctor in charge of the conference. Nurses followed each mother into 
her home and closely inspected her care of utensils, method of preparing 
the formula, and advised her as to where to buy her milk and how to care for 
the baby in every respect. Mothers were encouraged to nurse their babies 
where possible and were taught the principles of diet. 
From October 1 to May 1 conferences are held in two quarters of the city, 
and the time of one nurse is given to following up theebabies on the list during 
the summer months, and also to prenatal work among expectant mothers. s 
On May 1, 1913, the summer schedule will be resumed, and the four con- 
ferences resumed, and a large list of babies will be carried. 
The educational work for 1912 of the New York Diet Kitchen 
Association was reported by Maria L. Daniels, the superintendent, 
as follows: 
During 1912 the New York Diet Kitchen carried on a large amount of in- 
structional and educational work through the doctors, nurses, and matrous 
connected with its nine milk stations or “kitchens,” which are located in 
various congested sections of the city. 
All those who come to the stations for milk are taught the value and ad- 
vantage of good milk and are instructed in its proper care and handling, but 
the two main features of the educational work are the conferences for mothers 
and babies held at the stations and the visits of the nurses and matrons, who 
act as assistants to the nurses, in the homes for the purpose of following up 
the instructions given to the mothers at the conferences. 
Throughout the winter these conferences were held weekly in the smaller 
“kitchens ” and twice or three times weekly in those having a larger number 
of babies under their care, while in the summer the conferences were held more 
frequently in all stations, and in the two heaviest stations every week day. 
At the conferences, of which the doctors have charge, the babies are examined 
and weighed, and their condition at every visit noted on a weight chart kept 
for each child, while the mothers are instructed in the proper feeding and 
care of their babies, if they are bottle fed, or encouraged in and taught the 
value of breast feeding in every case where such feeding is advisable or possible. 
In case of illness of a baby the nurses will not only give it any treatment pre- 
seribed for it by doctor or dispensary, but will also teach the mother the proper 
method of preparing or giving such treatment when the baby is left to her care. 
This instruction in the home is not limited to the care of the baby, but in- | 
cludes advice or instruction in the care of the older children or invalids, house- 
hold hygiene, or anything else tending toward the improvement or elevation 
of family life.

The Infant Welfare Department of Duluth Consistory, Scottish 
Rite Masons, has furnished the following account of their work: 
For three years we have engaged a first-class nurse. This nurse visits the 
homes and gives instruction to the mothers and, where possible, gives prenatal 
instruction of great value. She then shows the mothers how to care for the 
infants, advises with them as to their food, and when necessary secures a phy- 
sician’s attendance. She holds what is called mothers’ meetings quite fre- 
quently, at which the babies are weighed and a record kept of their weight. 
She talks to the women and sometimes a number of girls drop in. These meet- 
ings are held in neighborhood centers, sometimes in the basement of a church, 
or wherever possible. She also has meetings for what we call the “little 
mothers ”; that is, the little girls who in so many cases are intrusted with the 
care of still younger ones. 
A summary of the work done by the Boston Chamber of Commerce, 
through its committee on prevention of disease, is stated by its assist- 
ant secretary, Mr. John W. Plaisted, as follows: : 
This committee made reports to the directors at various times on (1) the 
causes and prevention of common colds, (2) a plan for increasing the longevity 
of life insurance policy holders, and (3) infant mortality and the proper regis- 
tration of births and deaths. At the time when the committee ceased active 
work it had in preparation a long and detailed report on the hygienic require- 
ments of industrial establishments. This report included studies of ventilation, 
heating, humidity, and various other elements affecting health in factories, 
workshops, stores, ete. 
Educational work in connection with these reports was done mainly along the 
line of publicity regarding the causes and prevention of common colds. The 
committee secured the publication of a number of articles in the daily papers of 
the city and also in some of the current magazines, and issued a small placard 
giving a few practical suggestions on the subject. 
After study of the situation as to infant mortality and registration of births 
and deaths in Boston and the State generally, the committee decided that the 
Jaws then in existence on the subject were not adequate and so advocated the 
strengthening of those laws to a considerable extent. The committee also ad- 
yocated more careful supervision of the care of infants during the first few 
weeks after birth, with a view to preventing blindness. The result of the com- 
mittee’s campaign was the passage in 1912 of laws covering both these subjects. 
One of the most useful features of the work of this committee, and one directly 
in the educational line, was the committee’s activity in the establishment of 
preventive clinics, so called, in various industrial establishments in and about 
Boston. The committee believed that much time lost in industrial establish- 
ments through illness could be saved by a study of the workers and advice to 
them in the early stages of illness which might prevent any serious conse- 
quences. The committee, therefore, advocated the employment of a nurse either 
part or all of the time by establishments large enough to bear the expense, and 
also arranged to secure the attendance of a physician, in a room provided for the 
purpose, one hour or more each week, the physician making examinations of 
employees who showed symptoms of illness and advising them as to the proper 
methods for combating it. Asa result of the work of the committee some 7 or 8 
such clinics were established, and indirectly it is believed that a large number 
of other establishments were induced to adopt the same plan. Most of the 
factories and stores with which the committee worked now employ a nurse
-P-A-G-E-350
  824 ‘EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
during practically the full working time of their employees and have a doctor 
in attendance one or more hours a week. The establishments which have adopted 
this plan believe thoroughly that it pays and report a considerable improvement 
in the health of their employees, though many of the employees are rather back- 
ward about reporting illnesses to the nurse or physician. 
The committee compiled the following hints on How to Avoid 
Common Colds and published these in the interest of public health: 
Common colds are contagious. They are caused by germs. You catch cold 
just as you catch diphtheria. The germs of colds are spread from the nose 
and mouth of one person to another. 
Drafts, wet feet, chilling of the body, and sudden changes of temperature 
will not in themselves cause a cold. (Stiff neck and other muscular pains are 
not, here included.) These conditions may weaken the body, help the germs, 
favor the development of colds, and make them worse. But it is worth noting 
that Arctic explorers never suffer from colds until they become infected from 
-their fellow men on their return to civilization. 
Do not get close to others who have colds. 
Do not use handkerchiefs, towels, cups, ete., that have been used by people 
who have colds. Even though you do get your cold from your neighbor, do 
not pass it on. 
Do not sneeze or cough except into your handkerchief. 
Do not spit on the floor; to do so may spread colds, tuberculosis, and other 
diseases. 
Do not neglect a cold. It may lead to serious complications. During the first 
few days, if you have fever, stay in bed. This will help you and protect others 
from getting your cold. Take a laxative and use simple household remedies. 
If these do not help you, call a doctor. 
You will be able to resist the germs causing colds if you keep your body in 
good condition. 
Breathe pure air; avoid dust; take regular exercise; get plenty of sleep and 
rest; eat wholesome food; and do not sit for iong hours in a stuffy, close room. 
Colds come from the bacteria in your mouth, teeth, nose, and throat; therefore 
keep these parts clean. Z 
The Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, through its committee on 
health, has been instrumental during the last three years in further- 
ing the work of the Rockefeller Commission for the Eradication of 
Hookworm Disease, in helping to introduce medical and dental 
inspection of school children in the city and country, in a movement 
to secure better housing conditions of the negroes, in interesting the 
children of the public schools in securing clean-up pledges from the 
citizens (30,000 pledges secured), and in educating the public in the 
prevention and cure of tuberculosis. 
The public health department of the Social League of Middletown, 
Conn., directs its efforts along three lines: 
(1) The Sanitary Investigation and Improvement of Housing Conditions.— 
In the spring of 1910 our regular social worker obtained permission from the 
city officials to act as a deputy of the city health officer in the investigation of 
housing conditions in certain sections of the city. Her report revealed such a 
need of improvement and regular investigations that the city council passed
-P-A-G-E-351
    
TYPICAL HEALTH-TEACHING AGENCIES. 325 
an order requiring an investigation of the entire city at regular intervals. This 
is now done by an officer at city expense, and as a result many insanitary 
conditions have been remedied. 
(2) Improvement of the Present Method of Disposing of Refuse.—The attempt 
to enforce the city ordinance requiring the separate disposal of ashes, garbage, 
and paper was unsuccessful, as the public objected to the extra trouble caused, 
and the ordinance was rescinded. The league has not given up the fight, how- 
ever, and by gradually educating public opinion hopes finally to introduce a 
better method of disposal than the present insanitary one of mixing garbage 
with ashes and other refuse on city dumps. 
(3), The Reduction of Infant Mortality——For three years the league has tried 
to diminish the number of babies dying from preventable causes by the opera- 
tion of modified milk stations and the instruction of mothers in the care of 
their babies. During the last two summers a trained nurse has had charge 
of this work, and valuable service has been given in educating the mothers how 
to care for their own health and that of their children. 
The Bureau of Industries and Immigration of the Department of 
Labor of the State of New York, through its secretary of education, 
is preparing articles for the newspapers of the State relating to the 
health, the transportation, employment, and swindling of the immi- 
grants in the State. One of the duties of the bureau is to oversee 
the labor camps, and through placards and pamphlets in foreign 
languages to improve the sanitation of such camps and :to teach the 
workers better care of their health. 
ANTITUBERCULOSIS LEAGUES, ASSOCIATIONS, AND ORGANIZATIONS. 
The Cincinnati Anti-Tuberculosis League reports that for 1912 
they received $30,728, which was used in establishing dispensaries, 
day camps, in exhibitions, school instruction, sanitary surveys, pub- 
lishing a journal on outdoor life, developing a moving-picture film 
r entitled “ Darkest Cincinnati,” holding mass meetings, utilizing a 
press agent, ete. Growing out of such work the following results 
may be mentioned: A vacation ordinance, promise of a larger and 
more efficient sanitary force, police court fines for noncompliance 
with sanitary orders, promise of a housing association, better pro- 
vision for tuberculosis hospital accommodations, and many other 
improvements. 
The following figures will illustrate the extensiveness of the work 
done by this league: 
42,178 children in public and parochial schools addressed. 
3,037 children attended day camp. . 
406,293 people attended exhibits. 
282,600 pieces of educational literature distributed. 
228 columns of educational matter in daily press. 
6,373 visits made by nurses to homes. 
The Boston Association for the Relief and Control of Tuberculosis 
gives through its publications a great amount of advice and direc-
-P-A-G-E-352
  326 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
tions regarding the prevention of consumption. In one of its publi- 
cations entitled, “A War upon Consumption,” it tells the people of 
Boston that: 
Consumption causes more than a thousand deaths in Boston every year. But 
able physicians tell us that, if we follow certain directions, we can help to 
stamp out this disease. 
Consumption is not inherited. It does not belong to our climate. It is very 
often cured. It is actually on the decrease. : 
Consumption is usually carried by the poison which comes from the con- 
sumptive’s sputum, or spit. Sick persons should take care to burn their spit, 
or put it into the water-closet. ; 
The trouble now is that consumptives spit upon the floor or in the street. 
The poisonous sputum then dries and goes as dust into other people’s lungs. 
A little spit is enough, when scattered in dust, to infect dozens of people. 
They also issue a warning to those who have weak lungs. They say 
in this connection that: 
Dust and smoky or dusty places are bad. Dark, damp, or crowded rooms 
are bad. 
Dirty shops and siores, dirty saloons and dance halls, dusty kinds of business, 
like marble-cutting, sorting feathers, or making cigars, are bad for weak lungs. 
To sit bent over one’s sewing or other work is bad. 
Self-indulgence and intemperance are very bad. Vice which weakens the 
strong kills the weak. ‘ 
They further attempt to teach that plenty of fresh air prevents 
consumption ; that it is the duty of the people to choose sunny rooms; 
that if a consumptive is moved out of a room it should be disinfected 
before occupied by others; that outdoor work is vastly better than 
indoor work; to engage in deep, full breathing for several minutes 
in the morning and at night, in order to develop the chest capacity. 
They advise people to spend money for simple, well-cooked food, 
and urge them to spend no money for liquors or for quack medicines. 
They do their work in connection with the other agencies in Bos- 
ton designed to aid in this fight and in the general propaganda of 
health. 
Chicago Tuberculosis Institute has undertaken during the past two 
years the following special lines of work: 
It has prepared a very complete exhibit in regard to tuberculosis, 
and for this has spent over $3,000. This exhibit will be displayed 
in various parts of Chicago for the next two or three years; and 
during these exhibits, lectures, discussions, and conferences will be 
held, attempting to interest and instruct each locality in the preven- 
tion of tuberculous infection. 
The other part of its work consists of a campaign for the intro- 
duction of medical examination of employees in industrial concerns. 
Its plan for the examination of employees is as follows 
1. A physician examines all suspicious cases among the employees. 
The physician not only determines whether the man individually is 
 
-P-A-G-E-353
  TYPICAL HEALTH-TEACHING AGENCIES, 327 
infected or not, but gives instructions to the sick in the essentials of 
treatment of those who seem to be predisposed to this disease. Dur- 
ing the noon hour or the evening the entire working force of the 
establishment are gathered together for a brief discussion of health 
topics. 
2. Trained nurses are employed to assist the physician in the ex- 
amination of the workers. In addition, the nurses are instructed to 
visit and study the homes and living conditions of the employees 
and to instruct the family in the fundamentals of right living, and 
especially in the methods of the care and prevention of this disease. 
This plan has been put in operation in some of the largest shops 
and manufacturing establishments in Chicago. 
This association has set for its watchwords in connection with its 
work, Education, Detection, and Control. Tt is expecting the work 
of its physicians and nurses to be, to a great extent, educational, 
and to extend beyond the factory, office, or store into the homes of 
the employees. With this idea in view, the association says: 
Education in right living will tend toward the improvement of the state of 
resistance in the majority of these cases and is bound to reflect itself in the 
attitude of the entire working force toward the problem of health. 
The St. Louis Society for the Relief and Prevention of Tubercu- 
losis was organized in 1907 by uniting two former associations 
having for their purpose similar work. In addition to the regular 
educational work such societies are undertaking throughout the 
country, it is especially noticeable that this society has given special 
attention to the establishment and maintenance of open-air schools. 
The first school of this sort was opened thé 24th of August, 1911, with 
9 children; in a short time 25 children were in attendance and 71 on 
the waiting list. The schoolhouse is built in the form of a pavilion. 
In addition to their work in connection with their open-air schools, 
through their nurses they come in contact with the homes, with the 
various clinics in the city hospitals and church missions of one sort 
or another. 
The educational purposes of this society may be summarized as 
follows: To maintain a system of visiting nurses, to teach people to 
seek more sanitary homes, and, in general, to teach the people the 
dangers of tuberculosis and the necessary information they should 
have to guard againt an attack, or to submit to proper treatment in 
the incipient stages of the disease. 
The San Francisco Association for the Study and Prevention of 
Tuberculosis is directing its educational work through large display 
cards placed in various sections of the city, through a flasher placed 
77236°—xp 1912—vot 1——23

in the Union Station, and by lecture work. The chairman of the 
educational committee, Dr. W. C. Voorsanger, says: 
We have a very fine slide collection of local, eastern, and foreign material. 
We try to give lectures not so much in our own building as in various sections 
of the city, and before various clubs and civie organizations. We find that 
public lectures are poorly attended, but that lectures given before a different 
section of the city or a “neighborhood” lecture always draws a large crowd. 
We are doing considerable work in the schools, both with the children through 
their teachers and through public lectures, and also to the parents in the even- 
ing at various: stated times. To illustrate, this month there will be three 
evening lectures on “ Tuberculosis,” one in the city here and two across the 
bay, in Oakland, each in different auditoriums. 
Through the initiative and influence of the Texas Anti-Tuber- 
culosis Association, Gov. Colquitt, of that State, called the South- 
western Conference on Tuberculosis, which met at Waco, Tex., April 
16 and 17, 1912. 
This conference was called— 
to consider ways and means of aiding poor consumptives of other States who 
go to Arizona, California, Colorado, Kansas, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, 
and Utah, in the hope that a change of climate may be beneficial to them. 
At the close of this conference the following resolutions were 
adopted, and deserve widespread attention in order to acquaint those 
who go to these States for relief with difficulties to be encountered : 
A resolution declaring the care of tuberculosis strangers in the Southwest to 
be an interstate problem, and calling upon the Federal Government to convert 
abandoned forts and military reservations in the Southwest into tuberculosis 
sanatoria. 
A resolution advocating publicity as to the lack of free hospitals for stranger 
consumptives in the Southwest; the inability of charity organizations to aid 
such; the difficulty of securing suitable employment; that consumptives coming 
to the Southwest should have funds sufficient to carry them for about one year. 
A resolution declaring that institutions for the care of consumptives are nec- 
essary in the prevention of tuberculosis and calling upon the legislatures of the 
Southwestern States to provide same. 
A resolution declaring that tuberculosis can not be eliminated without im- 
proving living and working conditions and describing legislation necessary to 
secure such improvement. 
The Anti-Tuberculosis Committee of One Hundred, of Winston- 
Salem, NV. C., outlines its health services to the community, as follows: 
To provide and impart instruction and give relief to tuberculous per- 
sons in their homes and to their dependents or family, in order that 
they may understand and practice the care and caution that is needed 
to restore health and prevent further infection. This instruction is 
provided through printed matter, personal visits by nurses and other 
members of the committee. 
The committee also provides lecturers who present to school, church, 
and other public organizations the latest information on the methods 
and means for prevention of this disease.
-P-A-G-E-355
  TYPICAL HEALTH-TEACHING AGENCIES. 329 
This committee also is attempting to make*a general health survey 
of the living conditions of its people and, where the need is evident, 
to instruct them in personal hygiene and sanitation. The schools are 
visited and studied from the health point of view, and where needed 
the public is notified with reference to the conditions under which 
the children are working. 
The work of the Massachusetts Hospitals for Consumptives, estab- 
lished under the act of 1907, is attracting a great deal of attention. 
The educational work of the board of trustees is set forth in their 
Public Document No. 77, published in 1912, as follows: 
During the year 1911 the educational work of the board has steadily increased. 
As in the past, bulletins have been sent out every two weeks to nearly 200 
newspapers in the State. Many letters touching on every phase of the tubercu- 
losis question have been written to physicians, patients, and their friends and 
antituberculosis workers, not only in Massachusetts but all over the country. 
The office of the board has become an information bureau to which patients, 
physicians, and others are constantly coming to interview the secretary of the 
board in regard to the sanatoria and other questions connected with the work. 
Literature in the way of reports, reprints, instructive pamphlets, pay-envelope 
cards, ete., are kept on hand for distribution. Members of the board, the four 
superintendents, and the secretary have given lectures to large numbers of peo- 
ple on the general subject of tuberculosis, and the four superintendents have 
given many informal talks on this subject to their patients. The Journal of 
the State Sanatoria, a monthly paper published at the Rutland State Sana- 
torium, in addition to giving items of news from the four sanatoria, contains 
numerous articles of interest and value not only to patients but to their friends 
and to the public at large. This paper is distributed to the patients, anti- 
tuberculosis associations, physicians, and to many others who have asked that 
their names be put upon the mailing list. 
They also employ school tuberculosis exhibits to educate the chil- 
dren and the parents throughout the State in all matters pertaining 
to the prevention and cure of this disease. They state in a special 
pamphlet, printed in 1910, that the object of the exhibit is more to 
demonstrate: 
1. That there is a right and a wrong way of living. 
2. That fresh air day and night, cleanliness, exercise, and wholesome food 
are essential not only in the treatment of consumption but are more important 
still in avoiding. consumption and in maintaining that condition of health which 
will ward off disease. 
3. That consumption is itself rarely inherited, but that it is a disease usually 
due to carelessness and ignorance. 
4. That people working and living under proper conditions need not worry 
about getting consumption. 
5. That prevention is better than cure, and that good physical health is more 
precious than much knowledge. 
The California Association for the Study and Prevention of 
Tuberculosis is the parent body of component affiliated societies, 
located in Oakland, Los Angeles, Pasadena, Redlands, Riverside,
-P-A-G-E-356
  330 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, San Rafael, Stock- 
ton, Sierra Madre, Santa Ana, and Pacific Grove. The purpose of 
this society is to carry on a State-wide publicity campaign, and to 
have lecturers in the field at all times, teaching the people, both in 
the city and country, how to prevent the spread of tuberculosis and 
how to treat those who are infected. i 
California has an especially peculiar work to do in this connection, 
due to the fact that so many infected people go to the State, espe- 
cially to the southern part, hoping thereby to get relief from this 
disease. This tends to bring the people of California into contact 
with a great many cases of tuberculosis, and hence, despite the special 
advantages of the climate, the people are realizing that only through 
effective educational work can the health standards of the State be 
maintained. Illustrative lectures, given before teachers, institutions, 
and general audiences and in connection with the public schools, have 
been of great service in helping the situation there. 
Dr. M. G. Overlock, State inspector of health of the eleventh 
Massachusetts district, summarizes his work in connection with 
industrial establishments in the following words: 
The work began by a series of lectures at the noon hour to the employees 
of the large industrial establishments on personal hygiene and preventive medi- 
cine. Later these lectures were given on Sunday evenings and such other eve- 
nings through the week when audiences could be gotten together in different 
parts of the State, as well as in different parts of New England and several 
of the Eastern States. The second part of the plan consisted in getting the 
manufacturers to agree to pay the $4 per week required of all who would 
enter a sanatorium if found ill with tuberculosis. 
The great value of this movement from an educational standpoint is that 
hundreds of patients are being cured under this movement in the different 
sanatoriums and sent back into the community in which they live as teachers 
of personal hygiene and sanitation. They become centers of good health instead 
of centers of infection. Another point is that it raises in the mind of the 
manufacturers this question: What are the elements at work in my establish- 
ment which are productive of tuberculosis, and how can I best remedy it? It 
teaches the manufacturer that, where proper hygienic surroundings are in 
vogue, tuberculosis will not thrive. It attracts the attention of the employee 
to the neglected cold and slight cough, and tells him that an early examination 
of the chest and sputum is much better and safer than the drug-store treat- 
ment of these seemingly slight matters which if taken early can be cured. 
By publishing the letters from day to day in the daily press it keeps alive 
the interest of the public and societies for the prevention of tuberculosis, 
thereby enlisting their cooperation. We are now uniting a second plan with| 
the one already in vogue, which, briefly described, is as follows: If the pro- 
prietor of one manufacturing establishment is caring for four people each 
week at the cost of $4 per week for each person, or an aggregate of $16 pe 
week, we are asking the employees to contribute a like sum to be distribute: 
among the families of those who are being cared for by their employer. U: 
to the present writing we have had no refusals from manufacturers to joi 
this movement. And if it can be extended, which I have eyery reason to feel    
    
                  
       
           
 
-P-A-G-E-357
  TYPICAL HEALTH-TEACHING AGENCIES. 3381 
that it can and will, throughout the whole manufacturing establishments in the 
United States, in a short period of time it will protect the 7,000,000 of those 
employed in these different establishments. This movement has become known 
as the Overlock Tuberculosis Agreement. 
Dr. R. H. Bishop, jr., secretary of the Anti-Tuberculosis League 
of Cleveland, Ohio, reports that in addition to educational cam- 
paigns, which consisted of stereopticon lectures, moving-picture 
shows, and discussions before audiences, a systematic canvass of the 
public schools was made, where lectures were given in each school 
building, and that thousands of pamphlets on tuberculosis were dis- 
tributed. Most of the educational work is done at Christmas time, 
in connection with the sale of Red Cross seals. 
Within the last year the “Cleveland Health League,” consisting 
of a dozen or more organizations that are concerned in the health of 
the home, has been organized; a paid secretary is.employed, who, in 
cooperation with the executive committee, superintends the placing 
of the exhibit and arranges for an extensive educational campaign 
in various sections of the city. Each organization has a section in 
the exhibit, setting forth the main points in its work and its relation 
to the health of the home, and it is so gotten up that anyone visit- 
ing the exhibit starts in with the prenatal care of the child as given 
by the maternity dispensary, the work of the babies’ dispensary, 
medical inspection of schools, etc. It is now proposed to connect all 
of these organizations with the health department, in which will be 
developed an educational bureau. Article 2 of their proposed con- 
stitution, setting forth the object of this league, is as follows: 
The object of this league shall be the dissemination of information concern- 
ing public health. It shall bring to the attention of those who may need to 
use them the facilities offered by boards, institutions, organizations, and 
agencies, both public and private, dealing with public health matters. It 
shall promote publicity on the means of improving health conditions as recom- 
mended by these various agencies, both public and private. Its methods shall 
include exhibits, lectures, publication of pamphlets and newspaper articles, 
and such other means as are available to attract either local or general atten- 
tion to the betterment of health conditions. 
Cohoes, N. Y., has a committee to prevent tuberculosis. The fol- 
lowing rules to prevent disease were printed on a card headed “ Health 
is Wealth,” which is distributed by this committee in the homes 
and is so arranged that it may be hung up in the house for ready 
reference. In addition to the rules printed in one column, the other 
column gives the number and location of the fire-alarm boxes in the 
city. This device, of course, is simply .to make the card worth while 
to all and to cause it to be hung in a conspicuous space. It will 
be noticed that the rules which follow are not limited to advice re- 
garding tuberculosis, but are general in their nature. 
Good air.—Avoid badly ventilated, badly lighted, dusty, dirty, overheated, 
or damp rooms.
-P-A-G-E-358
  332 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912, 
Avoid house dust.—Breathing dust, notably house dust, often causes dis- 
ease. Have no tacked-down carpets and mattings. Have loose pieces or rugs, 
and clean them frequently outdoors. Use a hair broom for your floor, and 
keep lower sashes closed while sweeping or dusting. Open upper sashes, if 
possible. Never sweep rooms with a broom that raises dust. 
Pure water.—Drink pure water. Avoid water from shallow and unprotected 
wells, and from ponds and streams. If in doubt, boil the water. Avoid public 
drinking cups. 
Safe milk.—Tuberculosis, typhoid fever, and other diseases are often caused 
by drinking raw milk and raw cream. Get milk properly pasteurized, or home 
pasteurize it, or simply scald it. All cream, including that used for ice cream 
and butter, should be properly pasteurized to be safe. e 
Keep clean.—Take a bath or sponge daily, and a warm bath, followed by a 
cold splash, plunge, or shower once or twice a week or oftener. Use soap

breathe into another’s face. Don’t spit on floors or sidewalks. 
Sunshine.—Admit sunshine freely into your houses and into your lives. 
Cultivate cheerfulness and kindness; it will help you to resist disease. Your 
mind acts on your body. 
The State Charities Aid Association of New York, a voluntary 
organization, has for its stated objects— 
the visitation and improvement of charitable institutions maintained by the 
State and by counties, cities, and towns, the placing of destitute children in 
families, and the prevention of tuberculosis and insanity. The association has 
been in existence for 40 years, and is divided into local committees. The work 
it undertakes to do in teaching people how to prevent and cure tuberculosis is 
indicated by the summary of their work for the year 1911. 
The committee on the prevention of tuberculosis has carried on its campaign 
for the education of the general public and the adoption of constructive, pre- 
ventive measures in the counties, cities, towns, and villages of the State outside 
of Greater New York and Buffalo. In cooperation with the State department 
of health a large exhibit was sent to 12 cities and 6 small exhibits to 247 
villages in 21 counties. A series of meetings was held in each city and village 
and in the larger localities local committees were organized. A number of 
prominent State organizations indorsed the program of “No Uncared-for 
Tuberculosis in 1915,” and called upon their local bodies to petition county, 
municipal, and town officials for the providing of nurses, dispensaries, and 
hospitals. This and other propaganda work served to bring about, through the
-P-A-G-E-359
  TYPICAL HEALTH-TEACHING AGENCIES. 333 
* 
cooperation of local committees, the opening of 6 dispensaries, 3 open-air schools, 
the engaging of 15 nurses, the maintaining of 4 summer camps, and the 
assurance of the construction of 9 county hospitals and 2 city hospitals for 
tuberculosis. 
In addition to the detailed work simply suggested in this inclusive 
program the association sends representatives to the various confer- 
ences and associations having for their purpose the general health of 
the people. 
The efficient secretary, Mr. Homer Folks, during the year 1911, 
gave a course of lectures in the New York School of Philanthropy, 
and thade addresses at various. meetings of health and medical so- 
cieties, both in New York and elsewhere. 
The educational activity of this association proceeds along two 
lines: 
First, to teach people the salient facts regarding the nature, cure, and pre- 
vention of tuberculosis; and, second, to arouse sentiment for the creation of 
greater facilities for the treatment and care of the disease. % 
Their campaign of education is conducted— 
throughout the State of New York, outside of Greater New York, and is greatly 
helped by the 403 local committees affiliated with the State association, to in- 
duce county boards of supervisors to establish county tuberculosis hospitals and 
city authorities to appropriate funds for dispensaries and visiting tuberculosis 
hurses. 
A larger educational program is undertaken with reference to pub- 
licity. This is accomplished by special press bulletins, special stories 
in the daily newspapers and in the various press associations. In 
1912, 82,193 copies of special literature and 56,116 letters were sent 
to members and officers of tuberculosis committees, women’s clubs, 
granges, municipal and county officials, labor unions, county and city 
medical societies, and individuals. In addition to this means of 
publicity the association utilizes exhibits which they send through 
the towns and villages throughout New York State. Also, lecturers 
are supplied to various local organizations, acquainting the people 
with the latest information with reference to the prevention of 
tuberculosis and the care of those afflicted with this disease. To 
indicate how minutely this association has gone into the educational 
side of health work, health rhymes were printed on blotters and dis- 
tributed to the school children throughout the State. While these 
health rhymes are not especially poetic, it is interesting to see that 
they especially emphasize fresh air, free play in the open, plenty of 
sunshine, and ‘personal cleanliness. Only two of the rhymes suggest 
a doctor and possible medicine. These are: 
C—is for cough, which refuses to quit, 
D—is for doctor to look after it.

SOCIETIES FOR PREVENTION OF BLINDNESS. 
The Maryland Society for the Prevention of Blindness reports 
that, through the efforts of the educational committee, talks on the 
prevention of blindness have been given to many clubs, settlements, 
associations, Y. W. C. A.’s, and to other workers in the city. Leaf- 
lets have been prepared and distributed, and a plan has been pro- 
posed to organize the teaching of midwives in Baltimore. 
The society has given special attention to ophthalmia neonatorum. 
They also are attempting to safeguard the children by establishing 
systematic examination of children’s eyes in school. 
The Tennessee Federation of Women’s Clubs has given especial 
attention to the prevention of infant blindness, and has prepared 
and sent out through different health departments simple directions 
for the care of newborn babies. 
The American Association for the Conservation of Vision, Dr. 
F. P. Lewis, Buffalo, N. Y., president, states in a little pamphlet 
that there are over 100,000 blind people in the United States, and 
that in 30,000 of these cases the loss of sight was preventable. The 
purpose of this association— 
is to endeavor to obtain effective action through the health boards for the 
control of ophthalmia neonatorum and other infectious diseases of the eye, 
to secure in factories and workshops adequate lighting and more general use 
of protective devices to prevent accidents to the eyes, to extend knowledge, 
through the help of illuminating engineers, architects, and others, as to the 
best methods of illumination in public buildings and in our homes, and to 
enlist the cooperation of all who, through interest in the subject or through 
their occupation, can aid in preventing the unnecessary loss of eyes through 
carelessness or ignorance. 
The work is in charge of some of the ablest men in the country, 
specialists, practical philanthropists, and financiers, but it depends 
for its ultimate success on the support of the public. 
The Kentucky Society for the Prevention of Blindness has issued 
several circulars concerning the care of the eyes of newborn babies, 
and also warning people against the dangers of trachoma, which is 
quite prevalent in some of the mountain sections of that State. 
In the third report of the Ohio Commission for the Blind, made 
in 1910, to the governor, it is stated that the commission proposes: 
(1) To continue through a number of years educating the public for the 
saving of sight. 
(2) To forward and initiate movements for the profitable employment of the 
sightless. 
(3) To provide home teachers for those who in adult years have become 
blind, and so to ameliorate their condition. 
To carry forward such a program calls for the undivided attention 
and service of a competent superintendent, with sufficient funds to 
make his work really effective.

The social service work at the Massachusetts Charitable Eye and 
Ear Infirmary, as outlined in their fifth annual report, may be sum- 
marized briefly as follows: 
In the last five years the social service department has made over 5,000 visits 
to the homes of poor patients, and in addition has made a special study of 
contagious diseases of the eye in infants (ophthalmia neonatorum), visiting 
496 cases after discharge from the hospital; has given great assistance in the 
effective campaign in the city and State toward the prevention of blindness; has 
studied the relation of industrial accidents to total or partial blindness in wage 
earners; and has established a class for the treatment of tuberculosis of the 
eye, making about 300 visits each year to this class of patients alone. 
The committee on prevention of blindness of the New York Asso- 
ciation for the Blind was organized for the purpose of preventing 
unnecessary injury or loss of sight from any cause and is, therefore, 
endeavoring to eliminate ophthalmia neonatorum, trachoma, and 
other preventable eye infections, to prevent blindness from drinking 
or inhaling wood alcohol, eye injuries in the industries, and impair- 
ment of vision from improper lighting, and also the use of glazed 
paper in school books. 
The committee carries on its work through investigations, educa- 
tional publicity, cooperation with all organizations which can be 
helpful, and through influencing certain legislation. In the fourth 
annual report of the committee it is stated that— 
The educational work of the committee as carried on through the year has 
consisted of the publication and distribution of literature, public speaking, the 
loaning of exhibits and lantern slides, and the writing of magazine articles and 
press notices. 
The committee has published during the year a ninth edition of its circular 
No. 1, “The Prevention of Blindness,” containing practical suggestions for the 
preservation of sight; a second edition of No. 4, ‘‘ Directions to Mothers, Mid- 
wives, and Nurses for the Prevention of Ophthalmia Neonatorum,” in the four 
foreign languages, Yiddish, Polish, Italian, and German, and two editions of 
its third annual report for the year ending November 1, 1911. 
During the year 19,573 publications have been distributed; 11,648 in New 
York State, 7,805 in States outside of New York, and 120 in foreign countries. 
Addresses and talks on ophthalmia neonatorum, midwifery, lighting, and 
various phases of the work have been given by members of the committee and 
the executive secretary before the Central Nurses’ Club, of New York City, 
before the International Conference on Hygiene and Demography, and before 
the Illuminating Hngineering Society. 
The committee’s exhibits on ophthalmia neonatorum and other phases of 
preventable blindness have been shown at 16 conferences or meetings in 6 
different States, while 2 new exhibits have been prepared, one being sold to the 
University of Texas for use by its extension department, and the other, consist- 
ing of three large screens on the subject of trachoma, being incorporated in the 
Italian neighborhood child welfare exhibit prepared by the New York child 
welfare committee. Sets of lantern slides, in addition to frequent use in New 
York State, have been loaned to social welfare workers in four other States.

  336 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
The Massachusetts Commission for the Blind, in connection with 
its general educational work to enable the blind to become self- 
supporting citizens, is, through its field worker and in many other 
ways, doing effective educational work for the prevention of blind- 
ness, the education of midwives, the instruction of mothers concern- 
ing the care and treatment of their children, in urging the adoption 
of better laws for the prevention of blindness, and in the enforcement 
of the laws now on the statute books. In addition, the commission 
sends out an exhibit on the conservation of eyesight to various meet- 
ings, to public libraries, and to the various health agencies throughout 
the State. 
The commission was authorized under a law passed in 1906. Its 
chief concern, however, has to do with the needs of the adult blind 
and helping to establish them in self-supporting occupations. Its 
health education work, while important, is more or less incidental to 
its main purpose. 
DENTAL HYGIENE SOCIETIES. 
The National Mouth Hygiene Association has planned a nation- 
wide campaign for the purpose of (1) bringing about legislation 
which will permit local boards of health and boards of education to 
cooperate in the establishment of a complete system of medical and 
dental inspection and in the establishment and maintenance of medi- 
cal and dental clinics to care for the indigent poor. (2) To secure 
legislation which will make it possible to protect the public from that 
class of dental practice which is a menace not only to the individual 
but to the health of the community. (8) To secure legislation which 
will not only improve the conditions surrounding the teaching pro- 
fession of this country, but to enable boards of education to pay 
salaries commensurate with the service rendered. 
One of the most interesting experiments in oral hygiene and its 
relation to general intellectual development of children was that 
undertaken by this committee in Cleveland. While their findings 
must of necessity be tentative, on account of the number of children 
experimented on, nevertheless it is a start in the right direction, and 
the evidence goes to show that, other things being equal, those chil- 
dren whose mouths are well cared for are thereby enabled through 
the influence of better health to do a higher grade of intellectual 
work than those whose mouths and teeth are ill kept and in an 
insanitary condition. 
The direct educational work of this committee consists largely 
in making known to the people the serious condition of the mouths 
of children of all classes, cause of this widespread disease, and the
-P-A-G-E-363

necessary treatment to overcome it. Among their latest educational 
means is a moving-picture show entitled “Toothache.” This has 
been exhibited in many parts of the country and has aroused a good 
deal of interest. 
Many pamphlets and charts are published and articles prepared 
for popular magazines, all designed to educate the public with refer- 
ence to urgent need of better care of children’s teeth. They have 
been instrumental in establishing many school dental clinics and are 
forwarding this movement in a commendable way. 
The Rochester Dental Society has engaged in educational work in 
the public and parochial schools in that city. They have given free 
lectures on the subject of mouth hygiene, have made examination of 
school children’s teeth, have held public meetings to discuss the ques- 
tion of mouth hygiene, have established free dental dispensaries for 
the care of the teeth of poor children, and the publication of a dental 
dispensary record in a bimonthly magazine devoted to mouth hygiene. 
The East St. Louis Dental Society has for the last two years made 
free dental inspection of the mouths of children in the public schools. 
This year they have been successful in getting the school board to 
employ a nurse, who visits each schoolroom in the city, giving the 
children instructions in the care of the mouth and teeth, and im- 
pressing upon the pupils the necessity of an individual toothbrush. 
The county health commissioner for Porter County, Ind., Dr. 
Otis B. Nesbit, reports a very interesting line of investigation and 
education in his county with reference to dental inspection and edu- 
cation in mouth hygiene in general. He has devised a health exhibit 
especially for educating the children and others with reference to 
mouth conditions and their effects on general health. This exhibit 
is one of the most complete and striking I have seen in connection 
with the local work. One interesting feature of it lies in the fact 
that school children entered into the development and preparation 
of this exhibit, and in this way it has been of wider influence than 
it otherwise could have been. This is a sample of what may be done 
in any community by those interested. 
ORGANIZATIONS FOR SOCIAL PURITY AND THE TEACHING OF SEX 
HYGIENE. 
The American Federation for Sew Hygiene was incorporated in 
1912, and its stated objects are: The education of the public in the 
physiology and hygiene of sex, including the study and application 
of every means—educational, sanitary, moral, and legislative— for 
the prevention of vice and its diseases.
-P-A-G-E-364
338 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
Tts scheme of work as outlined by its president, the late Dr. Prince 
A. Morrow, of New York City, is chiefly educational, and includes the 
following lines of work: 
1. Enlightenment of the public in the knowledge of the enormous prevalence 
of venereal diseases, their dangers to the public health, and especially the dan- 
gers to the family and the race from their introduction into marriage. 
2. The education of parents to the great importance of instructing their 
children at an early age in the origin of life and the facts of sex. 
3. The education of young people in the physiology and hygiene of sex, 
through the introduction of sex teaching in schools and colleges, as a necessary 
and integral part of a rational education. 
The chief features of this educational policy are publicity and sex 
instruction. The methods which are now available, and which 
promise to be most effective, are lectures and conferences and the 
distribution of educational literature. 
The federation proposes: 
(a) The organization of a corps of lecturers chosen for their special fitness 
for this work, who shall address public audiences of men and women and 
various social groups throughout the country. 
(b) The wide distribution of educational literature and the giving of lec- 
tures, in the Y. M. C. A.’s, the settlements, large industrial organizations, trade 
and labor unions, to the employees of railway and street car companies, fac- 
tories, department stores, Army and Navy people, etc., and to secure the co- 
operation in this educational work of employers’ associations, civic clubs, 
federation of women’s clubs, social and reform associations, ete. 
(c) The establishment of educational centers in cities and towns which shall 
carry on local educational work, in cooperation with the various societies com- 
posing this federation, and the formation of similar societies in cities where they 
do not now exist, in order to secure the active working forces of the federation. 
(d) The preparation of a sex hygiene and eugenics exhibit which shall be 
exhibited in all the large cities of the country. 
(e) The selection of an advisory committee of trained experts, consisting of 
leading educators, sociologists, and physicians, who shall pool their wisdom in 
the formulation of the matter and methods of sex instruction in schools and 
colleges, the preparation of suitable textbooks on sex education, and to make a 
digest of existing sex literature with a view of recommending to the public 
judicious books for general reading. 
(f) The establishment of special courses in schools of pedagogy, teachers’ 
colleges, and normal schools, for the purpose of preparing teachers to ADEE E 
sex instruction wisely and effectively. 
(g) The enlightenment of advanced students in high schools and colleges, 
through medical lectures, of the nature and dangers of venereal diseases and 
their modes of contagion, direct and indirect. 
(h) To enlist the cooperation of boards of health, State and municipal, in 
securing the health department control of venereal diseases; to demand hospital 
treatment of all cases of venereal diseases which are not or can not be properly 
treated in private practice; and to urge upon municipal and State authorities 
the necessity of providing larger and more adequate facilities for the treatment 
of yenereal diseases in order to promptly sterilize sources of contagion and 
thus prevent the infection of others.
-P-A-G-E-365

(i) To study the fundamental causes of prostitution and the social and 
economic conditions of which it is the outgrowth, in order to apply fundamental 
remedies. 
(j) To cooperate with existing agencies for suppressing the affluents of 
prostitution, such as the white-slave traffic, dance halls where liquor is sold, 
steamboat and beach excursions, indecent posters, demoralizing plays, obscene 
literature, etc., and the enforcement of the laws for the suppression of public 
prostitution. 
(k) To secure legislative enactments for the protection of female minors, to 
throw sanitary safeguards around marriage, and to utilize all agencies under 
social control to prevent the marriage of the unfit and defectives who are fated 
to propagate their kind. 
The Seattle Society of Social and Moral Hygiene, through its 
secretary, Dr. Sydney Strong, reports that it— 
has been active for over a year. In the spring of 1912, it conducted a school- 
house campaign, holding parents’ meetings in over 50 schoolhouses. The cam- 
paign was repeated in the fall of 1912. Fully 7,000 parents have been 
instructed by these campaigns. The society has also had conferences and 
institutes and brought on lecturers from abroad. It has developed a staff 
of competent lecturers, physicians, and laymen, whose services have been in 
demand by other societies and clubs. The staff of 25 lecturers has been of 
great educational value. The superintendent of the public schools, the secre- 
tary of the State board of health, the head of the city board of health, are on 
the board of directors. 
The society has put out leaflets of its own and has maintained headquarters, 
where literature is on sale and exhibition. It has published an approved list 
of books, and these have all been placed in the public libraries. 
Public sentiment against the sex diseases and in favor of publicity is very 
rapidly growing. ‘The leading morning paper has eliminated all quack ad- 
yertisements. A bill is now before the legislature asking for an appropriation 
for purposes of education, through the board of health, on matters of sex and 
venereal diseases. 
The Pennsylwania Society for the Prevention of Social Diseases 
was founded in 1906, and aims: 
(1) To instruct every adult in the State of Pennsylvania with 
regard to the prevalence and the means of prevention of the social 
diseases. ; 
(2) To secure the willing treatment of these diseases by every 
hospital management throughout the State of Pennsylvania. 
(3) To safeguard our young men and boys, as well as young 
women and girls, by early, sane instruction in sex hygiene, and 
through them to protect our women and children against innocent 
infection, and to insure to them physical and moral rights identical 
with those enjoyed by the men. 
The California Social Hygiene Society was organized in 1912. 
The purpose of this society is to secure and disseminate information upon the 
subject of sex hygiene, of venereal disease, and of vices injurious to health and 
morals, and to that end to give lectures, distribute literature, and employ other 
appropriate means.
-P-A-G-E-366
340 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
The methods for bringing this topic to the attention of the public are lectures 
delivered by volunteer speakers on social hygiene. During the past four months 
there have been delivered in various school centers under our auspices, in schools 
in San Francisco and Oakland, some 14 lectures, and at the conclusion of the 
lecture the small publications which we issue were distributed. 
The Social Hygiene Society of Portland, Oreg., was organized in 
1911, and is cooperating with the State board of health and other 
agencies of that State to combat this prevalent evil and to carry on 
an educational campaign to acquaint the people with the seriousness 
of the situation. During the past year the following meetings have 
been held: Ninety-eight parents’ meetings, 2 meetings for fathers and 
sons, 43 meetings for miscellaneous groups of men, 59 meetings for 
boys, 45 talks to men in business houses, 7 talks to boys in business 
houses, 10 public meetings in churches and other public places, 2 talks 
to college women and high-school girls, 1 talk to public-school prin- 
cipals, 2 addresses to Western Oregon Teachers’ Association, and 3 
addresses before Chautauqua assemblies. 
In addition, this society has published and distributed many cir- 
culars bearing on sex hygiene and related topics. Some special effort 
has been directed against the “quack doctors” who prey on the 
ignorance of young men. 
The West Virginia Society of Social Hygiene was organized in 
1911 to induce the fathers and mothers, the church and public-school 
officers, “to meet this problem face to face.” 
The proposed methods of this society are: (1) To distribute circu- 
lars illustrative of the dangers of venereal contamination and de- 
monstrative of the urgency of this vital question. (2) Whenever 
practicable public meetings will be held, addresses will be delivered 
by competent speakers, and chapters of the society will be organized 
for the purpose of obtaining local cooperation in the general effort. 
(3) The society will support in every possible way the work of the 
Social Hygiene League, of which it, together with several other 
similar societies in other States, is a member. 
The Chicago Society of Social Hygiene, organized in 1906, has 
endeavored, says its secretary, William T. Belfield, to further three 
aims: 
(1) To instruct youths as to the injury, immediate and remote, to physical, 
mental, and social health, resulting from venereal disease and illicit sexual 
indulgence. 
(2) To direct the attention of parents and other guardians of children to the 
fact that most children will acquire knowledge of sex either on the street or at 
home—the parent must decide from which source the information shall come. 
(8) To disseminate the knowledge that the mentally defective, unfit to propa- 
gate normal offspring—including the feeble-minded, insane, epileptic, and habit- 
ually criminal—can be sterilized without impairment of the natural sex instinct 
and its gratification.
-P-A-G-E-367
  TYPICAL HEALTH-TEACHING AGENCIES. 341 
To further these ends, over 700,000 leaflets have been distributed, nearly all 
gratuitously, in response to requests from universities, colleges, Y. M. ©. A.’s, 
and other organizations; lecturers have been furnished to those requesting 
them; advice and literature have been given to some of the 14 societies of social 
hygiene organized in various cities since the Chicago society came into exist- 
ence; and cooperation with various organizations aiming to promote public 
health has been carried out. 
The Los Angeles Society of Social Hygiene states its purpose and 
methods as follows: 
To help establish the single standard of morals. 
To aid parents and teachers in preparing themselves for the proper instruc- 
tion of the young in sex knowledge. 
To enlighten the public regarding the prevalence and seriousness of venereal 
diseases. 
By publishing and distributing literature. 
By public addresses. (Speakers supplied upon request.) 
By keeping our office open daily for counsel and as a reading room and center 
of supplies for the best literature upon the subject of social hygiene. 
The secretary, Clifford Howard, says: 
The work of this society is devoted almost exclusively to the giving of talks 
to parents and teachers upon the necessity of proper sex education for the 
young. We have a small library of books and pamphlets on sex hygiene and 
kindred subjects which is open to all interested persons. The society numbers 
among its speakers some of the most prominent physicians, clergymen, lawyers, 
and social workers of the city, all of whom give gheir services gratuitously. 
The following statement, prepared by B. S. Steadwell, president 
World’s Purity Federation, will indicate the work of this federation: 
In so far as the work of the World’s Purity Federation may be said to be 
educational, our efforts consist almost entirely of promoting the teaching of 
sex physiology and sex hygiene. During the past two years we have sent out 
more than twenty million pages of literature, touring parties of expert workers 
have visited every section of the United States and every Province in Canada, 
traveling more than 14,000 miles, holding conferences in the leading cities. In 
the same time more than 1,000 public addresses have been given by representa- 
tives of the federation, while a largely attended international congress is held 
biennially. In all of this work we constantly hold up the necessity of living 
chaste, pure lives if we would be physically strong and healthy. 
The School of Eugenics of Boston is attempting to give instruction 
in sex hygiene according to the following program: 
Purpose.—The work attempts to meet the needs of (a) parents 
who find themselves unable to properly instruct their children in the 
facts of sex; (b) teachers who are unable to deal intelligently with 
school-room problems which involve moral questions; (¢) all social 
workers who need to understand more specifically the problems which 
center about, sex. 
Courses.—(a) Classes composed of mothers and teachers who meet 
for the purpose of instruction in the biology of reproduction and in 
matters pertaining to sex. These classes meet weekly and give an op-  
-P-A-G-E-368
  842 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
portunity for questions and discussions of home and school problems 
relating to the sex life of children. 
(6) Normal classes for the instruction of carefully selected candi- 
dates who desire to teach this subject. This work consists of lec- 
tures, laboratory work, a certain amount of collateral reading, the 
preparation and presentation before the class of papers, field work 
in the study of family traits, and practice teaching. Certificates are 
granted to those who pass the required tests and who otherwise show 
ability to instruct others in the subject of sex. 
(c) By far the greatest, numbers of people are reached through the 
extension classes of the school. These consist of series of lectures 
given before women’s clubs and other organizations of women, girls, 
boys, and men. 
(d) A summer course of instruction is offered to men and women 
who wish to qualify for teaching. This consists of 75 lectures and 
laboratory periods, required reading, the preparation and presenta- 
tion of papers, and trips to the aquarium, the botanic and zoologic 
gardens, and the natural history museums for the study of biologic 
specimens and the material to be used for teaching. 
The Maryland Society of Social Hygiene— 
aims to teach people how to care for their health by teaching the nature and 
seriousness of the diseases with which we are especially concerned; the man- 
ner and sources of infection; the difficulty of eradication; and the consequent 
need for prophylaxis. In thfs respect we teach the fallacy of the contention 
for the recognition of a so-called sexual necessity, the significance of heredity 
and eugenics, and the value of the training of the young in a more normal and 
systematic way in the laws of sex. The objects are sought to be attained 
through the medium of lectures and literature and through conferences of 
groups of people interested in the hygienic and educational welfare of the 
community. 
The society employs a secretary for full time, at present one who has had 
11 years’ experience in elementary and secondary school work. The secre- 
tary, in addition to the lines of work indicated, seeks to interest individuals 
and other organizations in the importance of studying causes of the spread of 
disease and the means of prevention. 
The St. Louis Society of Social Hygiene has furnished, through 
its president, Dr. George R. Dodson, the following statements re- 
garding its work: 
We are striving through the press, through public meetings, through lectures 
before all kinds of clubs, societies, classes, and associations, through churches 
and Sunday schools, and through the dissemination of literature—(1) To induce 
such parents, as are qualified, to instruct their own children in sex hygiene. 
(2) To create public opinion which will demand the systematic teaching 
of this subject in the public schools. (3) To cause the public to realize 
the serious nature of venereal disease and the extent to which the innocent 
become infected. (4) To bring to the knowledge of every woman and girl a

are well but who are germ carriers. (5) To combat popular errors, such as 
the doctrine that sexual intercourse is necessary to the health of men. (6) To 
explain to the public the fact that serious troubles, such as locomotor ataxia, 
ete., are often the sequel of venereal disease. (7) To create a public senti- 
ment that will demand of applicants for the privilege of marriage that they 
be free from venereal disease. (8) We are now advocating a law forbidding 
marriage to the feeble-minded. (9) We publish bulletins containing lists of 
approved books on sex hygiene. 
The. Connecticut Society of Social Hygiene says it— 
is concerned solely in the educational work pertaining to sexual health, the 
term social hygiene being used in that restricted sense. The organization has 
over 800 members, among whom are many of the most prominent people of the 
State. The educational work is carried on by means of volunteer lecturers 
and the distribution of educational literature. Under our own. caption we have 
published four educational pamphlets: No. 1, the general statement covering the 
topic at large, with a special appeal to the citizens of this State; No. 2, a 
pamphlet for young men; No. 3, a pamphlet for young women; No. 4, apam- 
phlet giving instructions for those infected with venereal disease. All of these 
pamphlets are for free distribution. 
We have recently bought a complete edition of 10,000 copies of Brieux’s 
play, “Damaged Goods.” These we are distributing for 25 cents: each. 
Recently we have secured the services of an able man who, as field secretary, 
will devote his whole time toward furthering the work of the organization. 
The American Vigilance Association, whose president is Dr. David 
Starr Jordan, president of Stanford University, states its purpose 
to be— 
to suppress and prevent commercialized vice, and to promote the highest stand- 
ards of public and private morals. To accomplish this purpose the association 
shall strive for the constant, persistent, and absolute repression of prostitution 
and the passage and enforcement of laws for the rescue and protection of girls 
and women, for the promotion of knowledge of the social evil, its effects and 
results, and for the circulation of the best literature regarding it. 
The official journal of this association is Vigilance, now in its 
twenty-sixth volume. It is a monthly magazine “correlating con- 
structive efforts for the suppression of the social evil.” 
The State Board of Health of Indiana issued a health circular 
entitled “Social Hygiene versus The Sexual Plagues,” which has 
been reprinted many times, and 100,000 copies have been distributed. 
This is an educational pamphlet designed to acquaint the public with 
the extent and dangers of these secret diseases, and also to suggest 
methods and means for combating them. 
The Detroit Society for See Hygiene is undertaking to teach people 
to care for their health in the following ways: 
We have been before practically all the labor unions, fraternities, clubs, fac- 
tories, laundries, church societies, and parent-teacher meetings in the city. 
This winter (1912-13) we have presented the subject to the entire high-school 
student body of the city. Our literature has been recommended as suitable in 
libraries by one of the official organs of library work, and has been called for

by numerous libraries. The total number of circulars printed to date has been 
about 190,000 copies. 
The Spokane Society for Social and Moral Hygiene states that the 
work of this society is entirely limited to the subject of education in 
sex hygiene. Lecturers have been furnished at public meetings 
where an avenue of publicity could be obtained. 
Reed College, in cooperation with the Oregon Social Hygiene 
Society, is offering an extension course on the general theme of 
“Sexual hygiene and morals.” Lectures are to be given in Port- 
land, Oreg., at the Portland Hotel, every Monday evening from 
February 10, 1918, to April 28, 19138. The purpose of this course of 
lectures is— 
for the benefit of various parents who feel a need for more complete informa- 
tion than has been given at single parents meetings, for business men and their 
wives, for public-school teachers, librarians, Sunday-school teachers, and other 
social workers. 
RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS ENGAGED IN HEALTH TEACHING. 
The superintendent, Charles Stelzle; of the bureau of social service 
of the Presbyterian Board of Home Missions, reports that in its sev- 
eral departments of work this bureau makes much of education with 
regard to the matter of health: 
Sociological surveys are constantly being made in various cities and States 
throughout the country, in which the bureau deals with sanitary conditions, 
housing, the social evil, the causes of mortality, and conditions in shop and 
factory as they affect the health of the worker. Invariably after a survey a 
comprehensive report is made, and recommendations based on the findings are 
suggested to the municipal authorities through the particular organization 
which requested the survey, or else these recommendations are carried out by 
the local organization for which the survey has been primarily made. 
In connection with such work, conferences with leading business and profes- 
sional men and social workers are held, and sometimes mass meetings are 
conducted for the purpose of giving wide publicity to the conditions, but par- 
ticularly to the constructive programs suggested. 
At the Labor Temple, a down-town church organized by the bureau in one 
of the most congested districts of New York City, there are frequent series of 
lectures on such subjects as tuberculosis, the causes and prevention of insanity, 
food reform, the social evil, and the care of the human body. 
The Methodist Federation for Social Service undertakes in addi- 
tion to other lines of work— 
to prevent all preventable diseases by spreading the knowledge of the methods 
of prevention and by forcing individual responsibility for the health of the 
community. 
To combat and destroy commercialized vice, to secure proper education in sex 
hygiene in the home and by competent instructors in the school, and to pro- 
mote the single standard of purity.

To repress the vicious features of commercialized amusement and to secure 
the provision and direction of adequate recreation and wholesome amusement 
by the community. 
The Council of Jewish Women, through the chairman of its com- 
mittee on education, Mrs. Bernard E. Pollak, reports its health work 
as follows: 
The 50 sections of the Council of Jewish Women (in 24 States and Canada) 
deal primarily with conditions affecting Jewish life, but in alt educational 
fields such as those promoting the public health the council necessarily 
merges its especial interest with that of the whole community. 
The general program of work issued triennially by the national chairman 
of the committees of the council of Jewish women to be used by the various 
sections urges the following essential features along the lines of public health: 
(a) Prevention of unnecessary blindness by cooperating with other agencies 
or for initiating means to arouse the public by an educational campaign con- 
cerning ophthalmia neonatorum, its causes, dangers, prevention, and cure; 
the necessity of educating and training midwives in the sanitary care of the 
baby’s eyes, the use of the nitrate of silver solution, etc.; the hygiene and care 
of the eyes, dangers of the common roller towel, eye strain, etc. 
(b) Prevention of tuberculosis by initiating a movement or cooperating with 
other agencies in a directed campaign of education for stamping out of con- 
sumption. 
(c) Teaching of personal and sex hygiene through medical inspection and 
the school nurse's talks to the children and mothers’ and parents’ clubs, point- 
ing the dangers of a lowered vitality in the child, induced by poor teeth, 
adenoids, eye strain, flat foot, anemia, insufficient and improper nourishment, 
rest, etc. It also urges cooperation with the teachers in initiating and con- 
ducting health talks with the children concerning the care of the body, the 
value of pure air, proper rest, the evils lurking in the roller towel, the common 
drinking cup, and the plague of the mosquito, fly, etc. 
About 35 sections, through special committees appointed for the purpose, are 
now directly furthering the cause of sex hygiene instructions following sugges- 
tions of the national committee. This is done through those within their own 
number, who are studying these questions, and by having lectures presented 
on this subject by physicians and educators; by cooperating with the American 
Federation of Sex Hygiene, or other like agencies in a campaign of education. 
We are striving to establish courses of instruction, study, and conferences for 
mothers, courses of instruction in sex hygiene in the normal schools, conferences 
between teachers, mothers, and physicians upon this subject, and a course of 
instruction that shall answer the needs of, and meet the problems of, the young 
men and women who have left school, with no preparation for the dangers about 
them, and are thrust upon the world to rise or fall according to chance. 
The Sunday-School Superintendents’ Union of Boston and vicin- 
ity, it is very interesting to note, is beginning to undertake educa- 
tional work in direct connection with health conditions. Through, 
its sex education committee, it is attempting to furnish to boys and 
girls of the proper age lectures and opportunity to borrow really 
worthy books to read, bearing on this subject. The chairman of 
this committee is Mr. Don 8, Gates.
-P-A-G-E-372
  346 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
The union is acting on the theory— 
that the ideal way that our children should be taught concerning matters of 
sex should be through their parents with a religious background, if possible. 
We are not advocating meetings of groups of boys or girls, but rather parents’ 
meetings where they may be able to see the importance and opportunity they 
have to instruct their children along these lines. To accomplish this object we 
are bringing the matter before the members of the union (about 375 members 
from nearly as many churches, within a radius of 30 miles of Boston) in three 
distinct ways: (1) By bulletins sent to all the members of the union; (2) by 
furnishing speakers once each year to address the union on this vital subject, 
and by furnishing speakers for parents’ meetings in the different churches; 
(3) by the loan of recommended books. 
The International Committee of Young Men?s Christian Associa- 
tions has furnished through one of its secretaries, Dr. George J. 
Fisher, specialist in physical education, the following comprehensive 
account of the educational attempts of this powerful association: 
We have our department of physical training. This is supervised by over 
600 physical directors, and reaches in its membership, through its 648 gymna- 
siums, over 300,000 men and boys. One hundred and sixty thousand are en- 
rolled in regular gymnasium classes. All this gymnasium work is based upon 
preliminary physical and medical examinations, and special exercise is given 
to those requiring it because of peculiar defects. Fully 67,000 such examina- 
tions were made during the past year, and over 1,000 physicians voluntarily 
cooperated in making these examinations and serve on the local medical staffs, 
thus making it possible to counsel with young men in reference to their health 
needs. 
The association does not limit its work to physical exercise, but places great 
importance upon teaching men to live with reference to personal hygiene. Two 
hundred and thirty-three associations report giving series of health talks; 171 
had first-aid classes. Lectures and study courses in eugenics and in public 
sanitation and kindred subjects are popular. 
The Young Men’s Christian Association realizes its responsibility to the young: 
men and boys in the community, irrespective of whether they are members of 
the association. In fact. while 300,000 have been reached in the membership, 
over 400,000 outside the membership have been ministered to in matters of 
health. A very comprehensive organization has made this possible. 
Nine thousand volunteer leaders have been trained in leaders’ corps to do 
technical physical work. Twelve hundred of these are teaching ‘in schools, 
on playgrounds, in churches, settlements, and boys’ clubs, thus making play 
and physical exercise possible to thousands who otherwise would have no 
supervision. 
The physicians give health talks in shops, factories, schools, churches, and 
in every conceivable place. 
Several specialists are giving a large portion of time to the Young Men’s 
Christian Associations and are used in community campaigns on sex education, 
holding conferences with parents, teachers, and leaders on the best methods for 
promoting sex education. Special courses of study have been developed and 
authoritative literature created. 
A Health League has been organized. which has 4,000 members all over 
North America. This league has two departments—a department of health edu- 
cation and a department of health service. Literature is sent to the members,
-P-A-G-E-373
TYPICAL HEALTH-TEACHING AGENCIES, 347 
special editions of certain well-known books on health being published. A 
monthly bulletin contains information on health topics. Pamphlets on smoking 
and alcohol have been written, and pamphlets issued by other organizations 
have been circulated. The department of service provides for the organization 
of local health-league chapters. To such chapters moving-picture films and 
stereopticon slides and lectures on health topics are furnished, and local cam- 
paigns in the interests of health are promoted. In some cities health days 
have been celebrated and a score of speakers organized, the schools and board 
of health cooperating. Health Sundays are organized in churches and material 
furnished to clergymen. In one city the films were placed on exhibition in a 
local theater, and over 2,000 children marched from the schools to see them. 
Clean-up days have been stimulated, and in one city a board of health was 
organized where none existed before. 
One significant movement is the promotion of rural health and recreation. 
Health surveys have been outlined and directed. A specialist gives all his time 
visiting county associations and gives play demonstrations in the public schools, 
showing the teachers how they can conduct certain games and physical activi- 
ties. Play festivals are organized, whole counties participating. The physical 
surveys have revealed many physical defects among school children. One vil- 
lage, where 100 school children were examined, revealed 40 per cent with 
adenoids and enlarged tonsils. Complete policies, based upon findings, are sub- 
mitted to and adopted by local committees for rural reconstruction. These 
include movements for abolition of open privies, health inspection in schools, 
efficient public sanitation, establishment of accurate system of vital statis- 
tics, ete. = 
Health institutes are held, in which health conditions and remedies are dis- 
cussed.. In mill villages the association has taken full charge of health work, 
and in construction camps secretaries have been given responsibility for the health 
of the men employed. 
One interesting form of service which the association has undertaken in the 
past three years is the popularization of swimming. Several experts were 
engaged to visit Young Men’s Christian Associations, each spending a week in 
2 city, at which time the swimming pool of the local association was thrown 
epen to the public and boys from the schools were given lessons free. A 
unique method was devised by which swimming is taught quickly. The water 
in the pool is heated. to 80°, land drills given, water wings used in the 
water until the stroke is learned, and in from one to three lessons boys 
jJearn to swim, unaided, from 25 to 50 feet. In these campaigns over 50,000 
were taught last year. Often the campaigns were held in the public baths. 
The results have been far reaching, some schools making swimming compul- 
sory. and often asking the association to do the teaching. In Chicago the sys- 
tem. was taught to all men in charge of the bathing beaches and municipal 
baths. 
The Young Men’s Christian Association is rendering effective service in help- 
ing to establish playgrounds, often supervising them until the municipality is 
educated to its responsibility and is ready to take them over. This is true of 
physical training in the public schools. Sunday School athletic leagues, fac- 
tory leagues, leagues among commercial houses, are organized and directed. 
A new form of athletic administration is now being promoted, the purpose 
of which is to unite the permanent organizations of a community, such as the 
school, college, church, playground, settlements and Young Men’s Christian 
Associations in giving direction to the sport of a community and muking them 
a part of sane health and character development 
 
-P-A-G-E-374
848 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
The national board of the Young Women’s Christian Associution, 
through its secretary, Miss Marcia O. Dunham, New York City, 
states that the matter of health teaching in Young Women’s Chris- 
tian Associations throughout the country can be summarized as 
follows: ; 
Physical education in the association comprehends training through exer- 
cise, developmental, hygienic, corrective, and esthetic. Indoor and outdoor 
games and athletic sports are promoted under rapidly improving conditions. 
Over 40,000 girls are registered in physical training classes, but these figures do 
not take account of the numbers who use the gymnasium and outing parks for 
recreative games and sports. 
Swimming, which affords the women the best means of overcoming many 
of the faulty habits of function due to dress, bad posture, and ignorance of 
hygiene, has come to have a prominent place in the Y. W. ©. A. program. 
Hygiene is taught by practical talks and popular forum on the purpose and 
value of exercise and rest, diet and dress; and also by well-worked-out 
courses of a popular nature on personal, industrial, and community hygiene, 
with practical application to the working and living éonditions which belong 
to the persons instructed. Special courses of lectures on health were given 
in 84 cities in 1912. 
The largest opportunity for emphasizing practical values is afforded in the 
summer camps and conferences where each summer for periods of from 10 
days to 3 weeks, thousands of girls practice the simple rules of health under 
a system of self-government, which proves to them conclusively that, although 
individuals may not be able to choose their environment, they can change it 
if they care enough to try. 
As a means of cultivating in women a right attitude toward health, the 
policy for the coming year includes a plan for setting certain standards of 
health and testing these standards among association members. 
The ideal of honor in holding health standards is the basis of the Health 
and Honor League, an organization which is being promoted among the girls, 
and which includes a scheme of practical training in things which are funda- 
mental in the life and experience of the woman of to-day. The goal is effi- 
ciency for the woman in the business, home, social, or moral sphere. A code 
is adopted for each section, and a point system enables the members to measure 
attainment. 
HOME AND SCHOOL LEAGUES AND ASSOCIATIONS. 
The Home and School League of Philadelphia is composed of 
some hundred and more organizations, two-thirds of which are 
grouped around school buildings. Many forms of activity have been 
entered into through the stimulating interest of the central body of 
the league. Those relating specifically to awakening an interest in 
people as regards health conditions are such as courses of lectures 
dealing with definite instruction concerning such subjects as fresh 
air, food values, physical exercise, etc. These lectures have been 
given in various sections of the city. During the past year some 
200,000 people have been reached in this way.
-P-A-G-E-375
  TYPICAL HEALTH-TEACHING AGENCIES, 349 
Another phase of activity has been carried on under the school 
luncheon committee, which, while furnishing children with whole- 
some, nutritious food at the small cost of from a penny to 3 cents 
for a meal, is succeeding in stimulating the home to a sense of its 
responsibilities in this direction. Following the school lunches in 
many centers, lectures on cooking have been given to the mothers 
belonging to the home and school group of their community. Re- 
ports are being received continually of the direct influence all of this 
is having on the health of the children, both in the home and in the 
school, 
A committee on housekeeping centers is following the children 
from the activities of the central body into their homes and by 
means of the personal touch is instructing the family in conditions 
that will make for health. 
Under the moral and social education committee another form of 
health benefit is being carried on by stimulating the boys and girls 
to a certain development of physical prowess. The approach is made 
purely from the physical side, and many boys finding that develop- 
ment of muscle does not follow while they indulge in smoking have 
thrown away the cigarette, and in their effort to become stronger in 
body are catching a sense of the purity of spirit which is so essential. 
Both boys and girls are taken on “hikes” Saturday afternoons by 
members of the home and school league, who volunteer their services. 
A group of some half dozen college girls are doing this for four 
schools, and a marked improvement in the health of the schoolgirls 
has been the result. Several of our young university men have done 
the same for the boys’ schools. 
The Boston Home and School Association, through its various 
committees, is undertaking to improve conditions of child life in 
that city by fostering cooperation between the home and school and 
by providing an opportunity for the study of the intellectual, moral, 
and physical development of the children. The association publishes 
the Boston Home and School News-Letter. The last number of 
this periodical (Jan.—Feb., 1913) is a health number, and the fol- 
lowing topics are discussed: The nervous breakdown; the care of the 
body; some observations on the health of working children; health 
and store work. 
The Chicago School Eatension Committee, in addition to its work 
in serving lunches, has established a lecture course in a night school 
for mothers and prospective mothers. A trained nurse, whose salary 
is paid by this committee, is employed to instruct these groups of 
women in the most fundamental matters concerning themselves and 
their babies. This committee is composed of delegates appointed 
from 70 or more women’s clubs in and near Chicago. They were
-P-A-G-E-376
  350 , EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
instrumental in establishing vacation schools, playgrounds, and open- - 
air schools as a part of the regular work of the board of education 
in Chicago. It is their policy to start and test out the value of such 
undertakings and then, if they promise useful service, to induce the 
school authorities to incorporate them into their regular school work. 
SOCIETIES DEVOTED TO THE TEACHING OF MENTAL HYGIENE. 
The National Committee for Mental Hygiene, through its director 
of special studies, Dr. Thomas W. Salmon, says: 
The educational work in which the National Committee for Mental Hygiene 
is now engaged has for its object the dissemination of information regarding 
the prevalence and causes of mental disorders, the means of their prevention, 
and humane methods of treatment. 
When it is realized that at the present time there are over 200,000 insane per- 
sons in institutions (a number exceeding the number. of cases of tuberculosis 
in institutions), it is realized that prevention of these disorders is a matter 
of great importance. It is also true that there is no other matter relating to 
health regarding which so little reliable information is possessed by the public, 
or regarding which there is such wide acceptance of unfounded beliefs. These 
facts make an educational campaign seem absolutely essential in any movement 
for mental hygiene. 
After considering the question very carefully, it was thought that an exhibit 
on mental hygiene would be an especially useful means of beginning such a 
campaign of education. The striking results accomplished by the use of the 
exhibit in popular education regarding tuberculosis led to a very wide use of 
this form of popular education in other health movements. Examples of this 
are the employment of exhibits on health by the Federal Public Health Service 
and local boards of health and of various exhibits by child-labor organizations, 
child-hygiene organizations, and many other bodies which are working for 
social betterment. 
The mental-hygiene exhibit was prepared under the direction of Dr. Stewart. 
Paton, of Princeton, N. J., and many authorities on mental diseases in this 
country gave their time and knowledge very freely in its preparation. It was 
carefully planned, for it was felt that at the beginning of such a new move- 
ment for popular education it was quite essential that no errors should be made 
and that the new and rather complex material to be presented should be shown 
in a logical manner. 
Another feature of the campaign of the educational work which our organiza- 
tion has under way is the publication of pamphlets dealing with certain other 
phases of mental hygiene. 
The ones thus far published are— 
(1) Origin, Objects, and Plans of the National Committee for Mental Hygiene. 
(2) Principles of Mental Hygiene Applied to the Management of Children Pre- 
disposed to Nervousness. By Dr. Lewellyn F. Barker, professor of medi- 
cine, Johns Hopkins University. (Issued March, 1912.)

The State Charities Aid Association of New York, through the 
assistant, secretary, Mr. Everett S. Elwood, summarizes the educa- 
tional undertakings of the committee on mental-hygiene movement 
as follows: 
The mental-hygiene committee began active work for the prevention of in- 
sanity in New York State September 1, 1910. Its plan of work as then an- 
nounced and as carried out during the past two years was— 
1. Inaugurating a State-wide campaign of popular education as to the pre- 
ventable causes of insanity. 
2. Bringing to light individual cases of approaching mental disorder at an 
early stage and helping them to secure such medical attention and social aid 
as will delay or prevent complete mental breakdown. 
The campaign for popular education has been continued in New York State 
for the past two years by the following: (@) Distribution of literature; (0) 
correspondence; (¢) meetings; (d@) exhibits. 
Twenty-four different pieces of literature, besides reports, have been dis- 
tributed. One of these is a small pamphlet entitled ‘‘ Why should anyone go 
insane?” It has been printed to the number of 585,000, and to date 578,000 
copies have been distributed among interested individuals. Numerous press 
bulletins have been issued to New York State papers and to magazines. These 
have carried the essential facts about mental diseases to hundreds of thousands 
of individuals. An article giving a complete statement of the work, the causes 
and extent of insanity, was printed in the May(1910) Review of Reviews, which 
has a circulation. of 225,000. 
The 13,474 physicians in New York State have received letters and literature ; 
over 500 of them have taken active part in the general education of the public. 
Eleven thousand three hundred and seventy professional men, clergymen, 
teachers, social workers, and heads of organizations have been invited to co- 
operate in the educational campaign, and 680 of them have done so. 
Popular knowledge has been advanced also by local campaigns in the principal 
cities of the State of New York, and lectures and meetings before clubs and 
organizations. Forty meetings, with a total attendance of 7,000, have been held, 
besides the recent mental hygiene conference in New York. 
The first mental hygiene conference and exhibit ever held occurred at the 
College of the City of New York, November 8 to 15. It consisted of six evening 
meetings and two afternoon sessions, and daily stereopticon and moving-picture 
lectures. Thirty-three physicians, teachers, and sociologists, many of inter- 
national reputation, addressed the conference. The total attendance at the con- 
ference and exhibit approximated 21,000. The New York press gave a total of 
60 columns of news space to the conference. 
During the coming year the committee plans to do the following: 
(1) Continue the campaign of popular education in New York City and. State by 
lan extensive use of the exhibit, by public meetings and lectures, a wide distribu- 
jon of literature, and press and magazine articles on the extent, causes, and 
revention of insanity. Intensive local campaigns will be held in centers of 
opulation. 
(2) Promote the establishment of additional clinics and psychopathic wards 
nm connection with general hospitals throughout the State. Partial plans have 
een made for an additional mental clinic in Brooklyn, another in Manhattan, 
nd one in the city of Syracuse. . 
(3) Continue the intensive social service work with individual cases. By 
aking complete and accurate records of cases, assist in the study of the 
eredity of insanity.

(4) Organize committees to carry on work in different localities. 
(5) Conduct a careful study of a limited number of abnormal school children, 
considering their environment, heredity, school records, physical make-up, and 
inental maladjustments. 
(6) Promote desirable State and Federal legislation bearing upon the cure 
and prevention of mental diseases. 
(7) Support practical and well-advised measures promoting eugenics. 
HEALTH WORK OF TYPICAL INDUSTRIAL CONCERNS. 
The health teaching of certain industrial establishments is a strik- 
ing development of the past few years. The efforts in this direction 
grew out of the demand for more competent work on the part. of 
employees. It has been found that it pays to conserve the health 
and vigor of women, and to this end wholesome environment is fur- 
nished, the best sanitary equipment is provided for workers, and in 
addition they are taught better care of their health. 
Merely as an advertising scheme, one concern is sending lecturers 
to other cities and communities where they show, by means of lantern 
slides and exhibits, the value of good health, and how it has been 
made the basis of successful manufacturing. They have especially 
emphasized the value of pure, clean air, abundance of sunlight, pure 
water, wholesome food, and regular exercise. It has been found also 
that workers must have recreation and fun in order to reach and 
maintain the maximum efficiency in daily work. 
Some of the life insurance societies of this country are engaged on 
a large scale in attempting to teach their policyholders the value of 
good health and the means of maintaining it. This sort of general 
propaganda on the part of these great insurance companies works 
both ways. It means money to the companies and better health and 
longer lives to the policyholders. 
One company states that its educational work in the field of 
health— 
is designed to stimulate both the individual and the community to adopt simple 
and well-known preventive measures to reduce needless sickness and prematur 
death. 
The primary object is to reach the individual policyholder, of which thi 
society has about 500,000. This is done through an illustrated magazine, whic! 
is carefully designed to attract and hold their attention. Each issue of thi: 
publication contains information and comment upon the various phases 0: 
conservation and a health bulletin which appeals to the individual and deal 
solely with prevention. 
Important lessons are drawn from the general mortality statistics an 
published in popular form. 
Interest in the public health service is stimulated and action encouraged b: 
the distribution of pamphlets, circulars, public addresses, ete. 
The educational campaign includes not only the prevention of communicabl 
diseases, but especial attention is given to the excessive life waste from th 
degenerative diseases of middle life and old age.

An especial effort is made also to induce policyholders and others to adopt 
the practice of periodical health examinations to detect incipient disease, when 
it may be checked or cured. 
The following brief outline of the health work of another company 
will give a slight suggestion of its educational undertakings in the 
field of health: 
At the home office an infirmary is maintained for the benefit of the 
employees, with a physician and a trained nurse attached. A visit- 
ing nurse is employed, whose duty it is to visit the homes of sick 
employees. To the policyholders and the public at large pamphlets 
on health topics are distributed. The following titles will indicate 
the variety of subjects treated: Health Suggestions; Care of Chil- 
dren during Summer; Consumption, Suggestion for its Prevention; 
Fresh Air, Its Importance to Health; Foreign Bodies in the Eye, 
Ear, Nose, and Throat; Flies, a Plague of Plagues. 
In addition to these pamphlets a periodical is published, each 
edition numbering 2,250,000 copies, distributed gratuitously to policy- 
holders and to the general public. Many articles appear in this 
periodical which were written to instruct in all phases of health 
conservation. This company has also taken part, through its exhibits, 
in the general movement for the prevention and cure of tuberculosis. 
The Joint Board of Sanitary Control in the Cloak, Suit, and 
Skirt Industry of Greater New York is an organization made up of 
seven members—two representing the manufacturers, two the unions, 
and three representing the public. This board is empowered to 
establish standards of sanitary conditions to which manufacturers 
and unions shall be committed and shall obligate themselves to main- 
tain to the best of their ability. Naturally, in attempting to set these 
standards, it has been necessary to have a system of inspection to see 
that the standards set are maintained, and this has the effect of 
educating all parties to the agreement to strive for better standards. 
* With reference to the strictly educational work that this board 
of sanitary control is undertaking, the following excerpts from 
published bulletins will give some indication of what is attempted. 
These are published in English, Yiddish, and Italian, and distributed 
to the workers. Bulletin No. 2, published in 1911, gives the follow- 
ing sound and interesting advice: 
Health is the most precious possession of man. Health is the only capital 
of the workingman. Without health, the workingman is of no use to his em- 
ployer. Without health, life to the employee is not worth living. Therefore, 
the preservation of health is the most important consideration of the worker. 
Therefore, join in securing safe and sanitary shops, in order that your life may 
be prolonged and your health be preserved. 
The work place plays a most important influence upon the life and health 
of the worker. In his work place, the worker spends over one-third of his life.
-P-A-G-E-380
354 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
His life and health are influenced by the construction, by safety from fire, 
by the light and illumination, by the air and ventilation, and by the sanitary 
care and cleanliness of the shop. 
Workingmen have a right and duty to demand from their employer safe 
and sanitary shops. 
But the employers have a right to demand from the workingmen themselves 
that they should be clean and should help the employers to keep the shop 
clean. = 
Let the workers prove to their employers that they not only demand sanitary 
and clean shops but appreciate them and will help to keep them clean. 
Demand cleanliness from your employers, from your fellow workers, but 
demand it first of all from yourself. 
It is impossible to give a sufficiently detailed account of this work 
to show its true importance, but it certainly represents a new attitude 
when employer and employee bond themselves together in a volun- 
tary organization of this kind to help preserve life and health. 
A manufacturer of coats, suits, and skirts states that many na- 
tidnalities are represented in the working force, and that at times 
it is very difficult to teach properly health and hygiene. During 
the noon hour in this establishment, motors are disconnected and no 
factory work is done. No one is allowed to eat in the workroom; a 
dining room, properly fitted, is used for luncheons. There is a 
library of 575 books for distribution among the employees; there is 
a piano, and during the noon hour musical entertainments are fre- 
quently given. A graduate nurse is in charge of an emergency room, 
where minor accidents are treated. The company employs welfare 
workers, who visit the homes of the employees and teach them how 
to care for their health. 
ASSOCIATIONS FOR SECURING CLEAN MILK SUPPLY. 
The American Association of Medical Milk Commissions has for 
its purpose— 
to federate and bring into one compact association the medical milk commissions 
of the United States; to exchange views and to adopt uniform methods of pro- 
cedure in the work of the medical milk commissions; to fix chemical and bac- 
teriological standards; to determine the scope of veterinary inspections and 
to foster and to encourage the establishment of medical milk commissions in 
other’ cities. * * * ~ : 
The greatest menace to the pure-milk movement lies in the fact that politi- 
cally controlled boards of health are pretending to guard public health. 
Wherever this condition obtains there would naturally be friction between the 
milk commission, striving honestly and fearlessly to improve local conditions, 
and the board of health on the other hand, which may be protecting special 
interests and individuals. In such instances the organized medical profession 
represented by the commission can so definitely mold public opinion that the 
pure-milk movement in a city may become a campaign issue. 
The work of the Massachusetts Milk Consumers’ Association is 
entirely directed toward securing a clean milk supply for the whole
-P-A-G-E-381
  TYPICAL HEALTH-TEACHING AGENCIES. 355 
State, the first step required being to get proper legislation. To 
secure this result a campaign of education has been carried on among 
legislators, and much more among consumers and producers, by means 
of talks given at meetings of clubs, granges, church organizations, 
settlement houses, schools, etc., also through cartoons, and by the 
dissemination of literature, both through the mails and in the news- 
papers, and by personal visits to many farmers, convincing them of 
the similarity of their interests with those of the consumers. 
The association had an exhibit in Washington at the International 
Congress on Hygiene and Demography held there last September. 
This exhibit, is now traveling with that of the State Board of Health, 
the Boston Board of Health, etc., to all of the larger cities of Massa- 
chusetts. 
The Babies’ Milk Dispensary, of Buffalo, sets forth its purpose in 
the following words: 
Our effort is to start with the mother before confinement and through the 
nurse give what assistance is possible to help her in maintaining or acquiring 
a good physical condition to assume the nourishment of the infant. At the end 
of three or four weeks the mother is asked to bring the infant to the consulta- 
tion every week to have its weight recorded and receive advice in regard to 
nursing, bathing, and general hygiene of the child. Much of the work is 
carried on by class instruction. These classes seem to be more successful by 
making them somewhat of a social affair. 
SPECIAL COMMISSIONS, BUREAUS, ETC., ENGAGED IN HEALTH 
TEACHING. 
The Rockefeller Sanitary Commission for the Eradication of Hook- 
worm Disease is a most significant undertaking both with reference 
to the work accomplished and also with reference to the work yet to 
be done. This commission treated in 11 States 227,916 persons. In 
the three years in which this commission has been at work nearly 
400,000 people have been treated. Each of the Southern States has an 
organization for the purpose of educating the people with reference 
to the cause and prevention of this disease and for treating people 
at dispensaries. The county dispensary commission, organized and 
managed by this commission, is an educational agency of great use- 
fulness, not only with reference to hookworm disease, but to health 
provisions in general. While examining and treating the people it 
teaches them by demonstration. The exhibit shown at these dis- 
pensaries includes a series of charts, photographs, posters, specimens 
of grown hookworm, and other intestinal parasites, and various 
stages of the development of the hookworm embryo. 
The commission undertakes to make effective cooperation with local 
physicians to secure county appropriations, and in this way to extend 
the work. The commission has found, however, that while the disease
-P-A-G-E-382
  
  856 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
can be cured in nearly all cases, unless better sanitary measures are 
taken, especially in country districts, the eradication of the hook- 
worm from the Southern States will never be accomplished. There- 
fore, they have found it necessary to enter upon a campaign for the 
construction of sanitary toilets at country homes, country schools, 
villages, and wherever sanitary sewerage is not provided. In this 
way this commission is not only teaching how to avoid hookworm 
infection, but also the dangers of infection from typhoid and other 
intestinal diseases. To indicate the great value of this movement to 
secure sanitary privies and to prevent soil pollution it will only be 
necessary to say that nearly a half million of bulletins prepared by 
Dr. C. W. Stiles and Dr. L. L. Lumsden have been distributed 
throughout the country. This bulletin is illustrated, and a new type 
of sanitary toilet is explained and details given for its construction. — 
Incidentally the work of this commission has been of tremendous 
service in clearing up many questions and much superstition concern- 
ing health conditions in the South. It is perhaps safe to say that 
no one organization or commission in this country has wielded such 
a wide influence and has brought relief to so many people in the last 
three years as has this commission, and its educational work in mat- 
ters of general health will, in the end, count for even larger service. 
No adequate description of the work of this commission or its edu- 
cational influence can here be given. Its work is so well known and 
has proved itself so effective that extended accounts of it are here 
unnecessary. 
The training school for public service conducted by the Bureau of 
Municipal Research (William H. Allen, director, New York), in coop- 
eration with the Wisconsin State Board of Public Affairs, through 
their field agent, Mr. F. S. Staley, made a thorough and systematic 
examination of conditions and needs of rural schools in Wisconsin. 
Twenty-seven counties, in widely separated portions of the State, 
were selected for general examination, and 131 schools in 18 counties 
were examined in detail. From that part of the report (Part III, 
pp. 26-88) summarizing the conditions which directly or indirectly 
affect health conditions the following quotations are taken: 
No district had the following minimum essentials which every district ought 
to have— 
(1) Windows on one side or on two adjacent sides only, with the major 
light coming over the left shoulders of the pupils. 
(2) Windows properly curtained with both opaque and transulcent shades. 
(8) Windows running practically to the ceiling. 
(4) Narrowest piers possible between windows—not over 15 inches. 
(5) White ceilings. 
(6) Walls tinted a soft light green or gray, restful to the eye and nerves 
and having high reflecting quality.

The biological laboratory of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and 
Sciences is undertaking to train teachers for work in eugenics. They 
offer a course— 
open to a limited number of properly qualified college graduates with biological 
training who wish to prepare themselves for positions as field workers in con- 
nection with institutions for defectives and other work. The course lays par- 
ticular emphasis on modern methods of investigating the inheritance of family 
traits. 
The Health-Education League, under the presidency of Dr. Dud- 
ley A. Sargent, of Boston, the well-known specialist in physical edu- 
cation, is doing a splendid work through its famous booklets on 
health topics. More than a score of these have been issued, each of 
them written by a specialist. In order to indicate something of the 
nature of these booklets, the following titles are selected: Healthful 
homes; The plague of mosquitoes and flies; The efficient worker; 
Sexual hygiene; Habits of health; Typhoid fever; Infection and 
prevention; The observance of health day in schools; Industrial 
hygiene; Hygiene for workers; Hygiene of exercise. 
These booklets are described as the “best examples of expert 
knowledge brought to an edge for popular use.” They cost little 
more than a single copy of a newspaper, and more than a quarter of 
a million have been sold or given away. 
College work in hygiene—In order to illustrate what is being done 
in health teaching in connection with regular college work, the fol- 
lowing brief summary of the work done in the College of the City of 
New York is offered: 
The department of physical instruction and hygiene of the College 
of the City of New York had for the year 1911-12 a staff of 17 pro- 
fessors, tutors, and assistants engaged in carrying out a program 
including the following lines of work: (1) Individual instruction in 
hygiene through a medical examination, hygienic instruction, and 
regular conferences; (2) medical and sanitary supervision of all stu- 
dents with reference to board of health regulations, medical consulta- 
tions, medical examination of athletes, and emergency treatment; 
(8) lectures on hygiene (eight terms); (4) instruction in physical 
exercise (drills with apparatus, swimming, outdoor games, and 
sports) ; (5) general athletic control. 
A good part of this work is prescribed for all students in the 
college. 
NEGRO ORGANIZATIONS FOR HEALTH TEACHING. 
The Negro Organization Society of Virginia is devoting its chief 
energies to teaching the negroes of that State the facts concerning 
the cause and prevention of some of the most common diseases, such 
as tuberculosis and typhoid fever. According to a statement by  
-P-A-G-E-384
358 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
J. M. Gandy, the executive secretary of this association, its special 
work for the year 1913 will consist in “trying to get the colored 
people to ventilate their homes, churches, and schools properly, and 
to build sanitary privies at their homes, churches, and schools.” 
This society has arranged itineraries through the counties for mem- 
bers of the State health department. 
In these counties we have gone from ehureh to church, giving lectures to the 
people. After the lectures we have asked the people this question, “Do you 
believe in what has been said?” In every case the answer has been “ Yes.” 
‘Then we say, ‘‘We want to see how many of you will pledge yourselves to do 
something definite for your health.” Those who answer in the affirmative are 
asked to sign a card with the following pledge printed on it: 
THE NEGRO ORGANIZATION SOCIETY’S HEALTH CREED AND PLEDGE. 
I believe a sound healthy body is the most precious of all earthly possessions, 
the foundation of a strong mental life, the most important element in the 
making of moral character, the first essential to any worthy achievement, and 
the greatest factor in a life of happiness. 
I believe dirt and filth are the copartners of disease and death; cleanliness, 
an abundance of pure fresh air, plenty of sunlight, and the proper disposal 
of the waste from the human body are the greatest safeguards to good health. 
I believe the first duty of man is to provide such conditions at home, at 
school, and at church as will make possible good health. 
I therefore pledge myself to build a sanitary outhouse at my own home or 
make the old one sanitary, so that flies and animals can not get to the filth; 
to provide for an adequate supply of pure fresh air, day and night, winter and 
summer; to keep clean my person, yard, stables, and outhouse; to whitewash 
or paint my dwelling house, barns, and outhouse as often as necessary; to safe- 
guard my water supply against contamination; and to do whatever I can to 
encourage good health in the entire community in which I live.

CHAPTER XII. 
PURPOSES, METHODS, AND RESULTS OF THE PARENT- 
TEACHER COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATIONS OF THE 
NATIONAL CONGRESS OF MOTHERS. 
By Mary Harmon WEEKS. 
FOUNDERS OF THE CONGRESS. 
The National Congress of Mothers and Parent-Teacher Associa- 
tions was organized in 1897 by Mrs. Theodore Weld Birney, a native 
of Georgia, then resident in Washington, D. C. Mrs. Phoebe A. 
Hearst gave the financial support needed for the initial work. The 
first convention was held in the Arlington Hotel, Washington, D. C. 
BASIS OF ORGANIZATION. 
At its first meeting the congress announced its belief that the 
wisdom of experienced and intelligent motherhood, applied to all 
that pertains to childhood, whether in home, school, institution, 
reformatory, or factory, can do more to raise the social and civic 
conditions of our country than any other one thing; that the children 
of the world need the loving protection and consideration of en- 
lightened womanhood; and that organized motherhood stands for 
the same wise, loving thought and care for the children of the world 
that a wise, loving mother gives to her own little ones. 
CONVENTIONS, 
Since 1897 conventions have been held yearly in States where the 
work needs inspiration, and there are now branches in 33 States. 
In each State there are large numbers of associate members, mothers’ 
circles, and parent-teacher associations. In 1908 interest in the 
work had so increased that an international congress was held. Dele- 
gates appointed by many foreign powers were present, and it was 
decided to hold such a meeting every third year in Washington. At 
77236°—xp 1912—vor 1 25 359    
-P-A-G-E-386
  360 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
the international child-welfare convention held in 1911 there were 
representatives from all but four States in the Union. Great Britain 
sent Mrs. Barry Hart, of Edinburgh, to represent the Parents’ Edu- 
cational Union; Belgium appointed Consul General Hegeman; 
Greece sent two men; and China sent a man to say that the mothers 
of China were to be organized. Two men stood for Italy, one of 
them specially delegated to bring a message from the Queen saying 
that the mothers of Italy would be organized. Persia appointed 
Madame Ali Kuli Khan, the wife of the Persian Ambassador, to 
represent it. She-is now congress organizer for Persia. 
PURPOSES OF THE CONGRESS. 
The work of the congress may be briefly summarized as a work 
for child welfare in home, school, church, and state. It aims to 
carry the mother love and mother thought into all that concerns or 
touches childhood; to raise the standards of home life; to develop 
wiser, better-trained parenthood; to bring into closer relation the 
home and the school, that parent and teacher may cooperate intelli- 
gently in the education of the child; to promote the establishment of 
kindergartens and of laws which will adequately care for neglected 
and dependent children; to secure such legislation as will insure that 
children of tender years may not be tried in ordinary courts, but 
that each town shall establish a juvenile court and employ special 
officers, whose duty it shall be to so care for the child that he shall 
be rescued from, rather than confirmed in, evil ways; to work for 
such probationary care in individual homes rather than institutions; 
to give young people, ignorant of the proper care and training of 
children, opportunities to learn that which will enable them to 
better perform the duties of parenthood; to promote high ideals of 
marriage and the maintenance of its sacredness and permanence; to 
interest men and women to cooperate in the work for purer, truer 
homes, in the belief that to accomplish the best results men and 
women must work together; to rouse the whole country to a sense 
of its duty and responsibility to childhood; to surround the childhood 
of the whole world with that loving wise care in the impressionable 
years of life that will develop good citizens, and not lawbreakers and 
criminals. 
DEPARTMENTS. 
It does this work through 17 departments, many of which are 
merely media of cooperation with other national organizations; for 
instance, the departments of child labor and for the prevention of 
infant mortality. Others are extension departments. One organizes 
parents’ and teachers’ cooperative societies. The United States De- 
 
-P-A-G-E-387
PARENT-TEACHER COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATIONS, 361 
partment of Agriculture and the Bureau of Education have aided 
this department in many ways, and some of their bulletins are dis- 
tributed through the national office of the congress in Washington. 
DEPARTMENT OF PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATIONS, 
The strongest, most active, most far-reaching department of the 
congress is that of the parent-teacher work, through which it hopes 
to retain in the home its full share of child nurture. Unfortunately 
there has been of late too strong a tendency to thrust much of this 
upon the overburdened schools. 
The congress believes that through parent-teacher meetings the 
true division of labor between home and school may be determined; 
through discussions of the problems of parents and teachers the 
home may be educated to the necessity of assuming and performing 
its share. The public may thus be brought to understand that it 
also has a duty to home and child, which will best be performed not 
by makeshift playgrounds, makeshift meeting places, makeshift 
methods of preventing infant mortality, but by making every dwell- 
ing a true home. 
DEPARTMENT OF GOOD ROADS FOR COUNTRY-CHILD WELFARE. 
The congress recognizes an additional problem in the rural dis- 
tricts, and has created a department of good roads for rural-child 
welfare. This department organizes “ road-cadet companies ” among 
country schoolboys, and teaches them how to make and care for the 
roads leading to the schoolhouse. At the suggestion of the congress 
a primer on road building for use in rural schools has been com- 
piled by Mr. Samuel Ravenel, of Booneville, Mo. Girls are organ- 
ized into “ pick-and-shovel clubs.” They are instructed in sewing 
and cooking, in different kinds of profitable gardening, including 
tomato growing and mushroom culture, and in marketing the prod- 
uct. They also work for the improvement of:their country schools. 
Good roads make it possible for both children and parents to come 
to the school. Entertainment is provided for all; the boys and 
girls do regular and helpful work for the community, and a spirit 
of cooperation between home and school is established. 
DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE COURTS. 
The department of juvenile courts and probation, whose chairman 
is Judge Ben. B. Lindsey, has done important work in spreading 
information concerning juvenile courts and in securing legislation 
for them. The passage of the juvenile court law of Pennsylvania 
was due largely to the efforts of Mrs. Frederic Schoff, president 
of the congress. She has spoken on this subject in almost every  
-P-A-G-E-388
362 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
State in the Union; her papers on the juvenile court were asked for 
by officials of the Governments of Austria, England, and Australia; 
and she is the only woman who has ever been invited to address the 
Canadian Parliament, her topic being the aims, needs, and methods 
of the children’s court. 
THE DIFFERING FORCES OF HOME AND SCHOOL. 
The school can do for the children may things that the home used 
to do, and it can certainly do them better. There are other things 
that must be done by the home, or they will not be done at 
all. Parents and teachers must. have a common purpose, a spirit 
of intelligent cooperation, in order that home and school may each 
perform its best service to the child. Together must they work to 
give each child the sympathetic, intelligent care which will develop 
body, mind, and heart. 
THE PURPOSE OF THE PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATION. 
The National Congress of Mothers believes that parent-teacher 
circles, carried on in connection with the schools, offer the best oppor- 
tunity for acquaintance and true cooperation between parents and 
teachers. In the sympathetic atmosphere of the parent-teacher 
circle the parents learn, perhaps, how they are hindering the school 
work of their own children and of the school at large; learn that 
they and their children can not live for themselves alone, if they 
wish to live in the best way. The mother who is not yet beyond the 
stage of fighting for her children, whether right or wrong, learns 
as she listens to the discussions that her child can not have his rights 
unless he is willing to allow equal rights to others; that the give- 
and-take of the school community is the best kind of discipline. She 
learns that only by conformity to the school rules can her boy take 
his rightful place. The heedless parents learn that tardiness and 
absence are not small matters concerning their daughters alone, but 
hindrances to the school, by which their children suffer equally with 
the rest. Self-centered parents learn that some kinds of home helps 
are obstacles to school advancement. 
On the other hand, the teacher, sometimes dwelling too much on 
system and curriculum, finds her sympathies refreshed by coming 
into contact with the home relations of the children. She realizes 
more vividly the conditions under which they must work at home, 
makes fairer allowances for shortcomings, and is often able to sug- 
gest changes that are helpful to her charges. Even untrained 
mothers can give common-sense advice, and the contact of such a 
mother with the trained mind of the teacher is of incalculable value 
to the home.
-P-A-G-E-389
  PARENT-TEACHER COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATIONS. 363 
EFFECTS ON CHILDREN. 
That children thrive under the new sympathetic relation of home 
and school induced by these meetings is shown by the fact that they 
often urge their mothers and fathers to attend. Doubtless we never 
fully realize how alien a place school is to the little ones, and how 
helpful it is to see mother and father there and a part of it. One 
mother said that before the school had parents’ meetings her chil- 
dren never wanted her to come to the school, because she was poorly 
dressed, but that now, seeing her a part of the meeting and probably 
feeling a newly sympathetic attitude on the part of the teachers 
and a more intelligent understanding of school on the part of the 
mother, they urged her to come, clothes or no clothes, and really 
seemed to have more respect for her opinions. 
A large and successful parents’ association in Philadelphia secured 
$25,000 from the city councils to enlarge and improve the school 
buildings. A touching testimonial as to the benefit of the meetings 
of that association was given by one of the mothers who attended 
them. She had 5 children and did her own work. She said her 
little 12-year-old girl was trying to get new members for the club, 
urging all the teachers who did not attend to promise to do so. 
“Why does your little girl care so much?” was asked. “ What dif- 
ference does it make to her?” “She sees the difference in me,” the 
mother replied. “I am so much more patient, and I see so much 
more in home work than just the drudgery of it.” The subjects 
studied opened to this mother a world of new thought, a realization 
of the children’s point of view and a sympathy which they felt. 
MATERIAL RESULTS. 
The most important results of parent-teacher meetings are spiritual 
and can not be fully stated, but many material benefits also have 
accrued to the schools: Systems of ventilation, libraries, apparatus 
of various kinds, better school recreations, school lunchrooms, sanitary 
drinking fountains, abatement of insanitary conditions, clothes for 
indigent children, kindergartens, new school buildings, consolidation 
of rural schools, county graduations, social centers in schoolhouses, 
etc. All are important adjuncts of the school, but chiefly valuable 
as itdicating a better atmosphere for child development. 
Hon. Elmer Ellsworth Brown, late United States Commissioner 
of Education, said, in speaking of losses in school attendance: 
All manner of moral influences and cooperation must be added to all manner 
of legal and administrative compulsion to bring about the desired uplift in 
the matter of continued attendance at school. Pass on the word to parent- 
teacher associations that such combinations of favorable influences have even 
now accomplished notable improvements which have been seen, measured, and 
recorded. 
 
-P-A-G-E-390
  864 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
THE PRINCIPAL’S POINT OF VIEW. 
School principals find the parent-teacher circle an excellent means 
of reaching all parents effectively when some general condition 
needs changing, when public sentiment in the district needs rousing, 
or when they wish to make certain courses effective which do not 
seem to take hold. A principal may know of environments which 
are dangerously affecting certain pupils and, through them, the whole 
school. He may wish to suggest needs of the school. He can talk 
with a hundred parents as well as with one. 
Principals testify that pupils are more easily managed as a result 
of such meetings. They also find appreciation in quarters where 
they had not expected it, and disarm opposition which had long hin- 
dered their efforts. One principal said: 
When first spoken to about parent-teacher meetings I could not imagine what 
the people would talk about, for if they talked as they usually do when they 
visit me I thought they would soon come to blows of the tongue at least. Now 
we understand the home in its relation to the school much better, and the 
parents seem to understand what we are trying to do. 
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
County superintendents find the school and home organizations a 
valuable adjunct in unifying work and in creating sentiment for 
good roads between home and school, for better housing and sanitary 
conditions, for consolidation, and for all the crying needs of rural 
schools. 
INITIAL WORK FOR ORGANIZATION. 
Parents who wish to form school associations have usually to win 
over the principal. Naturally, he wishes to know what good the 
parent-teacher association will do his school, how much time it will 
take, how much work on his part and on that of his assistants will 
be required, and whether the movement has originated in a critical 
or a helpful spirit. If these things are made clear to him he will 
probably favor the meetings, and usually the organization had best 
be deferred till he wishes it. An antagonistic spirit can defeat all 
the purposes of the association. He may ask for specific cases of 
organization work, that he may write for first-hand information. A 
few such instances are here cited; they could be duplicated in every 
organized State: 
In Irondale, Mo., money was raised by a box supper, followed by a 
school program. The money was used in painting and lighting the 
interior of the schoolhouse. The Milan Mothers’ Circles held a re- 
ception at which a petition for the enactment of a curfew law was 
signed. A successful town clean-up, which is to be annual, was in-

augurated by the Stanberry Mothers’ Union; an agitation for the 
enforcement of the curfew law was carried on; improvements in 
sanitary conditions and in discipline were accomplished through the 
school board; at the request of the mayor $500 was raised for a sane 
Fourth of July. In Massachusetts the East Gloucester Parent- 
Teacher Association distributed 566 packages of flower and vegetable 
seeds and awarded 36eprizes for results, installed emergency cabinets 
in every school, and carried on a demonstration by a trained nurse on 
the treatment of wounds and first aid to the injured. In Auburn, 
N. Y., the Fulton School Circle furnished a rest room for the 
teachers. The Dover (Del.) Parent-Teacher Association has brought 
about the establishment of several playgrounds fitted up in school 
yards and other parts of the town, bubble fountains in the schools, 
- and public fountains elsewhere. The Parent-Teacher Circle of 
Washoe, Idaho, organized a girls’ sewing class, and the Fruitland 
circle bought a sewing machine and a basket-ball outfit for its school. 
The Rutland (Vt.) association raised $800 for the teachers’ pension 
fund. The circles in Austin, Tex., are working for the physical 
examination of pupils, simpler dressing of school children, domestic 
science and simple manual training in the grades, and supervision on 
playgrounds. The Maryville Union, of Missouri, was organized 
in a private house and its members feared that they could not 
get the cooperation of principal and teachers. In a short time a 
meeting was held in the high school at which 500 were present, 
the school made a fine display of manual work, and the three 
addresses were printed in full in the newspaper. The circle has in- 
stalled an emergency rest room in the schoolhouse and is working 
for medical inspection. The Harrison School Mothers’ Club, of 
Wheaton, Mo., has raised several thousand dollars to promote the 
improvement of roads to the school, has organized a fathers’ asso- 
ciation to help execute the plans, has raised funds to put a fireless 
cooker in the building to be used in furnishing hot penny lunches to 
the country children, has framed pictures, and raised money by a 
bazaar for a stereopticon for the consolidated school. It has voted 
to aid the girls’ culture club in raising mushrooms for sale. 
WORKING UP INTEREST. 
A good plan for working up interest, after the principal desires 
a parent-teacher association, is to talk the plan over with a few of 
the more active patrons of the school, and having enlisted their in- 
terest to set them each to work on another circle of patrons whom 
it may be possible to arouse. In doing this each is asked if there 
is not some one thing about the school work which she would like
-P-A-G-E-392
  366 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
to know, something that should be discussed for her own informa- 
tion. By this means a list of topics vital to that school’s welfare 
will be secured. The teachers will, of course, find many subjects 
whose discussion would facilitate their daily round—questions of 
the effects on school work of improper or ill-prepared food, bad 
sleeping and study conditions, wrong amusements, and physical and 
moral defects. . 
Personal visitations are among the most efficient means of keeping 
up interest and attendance after organization. There should always 
be a committee of patrons to receive and talk with the members when 
they come to the meetings and another to visit them when they per- 
sistently stay away. 
PARENTS MUST DO THE WORK. 
Parents are advised not to ask the teachers to take all the offices 
or to do all the work. Teachers are told: 
Keep the parents interested by allowing them to do the work. You have 
each 60 children; they perhaps have only 3 and some are not even so far 
blest. Through the parents you can suggest to the meetings many things which 
you hesitate to present for yourselves. 
The first essential of true success in parents’ clubs is that they 
should be animated by a spirit of democracy. Since the rights and 
interests of all parents are equal in the school, so all should be equally 
welcomed into the parent-teacher club and given a share in its ac- 
tivities. Officers and committees should be changed from year to 
year, it being the recognized duty of every officer, under the advice 
of the principal, to see that there is a suitable successor ready to take 
his place. 
CALLING THE MEETINGS. 
Getting the parents together involves little extra labor for anyone. 
The invitation for each meeting, reduced to its simplest and most 
telling form, is made the writing lesson for the whole school, the 
higher forms making extra copies for the little ones who can not use 
the pen. These invitations are carried home as specimens of the 
children’s improvement, and as such are always read. 
INDUCEMENTS TO ATTEND. 
Topics must be named attractively. Parents who most need. the 
metings are caught in this way, and also by personal solicitations 
from teachers and other parents to come and help. If a certain 
group of mothers that most need the meetings do not come, there 
may be some introductory music or recitation in which their chil-
-P-A-G-E-393
  PARENT-TEACHER COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATIONS. 367 
dren take part, and these mothers must not go away without feeling 
that something is to be gained from the circle. Each one must be 
personally met and something kind said about the children. It will 
help teachers to believe in the worst child; he most needs it. 
In some schools, parents are interested by tea and wafers, which 
make the meeting seem like a reception. Indifferent parents are 
asked to serve. Children are interested by hanging the best school 
picture in the room that furnishes the largest attendance of mothers 
from month to month. Sometimes a baby show brings out the 
mothers, and gives lessons inthe care of children. 
Do these things seem trivial or undignified? Do they seem to be 
unsystematic and out of harmony with the purposes of education ? 
System is not an end but a means. We are working not for education 
alone, but for child welfare, which is much larger than education. 
The school must get into closer touch with the home. To accom- 
plish this, parents must be brought into sympathy and cooperation 
with the school. Without this, “we are trimming one side of our 
hedge quite in ignorance of the plan of the one who is trimming 
the other. The care of stock would never be intrusted to two parties 
without a common plan.” If through the parent-teacher meeting, 
the teacher gains a “ common plan,” he gains that which doubles the 
efficiency of his own work. 
SUGGESTED RULES. 
Very little red tape is needed in the way of constitution and by: 
laws. The following is quite full enough: 
Articte I, Object and membership: The dbject of this organization shall be 
to bring the school and the home closer together, and thus work for the best 
good of the children. Anyone interested in the welfare of children may be- 
come an active member. 
Art. II. Name and meetings: This organization shall be called the — 
of the ——-——— School, and shall meet 
Art. III. This organization shall join the Rental Congress of Mothers.

each year. 
Art. IV. Officers: 
Section 1. The officers of this organization shall be a president, 5 vice 
presidents, a secretary, and a treasurer. 
Arr. V. Committees: 
Srcrion 1. There shall be standing committees on reception, mutual help, 
membership, and press. 
Src. 2. The president shall be ex officio a member of all standing committees. 
Src, 3. The officers and the chairmen of standing committees-shall con- 
stitute the executive committee. Members of the committees of the State

-P-A-G-E-394
368 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
Src. 4. The executive committee shall transact the business of the organiza-

How to Organize, furnished for 4 cents by the National Con- 
gress of Mothers, 806 Washington Loan & Trust Building, Wash- 
ington, D. C., gives advice as to methods of procedure and topics for 
discussion. Too much dwelling on parliamentary form in such gath- 
erings is paralyzing to the mothers. 
FREQUENCY OF MEETINGS. 
Once a month has been found to be often enough to come together, 
and all can be done in an hour. Friday is usually the best day, 
and from 3 to 4 the best time for towns, and from 2.30 to 3.30 for 
the country. The set talk is usually not over 15 or 20 minutes long. 
The rest of the time is devoted to questions and discussion, thus 
giving all an opportunity to take part and become more interested. 
Some one is appointed to be ready to start the questions and discus- 
sion informally. In this way the parents learn how to take part. 
Having taken the simplest action in meeting, they feel more closely 
identified with the work. 
SUBJECTS FOR DISCUSSION. 
Abstruse subjects should not be chosen, nor should technical talks 
be allowed. Both are deadening in the public-school meeting. Doc- 
tors, nurses, ministers, and public officials (with the technical and 
time restriction) should be asked to participate. Teachers and 
parents do not have much time for writing papers. Collections of 
telling, vital articles from books, periodicals, and daily papers are 
appropriate. The 125 papers prepared for this purpose by the Na- 
tional Congress of Mothers and the less technical bulletins of the 
United States and of State agricultural and educational departments 
which bear on the home and school are also serviceable. The idea 
that everything must be original is discarded. It is the discussion 
that counts, and no time is wasted writing such articles, when they 
have already been prepared by experts. 
Experience has shown that in most schools the first meetings are 
profitably spent in discussions of the simple basic problems of child 
nurture—food, clothing, sleep, habits, home study, diseases, care of
-P-A-G-E-395
PARENT-TEACHER COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATIONS. 869 
teeth, eyes, and ears. Talks on such subjects foster the feeling of inti- 
mate relation between home and school and serve to create a com- 
radeship between the two that may later lead to radical reforms, 
whose proposal, in the beginning, might arouse antagonism. All the 
early reforms discussed should be of a kind generally recognized as 
the business of parents. Those which relate especially to teachers 
and school boards had best wait on these. 
SUGGESTED PROGRAMS, 
The general tendency in selecting programs is to choose subjects 
which, while valuable in themselves, are too general to meet the 
want of the majority. As many teachers, while feeling a need for 
better cooperation between home and school, have not formulated 
the actual deficiencies, and as a large number of parents are equally 
blind to the nearness of the needs, the following simple programs 
for 9 meetings are suggested as calculated to create an immediate 
interest in the work of the parent-teacher meeting.

EVENING MEETINGS FOR FATHERS. 
Evening meetings are held occasionally to which add the fathers 
can come. If the school is in a rural district, a father and a mother
-P-A-G-E-397
  PARENT-TEACHER COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATIONS. 371 
may talk on the connection between good roads and good school 
work, and the discussion can be on how to get both. If the meeting 
is in-a town a good topic would be the relation to school work of the 
public amusements which the fathers, as voters, allow. 
AN INSPIRATION, 
The associations usually find it advantageous to work with the 
Congress of Mothers. Membership is an inspiration and brings 
much literature and many privileges. It keeps parents and teachers 
in touch with the thought of the best and most experienced men and 
women. Study courses and books for parents and for children are 
recommended by the organization, and there is a pleasure and inspi- 
ration in being a part of a great onward movement rapidly extend- 
ing to all civilized countries. The National Congress of Mothers’ 
Child Welfare Magazine keeps members in touch with all that is 
done and shows the paths to wider helpfulness. Each number also 
contains at least one article suitable for use in meetings. The reports 
of the congress contain many useful papers on the various phases of 
child training in home, school, and church. A number of clubs have 
formed several years’ programs from this material. 4 
WHAT PROMINENT EDUCATORS THINK OF THE MOVEMENT. 
William M. Slaton, superintendent of schools, Atlanta, Ga.: 
To accomplish the maximum good, the National Mothers’ Congress is vigor- 
ously stressing the wisdom of forming parent-teacher associations in city, town, 
and country throughout the United States. The movement is the product of 
logical thought, patriotic interest, and altruistic motive. The foundation of 
this movement is so broad, deep, and safe as to challenge the cooperation of 
intelligent men and women. It is to the honor of the mothers of the United 
States that the vital connection between home and school has been placed in 
the limelight and is commanding the vigorous support of the press and of 
women in every progressive community. Once the mind appreciates the con- 
nection between childhood interest and civilization, parent-teacher organiza- 
tions are inevitable. Every intelligent person knows that the child’s vital 
interests are fixed for life before 10 years of age and that the work of the 
school only supplements the teachings of the home; hence a necessity for organ- 
izing a close connection between the home and the school. 
In the last analysis public opinion controls things, and the parent-teacher 
organization will form public opinion. Then our curriculum can be broadened 
to meet the demands of common sense and progress. Teaching talent will. be 
appreciated and decent salaries will be paid. It will be easier to get good teach- 
ers and easier to displace worthless ones. Then it will be possible to secure a 
thorough equipment for grammar schools and high schools, and the school can 
realize for society the purposes and dreams of its founders. 
When parent-teacher organizations exist in every school district, and men 
and women regularly attend their meetings, public opinion will place in office 
men of broad views who will be quick to act for social welfare because anxious 
to execute the bidding of their constituents. We can not expect the highest
-P-A-G-E-398
  372 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
good in municipal or State government until public opinion demands it, and 
public opinion must be created, and the parent-teacher organization is the 
power to form the right kind of public opinion. If the parent-teacher organi- 
zation is to be dominated by factional politics, fanatics, and faddists, the school 
will be better off without them, but if the purpose is to unite the best thought 
and character of the parent and of the teacher inconceivable and universal 
good must result for society. I hope that every father and mother and patron 
will join the parent-teacher organization for some school district in Atlanta 
and will take part in its meetings, guided by the motive of love for the com- 
munity at large. 
William H. Elson, superintendent of schools, Cleveland, Ohio: 
I regard parent-teacher associations as the most hopeful and helpful of organi- 
zations cooperating with school officials for the betterment of conditions for 
children. Real mothers, with real interest in real children, not only know but 
can be relied on to do what is best for children. They are concerned for the 
welfare of children, all children, not merely a select few. Every mother should 
become a member of a mothers’ circle. 
David Snedden, State commissioner of education for Massachusetts: 
I have followed with interest for some years the work of the Congress of 
Mothers and Parent-Teacher Associations in the Nation and in two of the States. 
It seems to me that the congress is proving itself most helpful in its relations 
to the public schools, and I wish to heartily commend its activities to all who 
may be interested. 
State Board of Education of California, by its secretary, Edward 
Hyatt, superintendent of public instruction: 
The State board of education hereby expresses its commendation of your work 
as exemplified through the parent-teacher associations, child study circles, and 
other organizations constituting the State Congress of Mothers, which are now 
actively engaged in their work in so many of the cities of the State. 
The voluntary action of parents and teachers in organizing for the purpose of 
bringing school and home into closer relation can not but be helpful to both, and 
the results of such harmonious cooperation will certainly result in good for the 
children of the schools and homes thus brought together. We recommend your 
work to schools which have not yet organized in this way and hope that it may 
be extended throughout the State. 
M. V. O’Shea, University of Wisconsin: 
Personally, I feel that the National Congress of Mothers has accomplished 
more than any other national or international society for the betterment of the 
conditions of child life. As an organization, it is entitled primarily to chief 
recognition in any proceedings relating to the welfare of child life. It has done 
more in America than has been done throughout the rest of the world thus far. 
It has developed independently of aid from the outside. The influence of the 
Mothers’ Congress has been of immense importance throughout this country. 
The Mothers’ Congress has made a good start and is the natural center around 
which other organizations should be formed. 
A school principal in Oklahoma: 
In my school of 22 rooms, whose patrons are working people, I find that at 
the end of two years the work of discipline has been cut in half since the parents 
began to come to the school and understand matters.
-P-A-G-E-399
  PARENT-TEACHER COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATIONS. 373 
Superintendent of schools, Providence, R. I.: 
I shall not be satisfied till we have parents’ meetings in connection with every 
school. 
Ella Flagg Young, superintendent of schools, Chicago, IIL: 
Observation of the spirit pervading the meetings of parents’ clubs leads me to 
believe that in those clubs js the cornerstone for that structure which will make 
the life of the child in the home and in the school a unity, not a life divided 
between two neutral if not hostile camps. 
THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IN THE CONGRESS. 
Under the active leadership of Dr. M. V. O’Shea this department 
is furnishing to each number of the Child Welfare Magazine one 
article suitable for use in parent-teacher meetings and in mothers’ 
circles. They are all prepared by experts and are the beginning of 
a larger work which the congress expects to develop for this depart- 
ment. In course of time there will be a corps of lecturers, with head- 
quarters at the national office in Washington. These experts will be 
sent to the various congress circles to deliver courses on the care and 
training of children. So strongly does this plan appeal to students 
of child welfare that many are already offering to give a part of their 
time to the service. 
When, through some large benefaction, the congress is able to 
realize this vision, its parent-teacher associations will become a great 
parents’ university, with unlimited powers for good in the child 
world. 
THE TWENTIETH CENTURY CHILD. 
What we do for adults is usually mere amelioration of the effects of 
wrong conditions. That which we do for the children is done for 
future generations. The twentieth century has heard the crying of 
the children and is arming itself for a new sort of battle—a battle 
against the ignorance, conceit, and inertia of parents in home, school, 
church, and state; and its victory will mean a new environment, a 
new development, a larger life for every child.

CHAPTER XIII. 
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE NATIONAL 
EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. 
Ann Arsor, Micu., August 31, 1912. 
Sm: Complying with the provisions of section 4 of the act of 
incorporation of the National Education Association by Congress, 
approved June 30, 1906, the following is submitted as an annual 
report: 
An office is maintained in the city of Washington at 662 E Street 
NE., in accordance with section 8 of the act of incorporation, but 
the association owns no property, real or personal, in the city of 
Washington. 
The personal property of the association is largely in the form 
of volumes of proceedings, pamphlets, reprints, and office furniture, 
worth about $12,000, all of which is in the custody of the secretary © 
in Ann Arbor, Mich., where the business of the association is 
transacted. 
The association has a permanent invested fund, referred to in 
section 7 of the act of incorporation, which is in charge of the board 
of trustees. This fund at the close of the fiscal year June 30, 1912, 
amounted to $190,000, $10,000 having been added during the fiscal 
ear. 
: The net revenue from this fund amounted to $7,096.80, which was 
transferred to the treasury of the association for current expenses. 
During the fiscal year ended July 1, 1912, the total receipts from 
all sources, including balance at the beginning, were $51,636.01; 
the total expenses were $36,253.28; the amount transferred to the 
permanent fund was $10,000; the balance in the treasury June 30, 
1912, was $5,382.73. 
The chief sources of revenue are membership fees, proceeds of sale 
of volumes and reports, and income from the invested fund. 
The chief items of expense are the printing and distribution of the 
annual volumes, the maintenance of the secretary’s office, and the 
expense of preparing for and conducting the annual convention.

376 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
The usual appropriations for educational investigations were made 
at the time of the convention, which was held in Chicago, Il., 
July 6-12. 
The total registration at the Chicago convention was 11,286, only 
194 less than at San Francisco last year. 
The general sessions and the sessions of the department were well 
attended, and the programs presented were of the usual standard of 
excellence. 
The following general officers were elected for the ensuing year: 
President, Edward T. Fairchild, of Topeka, Kans.; vice president, 
Carroll G. Pearse, of Milwaukee, Wis.; treasurer, Grace M. Shepherd, 
of Boise, Idaho. 
The executive committee for the ensuing year will be constituted 
as follows: President, Edward T. Fairchild, State superintendent 
of public instruction, Topeka, Kans.; first vice president, Carroll G. 
Pearse, superintendent of schools, Milwaukee, Wis.; treasurer, Grace 
M. Shepherd, State superintendent of public instruction, Boise, — 
Idaho; chairman of trustees, James M. Greenwood, superintendent 
of schools, Kansas City, Mo.; member by election, George B. Cook, 
State superintendent of public instruction, Little Rock, Ark. 
The board of trustees. for the ensuing year will be as follows: 
Chairman, James M. Greenwood, superintendent of schools, Kansas 
City, Mo.; secretary, Robert J. Aley, president of the University of 
Maine, Orono, Me.; J. Stanley Brown, principal of Township High 
School, Joliet, Ill.; James Y. Joyner, State superintendent of public 
instruction, Raleigh, N. C.; Edward T. Fairchild, State superin- 
tendent of public instruction, Topeka, Kans. 
Dr. Irwin Shepard, who has been secretary of the association for 
the past 193 years, tendered his resignation to the board of trustees 
at the Chicago meeting. The following is an outline of his con- 
nection with the association: 
Dr. Shepard was first elected secretary of the National Education 
Association in 1893, while president of the Winona’ State Normal 
School. He was reelected annually until 1898, when he declined 
another term because of the heavy burden of carrying both offices. 
The association accordingly at that meeting, held in Washington, 
D. C., amended the constitution and created the permanent office of 
general executive secretary, with a generous salary and provisions 
for election by the board of trustees for a term of four years. He 
was then tendered the newly created office and accepted, resigning 
his position as president of the Winona Normal School. 
During Dr. Shepard’s term of office the National Education Asso- 
ciation has become the largest and most useful educational association 
in the world. Its permanent active membership includes many of 
 
-P-A-G-E-403
  
NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. 877 
the leading teachers of every State in the Union and in 21 foreign 
countries. 
In 1886 the association established a eat fund from the 
annual savings from the revenue, to be invested as a safety fund 
whose interest revenue only could be used for current expenses. 
During the 12 years previous to 1898 this fund had increased to 
$64,000, or nearly $6,000 per year. Since 1898, during the term of 
Secretary Shepard as general and financial secretary, this permanent 
fund has been increased from the savings and the economical ad- 
ministration of the secretary’s office from $64,000 to $190,000—an 
average annual increase of $9,000. 
The following quotation from an historical address, at the fiftieth 
anniversary convention, held in Chicago, by Dr. James M. Green- 
wood, who is chairman of the trustees of the association, and who 
was president of the association at the Washington convention when 
the constitution was amended to create the office in 1898, of which up 
to this time Secretary Shepard has been the only incumbent, is very 
appropriate, 
Dr. Greenwood, in closing his address, said: 
When I pass in mental review the illustrious names in scholarship, culture, 
and other higher qualities—those who have added grace and dignity to this 
great movement—I can not refrain from mentioning the name of the one who 
has since 1893 been the great organizing power in this corporation—I mean 
Dr. Irwin Shepard, one of the most remarkable men among a galaxy of notable 
men and women of this country. To his clear-sightedness, keen business 
sagacity, tact, and skill in conducting and handling the railroad and other 
transportation interests, mastery of details and the organization of the edu- 
cators in each State into a compact body of progressive men and women, the 
marvelous success of the association is due. The historian of the association 
will do full justice to him whose brain has planned and whose hand hag exe- 
cuted the great work committed to his care for the past 20 years.

GIFTS AND BEQUESTS TO AMERICAN LIBRARIES, 1912. 
The donations of Mr. Carnegie and the Carnegie Corporation 
combined in 1912 were about $90,000 less than Mr. Carnegie’s dona- 
tions in 1911, the total amount for the past year being $2,236,953. 
Cash donations from other donors totaled over three times the amount 
of 1911: $3,265,825.21 in 1912 as against $1,038,452.69 in 1911. The 
total number of volumes given to libraries was nearly twice as large 
as in 1911, and sites for library buildings were more than twice as 
numerous. The most conspicuous gifts of the year were the gift of 
Mrs. George D. Widener, of Philadelphia, to Harvard University, of 
a library building to cost approximately $1,000,000 as a memorial to 
her son, Harry E. Widener, who was lost in the Titanic disaster; 
$750,000 to the city of St. Paul, from James J. Hill; $200,000 to 
Trinity College, Hartford, Conn., from J. Pierpont Morgan; $250,000 
to Manchester, N. H., from Frank P. Carpenter; the Avery Building, 
costing $500,000, given to Columbia University by S. J. Avery, and 
$750,000 from. Mr. Carnegie to San Francisco for a public library and 
branches. By a recent vote the people of the last-named city 
accepted this donation.

LIBRARY BUILDINGS. 
Conspicuous among the notable structures completed during the 
past year is the New York State Education Building, at Albany, 
housing the State Library, whose destroyed collections have been so 
energetically replaced that the number of volumes already approxi- 
mates the original figures. Representative librarians from various 
parts of the country participated at the opening of the new central 
building of the St. Louis Public Library. A new library building at 
Springfield, Mass., was also opened. The Harper Memorial Library 
of the University of Chicago, and the new library building of the 
University of California were formally dedicated; Kenyon College 
dedicated a new alumni library; and the Avery Architectural Library 
was added to the group of library buildings at Columbia University. 
Much progress toward new buildings elsewhere was made during the 
year. Ground was broken for the new central library in Brooklyn, 
and the John Crerar Library at Chicago acquired a new site. Cleve- 
land has obtained an issue of $2,000,000 in municipal bonds for a 
central library; St. Paul is to have a large library building as the 
gift of J. J. Hill; and Indianapolis has received ground for a new 
central building from James Whitcomb Riley. Philadelphia is mak- 
ing plans for a central library, hitherto lacking in its system. Building 
plans are under consideration at Detroit also, and San Francisco is 
developing its central library scheme in relation to the proposed civic 
center. The new Widener Memorial Library is under construction 
at Harvard University, and Trinity College, Hartford, Conn., is 
assured a new library through the gift of J. P. Morgan. 
LARGEST AMERICAN LIBRARIES. 
The number of volumes and pamphlets contained in the Library of 
Congress and in the 5 largest city libraries of the United States in 
1912 was as follows: Library of Congress, 2,012,393; New York 
Public Library, 1,181,392 in central building, 908,828 in branches; 
Boston Public Library, 1,006,717; Brooklyn Public Library, 735,848; 
Chicago Public Library, 501,399; Cleveland Public Library, 444,907. 
The largest university book collections were the Harvard University 
library, with 972,574 volumes and 592,434 pamphlets, and the libra- 
ries of Yale University, Columbia University, and the University of 
Chicago, containing, respectively, 900,000, 500,000, and 381,351 vol- 
umes. ‘These figures show a marked increase over the preceding year 
in the contents of all the libraries mentioned. 
INSTRUCTION IN USE OF BOOKS AND LIBRARIES IN COLLEGES AND 
UNIVERSITIES. 
An increasing number of the leading colleges and universities in the 
United States are furnishing instruction of some nature in the use of
-P-A-G-E-407
  
RECENT ASPECTS OF LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT. 381 
books and libraries. In October, 1912, the American Library Associa- 
tion sent a questionnaire on this subject to 200 colleges and universi- 
ties. Replies were received from 149. There is a wide variation in 
the amount of instruction given and in the methods of presenting it. 
Of the 149 answers, 64 reported no instruction whatever in how to 
use the library, reference books, indexes, catalogue, shelf arrange- 
ment, etc. For the most part these comprise the smaller institu- 
tions, but some of the State universities and larger colleges furnish 
no work along these lines to help their students in familiarizing them- 
selves with the resources of the library. Of the number which report 
no courses in the use of the library, 6 are planning courses to be given 
in the near future. Others report instruction in special cases to indi- 
vidual students and particular applicants and occasional. talks in 
chapel, and the like. 
In those institutions where instruction is given, it is usually by the 
librarian or by some other member of the library staff. 
No uniformity whatever exists in regard to time given to this 
instruction or in importance attached to it in different schools. It 
varies from occasional talks to freshmen to systematic teaching, for 
which credit is given. 
There are therefore 85 institutions, or 57 per cent of the total num- 
ber reporting, which give some attention to instruction in the use of 
the library. Of this number, 32 report that the work is elective; 34 
that it is required. The remaining 19 did not indicate whether the 
work was elective or required. 
In the 32 institutions where the work is elective, it is open in some 
cases to students of any year, and in others it is limited to freshmen 
and sophomores. In a few instances it is provided only for graduate 
students, student assistants, and school-teachers. In the University 
of Missouri it is elective in connection with courses in education, jour- 
nalism, and the College of Arts. In Tulane it is an elective given as 
a university extension course. 
The required work ranges from one hour or one lecture early in the 
semester to systematic courses running through the year. It is gen- 
erally required in the freshman year, but in one instance in the sopho- 
more year. Frequently it is a requirement in connection with English 
classes and sometimes in connection with history. In one college 
(Utah Agricultural College) it is required in connection with any class 
in the general science course, agricultural courses, or home economics. 
Many institutions do not report definitely the number of hours of 
instruction. Several report one hour a week for 18 weeks; others two 
hours a week for 18 weeks; others one hour a week throughout the 
year. From 18 to 36 hours a year is the usual range. Of those who 
thus report definitely there is a total of 364 hours of required work, 
as against 1,525 hours of elective work, which would make it appear,
-P-A-G-E-408
  382 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
in general terms, that required work as against elective is about in tho 
ratio of 1 to 4. Most colleges report there are no prerequisites for tho 
library courses. 
The subjects treated may, for convenience, be classified in two 
groups. The first includes those topics which are generally taught 
wherever library instruction of any nature is given, such as classifi- 
cation and arrangement of books, the use of the card catalogue, the 
periodical indexes, reference books, and Government documents. In 
the second group are found scattering subjects which are given in 
some schools and not in others, such as illustration and history of 
printing, history of books and libraries, bibliography, practical exer- 
cises in making bibliographies, paleography, binding, selection of 
books, accessioning, shelf listing, how to build up special school libra- 
ries, suggesting best books for grades, and the administration of 
school libraries. 
Seven institutions report that the courses are intended primarily 
for school-teachers, two including in this class specialists in history. 
One university (University of Wyoming) gives its course for teachers 
and librarians working in the State; Simmons College plans to help 
secretaries at work in the libraries of their employers; the aim of 
another institution is to prepare persons to take charge of school 
libraries; of another to train people for employment in libraries; and 
of still another to train specialists m church history. 
In the remaining 73 institutions where attention is given to this 
matter, the courses are designed primarily to give grcater skill in use 
of books to the students as a whole and to teach the resources of the 
library. Seven universities give instruction regarding the library in 
their summer school course for teachers. 
In 104 institutions the librarian is a member of the faculty. In 61 
he holds the rank of a full college profussor; in 14 the rank of an 
assistant professor; and in 1 the rank of instructor. In one or two 
cases he holds the rank of a professor, but without a vote. In the 
remaining 28 cases the report does not state what position on the fac- 
ulty the librarian does hold. The remaining 45 of the librarians 
reporting are not members of the faculty. In three or four instances 
a professor is nominally librarian, and probably directs the policy of 
the library, but the actual administration is im the hands of an 
assistant librarian. 
The investigation shows that the following-named institutions 
maintain required courses, with credit toward graduation, designed 
to train all the students in effective use of books and libraries. The 
number of hours per week and total length of course is stated in each 
case. Instruction is given by the librarian or by members of the 
library staff.

RURAL LIBRARY EXTENSION. 
Progress continues to be made in reaching with supplies of suitable 
reading matter the large portion of our population, chiefly in rural 
and remote districts, still unprovided with library facilities. As 
examples of the need of this service, it may be noted that the number 
of people without access to books is estimated at a million and a half 
in New York State, and at about one million each in Wisconsin and 
Minnesota, although each of these three States has active agencies of 
library extension which have long been in operation. 
The extension of the library to rural communities is but one phase 
of the general movement for the improvement of country life. It is 
now recognized that an essential condition of effective work in library 
extension is a broader understanding of rural life and its problems. 
Much work in this direction has proved futile because of its lack of 
cooperation with other agencies, such as the country church and the 
rural school, at work for country life uplift. The a can not 
work alone and work successfully. 
Another requisite for effective library extension work in rural 
communities is a knowledge of home conditions, so that books 
supplied may be fitted to the individual or to the family receiving 
them. In order to meet this need, the methods of the rural social 
survey may perhaps successfully be employed to ascertain the 
reading interests and present book facilities of the people to be 
reached. 
An interesting example of this form of procedure is a statistical 
investigation recently made by the Delaware State Library Com- 
mission of books and periodicals owned in the homes of rural Dela- 
ware. Blanks containing the following questions for pupils to answer 
were sent to the teachers in the district schools: 
1. Name the books you have read in the past three years— 
(a) Books from traveling libraries. 
(6) All other books. 
2. What books does your family own? 
3. What magazines and papers does your family take?
-P-A-G-E-411
RECENT ASPECTS OF LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT. 385 
An accompanying card from the State board of education directed 
that the questions be answered. As a result, the State library 
commission now has records covering 80 per cent of the families 
that live outside of cities and towns. With these reports at hand for 
consultation, the commission may send books with a knowledge of 
the community to which they are going. When a request comes for 
a traveling library, the record for that particular neighborhood is 
consulted, and a little examination shows what kinds of books are 
owned there. 
*The replies received from one county were fully tabulated, while 
the reports from the other two counties are partly completed. 
Comparatively few families failed to answer the questions, and the 
replies show earnestness and accuracy. 
The papers proved that a great majority of the families in the 
country own but few books, and those not standard works in the 
estimation of librarians. Many families own no books aside from 
the Bible, and 20 per cent of them take no periodical, not even a 
local newspaper. The conclusions derived from the inquiry are 
summarized as follows: 
1. There is a great lack of reading among both adults and children. 
2. When books are provided, the children, at least, read them. 
3. The effect of the traveling library is very marked. 4. Periodicals 
taken are mostly of poor quality, including very few standard literary 
magazines. 5. Many homes had poor and expensive subscription 
books. 6. If a family owned many books, the majority were usually 
of good quality. 7. Not over one-third of the books owned outside 
the families composed clearly of book lovers could be classified as 
good. 
Thirty-five States are now engaged in rural extension work, 
either by means of a State-wide service of traveling libraries, or by 
authorizing library extension based on the county or township as 
local units. An account follows of present conditions with reference 
to these three main forms of progress. 
COUNTY EXTENSION. 
Library extension based on the county as a unit made considerable 
advance during the past year in various States, especially in California, 
where the county system prevails on a larger scale than elsewhere. 
California was found much too large to be served adequately or 
economically through a State system of traveling libraries, while 
municipal libraries can not reach the large percentage of population * 
living in remote parts of a county. The county free library, in its 
method of operation, closely follows that of a large city with its 
branches in different sections of the town. Its headquarters are
-P-A-G-E-412
386 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
established at the county seat, in charge of a county librarian trained 
and experienced in library work, who visits all parts of the county, 
becomes acquainted with the people, ascertains the book needs of the 
general public, the schools, the clubs, etc., and makes collections of 
books to be placed at each branch with special reference to the needs 
and desires of that particular locality. At suitable intervals these 
collections are changed in part or entirely, so that the material on 
hand may always be of interest. In addition, if a book is desired 
which is not in the local collection, it is sent from the central county 
free library; or if not found there, it is supplied from the State library, 
all shipments being free to the borrower. 
In very small communities the books are usually placed in a store, 
post office, or similar place convenient to the public. In each 
community large enough to need it a reading room is maintained, 
in charge of a custodian who is paid asmall stipend by the county and 
keeps the room open at convenient hours. Supplied with news- 
papers, magazines, and books, the reading rooms offer a most acceptable 
social center, and are welcomed as a strong influence for good in the 
smal] communities. 
In towns with libraries any cooperation with the county free 
library is for service only, and in no way interferes with the adminis- 
tration of the town library. If the town joins, it is then included in 
the taxable area, and its people consequently receive a more ex- 
tended library service, since the resources of the county then supple- 
ment those of the town library. 
From the county free library, and through it from the State library, 
the schools receive practically all books for reference and research 
work that the teachers may desire for the pupils. 
The California State library loans, free of transportation, to the 
county free libraries, books too expensive for purchase by the county, 
books which are only occasionally required, books out of print or 
rare, or several books on one subject where more are wanted by a 
school, a club, etc., than the county needs to own. Thousands of 
volumes on various professions, such as law, medicine, electricity, 
farming, etc.; historical works, including material about California; 
documents, books in foreign languages, books for the blind, art books 
and stereoscopic views, are examples of material available from the 
State library. 
Already 21 counties in California out of the total of 58 are main- 
taining county free library work, and many more are preparing to 
* adopt it. With a central office and storehouse established at the 
county seat, and with branches throughout the county, the people 
even in the remotest districts are receiving a library service possible 
only under such a cooperative plan. The counties now carrying on 
the plan are Alameda, Fresno, Imperial, Kern, Kings, Los Angeles,
-P-A-G-E-413
  RECENT ASPECTS OF LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT. 387 
Madera, Merced, Modoc, Monterey, Riverside, Sacramento, San 
Benito, San Diego, San Joaquin, San Mateo, Santa Barbara, Santa 
Clara, Stanislaus, Tulare, and Yolo. 
Indiana generally prefers the township plan of extension, but the 
county system prevails in some parts of the State. The public 
library at Bedford receives a small income from Lawrence County, 
and is free to all citizens of that county, while Marion and Vander- 
burgh Counties have county libraries at Indianapolis and Evansville,, 
respectively. The People’s Free Library, at Columbia City, lends 
books free of charge to all the citizens of Whitley County. The honor 
is claimed for Indiana of having been the first State in the Union to 
make provision for county libraries. 
In Kentucky extension work is done in Fayette and Mason Counties 
by the city libraries at Lexington and Maysville, which are also 
county libraries. Lawrenceburg, Henderson, and Covington libraries 
are agitating the subject of securing public appropriations which will 
enable them to extend their loans to the people of Anderson, Hender- 
son, and Kenton Counties, respectively. 
- A law of Minnesota passed in 1905 authorizes library extension 
through either the township or the county. Ten libraries in that 
State are now under the county extension plan, and three of these 
adopted the system during 1912. Only one public library in the 
State is under the township system. The Minnesota Public Library 
Commission reports that although good results have been obtained 
through the operation of the present law— 
comparison with work in other States seems to indicate that a more permanent system. 
could be established if the law provided for a definite basis of taxation for the co nty 
library, and accordingly a bill authorizing such taxation will be introduced in the 
1918 session of the legislature. 
At the 1911 session of the Nebraska Legislature, the library law 
of that State was amended so as to make possible the establishment 
of township and county libraries. Under this new provision, Lan- 
caster County voted at the general election in 1912 to make a library 
levy on the county, outside Lincoln, Havelock, and College View, 
which already maintain libraries. The county commissioners are to 
fix the rate of levy and determine the mode of operating the county 
library. It is expected that a contract will be made with the Lincoln 
city library for the extension of its privileges to the county. 
The New York Legislature in 1911 authorized the establishment, 
by popular vote, of a county library system, or securing library 
privileges for the people of a whole county by means of a contract 
between the county board of supervisors and any public library in 
the county. This plan has already been tried by Broome County. 
In North Carolina the Good-will Free Library, at Ledger, and 
the Washington Public Library are aided by appropriations from 
Mitchell and Beaufort Counties, respectively, while the Carnegie 
Library, at Charlotte, receives aid from both town and county. 
 
-P-A-G-E-414
388 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
The laws of Ohio permit the organization of both county and 
township libraries. The State possesses two notable examples of 
libraries serving their counties in the Brumback Library, at Van 
Wert, and the Cincinnati Public Library. 
The Library Association, of Portland, Oreg., serves the whole 
population of Multnomah County, in which that city is located. A 
new central library building is about to be erected, and numerous 
branches and deposit stations are located in various parts of the city 
and county. In addition, both city and county schools have been 
provided with classroom libraries. Oregon has a general law under 
which other counties may establish libraries when occasion, arises. 
This has already been done by Hood River and Wasco Counties. 
The Tennessee Free Library Commission advocates the establish- 
ment for every county in Tennessee of a free library on the model 
of that of Washington County, Md., at Hagerstown. It is reported 
that Williamson County, Tenn., is already preparing to inaugurate 
a free county library at Franklin. 4 
In Wisconsin the State form of extension predominates, but there 
are 12 county systems of traveling libraries organized under a special 
act of the legislature, besides 2 county systems supported by private 
benefaction. The Wisconsin Free Library Commission will aid in 
establishing county systems only in counties where the library condi- 
tions at the county seat or elsewhere give assurance of permanent 
supervision by one experienced in library routine and management. 
TOWNSHIP EXTENSION. 
Local library extension in Indiana is based on two laws, one 
known as the general library law and the other as the township 
extension law. These two statutes provide for the establishment 
and maintenance of public libraries in cities and towns, and for the 
extension of the unit of library control and support to one township 
in which such town or city is situated, or to a number of neighboring 
townships. The object in view is to have a public library in every 
important city and town, which will serve not only the people who 
live inside the corporate limits, but all the people in the vicinity—in 
other words, to make every important town and city a library center 
for all the people who use the town or city as a business, social, reli- 
gious, or educational center. Sometimes this means one main library 
in a county, sometimes it means several such libraries. The rural 
service is both directly from the central library, and indirectly through 
branches, deposit stations, and when possible through parcel post. 
Fifty-three Indiana towns and cities have united with 60 town- 
ships to support libraries under the township extension law. One 
library is securing support from 4 townships, 1 from 3, 2 from 2, and 
49 are receiving support from 1 township each. Some of these libra-
-P-A-G-E-415
RECENT ASPECTS OF LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT. 889 
ties have been operating under this plan since the first township law 
went into effect some years ago; several were added when the law of 
1909 was passed, and 28 have become township extension libraries 
since the enactment of the 1911 revision. 
The Iowa Library Commission reports that the township library 
extension law of that State is greatly in need of amendment to meet 
the actual conditions which have developed as the law has been 
tested. The results of a trial of the method in three towns have 
been in general encouraging. 
Nearly every township in Michigan now possesses a library, through 
the efforts of the State board of library commissioners and cooper- 
ating agencies working under appropriate legislation. 
In 1912 New Jersey had about five libraries doing effective town- 
ship work, and according to the public library commission, there 
were in the State many others which could with advantage to them- 
selves follow this example, and undoubtedly would if the proper 
impetus were supplied. The States which permit both the county 
and township plans of extension, namely, Minnesota, Nebraska, and 
Ohio, have already been mentioned in this chapter. 
. 
TRAVELING LIBRARIES. 
Traveling library systems are now maintained by 28 States, as fol- 
lows: Alabama, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, 
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Min- 
nesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, 
Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, 
Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. In Massachusetts the State 
Library Commission cooperates with traveling libraries maintained 
by the Woman’s Education Association of Boston and by other agen- 
cies. The traveling libraries formerly sent out by the California 
State Library were discontinued in 1911, and extension work in that 
State is now carried on under the county system. The principal 
features of recent traveling library work in 20 of the above-named 
States may be described as follows: 
COLORADO. 
The biennial period 1911-12 promised to be the most successful in 
the history of the Colorado Traveling Library Commission, owing to 
the increased grant made by the eighteenth general assembly, but 
unfortunately the available State funds were sufficient to meet only 
50 per cent of the appropriation. In spite of this deficit, the travel- 
ing libraries increased from 241 boxes to 265 boxes of 50 volumes 
each, and 47 towns were added to the list of stations, making a total 
of 349. There is a strong demand from all parts of the State for 
further extension of the work.
-P-A-G-E-416
  390 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
IDAHO. 
The demand for children’s literature during the past year has been 
so great that 10 special juvenile cases have been added to the travel- 
ing library, and as many more are to be secured as soon as time and 
finances will permit. Special cases of books on agriculture and home 
economics are now in circulation for the first time. Since there are 
many calls for material on subjects for debates, it is intended to add 
special collections along these lines, as well as books for the blind. 
INDIANA. 
The public library commission of this State circulates 35,000 vol- 
umes annually from its traveling library department, which contains 
10,000 volumes. 
IOWA. 
The Iowa Library Commission maintains both fixed-group and 
open-shelf collections for traveling libraries. During recent years 
there has been a steadily increasing number of requests for material 
on specific subjects, and of appeals for direction and help along defi- 
nite lines of investigation. : 
Many agencies in the State stimulate an interest in books, and it 
is the policy of the traveling library to cooperate in every possible 
way with such agencies in providing books on various subjects. 
The agricultural extension department of tho State college at Ames 
continued to make extended use of the books on agriculture and 
related subjects, and books from the traveling library were carried on 
exhibit cars and used at the short courses and in connection with the 
organization of farmers’ clubs. The granges also make use of both 
agricultural books and those for general reading. Exhibits were 
also made at county fairs, with the object of arousing an interest on 
the part of the farmers in the use of books from the local library. 
The Iowa Federation of Women’s Clubs continues to be one of the 
strongest allies of the work of the library commission, and there is 
very close cooperation between the many clubs in the federation and 
the traveling library, both in the preparation of club programs and 
in supplying books for study. There has also been close coopera- 
tion with the Iowa Congress of Mothers and Parent-Teacher Associ- 
ation in the preparation of a study outline on child study and in 
the use made of the traveling library books. 
Various church organizations throughout the State, especially mis- 
sionary societies, obtained material on the special country studied 
from the traveling library, and books for general reading were loaned 
to rural churches and Sunday schools to a greater extent than ever 
before, owing to the active interest in establishing social centers in 
country neighborhoods. The rural schools are making increasing

use of the travelitig library and serve as distributing centers for the 
loan of books in their vicinity. 
There continues to be a wide use of the debate collections for high 
schools and of the traveling picture collections. 
The books in the entire traveling library collection July 1, 1912, 
numbered 22,823, divided as follows: 225 libraries for general read- 
ing in fixed collections of 50 books each, 12,250 volumes; open-shelf 
subject collection for study and graded books for rural schools, 10,573 
volumes. During the biennial period preceding that date, 58,196 
volumes were loaned in answer to 2,744 requests, and 278 new sta- 
tions were registered, of which 134 were schools, both rural and in 
small towns, and 80 were clubs. 
KANSAS. 
The plan followed by the Kansas Traveling Libraries Commission 
in making up its libraries is to select the books from a miscellaneous 
collection, so as to fill as nearly as possible the lists submitted by its 
patrons. When no list is furnished, an attempt is made to send a 
selection of books suitable for the readers ordering. This is in many 
eases very difficult to accomplish without any knowledge of. the 
tastes of those ordering or of the books to which they already have 
access. This»“‘open-shelf”’ system involves considerably more labor 
than the “unit” or “fixed-group” plan in use in many States. Under 
the unit system a more generally desirable selection of books may be 
placed in each library, but it is shown by experience that books 
selected for general use will not be read as much as the books selected 
by the readers themselves. 
The commission now has 5 German libraries sent out under the same 
regulations as the other books. A few special libraries of 4 to 13 vol- 
umes each have been purchased for a correspondence course in uni- 
versity extension work carried on by the State university. Of these, 
6 are on English history, 3 on education, 6 on psychology, 4 on soci- 
ology, 3 on American history, 3 on American literature, and 2 on the 
history of ancient philosophy. Two complete libraries on domestic 
science have been added for the use of classes organized by the domes- 
tic-science department of the agricultural college. Aside from these 
mentioned, the unit system is not in use in the Kansas traveling 
libraries. 
The following statistics show the growth of the traveling libraries 
during the last two years: Total number of cases on hand June 30, 
1912, 525; number of accessioned volumes, June 30, 1912, 41,000. 
Number of libraries sent out during the two years ending June 30, 
1912, 1,106, as against 1,000 sent out during the two years ending June 
30, 1910.

  392 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
Two years ago the traveling libraries reached 104 counties and 580 
stations, while the record now shows that 640 stations in the same 
counties (all in the State but one) have been visited. Many of the 
towns are regular patrons, ordering from 8 to 10 libraries a year. 
KENTUCKY. 
The library commission of this State has at present 122 traveling 
libraries, divided as follows: General libraries, 66; school libraries, 
50; farmers’ libraries, 4; colored school library, 1; special library, 1. 
At the time of the latest report these libraries were distributed as 
follows: Schools, 65; communities, 22; social settlements, 2; insti- 
tutions, 4; Young Men’s Christian Association, 4. 
MAINE. 
The State now has 268 traveling libraries, of which 210 are at 
present in circulation. During the past year more than 400 libraries 
have been sent out, and the demand for them is steadily increasing. 
The Maine Library Commission circulates regular libraries of 50 
volumes, of which 35 are fiction and 15 general literature; also special 
libraries made up of books on some designated country or subject, an 
agricultural library, and juvenile libraries. 
MASSACHUSETTS. 
The traveling libraries in Massachusetts have been for many years 
furnished and circulated by the Woman’s Education Association, 
in close cooperation with the State library commission. 
They are sent to the smaller libraries to supplement their own col- 
lections, and especially to supply the needs of study clubs and others 
wishing to pursue a special course of reading. They are also often 
sent, at the request of the commission, to outlying villages or schools 
as the first step toward the establishment of a branch or deposit sta- 
tion in connection with the town library. i 
Ninety localities received the benefit of these libraries in 1911. In 
recognition of the present need of books for foreigners, two Polish 
libraries were prepared, and the Circolo Italiano gave the association 
$50 for an Italian library. Twenty-three sets of pictures visited 152 
places. 
In 1912 an agricultural traveling library was sent to six libraries; 
a French traveling library to two libraries; and French and Italian 
books given to two libraries. 
MINNESOTA. 
During 1911-12 the number of traveling library stations in Minne- 
sota increased steadily. More agricultural libraries were made avail- 
able, and a teacher’s library was prepared, containing books on story

RECENT ASPECTS OF LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT. 393 
telling and approved editions of the children’s classics. It was found 
impossible to supply the demand for foreign literature, in spite of 
liberal purchase of Norwegian, Swedish, and German books. The 
foreign libraries circulated by the library commission each contain 
25 volumes in Finnish, French, German, Norwegian, or the Swedish 
language. The number of foreign books on hand in July, 1912, was 
1,148. 
In conjunction with the country-life committee of the Minnesota 
Federation of Women’s Clubs, libraries on household economics, 
country-life problems, etc., were placed in various parts of the State. 
Two traveling libraries on arts and crafts and school arts were sent 
out to accompany the traveling exhibit of the Minnesota State Art 
Society. While the art exhibit was in each town, the books were 
placed in the public library, and those interested were thus enabled 
to inform themselves by collateral reading. By request of the Ameri- 
can Medical Association, libraries on hygiene and sanitation have been 
collected and will be placed in rest rooms designated by the committee 
for public health education among women. 
The total number of books in the traveling libraries July, 1912, was 
26,448. There was also an open-shelf collection comprising 3,917 
volumes, used in making up club libraries, furnishing debate material, 
satisfying individual calls, ete. 
NEBRASKA. 
The Nebraska Public Library Commission reports that the use of 
its traveling library department during 1911-12 has continued to 
increase. In response to 1,306 requests, 30,225 volumes were sent 
out, which is an increase of more than 32 per cent over the number 
of volumes sent out in the previous biennium. The increase might 
have been much greater, however, had there been more books 
available, and the commission therefore asks from the legislature 
an appropriation for enlarging the collection. During the winter 
of 1911-12 there was seldom a time when the number of requests 
on file did not exceed the number of libraries in. Books were sent 
during the biennium to all but seven counties in the State. 
In Nebraska the practice of combining the fixed-group and open- 
shelf systems is found successful. The unit is 15 adult fiction and 
20 children’s books, to which are added-books to suit the special 
community. The patrons express far more satisfaction with the 
books, and the old stations are held better than formerly. More- 
over, the actual use of nonfiction has increased. 
NEW JERSEY. 
During the past year 795 traveling libraries have been sent out, 
containing an aggregate of 39,750 books. The number of traveling
-P-A-G-E-420
  394 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
library centers has been increased from 256 to 282, making a gain of 
26 in the number of communities served. As far as can be ascer- 
tained, the average circulation from these stations is about four 
times for each volume, making a total circulation of 159,000 from the 
282 stations. As computed from the reports, the average number 
of readers at a traveling library station is 87, making a total of 24,534 
people being served through the regular traveling libraries. 
As special loans, 1,871 books were sent out during 1912. With the 
aid of the public libraries of Newark, New York, Trenton, and other 
cities, this method of supplying books for specific demand is suc- 
cessfully meeting a need of material for individual study which could 
not be met through the general traveling libraries. The privilege is 
greatly appreciated, and this branch of the work promises in time 
to become one of the most important developments of the traveling 
library system, furnishing, as it does, a means of carrying on serious 
research and study work in rural communities and small towns and 
villages that are without libraries, as well as enabling small libraries 
to give their patrons the benefit of many valuable reference books 
otherwise unavailable. 
NEW YORK. 
The division of educational extension of the New York State 
Education Department had in 1912 a collection of 49,897 volumes 
available for traveling libraries, requiring the constant service of 12 
persons for its administration. There were in fixed groups 5,706 
volumes, of which 77 sets of 25 volumes each were. for children. 
The great bulk of the collection consists of books which are subject 
to selection for reading on some particular topic. During 1911-12, 
758 traveling libraries, containing 31,302 volumes, were loaned. 
The division also promotes the establishment of study clubs by 
aiding in the preparation of their programs and by loaning books 
relating to the subjects of their study on the same terms as traveling 
libraries containing an equal number of volumes. During the year 
35 new clubs were registered, and the total of those reporting approved 
courses of study was 353. 
NORTH DAKOTA. 
The following statistics show the condition of the traveling library 
department of the North Dakota State Public Library Commission 
July 1, 1912: Number of traveling libraries, 151, as against 117 in 
1910; books in traveling libraries, 7,165, as against 6,158 in 1910; 
traveling library stations, 356, as against 138 in 1910; farmers’ 
libraries, 95, as against 25 in 1910; books in farmers’ libraries, 1,270, 
as against 365 in 1910.

OREGON. 
There are 15,303 volumes in the traveling libraries and general 
loan collection of the Oregon Library Commission, 10,753 of these 
being in fixed groups, the balance representing books which help to 
meet special demands from the commission’s readers in its regular 
stations, which in 1912 numbered 208, an increase of 105 over the 
total of 1910. Since there are but 209 traveling libraries for 208 
stations, there are not enough books to make exchanges for these 
stations without waiting for the return of boxes, and an enlarged 
appropriation for the purchase of books for these collections is there- 
fore requested from the legislature. During the past two years 3,178 
books have been bought for these fixed traveling libraries, and 442 
freight shipments have been made, containing 22,785 volumes. 
Aside from these miniature public libraries, which the commission 
has in every county except Multnomah, there are 28 special collec- 
tions of club or high-school libraries intended for the study of some 
one particular subject for six months or more. Nine attractive study 
libraries were recently added and served groups of students in small 
Oregon towns during the winter. These new libraries deal with 
description and history of China, Holland, and Mexico; travel in the 
United States; American colonial and revolutionary history; Ameri- 
can literature; home, school, and community life; and the drama. 
The commission has other group libraries on the most interesting 
leaders and events in ancient, medieval, and English history, besides 
four collections upon the American Revolutionary period, deposited 
by the Oregon Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
During 1912 the assistant secretary of the Pennsylvania Free 
Library Commission spent considerable time attending farmers’ 
institutes to present the traveling library work to those in attendance. 
Traveling libraries were sent to 390 places, and 23 local free 
libraries also received supplementary loans, in some cases consisting 
of one or two volumes and in others of entire traveling libraries. 
The general and study club collections distributed contained 14,342 
and 2,101 volumes, respectively, while 1,094 volumes were loaned to 
public libraries and 35 to individuals. All recipients of general col- 
lections and individual borrowers and many of the study clubs and 
public libraries assisted were located in communities of less than 
1,000 population, and mostly in the open country. 
TENNESSEE, 
The traveling libraries circulated by the Tennessee Free Library 
Commission are collections of 50 books of general reading, which are 
loaned to any community in the State not accessible to a library
-P-A-G-E-422
  896 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
center. They consist of books of interest in popular science, history, 
travel, biography, agriculture, and household economics, as well as 
a liberal supply of fiction and books for children. 
In 1912 the commission reported a steady and increased demand 
for traveling libraries throughout the entire State. Seventy-six cases 
of good books were sent to 112 different rural communities in 51 
counties. In the words of the commission— 
they have been sent to the most obscure landings up and down the Tennessee and 
Cumberland Rivers; they have penetrated the mountain fastnesses; they have gone 
into the most isolated regions of the lowlands and into the most prosperous sections 
of our blue-grass country. Post offices, general stores, newspaper offices, schools, 
churches, and sometimes the hospitable farm home, have all served as stations. The 
circulation of books from these libraries has been large, as shown by the reports of the 
local libraries. 
The Tennessee State Library is authorized by the general education 
bill of 1909 to circulate traveling libraries for county schools. In 
1912 the State library had 6 traveling school libraries of 50 volumes 
each in each of 38 counties, a total of 228 collections aggregating 
11,400 books. The purpose of the traveling school library is to sup- 
plement the permanent library and to arouse a desire for reading that 
will lead to the establishment of permanent libraries in communities 
now lacking them. The books are made available to the adult mem- 
bers of the family, who are reached through the children. 
VERMONT. 
The traveling libraries of the Vermont Library Commission number 
143, containing 5,431 volumes, and are of the usual three kinds— 
general collections, school libraries, and libraries for study clubs. 
The school libraries are planned for the special use of children, and are 
intended to serve district schools at a distance from public libraries. 
The demand for the school collections required an increase in their 
number to 50 in 1912, which was exactly double those available in 
1910. ‘ 
A new departure in 1912 was 4 libraries for farmers. These con- 
tain 45 books each—20 on various phases of agriculture, 10 stories 
for adults, and 15 books of fiction and nonfiction for children. A 
constant call for these farmers’ libraries and for extra agricultural 
books was reported. 
The number of traveling libraries sent out during 1911-12 aggre- 
gated 238, containing 8,895 volumes, and comprising 110 general 
collections, 81 school libraries, and 47 study-club collections. The 
readers reached by this material numbered 4,150. 
The traveling library department of the Vermont commission also 
circulates picture collections on about 30 different subjects, the most 
popular of which are colored prints of birds, animals, and flowers, 
which go to many schools to help in nature study.

VIRGINIA, 
During the year ending October 31, 1911, the total circulation of 
books in the traveling library system maintained by the Virginia 
State Library was 31,259, and the total number of borrowers 6,579, a 
decided increase both in number of borrowers and readers over the 
figures of the preceding year. Of this service the greater part was 
with school libraries, for which the demand exceeded the supply. 
The traveling libraries have demonstrated their popularity and 
have stimulated interest in the establishment of permanent libraries 
in many localities. The total number of volumes owned by the 
traveling library department October 31, 1911, was 10,666. 
WASHINGTON. 
The superintendent of the State traveling library reports that 288 
new applications were received in 20 months and that more than 
12,000 people in the rural districts are tributary to the new stations. 
Among the readers of the traveling libraries are 4,422 men in railroad 
construction and United States reclamation work. Special book pur- 
chases have been made for improvement clubs, granges, debates, 
required reading in the eighth grade and in teachers’ reading circles, 
rock-quarry convicts, the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, 
the Young Men’s Christian Association, and the women’s clubs. The 
total number of volumes available for Washington State traveling 
libraries is 11,000. 
WISCONSIN. 
According to 1912 statistics, the traveling library department of the 
Wisconsin Free Library Commission possessed a total of 38,843 vol- 
umes, all in fixed groups, except 2,500 which formed an open-shelf 
collection. The number of volumes sent out as loans was 48,369, in 
answer to 1,001 requests. 
LIBRARY SERVICE TO FOREIGNERS. 
The public library is one of the effective agencies engaged in pre- 
paring for American citizenship the great numbers of adult immigrants 
settled in various sections of the country, chiefly in the large cities. 
. This department of library work has developed during the past 
decade from small beginnings to a point where now the library of 
nearly every city in the country having a noticeable proportion of 
foreign-born residents has at least a few volumes and a newspaper 
or two in the native tongue of these patrons, while some public 
libraries maintain large foreign collections under special custodians. 
Special attention is given to supplying the need of the immigrant for 
literature in his own language regarding America. Many libraries
-P-A-G-E-424
  398 |. EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
provide rooms for the meetings of societies of foreigners, and maintain 
lectures and evening classes for instruction in American conditions. 
Some of the State library commissions circulate traveling libraries 
of books in foreign languages, designed especially for the benefit of 
the immigrant population. 
In Massachusetts, in 1912, it was reported that a French traveling 
library was in circulation, and that Polish and Italian libraries were 
in preparation. New York State had available for traveling service 
a limited number of books in Italian, Polish, and German. The 
New Jersey Public Library Commission cooperated with the immigra- 
tion commission of that State in work for the education and recrea- 
tion of the foreigner. This library commission supplemented the 
collections, usually very small, in local libraries by its own books, 
and by acting as an exchange center for various libraries. 
In the Middle West the Wisconsin Free Library Commission loans 
to public libraries for six months traveling libraries of German, Yid- 
dish, Danish, Norwegian, and Polish books. Small groups of Bohe- 
mian, Danish, French, German, Norwegian, Polish, and Swedish 
books are sent with traveling libraries in English to settlements of 
foreigners. The foreign libraries of the Minnesota Public Library 
Commission, each containing 25 volumes in the Finnish, French, Ger-" 
man, Norwegian, or Swedish language, had a wide circulation during 
1911-12. Many public libraries with insufficient book funds depended 
on the library commission to help them meet the demand for foreign 
literature. Groups of six foreign books were sent upon request 
without extra charge with a traveling library in English. During the 
winter months the demand for Scandinavian books exceeded the 
supply, in spite of liberal purchases. 
The Kansas Traveling Libraries Commission has five German libra- 
ries sent out under the same regulations as its other books. Since, 
with the opening of the Panama Canal, California expects a great 
increase in immigration, the problem of assimilation of the foreigner 
is receiving consideration from librarians in that State. It is said 
that the county librarians now have an opportunity for constructive 
work among foreigners in California not to be found elsewhere in 
rural districts, since the agricultural population of the State includes 
many diverse nationalities. 
Since the bulk of foreign population is massed in the larger cities, 
the task of making provision for the immigrant falls principally 
upon the various city libraries. The policy ordinarily followed is 
to supply the adult foreigners with literature in their own languages, 
but to offer to children and young people interesting books as a 
reward for learning to read English. 
According to the Director of the Census, in New England, once 
regarded as an essentially American section of the country, less than
-P-A-G-E-425
  
RECENT ASPECTS OF LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT. 399 
two-fifths of the population is now native-born of native parentage. 
Southern New England is said to be ‘‘the most foreign region of 
the United States,” having a larger percentage of foreign birth 
and foreign parentage than New York, Chicago, or San Francisco. 
The New England libraries are actively contributing their part to 
the work of assimilating this element in the body politic. Note- 
worthy examples of this service are furnished by the public libraries 
of Boston and Providence. 
In various parts of the city of Boston a series of foreign centers is 
rapidly forming—of Itelians, Jews, Poles, Portuguese, and other for- 
eigners—many of whom are eager readers. These people want the 
companionship of books as a cure for homesickness, and want the 
information to be gained from books as an aid to advancement in 
their occupations. Books that will assist foreigners in learning Eng- 
lish have recently been purchased by. the Boston Public Library, 
and an increased supply of books in foreign languages for adult for- 
eigners is contemplated. 
The Providence Public Library has a well-organized and active 
foreign department. This department has 10,000 volumes in 14 dif- 
ferent languages, with each literature arranged in a separate section, 
containing classic works for those who seek their mother tongue for 
pleasure and inspiration, while for those who are trying to learn 
English there are interlingual grammars prepared especially for the 
adult immigrant, with trade vocabularies of practical business English. 
There are, also, elementary reading books, for the most part in 
English, and books on civics to acquaint the future citizen with the 
fundamental principles of our Government. Leaflets in five different 
languages, explaining what steps are necessary to obtain cards and 
draw books, are circulated by the Providence Public Library, and the 
response is gratifying. 
This public library also cooperates with the city night schools, 
sending them lists of books that will assist both teachers and pupils. 
A large part, however, of the non-English-speaking population of 
Providence is untouched by the public school, and must be reached 
by some other means. Providence has recently become a port of 
entry for immigrants, and coincident with this has arisen the immi- 
grant educational bureau, which is arranging for illustrated lectures, 
in foreign languages and in English, on topics which will appeal to the 
immigrants and assist them to become useful citizens. The lecture 
room at the library is one of the halls used for these addresses. 
In 1912 books in the Portuguese, Yiddish, and Armenian languages 
were placed on open shelves in the main reading room of the New 
Bedford (Mass.) Public Library for the advantage of foreign readers, 
while a large collection of French books was sent to the north branch 
for service among the French Canadians in that section of the city.
-P-A-G-E-426
400 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
A suggestive card, printed in English and in French, calling attention 
to the resources of the library, was widely circulated through the 
agency of the schools and a reading list of the Portuguese books in 
the library was printed. ; 
The circulation department of the New York Public Library con- 
tained in languages other than English 92,241 volumes in 1912, an 
increase of 10,981 over 1911. During the past year special additions 
were made to the collections in Spanish, Italian, Bohemian, Hun- 
garian, and Polish. There were circulated 499,350 volumes in 26 
foreign languages, an increase of 45,632 over the number recorded 
in 1911. The languages principally represented were Bohemian, 
Danish, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, 
Polish, Roumanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, and Yiddish. Small 
numbers of books were circulated also in Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, 
Flemish, Finnish, Slovak, modern Greek, and Servian. With the 
exception of French and German, which are distributed throughout 
the branches generally; the principal foreign collections are localized 
among their respective constituencies. 
A further extension of the work with the foreign population of New 
York City is planned for the coming yéar. It is proposed to 
strengthen the public library collections of Russian, Yiddish, and 
Polish books, and plans are under way for the installation of a col- 
lection of Ruthenian books at the Ottendorfer branch. 
In order to reach the foreign population, circulars printed in 
Italian, modern Greek, Hungarian, Polish, Spanish, and Chinese, 
respectively, were distributed last year, calling attention to branches 
where books in these languages were available for home use. This 
proved effective in promoting increase of membership at many 
branches. 
In this connection one aspect should be mentioned of the coopera- 
tive work at New York library branches with local educational, 
literary, and welfare societies, through the use of assembly and club 
rooms in branch buildings by these organizations for regular places of 
meeting. The advantages of such cooperation are especially empha- 
sized in the work of the branches located on the east side, where the 
foreign element is strongest, and where, consequently, there is greater 
need of stimulating popular interest in the library by bringing these 
people into closer personal touch with branches in their districts. 
The cooperative work of the past year.included classes in the study) 
of English for Italians, Russians, Roumanians, Bohemians, Hungarians, 
Lithuanians, Finns, Poles, and Oriental Jews, and meetings of foreign| 
societies, literary and other, including most of these nationalities. 
Of special interest were the meetings held during the summer i 
the roof reading rooms of the Hamilton Fish Park and Rivingto: 
Street branches, located in congested east-side districts, of th

“Tittle mothers’’ league, formed under the auspices of the depart- 
ment of health for the purpose of instructing girls in the care of 
babies. In reporting an attendance of over 500 girls at these meet- 
ings one librarian added that about 50 books on the subject of babies 
were in constant circulation among the ‘‘little mothers,’”’ a concrete 
illustration of one result of this sort of library work. 
The Brooklyn Public Library has available for circulation more 
than 25,000 volumes in 20 different modern languages. 
Buffalo, the second city in size in New York State, also contains 
large colonies of foreigners. There the circulation of books in German 
is, for the most part, from the main building of the public library. 
All the books in the Polish language owned by the library are located 
in one branch. The collection of Italian books has received some 
recent additions, but is still considered inadequate, and the same 
statement applies to the books in Hebrew and Yiddish. The library 
also contains books in the Hungarian language. 
All foreign books added to the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh are 
placed in the central building and loaned to branches, sometimes in 
large collections for an indefinite period; sometimes in small groups 
of from 10 to 30 volumes, to be exchanged in a few months; and 
sometimes in response to a request for two or three books for an 
individual. During the past year a Lithuanian collection was 
acquired, selected by a small committee of Lithuanians, who gave 
valuable assistance in making the books known among their country- 
men. Additions were made to several of the foreign collections, and 
entertainments in the vernacular were given to-inform the foreign- 
speaking people that the library has books for them and that they are 
welcome within its doors. The increase in registration and circula- 
tion following each entertainment of this kind has shown them to be 
a valuable aid in the work. At the close of the year ending January 
31, 1912, the books in foreign languages numbered 28,640 and the 
total foreign circulation during the year was 46,920, a gain of 25 per 
cent over 1910. The principal languages of the collection were 
French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Lithuanian, Polish, 
Russian, Spanish, Swedish, and Yiddish. 
Classes in English for foreigners are conducted at some of the 
branches of the Pittsburgh library. 
At the Carnegie Library of Homestead, Pa., the annual circulation 
of books in Slovak, Magyar, Bohemian, German, Italian, French, and 
Lithuanian amounted to over 5,000. The foreign patrons of the 
library, who are mostly steel-mill workers, take great interest in 
literary club work. Examples of societies meeting in the building are 
the Slovak-American Literary Club with 90 members, the Magyar 
Self-Culture Club with 100 members, and the Slovak Civic Association 
with 70 members.

  402 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
This library has an educational department, with classes in common 
and higher school branches, mechanical drawing, and commercial 
subjects. In the English ciass 43 foreigners were enrolled, while in 
the civil-government class for foreigners, with a 20 weeks’ course, the 
enrollment was 10, with an attendance of 123. 
For a number of years the public library of Cleveland, Ohio, has 
been dealing with the increasing problems arising in connection with 
the foreign population of that city. The circulating collections now 
include nearly 40,000 volumes in foreign tongues, 18 languages being 
represented. It is hoped to attain the solution of some of the prob- 
lems by centralizing the books in each language in the district con- 
taining the largest number of readers of that language, either in the 
main library, a branch, or a subbranch. The headquarters for 
books in each language will have assistants with special knowledge 
of that language, and will manage interloans, book selection, and all 
general procedure except that of obtaining and “preparing” the 
books. In accordance with this plan the collections of books in the 
following languages have been transferred to suitable branches: Bo- 
hemian, Croatian, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Russian, 
Slovenian, and Yiddish. The following collections remain at the 
main library: Danish, Finnish, French, Lithuanian, Roumanian, 
Spanish, Swedish, though it seems probable that the Lithuanian, and 
possibly the Finnish and Swedish, may be transferred to branches 
later. The main library will retain the central collection of German 
books, though in this language most of the larger branches will con- 
tinue to keep local collections. 
The Grand Rapids (Mich.) Public Library contains about 6,000 
volumes in foreign languages, from which approximately 18,000 
loans were made during 1911-12. The languages chiefly represented 
are Dutch, French, German, Italian, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, 
and Swedish. There has been a growing use of Polish books, the 
circulation in this language being twice that of the German and Dutch 
languages combined. 
During the past year members of the library staff gave addresses 
on the use of the library to groups of school children and to adult 
patrons. A night-school class of foreigners just beginning the study 
of the English language was brought to the main building for an 
evening to receive this instruction. For some of them an interpreter 
was required. 
Books in foreign languages in thé Chicago Public Library are 
chiefly in German, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Bohemian, 
Polish, Russian, Scandinavian, Hungarian, Lithuanian, Yiddish, 
Japanese, and Chinese. Manuals for learning English and for the 
study of American institutions are also available. For the use of 
citizens of foreign birth, the library provides a selection of leading

daily and weekly newspapers from 15 of the principal European 
countries. 
The Davenport (lowa) Public Library contains books in German, 
French, Swedish, Bohemian, and Danish. It has received requests 
for books in modern Greek, Spanish, and Russian, but there is no 
continued demand for them. 
ASSOCIATION PROCEEDINGS. 
AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. 
The thirty-fourth annual meeting of the American Library Associa- 
tion, was held at Ottawa, Canada, June 26 to July 2,1912. The total 
attendance was 704. Among the principal topics discussed were: 
“Publicity for the library for the sake of information and support;” 
“The breadth and limitations of book buying;” ‘‘The efficiency of 
the library staff and scientific management;” “What the library 
schools can do for the library profession;” and the various phases 
of book advertising. 
Among the prominent speakers were Sir Wilfrid Laurier; President 
George E. Vincent, of the University of Minnesota; Dr. J. W. 
Robertson, chairman of the Canadian Royal Commission on Indus- 
trial Training and Technical Education; Dr. Herbert Putnam, 
Librarian of Congress; and other prominent librarians. The con- 
ference was presided over by Mrs. H. L. Elmendorf, vice librarian 
of the Buffalo Public Library, the first woman president of the 
association. The various sections and affiliated organizations held 
meetings at the same time and place. 
The sections of the American Library Association are: College and 
reference, trustees, catalogue, children’s librarians, professional 
training, and agricultural libraries. The affiliated organizations are 
the National Association of State Libraries, League of Library Com- 
missions, American Association of Law Libraries, and Special 
Libraries Association. 
Henry E. Legler, librarian of the Chicago Public Library, was 
elected president of the American Library Association for 1912-13. 
The secretary is George B. Utley, with headquarters at 78 East 
Washington, Street, Chicago, Ill. 
Important features of the work of the association during the past 
year included the following: 
1. Efforts to induce newspaper publishers to print a special edition 
on more durable paper, and efforts to induce libraries to subscribe 
for these better editions wherever available. This work has resulted 
in several newspapers agreeing to print such a special edition. 
2. A study of the relations which should exist between the public 
library and the municipal authorities. The importance of this sub- 
ject results largely from the uncertain position of the library in cities
-P-A-G-E-430
404 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
which have recently adopted new charters, especially those governed 
under the commission plan. 
3. An effort to inform the men students of colleges and universities 
of the attractions of library work, with a view to inducing more of 
the best qualified men to enter the library profession. 
AMERICAN LIBRARY INSTITUTE. 
The formation of the American Library Institute grew out of a 
discussion of several years’ duration regarding the need of a delib- 
erative body, made up of those of wide experience and mature judg- 
ment, interested in the development of the library as an educational 
force. It was felt by many that the general plan and purpose of the 
American Library Association would not permit opportunity for ex- 
haustive discussion or due consideration of many questions involved 
in library extension, and that there was need and a place for a body 
where informal and somewhat confidential discussions might lead 
to the formation of definite, helpful, and valuable principles. 
With this end in view, the matter was thoroughly discussed from 
every standpoint, and the adoption of a constitution followed which 
consummates the organization of the body proposéd.. The constitu- 
tion of the American Library Institute states that— 
the object shall be to provide for the study and discussion of library problems by a 
representative body chosen from English-speaking Americans, regardless of residence 
or official position. 
The membership is limited to 100 fellows. There are at present 56 
members in good standing. The growth in membership is inten- 
tionally slow. 
Meetings of the institute have been held every year since 1908. 
Interesting and instructive discussions have been held at all the meet- 
ings, which have been open to visitors. Meetings of the past year 
were held, the first at Ottawa, June 26, and the second at Niagara 
Falls, N. Y., September 26, 1912. The subject for discussion was 
“The cost of administration.’”’ So much interest developed, and 
so wide a divergence of opinion appeared, that a special committee 
was appointed to investigate the subject thoroughly and report at 
another meeting. 
The present officers of the institute are: President, Dr. Frank P. Hill, 
librarian of the Public Library of Brooklyn, N. Y.; secretary and tre’s- 
urer, Mary Eileen Ahern, editor of ‘‘ Public Libraries,” Chicago, Ill. 
LEAGUE OF LIBRARY COMMISSIONS.     
     
    
    
    
         
    
        
   The League of Library Commissions, including 27 State commis- 
sions and similar bodies, met with the American Library Associatio: 
at Ottawa in July, 1912. 
A report was submitted by the committee on charter provisio 
for public libraries in home-rule or commission-governed cities. Th 
committee was continued and instructed to cooperate with the com.

mittee of the American Library Association council on library laws 
and charter provisions. 
A report was received from the committee on library post, which 
urged action by each State library commission and library associa- 
tion to secure parcels post for books. 
Reports were also received from the committees on State school 
library systems, on study outlines, on libraries in Federal prisons, on 
publications, and on uniform financial reports. A paper was read on 
library work among the insane. 
Efforts are making to secure the formation of State library com- 
missions in Arkansas and in Oklahoma. 
OTHER IMPORTANT MEETINGS. 
The annual midwinter meetings of the official boards and council 
of the American Library Association, the League of Library Com- 
missions, the college librarians of the Middle West, and the faculties 
of library schools, were held at Chicago, January 2-6, 1912. 
The New York State Library Association meeting, commonly 
termed ‘“‘ New York library week,’’ was held at Niagara Falls, Septem- 
ber 23-28, 1912. There was an attendance of over 300. Library 
work among various penal and philanthropic institutions was given 
prominence. Addresses were made by Dr. P. P. Claxton, United 
States Commissioner of Education; M. 8. Dudgeon, secretary of the 
Wisconsin Free Library Commission; Charles EK. McLenegan, librarian 
of the Milwaukee Public Library; Walter R. Nursey, inspector of 
public libraries of the Province of Ontario; Prof. George M. Forbes, of 
Rochester University, and others prominent in the work. 
The library associations of Illinois and Missouri held a joint con- 
ference at St. Louis, October 24-26, 1912. Library legislation, work 
among children, and work of the municipal reference libraries were 
among the subjects considered. Among the speakers were Prof. 
John Livingston Lowes, of Washington University; Percival Chubb, 
of St. Louis; and Henry E. Legler, of Chicago, president of the 
American Library Association: 
In addition to the above meetings, conferences have been held by 
over 30 of the various State library associations. Among those of 
particular importance may be mentioned those in Pennsylvania, Ohio, 
Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, California, and of the Pacific- 
Northwest Library Association, at Tacoma.

REPORT ON EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
Bureau or Epvucation, Atasxa Division, 
Washington, February 1, 1913. 
Sir: I have the honor to submit the annual report of the Alaska 
division of the Bureau of Education for the year ended June 30, 1912. 
During this period the field force of the Alaska school service con- 
sisted of 4 district superintendents of schools, 1 assistant superin- 
tendent, 108 teachers, 8 physicians (1 of whom also filled another 
position), 8 nurses, 2 contract physicians, and 3 hospital attendants. 
Eighty public schools were maintained, with an enrollment of 4,018 
pupils, and an average attendance of 1,805. 
METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION. 
The regulations governing the Alaska school service permit the 
greatest freedom of action on the part of the local employees that is 
consistent with the ultimate responsibility of the Commissioner of 
Education. - Each of the four school districts is under the immediate 
charge of a district superintendent who has almost absolute control 
of the work of the Bureau of Education in his district, and he in turn 
delegates to the teachers the greatest possible freedom of action in the 
local affairs of the schools. At the beginning of each fiscal year. the 
Commissioner of Education distributes to the purchasing agent in 
Seattle and to the district superintendents, from the appropriation 
made by Congress for education in Alaska, definite sums for the pur- 
chase of supplies, furniture, equipment, and fuel, for the payment of 
rental, for furnishing medical relief to the natives, for the relief of 
destitute natives, and for the payment of traveling expenses. In like 
manner, from the authorizations received by them from the Commis- 
sioner of Education, the district superintendents distribute to the 
teachers, physicians, and nurses in their districts “subauthoriza- 
tions” to enable them to make expenditures for local needs. Except 
in grave emergency, no expenditure is permissible unless it is covered 
by an authorization or by a subauthorization. By this method of

-P-A-G-E-434
  408 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
distributing funds each superintendent and teacher is enabled to 
meet, within the limit of expenditure authorized, every need of the 
service as it arises. 
MEDICAL WORK. 
Without neglecting the work in the schoolrooms and the sanitary 
work in the villages, special attention has been given during the year 
to medical work among the natives. Realizing the absolute neces- 
sity for checking disease among the natives of Alaska, $25,144.50 of 
the appropriation for education in Alaska was used (1) in maintaining 
hospitals in rented buildings at Juneau and Nushagak; (2) in pay- 
ments under contracts with the Holy Cross Hospital at Nome and the 
Fairhaven Hospital at Candle for the treatment of diseased natives, 
upon the application of a superintendent, physician, or teacher in the 
Alaska school service; (3) in the employment of 7 physicians in hospi- 
tal work and in checking disease among the natives in their respective 
districts; (4) in the employment of 8 nurses in the hospitals and in 
hygienic and sanitary work in the native schoois and villages; and (5) 
in furnishing medical chests to the teachers to enable them to treat 
minor ailments. 
During the autumn of 1911 quarantine maintained at the mouth 
of the Porcupine River by Mr. George E. Boulter, superintendent of 
schools in the upper Yukon district, and by Dr. Grafton Burke, 
medical missionary of the Protestant Episcopal Church at Fort 
Yukon, who was temporarily employed by the Bureau of Education, 
was an important factor in preventing smallpox from entering the 
Yukon Valley by way of the Porcupine. 
COOPERATION BY PUBLIC HEALTH SERVIOE. 
During the summer of 1911 Passed Asst. Surg. Milton H. Foster, 
of the Public Health Service, made a preliminary investigation of 
health conditions among the natives of southern Alaska with a view 
to inaugurating adequate measures for their relief. One of Dr. 
Foster’s recommendations was the extension of the medical work in 
connection with the Alaska school service. In pursuance of this 
recommendation and in order that the entire medical work among 
the natives of Alaska might have expert supervision, upon the request 
of the Secretary of the Interior, the Surgeon General of the Public 
Health Service, in March, 1912, detailed Passed Asst. Surg. Emil 
Krulish for service in Alaska for an indefinite period under the 
direction of the Commissioner of Education. With the consent of 
the Secretary of the Treasury, the duties of Dr. Krulish for the 
Bureau of Education will be (a) to supervise all measures for the 
medical and surgical relief of the natives of Alaska, (b) to act as 
instructor to the teachers of the United States public schools in|
-P-A-G-E-435
EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 409 
Alaska in all matters pertaining to the sanitary education of the 
natives, (c) to give instructions to teachers in first aid to the injured 
or sick, and (d) to act in a general advisory capacity to the superin- 
tendent of education of natives of Alaska in all matters pertaining to 
sanitation, hygiene, maintenance of hospitals, and other matters of 
like character. The plans for the work of Dr. Krulish in Alaska 
include prescribing and enforcing regulations for checking disease in 
the native villages. 
THE HYDABURG VILLAGE. 
For several years there existed a desire among the members of the 
Hydah Tribe living in the villages of Klinquan and Howkan, in south- 
eastern Alaska, to migrate to a site advantageously situated with 
regard to fishing and hunting grounds and running water, where they 
could found an exclusively native village and build up industries owned 
and operated by the natives themselves. During September, 1911, 
these natives moved to the selected site, on the west shore of Prince 
of Wales Island, where they founded, a village, which they named 
Hydaburg. A United States public school was at once established 
for their benefit. By Executive Order a tract of approximately 12 
square miles was reserved for the use of this colony and such of the 
natives of Alaska as may settle within the limits of the reservation. 
Under the supervision of the teacher of the United States public school, 
the Hydaburg Trading Co. was organized to transact the mercantile 
business of the settlement and the Hydaburg Lumber Co. was organ- 
ized to operate a sawmill, The natives were aided by the Bureau 
of Education in equipping the mill. A careful examination of the 
affairs of the two companies in December, 1912, by the supply agent 
of the Alaska division, detailed from Seattle for the purpose, showed 
that these native enterprises had been eminently successful. It was 
found possible for the directors of the Hydaburg Trading Co. to declare 
a cash dividend of 50 per cent and still have funds available toward 
the erection and equipment of a larger store building. The sawmill 
had provided the lumber used in building the homes for the natives, 
and had also furnished acceptable lumber to a number of the neigh- 
boring canneries. 
THE ERUPTION OF KATMAI VOLCANO. 
On June 6, 1912, Mount Katmai, a supposedly extinct volcano in 
southwestern Alaska, burst into eruption. For two days and nights _ 
arain of ashes fell; the darkness was illumined by occasional flashes 
of lightning; the air was charged with suffocating gases; fre- 
quent earthquake shocks were felt. An extensive region was buried 
deep in volcanic matter. The eruption caused no loss of life, but 
destroyed the houses of the natives living on the coast adjacent to  
-P-A-G-E-436
  410 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
the volcano and rendered necessary the distribution of food to the 
people in the stricken district, for the gardens were deeply covered 
and the salmon streams were choked with ashes. All employees of 
the Government in the region affected by the eruption cooperated 
with the Revenue-Cutter Service in rendering relief. Capt. K. W. 
Perry, commanding the revenue cutter Manning, conveyed 98 
natives, whose homes had been destroyed, to a site on the Alaska 
peninsula which had been selected for their new home. Here the 
two teachers from the United States public schools at Seldovia and 
Tatitlek supervised the erection of the new village, to which the name 
of Perry was given. The materials for the construction of 21 houses, 
to shelter these destitute natives, and the most necessary articles for 
their use were sent to them from Seattle. 
JUNEAU CONFERENCE. 
A conference of the teachers of the schools in southeastern Alaska 
and native delegates representing 9 of the largest villages was held 
in Juneau from October 28 to November 2, under the direction of the 
district superintendent. The morning sessions were for teachers 
only, and consideration was given to the various phases of the 
teachers’ work. The afternoon sessions were devoted to discussions 
of the social and economic problems confronting the natives. The 
native delegates expressed themselves clearly and forcibly in regard 
to those problems. Resolutions urging extension of the medical 
work among the natives, assistance to the natives in the establish- 
ment of industrial enterprises, and legislation granting citizenship 
to duly qualified natives were adopted by the conference. 
RECOMMENDATIONS. 
I can not urge too strongly the importance of the appropriation by 
Congress of funds to enable the Bureau of Education to make ade- 
quate provision for the medical and sanitary relief of the natives of 
Alaska. The use for this purpose of part of the appropriation for the 
education of the natives is an emergency measure dictated by the 
absolute necessity for action. The entire appropriation is urgently 
needed for the support of the schools and to promote the industrial 
development of the native population. Under a decision of the comp- 
troller this appropriation can not be used in erecting hospitals. 
I repeat my recommendation for the passage of a compulsory 
school attendance law, which is especially needed in native villages 
adjacent to the large towns. It is greatly to be desired that the com- 
pulsory school attendance bill which was passed by the Senate at the 
last session, but not acted upon by the House, should become a law. 
I again invite attention to the fact that the Bureau of Education 
should own and maintain a seagoing vessel in which to transport
-P-A-G-E-437
  
EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 411 
teachers, building materials, and school supplies from Seattle to the 
schools on the shores of Bering Sea and the Arctic Ocean. Such a 
vessel would in a few years save freight charges equivalent to its 
original cost; it would enable the district superintendents and physi- 
cians to inspect thoroughly the remote Arctic villages, and furnish 
means of instructing in seamanship the natives along that coast.

THE ALASKA REINDEER SERVICE. 
The reports from the reindeer stations for the fiscal year ended 
June 30, 1912, show a total of 38,476 reindeer, distributed among 54 
herds. Of the 38,476 reindeer, 24,068, or 62.5 per cent, are owned 
by 633 natives; 3,776, or 9.8 per cent, are owned by the United States; 
4,511, or 11.7 per cent, are owned by missions; and 6,121, or 16 per 
cent, are owned by Lapps. 
At an average value of $25 per head, the 24,068 reindeer owned by 
- the natives represent a capital of $601,700. The total income of the 
natives from the reindeer industry during said fiscal year, exclusive 
of the value of meat and hides used by the natives themselves, was 
$44,885.04. 
The reindeer industry affects the entire coastal region from Point 
Barrow to the Alaska Peninsula—a region approximating in length 
the distance from Maine to South Carolina. A line connecting the 
54 herds would be more than 5,000 miles in length. 
There are 633 native owners of reindeer, whose immediate families 
number approximately 2,500; in addition, approximately 4,000 na- 
tives are affected by the reindeer enterprise, obtaining reindeer prod- 
ucts in exchange for their own wares. Accordingly, the total number 
of natives affected by the reindeer enterprise may be estimated to be 
about 6,500. Attention is especially invited to the statements in- 
cluded in Tables 9 and 10, which set forth the cost and results of the 
introduction of reindcer among the natives of Alaska. 
There yet remain to be reached by the reindeer industry in Alaska 
the upper Kuskokwim and the Copper River regions and the coast 
east of Point Barrow; also Nunivak, Kodiak, and the Aleutian 
Islands. The establishment of herds in these regions will complete 
the means for gradually stocking with reindeer all of the untimbered 
regions of Alaska adapted for that industry. 
During August, 1911, 40 reindeer from the herd at Unalakleet were 
delivered to the Department of Commerce and Labor, 25 were placed 
on St. Paul Island and 15 on St. George Island. In June, 1912, the 
reindeer on St. Paul Island had increased to 40 and those on St. 
George to 25. :

In December, 1905, the herd at Nulato was transferred to the 
Roman Catholic mission at Koserefsky, and in 1908 from Koserefsky 
to Mountain Village, where it was cared for temporarily by the Gov- 
ernment in connection with the Government herd at that station. 
In December, 1911, the herd was returned to Koserefsky from 
Mountain Village. 
All of which is respectfully submitted.

INDIAN EDUCATION. 
Its Development and Present Status. 
Prepared under the direction of F. H. Abbott, Acting Commissioner of Indian Affairs. 
  
IN THE BEGINNING. 
The beginning of the education of the American Indian dates back 
many years before the War of the Revolution. Roman Catholic mis- 
sionaries accompanied the expedition of Narvaez to Florida early 
in the sixteenth century, and in 1567 the education of the Florida 
Indians was undertaken by the Jesuits. The educational work of 
the missions was chiefly along the lines of industrial and domestic 
progress, as well as in architecture and various kinds of artistic 
handicraft. They introduced foreign plants, including wheat, 
peaches, and grapes, and educated the Indians in their cultivation 
and uses. Early French Catholic missions were established among 
the Abnaki in Maine, the Hurons in Michigan and Ohio, the Iro- 
quois in New York, and the Ottawas in Wisconsin. 
The first English settlers gave evidence of a desire for some kind 
of education of the savages who surrounded them, as was evidenced 
in the resolution passed by the council at Jamestown, Va., in 1610, 
to give an education to Indian children in religion, civics, and some; 
useful trade. The superintendent of Henrico College, in 1621, gave 
a brief account of his labors in this regard. 
A notable attempt to educate Indian young people was made at the 
College of William and Mary, in Virginia. On conditions specified 
by one of the contributors to the support of that institution, which] 
was founded in 1691, Indians were maintained there. 
Even before that time, however, reasonably successful attemp 
had also been made to educate the Indian. Remarkable pioneer wor! 
was done by the Rev. John Eliot, who familiarized himself with th 
language, disposition, and character of the Indians in Massachusetts    
    
          
     
     
    
      
  
-P-A-G-E-447
INDIAN EDUCATION. 421 
He secured their confidence and respect and stimulated in their hearts 
reverence and a sincere desire for industry and thrift, godliness and 
purity of life of which New England communities afforded an 
example. Those who would follow him were gathered into towns, 
where he taught them the liberties and responsibilities of township 
government and the devices and institutions of civilized life, among 
which the church and school naturally occupied places of honor. 
A number of Indian youths were induced to attend English schools 
to prepare themselves for missionary work among their own people. 
Mr. Eliot was warmly supported in his work by both church and 
civil authorities. His work began in 1646, and in 1674 there were 
14 towns of “ praying Indians,” whose schools and churches in the 
majority of instances were administered by educated natives. At the 
same time an Indian college had been founded at Cambridge. Yet 
this success was swept away by the fears and prejudices which 
developed under the baneful influences of the Indian wars. 
Other efforts in the eighteenth century to civilize the Indian were 
robbed of their fruits by similar causes, intensified by a number of 
disorganizing factors incident to the revolutionary period. Promi- 
nent among these efforts was the work of Rev. John Sergeant, at 
Stockbridge, in Massachusetts, and that of Rev. Eleazer Wheelock, 
in Connecticut and New Hampshire. 
The work of Mr. Sergeant, involving the establishment of day 
schools, a boarding school, and an experimental “ outing system,” was 
almost ideal in conception, but it ended with the deportation of the 
Indians to the west. Dr. Wheelock’s efforts led to the establishment 
of an effective training school and, indirectly, to the creation of 
Dartmouth College “for the education and instruction of youths of 
the Indian tribes in this land in reading, writing, and all parts of 
learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing 
and Christianizing the children of pagans, as well as in all liberal 
arts and sciences, and also of English youths and any others.” Only 
the last purpose became a reality. 
BEGINNING OF GOVERNMENTAL INDIAN EDUCATION. 
The government of the confederacy, as well as individual citizens, 
made efforts before the Revolution to give the Indians the benefit of 
education. The first effort of this kind was made by the Continental 
Congress on July 12, 1775, when it passed a bill appropriating $500 
for the education of Indian youths at Dartmouth College, New 
Hampshire. On February 5, 1776, the Committee on Indian Affairs 
of the Continental Congress asked that body to request the Com-
-P-A-G-E-448
    422 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
missioners of Indian Affairs to “consider of proper places in their 
respective departments for the residence of ministers and school- 
masters, and report the same to Congress.” This request was 
prompted by the consideration, as expressed by its Committee on 
Indian Affairs— : 
That a friendly commerce between the people of the United Colonies 
and the Indians and the propagation of the Gospel, and the cultivation 
of the civil arts among the latter, might produce many and estimable 
advantages to both the United Colonies and the Indians. 
However, there is no record that this report was made to Congress. 
After the Revolution the attention of the people was again at- 
tracted to the Indian, and on December 2, 1794, the first Indian treaty 
in which anything pertaining to education appeared was made with 
the Oneida, Tuscarora, and Stockbridge Indians, “who had faith- 
fully adhered to the United States and assisted them with their war- 
riors ” during the Revolution. This treaty provided that the United 
States should employ one or two persons to manage and keep in re- 
pair certain mills which were to be built for the Indians, and “ to 
instruct some young men of the three nations in the arts of the miller 
and sawyer.” The second treaty made with the Indians in which 
education was referred to was with the Kaskaskia Tribe, of Illinois, 
at Vincennes, Indiana Territory, on August 13, 1803. 
FIRST CONGRESSIONAL APPROPRIATION FOR INDIAN EDUCATION. 
Up to the time of the Kaskaskia treaty it appears that the treaty- 
making officers of the United States did not believe that there was 
any necessity for the education of Indians; this need was not fully 
recognized until some years later. It was not until 1819 that further 
action was taken indicating the belief that the privileges of educa- 
tion should be extended to the Indians. In that year a law was 
enacted authorizing the President to employ capable persons to in- 
struct Indians in agriculture and to educate their children in read- 
ing, writing, and arithmetic, and appropriating $10,000 for the pur- 
pose. In 1820 the President was authorized to apply $10,000 an- 
nually in the aid of societies and individuals engaged in the educa- 
tion of Indians. In 1823 the sum of $80,000 was expended in the 
education of the Indiahs, of which amount $12,000 had been con- 
tributed by the Government. In 1825 the amount expended had in- 
creased to $202,000, of which the Government contributed $25,000. 
In 1848 there were reported in operation 16 manual-labor schools, 
87 boarding schools and other schools. These schools continued to 
increase in number and efliciency up to 1873. They were under the
-P-A-G-E-449
INDIAN EDUCATION. 423 
control of missionary bedies with such scanty aid from the Govern- 
ment as the small appropriations afforded. 
GOVERNMENTAL EDUCATION TAKES ON NEW LIFE. 
In 1876 the sum of $20,000 was appropriated “ for the support of 
industrial schools, and other educational purposes, for the Indian 
tribes.” This appears to have been the beginning of a new effort 
by the Government to’educate the children of Indians living under 
its jurisdiction, for after that year it entered upon an era of almost 
feverish activity in the establishment of strictly Government Indian 
schools—first day schools, then boarding schools and industrial train- 
ing schools. Congress kept pace with this zeal in the liberality of 
its appropriations. In 1877 it appropriated for schools, outside of 
treaty provisions, $20,000; in 1880, $75,000; in 1885, $992,800; in 
1890, $1,364,568; in 1895, $2,060,695; and in 1899, $2,638,390. Dur- 
ing this period the average attendance rose from 3,598 in 1877 to 
+ 19,648 in 1898. The sum of $3,757,495 was appropriated by the 
Government during the fiscal year 1912 for educational purposes, the 
enrollment in all Government schools reaching 25,187. 
With the increased appropriations by Congress for the education 
of Indians came the policy forbidding the appropriation of public 
funds for denominational purposes. However, many denominations 
continued and are continuing their schools for the education of the 
Indian. 
In 1881 the sum of $1,000 was appropriated for the establishment 
of Carlisle School, which had been founded in 1879 when Capt. 
R. H. Pratt, of the United States Army, brought a number of Indian 
prisoners of war from Florida for the purpose of giving them edu- 
cational advantages. This was the first nonreservation Indian school. 
Since 1881 the Federal Government has maintained three kinds 
of schools for the education of its Indian wards, and it may be well 
to describe them briefly. 
KINDS OF INDIAN SCHOOLS MAINTAINED BY THE GOVERNMENT. 
Day schools are located in Indian villages or near Indian camps 
and settlements. The instruction in these schools is of the simplest 
character. The children are taught to speak, read, and write Eng- 
lish; to cipher, to draw, and to sing. In a large number of day 
schools the boys receive instruction in gardening and in the use of 
the tools and implements that are always needed around the home. 
The girls are taught to sew, launder, and cook. Day schools, as a 
rule, in addition to the conventional schoolroom work, achieve much 
in encouraging better ways of living and they are valuable factors

in uplifting the race. They reconcile the Indian to the idea of send- 
ing his children to school and render him more willing in due time 
to intrust them to the care of boarding schools as well as more ready 
to appreciate and to accept the lessons of civilization. These schools 
are social centers as well as educational centers in Indian settlements. 
Reservation boarding schools are located within the territory re- 
served for some tribe or tribes of Indians. Each one is in charge of 
a superintendent. In addition to the conventional instruction, the 
girls receive training in domestic work and the boys are trained in 
industrial work, such as farming, painting, harnessmaking, shoe- 
making, carpentering, dairying, etc. In 1894 kindergarten methods 
were introduced in these schools as well as in some of the day schools 
with good results. 
Experience has taught that the half-day instruction method is one 
of wisdom and prudence. Confinement all day in the classroom is 
hard upon people who have been used to roaming at will over the 
plains; the interests of the schoolroom are foreign to their heredity 
and traditions. Therefore, the plan of spending half the day in the 
classroom and the other half in the industrial departments or on the 
farm has worked beneficially. The industrial features of the work 
appeal-more or less to the Indian tastes, and they stimulate interest 
in the parents as well as in the pupils. In the classroom; too, the 
industrial subjects furnish material for practice and discussion that 
is welcomed by the pupil. It is thus easier to overcome aversion and 
to secure an appreciative and sympathetic attitude on the part of the 
children. It has been conclusively demonstrated that where the half- 
day practice has not been put into use the pupils make less progress, 
are backward in physical and intellectual development, and are 
morally less earnest and responsible than the children in the schools 
conducted on the half-day plan. 
These boarding schools are not only places for formal instruction, 
but they are the pupils’ homes as well. The institution gives them 
food, clothing, and shelter; it accustoms them to habits of cleanliness 
and decency; it develops their better nature; it labors to secure right 
moral attitude, and gives opportunity for the missionaries of the 
several churches to impart the truths of Christianity and to stimulate 
the religious life of the children. 
Nonreservation boarding schools.—At present 23 such institutions . 
are conducted by the Government. The pupils at these schools are 
as a rule more advanced in years than those at reservation schools. 
Usually they have had some training in reservation day and boarding 
schools. The minimum age limit for enrollment in nonreservation

schools is 14 years, and the children must have had enough previous 
training, in most cases, to take them as far as the second grade. 
The classroom work is more thorough and more extended, and 
reaches far into the advanced grammar-school course of study, laying 
special stress upon language practice, arithmetic, geography, history, 
nature study, drawing, music, and Civil government. The facilities 
fer training in the domestic and industrial arts are much greater 
than in the reservation schools, and the effectiveness of the instruc- 
tion in these subjects is much enhanced by the fact that pupils have 
frequent opportunity to observe the practical application and the 
value of these arts in the environment of the schools. 
The instruction imparted enables the boys to go out and earn good 
salaries as mechanics, and the girls to become good housekeepers and 
helpful wives. Several of the larger nonreservation schools have 
added business and agricultural departments. The latter are par- 
ticularly important, since the majority of Indians are landowners. 
OTHER SCHOOLS EDUCATING INDIANS, 
Contract schools—In addition to maintaining these strictly Gov- 
ernment schools, the Indian Office contracts each year with certain 
mission schools for the education of a number of Indian children. 
Until June 30, 1912, Congress appropriated money for the edu- 
cation of 120 Indian children at the Hampton Institute, in Virginia. 
The outing system was originated at Hampton and has grown to be 
an educational factor of vast importance at Carlisle. In 1912 Con- 
gress withdrew its annual appropriation for the education of Indians 
at Hampton. 
THE SCHOOLS OF THE FIVE CIVILIZED TRIBES. 
These schools are located in the territory of the Five Civilized 
Tribes, in Oklahoma (formerly Indian Territory). At the present 
time the administration of school matters in this territory differs 
but little, if at all, from that of the Indian schools in other sections 
of the country. 
NEED OF SCHOOLS AMONG THE NAVAJOS AND PAPAGOS. 
Although schools have reached nearly every tribe of Indians in 
the United States, there still remain two tribes of Indians—the 
Navajo and Papago—that are sadly in need of school facilities. 
Several schools have been established among them, but they are 
entirely inadequate to meet the demands. It is estimated, after care- 
ful investigation, that there are more than 5,000 Navajo children 
who have no school facilities. The Navajo and Papago tribes ave

independent people, making their own living without outside aid. 
Sheep raising and goat raising are their most important industry, 
and the women and children as a rule take care of the flocks, 
LATER PROGRESS OF INDIAN EDUCATION. 
An effort has been made, by the establishment of supervisor’s dis- 
tricts under competent supervisors making frequent inspections and 
reporting to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, to do work essen- 
tially constructive in character. 
The sanitary regulations of the schools have been carefully revised, 
In addition to inspections made by school and agency physicians, 
traveling specialists have made examinations and have given treat- 
ment for trachoma. Victims of this disease and of tuberculosis have 
been segregated. Sanatoriums for the treatment of pupils afflicted 
with tuberculosis have been established. Outdoor sleeping porches 
have been provided for suspected cases, and everything practicable . 
done to protect healthy children from contagious diseases and to cure 
those afflicted. Regulations governing the number of cubic feet of 
air space in dormitories of boarding schools have been promulgated, 
requiring from 400 to 500 cubic feet for each child. 
A campaign for more physical training in Indian schools, through 
playgrounds and wholesome outdoor games and sports, has been 
instituted. 
A serious effort has been made to eliminate from Government 
schools children who are ineligible and those who do not need Goy- 
ernment aid, and an effort has been made to enroll Indian children 
in public schools where facilities are adequate and the home condi- 
tions of the Indian children satisfactory. Particularly has such effort 
been made among the children of the Five Civilized Tribes. Arrange- 
ments have been made to transfer children from one reservation 
school to another when the home boarding school is filled and the 
transfer to a nonreservation boarding school is impracticable. The 
importance of teaching English has been emphasized. Steps have 
been taken to improve the Indian home by giving girls at boarding 
schools special training in domestic and household duties. 
To show the present status of Indian education, tables are pre- 
sented below showing (1) capacity, enrollment, and average attend- 
ance of Government Indian schools for the fiscal year ending June 
80, 1912; (2) enrollment of Indian pupils by States in mission, pri- 
vate, and public schools, and the number of eligible children not in

EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, 1910-1912. 
Based upon annual reports of Frank R. White, director of education for the Philippine Islands, 
The report of the director of education for the year 1910-11 shows 
that the annual enrollment reached 610,493, as against 587,317 for 
the preceding year. The highest monthly enrollment was 484,689, 
as against 451,938 the previous year. 
The average daily attendance for the highest month was 395,537, 
an increase of 31,489 over that of the same month of the preceding 
year. 
The total number of scnools in operation was 4,404, and American 
and Filipino teachers on duty at the close of the year numbered 
9,086, with a total estimated school population for the islands of 
1,215,000. The director recommends a limitation of the enrollment 
and a substantial increase in the percentage of daily attendance. An 
example is given of one Province with a waiting list of 4,000 pupils 
desiring to be enrolled, but this Province reported an actual daily 
attendance of 80 per cent, which was 5 per cent higher than the 
general average for the islands. 
The report of the director for 1911-12 shows that in all lines of 
school activities the results during the year were very encouraging. 
A determined effort has been made to improve the quality of Eng- 
lish taught in all the schools, whether of primary, intermediate, or 
secondary grade, and progress in this respect has been marked. In- 
dustrial instruction has been organized and developed to a greater 
extent, perhaps, than in any previous year. A large number of 
permanent school buildings have been completed. The policy of 
acquiring ®adequate school sites has found general acceptance and 
much attention has been given to the improvement of temporary
-P-A-G-E-455
  
EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS. 429 
buildings. Through its publications, through personal contact, and 
particularly through the vacation assembly at Baguio, the Philip- 
pine Bureau of Education has come into closer sympathy with the 
vast majority of its teachers than ever before. A decided improve- 
ment is to be reported in the personnel of the teaching force, both 
American and Filipino. A great deal of attention has been given to 
the improvement of office methods, and as a result the administrative 
work of the Bureau of Education is now handled with greatly in- 
creased efficiency. 
There has been some decrease in the total number of pupils en- 
rolled in the public schools, the annual enrollment for the school 
year 1911-12 being 529,665, as against 610,493 for the school year 
1910-11. The average daily attendance for the year 1911-12, how- 
ever, was 329,073, as against 355,722 for the previous year. The per- 
centage of attendance was 83 per cent, as against 80 per cent for the 
previous year. It will be seen, therefore, that although the total 
enrollment was reduced by about 81,000, the average daily attend- 
ance suffered a decrease of approximately only 26,000. This in- 
crease of 3 per cent in the average daily attendance indicates that 
more really effective work was done during the past year. 
The decrease in enrollment and attendance was anticipated, and 
is due to a number of causes. In many towns the balances in the 
municipal treasuries have been exhausted and there are no funds to 
pay for suitable permanent buildings. Another cause that has 
operated to decrease the attendance is the increased salaries paid 
Filipino teachers. This additional expense could be met only by 
reducing the number of teachers.. There is nothing discouraging in 
the decrease, therefore; the loss is more apparent than real. Until 
additional funds are placed at the disposition of the bureau, there 
can be no further expansion of educational work. The hope of con- 
tinued improvement lies in securing the greatest possible regularity 
of attendance. 
AMERICAN TEACHERS, 
Approval was secured for the temporary detail of an agent to be 
on duty in the United States as representative of the director in the 
selection of new teachers. 
Each of the 118 new teachers who arrived during the months of 
April, May, and June of this year had been interviewed by this 
representative, and the selections were made only after careful con- 
sideration of the merits of all certified applicants. The following 
table, indicating the academic preparation and experience of these 
appointees, is of interest.

The plan of bringing new teachers from the United States to 
Baguio for a course of instruction intended to prepare them for 
immediate and better service in their various assignments is a new 
departure.’ The venture was made this year with a class of 16 
teachers who reached the islands about the opening of the assembly 
season. The climate of Baguio, the summer capital, is delightful, 
and not only do new teachers receive first impressions that are very 
agreeable in the associations formed during this summer school, but 
the general health of the new teachers is better because of this 
gradual climatic change from the Temperate Zone to the Tropical. 
   
-P-A-G-E-457
  EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS. 431 
Those new teachers who arrived later in the vacation period were 
given a brief course of lectures in Manila prior to assignment, with a 
view to acquainting them in some measure with Philippine conditions. 
There are 40 men now serving as division superintendents, 27 of 
whom have been with the department since 1901. 
The director mentions the death of Mr. T. W. Thompson, division 
superintendent of the Province of Pampanga, and gives a brief ac- 
count of his long and faithful service in the bureau. 
FILIPINO TEACHERS. 
The total number of Filipino teachers on duty at the close of the 
school year 1911-12 was 7,699, of whom 1,066 received salary from 
insular funds, 6,488 from municipal funds, and 145 were apprentices 
without salary. With few exceptions all primary instruction is now 
handled by Filipino teachers, and a large proportion of the inter- 
mediate classes have also been turned over to them. Increasing num- 
bers are engaged in secondary instruction, and 161 have been assigned 
to positions as supervising and assistant supervising teachers. From 
the first it has been the policy of the Philippine Bureau of Educa- 
tion to place upon the Filipino teachers as great responsibilities as 
they are capable of assuming. The constant increase in the number 
assigned to the more important work is evidence that this policy has 
not been without favorable results. 
Some mention has already been made of the increase in the salaries 
of Filipino teachers, and it will be noted that a part of this increase 
has been at the expense of attendance. Very little more can be done 
to relieve this situation until more money is placed at the disposition 
of the Philippine Bureau of Education; otherwise it would be neces- 
sary either to curtail school activities further or to reduce again the 
number of teachers. Neither of these alternatives the Philippine 
Bureau of Education can properly consider. It is fortunate for the 
educational work of the islands that young men and women are 
willing to devote themselves to the profession of teaching at lower 
rates of compensation than they would receive in private business or 
in other bureaus of the Government. This does not, however, lessen 
in any degree the duty of legislators to provide more generously for 
teachers who are giving their services freely and unselfishly to the 
cause of education in their native land. 
The total number of Filipino teachers shows a decrease of 704 over 
the report for the preceding year, but an increase of 12 in the num- 
ber of teachers receiving salary from insular funds. The decrease 
was due to the dropping of apprentice teachers and the closing of 
some barrio schools. Raising the standards has also had a tendency  
-P-A-G-E-458
  
432 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
to decrease the number, but has increased the efficiency very ma- 
terially. 
One hundred and forty-eight Filipinos were employed as super- 
visors and assistant supervisors during the school year 1910-11. 
The salaries reported for 1910-11 were low. The general average for 
the islands for municipal teachers was $9.29, an increase of only 15 
cents over the year preceding, while some Provinces reported as 
low an average as $5.80, and the much-needed legislation recom- 
mended in 1911 does not seem to have been acted upon. 
OFYVICE ORGANIZATION. 
The general office of the Philippine Bureau of Education consists 
of 5 division chiefs, 16 American stenographers and clerks, 7 Ameri- 
cans detailed to inspection duty in connection with the industrial 
division, and 79 Filipino stenographers, clerks, and messengers; mak- 
ing a total of 108 for the year 1910-11. On November 21, 1911, the 
correspondence study department, which was formerly operated in 
connection with the Philippine Normal School, was made a part of 
the general office, increasing the general office force to 24 American 
clerks and stenographers and 118 Filipino clerks and messengers. 
Much attention has been given to systematizing the work, both in the 
general and division offices, thus bringing the division offices in the 
Provinces into much closer harmony with the general office. Many 
of the old forms were changed and new ones introduced, particularly 
with respect to the handling of Government property and fixing the 
status of Filipino municipal teachers. 
The volume of business handled by the general office in 1910-11 
was double that of the two years previous, and a further increase is 
reported for this year. 
The accounting division shows that $2,477,216 was made available 
by 11 different acts of the legislature. There is also a reimbursable 
property fund of $250,000 that takes into account all sales of books, 
supplies, losses paid, etc. The total value of the equipment on hand 
in Manila and the Provinces amounts to $1,183,240. 
REVISION OF THE COURSES OF STUDY. 
The course of study adopted in 1904 had been subjected to many 
changes to meet altered conditions, especially in industrial education. 
The necessity for a complete revision was recognized by the bureau, 
and Circular No. 2s, 1912, gives a list of the committees appointed 
to revise the different courses. These committees collected informa- 
tion from every part of the islands, and submitted reports that were
-P-A-G-E-459
  EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS. 433 
partially adopted, except that some changes could not be put into 
effect immediately because the textbooks for 1912 and 1913 had al- 
ready been purchased. 
The caurse for primary and intermediate school shops was adopted 
July 22, 1912. This course is made a part of the other courses. It is 
compulsory, and before pupils can be promoted from the interme- 
diate grades they must comply with the requirements in shopwork 
for the intermediate grades. Furthermore, no substitution of time 
spent in the primary grades can be allowed. 
Circular No. 97 outlines the courses in detgil, and also gives the 
number of shops as 236, with an attendance of 10,356 pupils and 
only 203 shop teachers. The value of the articles mani amounted 
to $10,265.31. This does not include the value of articles made by 
the students out of school hours. Conditions that make for efficiency 
in shopwork are named as follows: “A trained shop teacher; an 
adequate supply of tools; a sufficient supply of materials; a sufficient 
number of pupils; proper housing of shop; ample bench accommoda- 
tion for each pupil; the choice and execution of a definite course; 
the continued use in the shop of the English related to shopwork; 
and the proper keeping of records.” The adoption of this revised 
course has had a beneficial effect upon the work, as municipalities 
had to provide shops and equipment for this required work or the 
regular course would be of no value to them. The financial condi- 
tion of some Provinces makes it difficult to conform to this part of 
the revised course of study, and very little insular aid is given for 
manual training or shops. 
No change has been made in the hours or sessions, but the two- 
sessions-a-day plan is recommended. 
Special courses are to be given along six different lines as follows: 
General course; course for teaching; course in farming; trade course; 
courses in housekeeping and household arts; and the course for busi- 
ness. Each intermediate school must select one or more of the 
special courses. 
_Of the total annual enrollment of 610,493 pupils, 582,115 are in 
the primary classes (first four grades), 24,947 in intermediate classes, 
and 8,404 in secondary courses. The average pupil goes no higher 
than the primary course. For like reasons special courses are intro- 
duced into the fifth grade, and the elementary course is made as rich 
as possible in its provision for practical instruction. Only 1 in every 
200 pupils enrolled in the public schools of the Philippine Islands 
passes beyond the intermediate grades. 4 
For the present school year no material changes have been made 
in the course of study, nor are any further changes contemplated at 
this time.
-P-A-G-E-460

The new revised high-school course will stand as follows: First 
year—algebra, English, composition, general history; second year— 
plane geometry, English, physical geography, government, general 
history, United States history; third year—review arithmetic, Eng- 
lish, biology (double period), Colonial history, commercial geog-

THE PHILIPPINES AND OTHER TROPICAL COUNTRIES. 
During the past year the director of education of the Philippines 
has been in correspondence with the school authorities of a number 
of other countries, particularly those located in the Tropics and enjoy- 
ing practically the same conditions as obtain in these islands. Let- 
ters requesting information on 13 topics were sent out to about 70 
countries, from nearly two-thirds of which replies have been received. 
A careful review of the correspondence shows that it is the aim of 
nearly every one of these countries to make education general, but 
as a rule the percentage of population attending school is much lower 
than in the Philippines. In very few cases is special attention given 
to industrial education. The elementary schools are seldom con- 
sidered in the plan of industrial instruction, the attention gener- 
ally being confined to advanced technical and agricultural subjects. 
Much more stress is laid upon athletics and physical training in 
the Philippines than is given in other countries generally. The 
interest that the Filipino people take in public instruction is much 
greater than is apparently the case elsewhere. Reports seem to indi- 
cate that in a number of the countries at least not only a lack of 
interest but actual opposition is manifested. 
BUILDINGS AND SITES, 
Under acts 1801 and 2029 of the Philippine Legislature, each of 
which provided the sum of $500,000 for the aid of municipalities 
in constructing permanent school buildings, 135 buildings have been 
completed, of which number 83 are built in accordance with the 
standard plans of the Bureau of Education, and 173 other buildings 
are in process of construction, of which 81 lack only very little of 
completion and are already occupied. Funds provided by act No. 
1801 have been exhausted; $432,880 remains unallotted under act 
No. 2029, of which sum $57,880 is already available. The remainder 
will be available at the rate of $125,000 yearly. Acts Nos. 1954 and 
1988, each of which also appropriated the sum of $50,000 for munici- 
pal school buildings, have been used to supplement the two acts just
-P-A-G-E-461

-mentioned in provincial capitals and important centers where larger 
buildings are needed. 
For the past year a campaign has been carried on for the acquisi- 
tion of adequate school sites to provide sufficient room for the build- 
ings to be erected, for the future development of the school plant, 
for school gardening, and for suitable playgrounds. As a result of 
this campaign, the bureau now has in its possession 187 school sites 
which contain 10,000 square meters or more each, and 832 school sites 
containing at least 5,000 square meters each. It is to be regretted 
that activity in securing these sites has been limited to a very few 
Provinces. What has been accomplished in these instances indicates 
very clearly what the result will be when every Province enters upon 
an active campaign for this purpose. 
For a number of years the Philippine Bureau of Education has 
been committed to the policy of providing adequate permanent build- 
ings for the housing of the public schools as rapidly as money might 
be made available. This policy will be pushed during the coming 
year, and there is every reason to believe that a much greater advance 
will be reported than heretofore. Too often improvements have been 
made on school grounds without permanent plans, as a consequence 
of which much of the work has had to be undone within a few 
months or years. Emphasis will continue to be placed upon the adop- 
tion of permanent plans for the improvement of school grounds, and 
cleanliness of premises will be insisted upon. In all large schools 
regular inspection of buildings and grounds is required. 
The difficulty of securing good school sites is much greater in some 
Provinces than in others. The school authorities are not allowed to 
use the right of “eminent domain” to secure school sites. The 
Filipino people are, however, taking a greater interest now in secur- 
ing satisfactory sites of good size. When they more fully under- 
stand the use of the grounds for school gardens, athletics, and other 
school exercises the present difficulties will not obtain. 
INDUSTRIAL INSTRUCTION. 
The industrial program is being promoted constantly through the 
medium of provincial industrial supervisors; inspectors and in- 
structors from the traveling corps of the general office; various pub- 
lications, bulletins, and correspondence; through industrial exhibits; 
through the appointment of pensionados to receive training along 
such lines; and by means of the special courses offered in the Philip- 
pine Normal School and the Philippine School of Arts and Trades. 
Such satisfactory progress is to be reported as to convince the 
director that the methods employed are substantially correct. On 
entering the school, the pupil must immediately take up as a part of
-P-A-G-E-462
  436 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
each day’s work certain manual exercises in the nature of play work, 
which gradually lead up to the regular industrial courses provided 
in the advanced primary and in the intermediate grades. Special 
courses in farming, housekeeping and household arts, trade work, 
and business are offered for those pupils who desire to do more indus- 
trial work than that prescribed in the general intermediate course. 
These special industrial courses are replacing the general course in 
many intermediate schools, Already 41 schools are giving the farm- 
ing course, 54 are giving the housekeeping course, 35 are giving the 
irade course, 42 the teaching course, and 1 the business course, as 
compared with a total of 199 conducting the general course. 
Of the total enrollment of 235,740 boys and 138,842 girls during 
the month of February, 1912 (an average month), 216,290 boys and 
125,203 girls—91 per cent of the entire monthly enrollment—were 
doing some form of industrial work; 13,210 boys were taking manual’ 
training and trade work; 96,167 boys were engaged in school garden- 
ing and farming; 15,485 girls were also engaged in garden work; 
and 165,450 boys and 68,194 girls were taking up various lines which 
go under the general caption of minor industries. The course in 
housekeeping and household arts was followed by 79,382 girls. In 
lace-making alone 16,439 girls were receiving instruction; in em- 
broidery, 12,339; and in cooking, 4,768. There were 22,965 boys and 
7,709 girls making hats in the industrial classes, 40,264 pupils making 
mats, and 104,424 studying the art of basketry. 
From another point of view, 63,067 pupils who were engaged in 
school gardening cultivated 3,046 school gardens and 24,682 home 
gardens during the year; 1,319 pupils were enrolled in the regular 
trade-school classes; 1,263 in regular trade courses in other schools; 
and 7,360 in the shops operated in connection with provincial and 
other intermediate schools. In addition to the above, 10,356 pupils 
were taking work in 236 primary woodworking shops conducted in 
connection with municipal primary schools in all parts of the islands. 
The purpose of the industrial instruction is, of course, primarily to 
give the pupil a certain training in mind and character and to enable 
him to acquire a measure of skill in manual exercises. There are, 
however, certain tangible results and the following specific instances 
are noted as illustrating what has been accomplished: 
School boys in a hundred towns of the Philippines are wearing hats made 
by themselves. The hat exports from the Philippine Islands increased from 
621,475 in the fiscal year 1910 to 1,025,596 in the fiscal year 1911. What pro- 
portion of this increase is due to school influence can not be definitely stated, 
but the schools have had much to do with it, and the result is going to be 
far greater in the future. i 
Igorot girls weave the cloth and make the clothing which they wear in 
school.
-P-A-G-E-463
EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS. 437 
More than half of the desks and tables in the primary schools of the Philip- 
pines have been made by the pupils. 
The primary schools of Albay are able to deliver 1,000 salable baskets on a 
month’s notice. 
The industrial school at Capiz has introduced and developed the slipper- 
making industry in that community. Slippers to the estimated value of $2,000 
were sold during the year. 
Through school influence, 1,072 gardens were established during the past 
year at the homes of people in Union Province. 
In November, 1910, an inspection of Albay Province developed the fact that 
many vegetables and fruits, capable of easy production in that district, were 
very scarce or entirely unknown. After the date of the inspection, 470 school 
and home gardens were developed in the Province, with pronounced effect upon 
the food supply of the people. 
In the non-Christian Province of Bukidnon every school has 4 hectares of 
land inclosed and under cultivation. Its school farms are models of cleanli- 
ness and order, producing an abundance of rice, camotes, and other substantial 
foods, with which the people were meagerly supplied before these schools 
were established. 
The school farm at Batac, Ilocos Norte, sent to Manila, and had on exhi- 
bition throughout the week of the 1911 carnival, a crop of vegetables superior 
in size and quality to anything ever appearing in the Manila markets. 
The provincial school of Pampanga exhibited at the last carnival more than 
600 samples of jell®s, jams, and preserves made from Philippine fruits, as 
illustrative of practical school work in developing a new industry and new 
articles of diet for the Filipino home. 
These cases will serve to illustrate the sort of thing that is accom- 
plished in the industrial classes of the public schools; but, as else- 
where indicated, the highest results of industrial instruction are 
those which have to do with the molding of the character and life 
purposes of the children. 
SCHOOL OF HOUSEHOLD INDUSTRIES. 
The Philippine Legislature by act No. 2110 appropriated the sum 
of $50,000 for the establishment and maintenance of a school of 
household industries in the city of Manila. The purpose of this 
school is to train adult women in certain selected home industries. 
In five or six months of daily work in embroidery and lace making 
the persons attending this school can become very proficient. They 
will then return to their homes, or to other towns agreed upon be- 
tween themselves and the director of education, where each woman 
will be expected to establish a local class for instruction in her 
specialty. It is desired that she gather about her a group of indus- 
trious women and girls whom she will instruct along the lines of 
her training in the school of household industries. When they shall 
have become proficient she will employ them at fair wages. Doubt- 
less many of the women who receive instruction if local classes will 
be ambitious to form similar organizations on their own account, and
-P-A-G-E-464
    
438 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
in this way it is expected that an ever-widening circle of industrial 
activity will result. Through the medium of either the Bureau of 
Education or the sales agency it is intended that the Government 
shall keep in touch with these industrial centers and communicate to 
them up-to-date information relative to patterns and standards de- 
manded by the foreign market. 
No promise is exacted from these women to teach, as in the case of 
the students and teachers who are sent at Government expense to 
Manila. The Philippine Bureau of Education purposes to keep in 
close touch with all graduates from this school and at all times will 
be glad to render them any assistance possible, other than financial. 
One of the objects of the school is to establish a new standard of 
excellence for Philippine lace and embroidery, and also to give em- 
ployment to women who may work under the direction of skilled 
teachers. It is believed that by an economical subdivision of labor a 
great advantage will be obtained in the quantity of work produced. 
One Filipino woman has established such an industrial center in 
Manila and has under her direction about 800 workers. The extent 
of her work may be inferred from the fact that one order for 2,400 
shirt waists was received. This woman now has subcontractors in 
many of the different towns, and thus the work is growing rapidly. 
The demand for all work of this kind from the Philippines has 
developed at a rapid pace during the past year, and many orders can 
not be filled. The physical and mental adaptability of the Filipino 
woman to work of this sort is universally recognized, hence Filipino 
embroideries and fine lace may in a few years have as great a com- 
mercial demand and artistic value as the best hand products of the 
skilled workers of the Orient and of the leading countries of Europe. 
VARIOUS INSULAR SCHOOLS, 
The new normal school building has been completed at, an expense 
of $187,500 and contains ample room for present needs. Plans are 
under consideration, however, for new buildings devoted to some 
special lines of industrial work and also for girls’ dormitories. The 
annual enrollment reached 928. ; 
The Philippine School of Arts and Trades, under the direction of 
W. W. Marquardt, has given an excellent account of itself. Money 
has been appropriated for a much-needed new building, but the 
amount is not, considered sufficient for the floor space required. The 
large and commodious building used by the Bureau of Education for 
the carnival exhibit, February, 1912, was entirely the work of the 
trade school. 
The requirements for admission of the Philippine School of Com- 
merce have been raised to the completion of sixth grade. The enroll- 
 
-P-A-G-E-465
  
EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS. 439 
ment reached 362, as against 391 for the year 1911-12. This shows 
a comparative increase in attendance in view of the higher standard 
for admission. So great is the demand for students of this important 
school by Government bureaus and business houses that there is no 
difficulty in placing all students who have done satisfactory work. 
The result is that, very few remain in attendance to complete the four 
years’ course. The class in stenography enrolled 57 in June, 1912. 
The attendance of the school for the deaf and blind during the past 
year has been 40 pupils, gathered from 9 Provinces. 
Substantial progress is reported from all non-Christian divisions. 
The best results have been secured in developing strong schools at 
provincial capitals and other large centers, rather than increasing 
the number of small schools in the outlying districts. In the sub- 
province of Bukidnon greater results in minor agriculture have been 
accomplished than in any other district in the islands. 
ATHLETICS. 
The Athletic Handbook for the Philippine public schools outlines 
the plan of the bureau under two general heads—general school games 
and organized athletics. Athletics for every pupil are first discussed, 
then the schedule for group games, impromptu schoolyard games, 
athletic badge competition, and simple apparatus for school play- 
grounds. Under the second heading are discussed: History of school 
athletics in the Philippines, general system of organization, athletics 
within divisions, interprovincial organizations, finances, general rules 
governing meets, playing rules for (a) baseball, (6) basket ball, 
-(c) volley ball, (d) indoor baseball, (e) track and field, and (7) lawn 
tennis, hints on training, Philippine interscholastic records, trophies, 
athletic courtesy. The Filipino boys and girls enjoy most of our 
school games, but some have to be modified more or less to conform 
to climatic conditions. Baseball, volley ball, tennis, and basket ball 
are played with a spirit of enthusiasm equal to that in the United 
States. 
The athletic badge competition gives a red button or badge to 
each schoolboy under the age of 13 years who is able to make all of 
the following records: Sixty-yard: dash in 9 seconds; pull up (chin- 
ning the bar). four times; standing broad jump, 5 feet 9 inches. 
A white emblem is given to any schoolboy under 18 years of age 
who can do the following: 100-yard dash in 14 seconds; pull up 
(chinning the bar) eight times; standing broad jump, 7 feet 6 inches. 
A blue trophy is awarded to any schoolboy who can accomplish 
all of the following feats: 220-yard dash in 28 geconds; pulling up 
(chinning bar) 12 times; running high jump, 4 feet 6 inches. 
The rules of the A. A. U. govern in all contests.

The following athletic associations have been organized: The 
Southern Luzon Athletic Association, the Central Luzon, Visayan 
Interscholastic, Tocano Interscholastic, and the Southern Tagalog. 
The Bureau of Education has adopted, along with its own rules, 
the tests and athletic rules which are required by the Philippine Ama- 
teur Athletic Federation, of which the Governor General is the 
president, and it is affiliated with this association according to the 
articles of alliance published in the handbook. A certificate is 
required frem each amateur, as follows: 
If I commit any of the following acts, I become a professional athlete and 
ineligible to compete further as an amateur: 
. Enter a competition for money. 
. Accept a prize for money. 
. Sell or pawn prizes. 
. Enter a competition under a false name. 
. Issue or accept a challenge for money or its equivalent. 
. Receive reward for becoming or continuing to be a member of an athletic 
organization. 
7. Accept a free membership or remission of dues in any club. 
8. Teach, train, or coach in any athletic sport for money or any valuable 
consideration. & amb wney 
No student can represent a school unless he has been a regular 
attendant at this school for at least four school months immediately 
preceding the meet, and only those students who are taking full work 
in a regular course are allowed to represent a school. No person who 
is a graduate of a four-year secondary course is eligible to compete 
in athletic meets. Approved private educational institutions may be 
represented at interprovincial athletic meets only upon the written 
invitation of the director of education. 
The chapter on athletic courtesy states that visiting teams are to be 
honored guests of the home team, and all their mutual relations are 
to be governed by the spirit which is understood to guide such deal- 
ings. Ungentlemanly or unfair means are not to be practiced, even 
when they are used by opponents, and the admonition given is, 
“Cheer when you win; cheer when you lose.” The fact that a Fili- 
pino baseball team met and defeated the strong team from Wasada 
University, Japan, shows the results of careful training and good 
coaching. .

Manual gives in compact form all the rules and regulations governing the sery- 
ice and is of immense benefit to teachers just entering the service. 
Other publications of the bureau include the Eleventh Annual Report of the 
Director of Education; No. 7 of the series of Civico-Educational Lectures on 
Cocoanuts; and Volume V of the Teacher’s Assembly Herald. Four textbooks 
have also been issued by the bureau: Commercial Geography; Introduction to 
the Study of Colonial History; Selected Short Poems by Representative Ameri- 
can Authors; and a book containing Macaulay’s Samuel Johnson, Emerson’s 
Self-Reliance, and Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address. 
The most important publication of the bureau in many respects is the Philip- 
pine Craftsman. This magazine is published monthly for the nine months of 
the year, and is devoted entirely to the advancement of industrial instruction 
in the public schools of the islands.* 
HAWAII. 
The school year 1911-12 marks a new period in the history of edu- 
cation in the Territory of Hawaii. By an act of the legislature ap- 
proved April 13, 1911, a new method of financing the schools was 
adopted. Under this act the Territorial department of public in- 
struction is authorized and directed to prepare a salary schedule to 
cover the compensation of all teachers, supervisors, and principals, 
such schedule to be based upon a classification of schools, teachers’ 
certificates, and length of service. The salaries of supervisors and 
principals must be based also on the number of teachers under their 
direction. Such schedule, when approved by the governor, has the 
effect of law, and may from time to time be altered, amended, or 
revised. The law provides that the total number of teachers, includ- 
ing supervisors and principals, who may be continuously employed 
in any one year shall not exceed 1 for every 35 pupils enrolled in the 
public schools during the preceding year, and that the monthly pay 
roll of teachers, supervisors, and principals shall not exceed $45,000 
per month, plus $50 additional for every 35 children of school age 
added to the enrollment of the public schools after June 30, 1911.

HAWAIL 443 
In addition to the salary schedule the Territorial department of 
public instruction is required to prepare biennially a school budget 
showing the estimated expenses, other than salaries of teachers, 
supervisors, and principals, of the public schools of the Territory 
and of such department, under two heads. Under the head of “ gen- 
eral fund ” are included the salary of the superintendent, salaries of 
office force, general expenses, supplies, libraries and books, industrial 
and manual training, and maintenance of special schools. Under 
the head of “special fund” are included new buildings (school- 
houses, cottages, and outbuildings), repairs and maintenance of 
buildings and grounds, new grounds, janitor service, furniture and 
fixtures. The budget must be submitted to a committee of estimate 
consisting of the secretary of the Territory, the superintendent of 
public instruction, the mayor of the city and county of Honolulu, 
and the chairmen of the boards of supervisors of the several counties, 
which committee may revise or change any item appearing under the 
heading “special fund,” but shall not change any item under the 
heading “ general fund.” The budget is then submitted by the 
governor to the legislature, and when acted upon by the legislature’ 
such budget shall determine the amounts which may be expended for 
the several purposes during the succeeding biennial period. 
The administration of the public schools is almost entirely cen- 
tralized in the department of public instruction, which consists of the 
superintendent and 6 commissioners appointed from the 4 counties 
by the governor with the consent of the senate. The only function 
connected with the public schools exercised by the local or county 
governments is the maintenance of school buildings and grounds. 
The course of study in the high schools extends through four 
~ years, as does that of the normal school. During the school year 
1911-12 a summer school was held at the normal school for a period 
of 6 weeks, with an attendance of 112. Of this number 83 took work 
required for the primary-grade teacher’s certificate, and 29 for the 
grammar-grade certificate. 
Attendance at either a public or a private school is obligatory for 
all children from 6 to 17 years of age. 
In 1912 the public-school system comprised the Territorial normal 
school at Honolulu; 2 high schools, 1 at Honolulu and 1 at Hilo; 3 
industrial schools, 2 of which are for boys and girls, respectively, 
committed to them by the juvenile courts; and 151 schools of primary 
and grammar grades. The total enrollment in public schools was 
23,752, of which number 12,965 are boys and 10,787 girls. This was 
an increase of 3,155, or more than 15 per cent, over the preceding 
year, while the average attendance was about 86 per cent of the 
enrollment. Of the total enrollment, 146 pupils were in the normal

school, 249 in high schools, 305 in the eighth grade, 434 in the seventh

fourth grade, 3,325 in the third grade, 4,170 in the second grade, 
and 9,803 in the first grade. Excluding the normal school, it is 
found that 413 per cent of all public-school pupils were enrolled in 
the first grade. é 4 
There was expended for public schools during the year the sum 
of $722,912.57, of which $92,577.92 was for new buildings. The 
total cost per pupil was $30.43. 
In addition to the public schools there are 51 private schools in 
the Territory, ranging from kindergartens to colleges, with an en- 
rollment of 6,157 pupils—3,270 boys and 2,887 girls. These institu- 
tions are required to obtain permits from the department of public 
instruction. 
The cosmopolitan character of the schools in Hawaii is indicated 
in the following classification of teachers and pupils by nationalities:

PORTO RICO. 
[From the report for the year ended June 30, 1912, of Edwin G. Dexter, Commissioner of 
Education for Porto Rico.) 
At the close of the year ended June 30, 1912, Dr. E. G. Dexter 
was succeeded as commissioner of education for Porto Rico by Mr. 
Edward M. Bainter, of Kansas City, Mo. In his report for the 
year Dr. Dexter summarizes briefly the progress in education made 
in Porto Rico during his term of five years. The report shows that

during that time the total enrollment in the public schools increased 
from 71,696 to 160,657, or 124 per cent; average daily attendance 
increased from 44,218 to 114,834, or 160 per cent; the enrollment in 
secondary schools increased from 182 to 1,547, or 750 per cent; the 
expenditure for public schools increased from $908,794 to $1,366,810, 
while the per capita cost per pupil in attendance decreased. from 
$12.67 to $8.51. During his term instruction in manual training and 
in agriculture was introduced in the public schools, public-school 
playgrounds were established in 61 municipalities, and libraries were 
established in 225 schools. 
COMMON SCHOOLS, 
The common-school system consists of the rural and graded schools. 
The graded schools show an increase of 84 over the number in the 
preceding year, and the rural schools an increase of 185. The total 
number of common-school teachers was 1,781, as compared with 
1,671 for the preceding year. The enrollment in these schools was 
141,424. As compared with the previous year, the enrollment shows 
an increase of 5,636, or 12 per cent, in graded schools, and 7,335, or 9 
per cent, in the rural schools. 
Of the 44,912 pupils enrolled in the graded schools on March 1, 
1912, there were 14,327 in the first grade, 9,228 in the second grade, 
6,682 in the third, 4,703 in the fourth, 3,669 in the fifth, 2,679 in the 
sixth, 1,888 in the seventh, and 1,706 in the eighth. 
The rural-school course covers a period of six years and articulates 
with the graded-school system at the beginning of the fifth grade. 
On March 1, 1912, there were enrolled in the rural schools 78,796 
pupils, of which number 47,855, or 61 per cent, were in the first 
grade. Only 71 of the total number were enrolled in the sixth grade. 
Considerable attention has been given to the matter of retardation 
of pupils. The percentage of promotion from grade to grade has not 
been satisfactory. An attempt to better conditions has been made 
by the introduction of the plan known as “ flexible promotions.” 
After a trial of over two years, the consensus of opinion on the part 
of supervising principals is in favor of the plan as a practical 
solution of the problem. 
The plan pursued is in brief as follows: 
(1) The course of study was divided into six groups of six weeks each for 
both rural and graded schools. This gave a short portion to be covered at a 
time, the exact amount being indicated by pages of textbooks and by detailed 
instructions to the teachers. 
(2) The pupils of each grade were rearranged so that in each of the two 
groups in a given room were found only those of practically the same degree 
of advancement. This regrouping was at first only tentative, but in the course 
of time has become fairly stable. Each group was allowed to advance at the
-P-A-G-E-472
  446 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
rate at which it could do the work well. Thus the groups gradually drew 
apart, the stronger covering the work outlined in a given six weeks’ period 
in less time, the slower requiring more, but all working at their best. It was 
not intended that the interval between them should be or remain uniform, al- 
though this has in many cases resulted. 
(3) At the end of each six weeks those who had shown marked ability, 
usually oply a few at a time, were advanced to the next higher group, while 
those who cculd not keep the pace set by the rest of the class were demoted 
to the next lower, reviewing the work in which they were weak. As far as 
possible the pupils did not change teacher or rooms, as it was recognized that 
such changes would not prove to be for the best interest of young children. 
Not more than two groups were allowed in a room. In this way a constant 
regrading was carried on during the year, the aim being always to place pupils 
in the group where they could do the best work, all at the same rate. 
The plan has not been found feasible above the fourth grade, except in a few 
of the larger towns, owing to the fact that as a rule the higher grades have 
not enough students to form more than one group. But it is in the lower grades 
where the greatest retardation has occurred in the past and where the largest 
number of pupils are found who are behind the normal advancement. 
The use of the English language as the medium of instruction is 
making rapid progress. In 1912 all instruction was given in English 
in 98.4 per cent of the graded schools, and in 1.6 per cent of such 
schcols the instruction was partly in English. There are now no 
graded schools in Porto Rico in which English is not used. 
In the rural schools the conditions are not yet so satisfactory, 
although considerable progress is being made. In 1908-9 there 
were no rural schools in which instruction was given wholly in 
English. Now instruction is given wholly in English in 188 rural 
schools, or 17 per cent of the total number; in 22 per cent of the 
schools instruction is partly in English; in 60.5 per cent English is 
taught as a special subject; and in only 6 schools is there no instruc- 
tion in English. 
The commissioner states that without a doubt the teaching of 
English is far more effective in the lower grades by the Porto Rican 
teachers authorized to teach in that language than by American 
teachers. They give betters results in the higher grades and it is 
the intention to gradually increase. the number of Porto Rican teach- 
ers in charge of the upper grades, as greater efficiency in the use of 
the English language is acquired. 
HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The number of high schools with four-year courses has been in- 
creased to four by the establishment of the school at Arecibo, which 
is located in a building that has been remodeled for high-school pur- 
poses and is the only high school in Porto Rico adequately housed. 
The enrollment in high schools was as follows: Arecibo, 70; Maya- 
guez, 175; Ponce, 360; San Juan, 301. The requirements for gradua-
-P-A-G-E-473
PORTO RICO. 447 
tion from the high school are uniform, as is the course of study. To 
graduate from the four-year course, a student must have attained 
16 units of credit, of which 4 must be in the English language, 2 
in either Spanish, Latin, or French, 2 in history, and 1 in science. 
The remaining 7 units may be chosen, under the direction of the 
principal, from the various elective subjects offered. 
AGRICULTURAL INSTRUCTION. 
Following the general plan of last year, special teachers of agri- 
culture were assigned toa limited number of towns and were charged. 
with giving theoretical and practical instruction to the pupils of 
both the graded and rural schools. The budget for the past year 
made provision for 10 special teachers of agriculture, at a salary of 
$60 a month for the calendar year, but owing to a lack of trained 
men available for this work only seven appointments were made. 
These seven were assigned to the districts of Carolina, Juana Diaz, 
Bayamon, Utuado, San German, Toa Alta, and Anasco. 
They devoted their entire time to the teaching of agriculture to 
the pupils of both graded and rural schools, holding conferences and 
classes for teachers, conducting public meetings for the farmers, and 
in general to arousing and maintaining interest in the agricultural 
movement throughout their respective school districts. Many of 
the distant rural schools, accessible only on horseback over long and 
wearisome trails, could be visited but once a month, though in: such 
cases the teachers in charge looked after the agricultural work, 
receiving explicit instructions from the special teacher. As a rule, 
both boys iand girls took the course, and emphasis was laid on the 
practical as well as on the theoretical side of the subject. In the 
seven districts where this instruction was given a total of 8,723 pupils 
are reported as having taken this course, as compared with 1,663 
during the year previous. The course has been offered in all grades 
of both graded and rural schools, but in the lower ones the most 
mature pupils were selected to do whatever manual work was neces- 
sary. In the graded schools the practical work in agriculture has 
been done on land contiguous to the school building, in most cases it 
being the property of the local school board. In the rented rural 
schools land has been donated or loaned by public-spirited people 
for the agricultural work. 
Nature study is a required subject in the first four grades of both 
rural and graded schools, and in those districts where no special 
teachers of agriculture were found practical work connected with 
school gardening was carried on as a part of the nature-study course. 
In those in which special teachers of agriculture were located the 
courses in nature study and in elementary agriculture have been very 
closely correlated. A course in agriculture has been worked out by 
   
-P-A-G-E-474
  448 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
the different teachers in this subject for their respective districts, 
and it is recommended that a uniform course be promulgated as soon 
as possible. 
The following table shows the average number of minutes per 
week given to theoretical and practical work in the seven districts 
mentioned above:

Grade 3... 56 55 
Grade 4. . 57 64    The need of more industrial instruction, especially in agriculture, 
which is and will remain the fundamental industry of the island, has 
long been recognized. 
During the past school year special efforts have been made to in- 
troduce elementary agriculture efficiently into the common schools. 
A recent ruling of the Commissioner of Education of the United 
States made it possible to utilize, to a reisonable extent, the Federal 
appropriations known as the Morrill and Nelson funds for instruct- 
ing teachers in agriculture and for the teaching of agriculture. 
The Commissioner of Education of the United States and the Com- 
missioner of Education for Porto Rico in consultation at Washington 
decided that it was highly desirable to hold a series of one-week 
institutes throughout the island for the purpose of giving instruction 
in agriculture to the teachers in rural and graded schools. The plan 
contemplated closing the schools for one week in a given district, 
assembling the teachers at a convenient central point, and requiring 
their attendance at the exercises of the institute. This was put into 
effect, and 85 institutes were held in different sections of the island. 
The selection and organization of the institute faculty, as well as 
the planning of the work, subject, content, and equipment, was 
placed in the hands of Dean F. L. Stevens, recently elected to organ- 
ize the college of agriculture at Mayaguez. The institute faculty 
selected by Dean Stevens was as follows: R. I. Smith, E. A. Cocke- 
fair, Mrs. A. C. Stevens, Miss M. E. Umberger, A. D. Cromwell, 
D. T. Griswold, and 8. K. White, all of whom arrived in Porto Rico 
in January, 1912. Work was begun immediately on the development 
of the scheme already worked out in its main features by Dean 
Stevens, and was essentially as follows: 
3. Each week’s work to consist of 20 exercises, each exercise to present the 
subject matter, with method of instruction, for approximately one week’s work 
in agriculture in the common schools.
-P-A-G-E-475
PORTO RICO. 449 
2. Several periods to be given to practice classes with the various grades. 
3. Evening illustrated lectures and moyving-picture exhibits on agriculture to 
be given. . 
4. During the following year 20 lessons to be presented and the 20 lessons 
of the first year revised. 
“5. During the second year a weekly bulletin to be sent to each teacher. This 
bulletin to present lesson plans for the agricultural lessons of the week follow- 
ing and to aid in stimulating interest in all phases of this work, including 
school fairs, school collections, ete. 
6. During the second year a large personal correspondence with the teachers 
regarding the teaching of agriculture to be conducted by the college faculty. 
7. A prize in the form of a one-week scholarship at the college of agriculture 
in a special course, all expenses paid, to be awarded to the pupils in each 
school district doing the best work in agriculture. 
The faculty immediately began to get together the equipment, 
charts, microscopes, specimens, lantern slides, etc., and to prepare the 
syllabi of the lessons to distribute to the teachers. 
In the selection of subject matter special stress was laid upon 
fundamental knowledge, teachability, and applicability of the knowl- 
edge in Porto Rico. It was, of course, impossible properly to de- 
velop and use school gardens in the work of the first year, but their 
utility was constantly emphasized and advantage was taken of the. 
many excellent school gardens that already existed in the island. 
The paucity of birds in Porto Rico, and their evident need here, 
lead also to special emphasis on the relation of birds to agriculture. 
In the agricultural instruction the proper value and full dignity 
of labor were emphasized, and pupils and parents are gradually com- 
ing to an appreciation of the work and to a realization that it is not 
ungentlemanly to soil the hands in manual labor. 
In many of the districts public agricultural exhibits were held 
with excellent results, and at the annual insular fair collections of 
fruits and vegetables raised in the school gardens of the island were 
on exhibition. 
The result of agricultural instruction has shown itself not only 
in the beautification of the school surroundings, but also in the 
homes of many of the children, where the pupils are raising not only 
flowers, but fruits and vegetables on their own account. 
The work is progressing as satisfactorily as can be expected, and 
with the teaching force receiving instruction during the year and at 
the summer institutes the time is not far distant when agriculture 
should be placed in the course of study for all the rural and graded 
schools of the island. 
INDUSTRIAL WORK YOR BOYS, 
It is the desire of the department of education to awaken in the 
heart of every boy a knowledge of the dignity of manual labor. In 
Porto Rico there are splendid opportunities for skilled artisans and 
 
-P-A-G-E-476
  450 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
workers in wood, iron, and other material. The boys, generally 
speaking, are artistic, and great credit is due them for the work 
undertaken in the classes. At the second insular fair a considerable 
variety of articles made by pupils in the manual training classes was 
exhibited. Instruction in woodworking was given during the year 
in 16 districts to 758 boys, an increase of 258 over the number for 
the preceding year. 
SEWING. 
Instruction in sewing was given in 54 towns to more than 5,000 
girls. The classes were taught as a rule after school hours and on 
Saturdays and wherever possible by teachers in the common schools 
who had special aptitude for the work. 
COOKING. 
In 1911 instruction in cooking was offered in but 4 towns, with a 
total of 159 girls enrolled. During the year 1911-12 this was ex- 
tended to 9 other municipalities, making a total of 13 towns, and 
the number of girls taking such instruction increased to 361. The 
girls have been taught to make practical menus, estimating the cost 
of meals. A course in cooking for use in the public schools was 
prepared by a former professor of domestic science in the University 
of Porto Rico. The course followed covers carbohydrates, prepara- 
tion of food value; proteins, foods which supply protein and prep- 
aration of the same; fats, use as food and in cooking; foods, kinds 
and value; batters, kinds and value; beverages, study of coffee, cocoa, © 
tea, and their uses; meats, kinds, value, composition, and. prepara- 
tion; simple desserts. 
Great interest is shown in these classes by both pupils and parents. 
Girls who have never done any manual work in their homes are 
anxious to show what they have learned at school, and in many 
instances parents have bought ovens, so that the children can make 
things which they were taught in the cooking classes. 
MUSICAL INSTRUCTION. 
School bands were maintained in 36 municipalities, an increase of 
7 over the number for the préceding year. The bands were com- 
posed of 1,479 boys, who received instruction under the direction 
of competent teachers. The funds available for these bands 
amounted to $16,633.12, of which amount $11,661.86 was provided 
by the school boards, $1,032 by the municipal councils, and $3,939.26 
by subscriptions. There was expended for salaries of instructors, 
$9,044; instruments, $5,758.71; material, $718.41; rent, $162; leaving’; 
a balance of $950. An average of 12 hours per week was devoted 
to musical instruction given outside of school hours.
-P-A-G-E-477

NIGHT SCHOOLS, 
During the year there were maintained 149 urban and 209 rural 
night schools. In the former the enrollment was 8,594, with an 
average daily attendance of 3,566; in the latter the enrollment was 
8,254, with an average daily attendance of 4,273. The school census 
of March 1, 1912, shows that of the pupils in night schools 39.7 
per cent were over 18 years of age. 
“ 
TEACHERS’ CONFERENCES. 
During the school year a total of 185 conferences have been held 
in the school districts of the island, with an average attendance of 
136 teachers. The average number of conferences per district was 
4.5, and the average number of teachers in attendance at each was 
33.1. These general conferences have been conducted, on the whole, 
with a definite aim in mind, and the programs have been so arranged 
as to allow ample time for informal discussions on the different sub- 
jects submitted. Some of the supervising principals planned the con- 
ference work at the beginning of the year and had conferences which 
concerned especially the different classes of teachers: Rural, primary, 
grammar, and high school, although one or two general topics were 
included at each conference which were applicable to all grades of 
schools. In this way definite conclusions were more easily obtained. 
Not infrequently a social gathering for the teachers, supervisors, and 
amembers of the school boards followed the conference, and much 
good was done in bringing about a spirit of cooperation in the work. 
In some districts these conferences have been held in rural school- 
houses in the country, the teachers making the journey on foot or on 
horseback. 
An important part of each has been model classes given by the 
strongest teachers for the benefit of the weaker, thus giving all an 
opportunity to see the best work being done in the district. Ex- 
hibitions of work from both rural and graded schools have been 
freely displayed, so that the teachers have received many valuable 
aids looking toward the improvement of their daily work. 
In addition to these general school conferences, numerous grade 
and group meetings, usually presided over by the supervising prin- 
cipal, at which the knotty problems of the work were straightened 
out, have been held. 
SCHOOL BUILDINGS. 
Continued interest has been manifested by the department and by 
the school boards in the erection of modern school buildings. Every 
effort is being made to lessen the number of rented schoolrooms as   
 
-P-A-G-E-478
  
452 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
fast as the resources of the local school boards permit. . During the 
past year four school boards have constructed graded school build- 
ings with funds obtained through loans from the insular govern- 
ment, while several others have obtained the loans and expect to 
begin building immediately. 
Of the 1,168 buildings used for school purposes, 325, or 28 per 
cent, are owned by the Government, and 843, or 72 per cent, are 
rented. Of the 1,845 rooms used for common schools, 759, or 42 
per cent, are in buildings owned by the Government, and 1,066 rooms, 
er 58 per cent, in those rented. Of the 325 school buildings men- 
tioned, 102 are within the urban limits and 223 in the rural districts.

CANAL ZONE. 
(From Report of the Isthmian Canal Commission, 1912.) 
The organization of the division of schools consists of 1 superin- 
tendent, 2 clerks, 1 supervisor of primary grades, 2 supervisors of 
children, 1 principal of high school, 7 principals of grammar schools, 
66 teachers, and 1 gardener temporarily employed. The total enroll- 
ment for the year was 3,821, of which number 1,556 were white 
children and 1,765 colored children. 
Of the 48 white teachers, 13 hold degrees from colleges or uni- 
versities, 19 hold diplomas from normal schools, 12 have had two or 
more years’ normal, college, or university training. Of the teachers, 
25 have had six or more years’ experience, 19 have had three or more 
years’ experience, and 4 have had two or more years’ experience in 
public-school work. 
In October, 1911, the upper-grade white school at Paraiso was con- 
solidated with the Pedro Miguel white school, and the children trans- 
ported to and from Pedro Miguel by brake. A new school for 
white children between the first and fifth grades was opened at Las 
Cascadas on October 2. Another school for white children of all 
grades was established at Porto Bello on November 6. New schools 
for colored children. were also established at Majagual, Miraflores, 
and Cucaracha on October 2, and at Mandingo and Ancon on October 
16 and November 17, respectively. The Cristobal colored school was 
reopened on October 2 in the new school building constructed to re- 
place the one destroyed by fire on March 23, 1911. 
On June 30, 1912, there were 26 buildings used for s¢hool pur- 
poses, 11 for white schools and 15 for colored schools. One of these, a 
school for lower-grade white children, was conducted in a room of the 
Las Cascadas Hotel building, and another in a room in a house in 
Porto Bello, while the school for native children at Majagual was 
maintained in the native church building at that point. New build- 
ings were erected or old buildings converted for school purposes as 
follows: Mandingo, 1 room; Ancon, 4 rooms; Miraflores, 1 room; and 
Cucaracha, 1 room, all for colored children; while the school build- 
ing at Tabernilla for white children was re-erected at Mount Hope 
for colored children. An addition of one room was made to the 
school building at Pedro Miguel for white children. 
The total expenditures for school purposes amounted to $100,997.23, 
of which sum $62,122.75 was expended for salaries of superintendent, 
teachers, and clerks; $8,230.79 for construction of school buildings; 
$3,483.62 for maintenance of buildings; and the remainder for 
janitor service, furniture and equipment, supplies, and traveling and 
miscellaneous expenses.

AMERICAN SAMOA. 
(From reports of the governor to the Secretary of the Navy.) 
The islands of Tutuila and Manua of the Samoan group are 
United States territory, and have been placed under the control 
of the Navy Department, with a naval officer as governor of the 
islands. No appropriations have been made by Congress for the 
development of the islands nor for the welfare of the natives. The 
revenues are raised from customs duties and licenses. The natives 
pay a poll tax in copra, which is marketed by the island government 
and nets about $8 per capita. All of the native tax fund is used to 
pay the salaries of native officials. The only fund from which 
expenses for educational purposes can be paid is the customs fund, 
from which there is available about $1,500 per annum for such 
purposes. : 
There is only one Government school in the American islands, 
which is located on the grounds of the naval station. It has an 
enrollment of about 50 pupils, with 1 teacher and a native assistant. 
In 1905 the people of the western district of Tutuila petitioned the 
governor that they be allowed to establish a district school and to 
employ Marist brothers as teachers. A contract was made between 
the chiefs of the western district and the Marist brothers to continue 
in force for 20 years. The Marist Society agreed to furnish three 
brothers of the order as teachers, not to teach religion nor to influ- 
ence children in religious matters, and the district agreed to pay the 
teachers each $300 per annum. The district erected a schoolhouse, 
and there are now about 120 pupils in attendance. Instruction is 
given in the English language. The district assesses all males a 
school tax of a certain amount of copra per annum, amounting to 
about $1,000. 
The eastern district of Tutuila has taken steps to erect a school- 
house, and it is hoped that 2 teachers for the school may be obtained 
from America. 
The London Missionary Society maintains a preparatory school for 
boys at Fagalele, Tutuila, and a school for girls in charge of two 
white women at Atauloma, Tutuila. All native pastors of this 
society are required to conduct a day school for both boys and girls. 
They teach in the Samoan language only, and the instruction is con- 
fined to reading, writing, arithmetic, a little geography, and the 
Bible. : 
The Society of Marists has decided to erect a schoolhouse in the 
eastern district of Tutuila and will conduct a private school. There 
are now 2 schools for girls in Tutuila conducted by Catholic sisters. 
English is taught in one of them. |

The Mormons conduct 8.sehools in Tutuila. Their principal 
school is located at Mapusaga, where English is taught to both boys 
and girls. Their teachers are young Americans who serve without 
pay. They have a flourishing plantation, all the land being held by 
natives, and an attempt is made to give instruction to the natives in 
the cultivation of the soil. : 
In the island of Manua there is 1 school for boys taught by a 
native pastor in addition to the usual parochial schools. 
In summing up the conditions regarding education in American 
Samoa, the governor states: 
(1) The only “public” schools in 'Tutuila are the Government boys’ school 
and the western district boys’ school. 
(2) In the denominational parechial schools no English is taught (except by 
Mormons), and undue time is spent on Bible study. 
(3) There is not sufficient instruction in the English language. 
(4) Education for all children does not proceed far enough. 
(5) Conditions in educational matters are generally unsatisfactory to the 
governor. 
An effort has been made during the past year to improve the condition of 
the schools. A convention of all the sechool-teachers of all denominations was ~ 
ealled in November, 1911, and was attended by all teachers except those of the 
Roman Catholic Church. The convention was addressed by the gevernor, by 
the Government school-teacher, and by other persons who have had experience 
in teaching. The convention recommended that a law for compulsory educa- 
tion be passed, and this law was passed by the governor, after a consultation 
with the district governors and other high ehiefs. 
Another meeting of white teachers was called on April 16, 1912, to consider 
what textbooks should be adepted. A committee was appointed toe standardize 
schoolbooks and the school courses for those schools taught by non-Samoans. 
fhe work required in each grade has now been standardized. 
While it is not possible to enforce upon any religious denomination any cer- 
tain kinds of beoks, it is found that the convention and subsequent meetings of 
the school-teachers have been of great value in coordinating the work of the 
different denominations, and most of them now use the same textbeoks. 
GUAM. 
The annual report of J. Schnabel, superintendent of public instruc- 
tion of the island of Guam, for the year ended June 30, 1912, shows 
a total enrollment in the public schools of 1,622, of which number 
844 are boys and 778 girls. The total number of teachers was 28. 
There were 12 public day schools, 1 night school, and a music (band) 
class. The location of these schools, with the number of teachers 
and pupils in each, is as follows:

The percentage of attendance in the public schools is very high, 
ranging from 95 to 99 per cent in the several schools. Half-day ses- 
sions are held, boys attending in the forenoon and girls in the after- 
noon, excepting in Agana School No. 2 and in the schools at Dededo 
«nd Ordot, where boys and girls attend both sessions. The half-day 
sessions are rendered necessary on account of lack of room in the 
school buildings to accommodate all the pupils at one time. 
The schools in Agana have been graded, and the following course 
of study has been prescribed:

Instruction is given also in vocal music in both the forenoon and 
afternoon sessions, and averages about one-half hour at each session. 
Reviews are held every Friday on work done during the week, and 
an examination is held every three months to determine the fitness of 
pupils for promotion to the next higher grade. The superintendent 
recommends that at least two professionally trained teachers be sent 
from the United States to take charge of the highest grades in Agana. 
Most of the teachers are natives of the island, and some of them 
are endeavoring to improve themselves by attending the sessions of 
the night school. Several enlisted men of the United States Navy 
on duty in Guam have been detailed as teachers. 
The report shows that improvements of a sanitary nature are being 
made in some of the school buildings, and shower baths have been 
installed in two of them. The amount expended for school furniture, 
rent, and repairs is $2,486.08, including a new school building in 
Ordot and playgrounds in Agana. The superintendent recommends 
that a small sum be set aside annually for the decoration of school- 
rooms, and he urges that use be made of the flag and of pictures of 
great men like Washington, Lincoln, and others.

  EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES IN CANADA.

Introducton—The main features of the systems of public instruction—Statisties of 
public elementary and high schools—Current activities—Training in manual arts 
and agriculture—Commissions on industrial education—Higher education. 
Never before in the history of the world was education the sub- 
ject of such widespread national interest as at the present time. The 
relative vigor of nations is no longer estimated solely by the strength 
of their armaments or their wealth, but, in constantly increasing 
degree, by the efficiency and universality of their school provision. 
This fact is emphasized by the numerous commissions sent on world 
tours to investigate educational systems, and by the international 
congresses called to discuss principles and methods of public educa- 
tion with a view, in every case, to the improvement of home condi- 
tions. 
In the discussions and legislative measures which the subject ex- 
cites, broad distinction is made between the agencies for popular 
education and those engaged in the work of liberal and professional 
education. This distinction obtains to some degree in countries 
where there is no traditional or social cleavage between schools for 
the people and higher institutions; it is noticeable, however, that 
the distinction is lessening, even in countries where it is most pro- 
nounced. Everywhere systems of popular education, elementary, 
and industrial, are expanding and overlapping systems of liberal 
education. :

  460 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
As regards elementary education, which in nearly all foreign 
countries is administered as a separate department, current activities 
have at present three main directions: First, the endeavor to make 
adequate provision of schools—a task of peculiar difficulty in new 
communities, in communities which have fallen behind in the march 
of progress, and in the centers of congested and constantly ancreas- 
ing populations; second, the endeavor to adjust school training to the 
vital needs of the people; and third, the endeavor to utilize the school 
system for hygienic and welfare services which affect the entire popu- 
lation. The mere enumeration of these activities serves to indicate the 
stages of advance in respect to popular education that mark different 
nations. The greater number are still struggling with the first prob- 
lem, namely, that of getting schools enough. Comparatively few 
nations, indeed, have passed the first stage of effort and are working 
out the problems of efficiency and general uplift. 
Canada, like the United States, offers examples of endeavor in all- 
the directions indicated. The newer Provinces have first to provide 
the essential conditions of a school system, buildings, teachers, ete., 
and this necessity they are meeting with liberal expenditure; at the 
same time, on account of the rapid growth of cities and of concen- 
trated industry in their midst, they are forced to consider the prob- 
Jems that are most urgent in long-settled communities. The older 
Provinces of Canada are chiefly engaged in readjusting their systems 
of public instruction as required by the complex conditions of modern 
industrial life. Hence, from the similarity of their problems, there 
is a community of interest between educators in the United States 
and in Canada that makes the interchange of experiences helpful to 
both, 
MAIN FEATURES OF THE SYSTEMS OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. 
Every Province of Canada has independent control of its educa- 
tional affairs in accordance with the British North American act 
of 1867, which applied to the four Provinces (Ontario, Quebec, Nova 
Scotia, and New Brunswick) then united under the general name of 
Dominion of Canada. The same right has been assured to the 
Provinces that have since entered the confederation. 
The public-school systems in the Dominion are particularly marked 
by the combination of central and local control, the former being 
most highly developed in Ontario. The minister of education in 
this Province has extensive judicial authority and powers of ap- 
pointment, and as a member of the legislature initiates and largely 
directs school legislation. In all the Provinces, excepting Quebec, 
public elementary schools are free, and school attendance is com- 
pulsory for all children not otherwise instructed. In Ontario, 
 
-P-A-G-E-487
  EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES IN CANADA, 461 
Alberta, and: Saskatchewan provision is made for separate schools 
for Roman Catholics and for Protestants, and the supporters of the 
separate schools are exempt from the payment of the local tax. The 
separate schools, however, are under Government inspection, and 
in general have the same regulations as the public schools. The 
public schools are classified as elementary and high, but in Ontario 
the high schools are comprised in a distinct division of the system, 
and tuition fees are charged in them, although these are often 
remitted. 
The support of the public schools in the several Provinces is de- 
rived from provincial grants, municipal appropriations, and local 
school taxes. 
The local control of schools in all the Provinces rests with elected 
boards, which establish schools and appoint school inspectors and 
teachers, but the qualifications for these positions are determined 
by provincial laws. 
The system of public instruction in Quebec departs most widely 
from the common type. Provision is made for the separate control 
of Roman Catholic and Protestant schools under a central authority, 
the council of public instruction, which is organized in two commit- 
tees; the one charged with the direction of the Catholic schools; the 
other with that of the Protestant schools (law of 1875). 
  The Roman Catholic committee consists of—(1) The bishops, ordinaries, or 
administrators of the Roman Catholic dioceses and apostolic vicariates situ- 
ated either in whole or in part in the Province; ex officio members. (2) An 
equal number of Roman Catholic laymen appointed by the lieutenant governor 
in council. 
The Protestant committee consists entirely of Protestant members, equal in 
number to the appointed members of the Roman Catholic committee, and, like 
them, appointed by the lieutenant governor. 
School questions in which the interests of Roman Catholics and Protestants 
are collectively concerned are under the jurisdiction of the council of public 
instruction, and shall be decided by it. 
School questions in which the interests of Roman Catholics or Protestants are 
exclusively concerned are decided by that one of the two committees which rep- _ 
resents the religious belief which the party concerned professes. 
The superintendent of public instruction, who is appointed by and holds 
office at the pleasure of the lieutenant governor, is ex officio a member of the 
council of public instruction and of each of its two committees, but he has a 
right to vote only in the committee of the religious faith to which he belongs. 
In the exercise of his functions he is bound to comply with the directions of 
the council of public instruction, or with those of its committees. 
In general, it may be said, that the administration of public schools 
in the Provinces is similar to that in the United States; the intimate

CURRENT ACTIVITIES, 
Recent reports from the Canadian Provinces show great activity 
in respect to multiplying schools and extending the scope of popular 
education. The newer Provinces, by reason of the stream of immi- 
grants for which they must provide, have heavy expenditure for 
schoolhouses and teachers. The older Provinces are better able to 
keep pace in these respects with the increase of population, though 
this effort entails ever-increasing expense. In Ontario, where the 
cost of building has greatly advanced within a few years, the expend- 
iture for primary education, including permanent works and the 
provision for expanding programs, rose from $6,100,000 to $9,300,000 
in the half decade 1906-1910. The teachers have shared in this in- 
crease; the average salary for men, which in 1907 was $907, has risen 
to $1,089; and for women from $453 to $565. 
TRAINING IN MANUAL ARTS AND AGRICULTURE. 
The movement for giving a more practical character to elementary 
education, which received great impetus from the Macdonald fund 
donated in 1899, has developed according to the plans of the donor 
in two directions, i. e., manual training and rural industries, the 
latter involving also the consolidation of rural schools.t When the 
experimental stage of this effort under private direction had passed 
the work was adopted into the school systems. 
In respect to the organization of the new orders of training, On- 
tario and Nova Scotia have made great advance. The minister of 
public instruction for Ontario in his latest report says: 
The new act of 1911 providing machinery for the establishment of classes for 
industrial training has already lent stimulus to the movement for what is 
comprehensively termed technical education. In a number of urban centers the 
advisory boards, whose special concern it is to institute and develop these

464 EDUCATION REPORT; 1912. 
classes, have been set up, and the result thus far is eminently encouraging. 
The appointment of Dr. F. W. Merchant as director of industrial and technical. 
education will enable a thorough organization and inspection of the work to be 
made throughout the Province. During the coming year it is intended that the 
director shall visit some of the chief centers of technical training in Great 
Britain and the Continent of Europe. with a view to applying here the latest 
experience abroad. Without waiting for such encouragement as the Federal 
authorities may decide to give to technical training as part of the duty which 
the Dominion Government must discharge in respect of national industrial 
efficiency, the legislature last year voted an ample sum of money for immediate 
purposes and will be asked to supplement the grant during the coming year.* 
The efforts with respect to rural industries are summed up as 
follows: 
The agricultural courses established in connection with the high schools have 
led to such promising results that a number of new centers have been provided 
during the year. There are now in the Province 18 of these courses in con- 
nection with either high schools or continuation schools, and by means of the 
short courses and the field work generally, which are carried on at convenient 
points in each county, the latest knowledge is being brought within the reach 
of the farming community. In this work the departments of agriculture and 
education unite their efforts. Another step of equal importance was taken in 
1911 in order to promote elementary agricultural instruction in the rural public 
schools. Prof. S. B. McCready, of the staff of the Ontario Agricultural College 
at Guelph, has been transferred to this department and appointed director of 
elementary agricultural education. To inspect and encourage the school-garden 
work connected with the rural schools is one of the duties of the new director, 
and the prospect of a general extension of this practical application of agri- 
culture to the school program is excellent. There were in 1910 just 17 school 
gardens in the Province, upon which grants aggregating $750 were paid, while 
at the close of 1911 the returns showed 33 school gardens, with grants aggre- 
gating $2,320. Here, as in other departments of school training, much depends 
upon the teacher. In 1911 the grant of $30 on the certificate of teachers holding 
a certificate in elementary agriculture and horticulture giving the required 
instruction was paid to 33 teachers. The encouragement given to normal- 
school graduates to take the three months’ courses provided by this department 
at the agricultural college from April to June each year is beginning to bear 
fruit. The number of certificates issued in elementary agriculture and horti- 
culture and industrial arts during the three years the courses have been in 
existence is 319, and the hope is that this number may increase until a large 
proportion of the teachers in our rural schools possess at least a grasp of agri- 
cultural conditions and have the sympathetic outlook which can do so much to 
inspire country pupils with an interest in the life about them. In referring to 
his new sphere of work, the director of elementary agriculture education 
reports: ‘‘Everywhere throughout the world there is evidence of a strong 
desire on the part of educationists and governments to have the schools give 
some measure of instruction in agriculture. Nowhere has the problem been 
solved completely. The plans that have been in operation in Ontario for the

EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES IN CANADA. 465 
past five years give promise of a very. satisfactory solution of the problem. 
To promote the work, teachers are trained especially at Guelph, material is 
sent for gardening purposes, special grants are paid both trustees and teachers, 
practical help is given by the district agricultural representatives, and the 
teachers assisted by charts, bulletins, and instruction sheets. In no other part 
of Canada nor in any State of the United States has any better scheme been 
devised, nor indeed has greater progress been made. There is strong evidence 
that the advancement of the work from now on will be rapid. Public opinion 
is becoming alive to the importance and the desirability of this kind of instruc- 
tion being given in the schools.” 
In Nova Scotia technical education is well organized under the 
immediate supervision of a director who is also principal of the 
Nova Scotia Technical College. By this combination of duties the 
practical courses of instruction in the elementary schools coordinate 
in a measure with the work of the special technical schools. The 
latter include the Nova Scotia Technical College and three types of 
secondary technical schools, namely: 
(1) Coal-mining schools, to train men fer colliery managers, underground 
managers, and overmen, 
(2) Engineering schoois, to instruct engineers, firemen, ete., in steam and 
mechanical engineering, so that they may obtain certificates as first, second, or 
third class stationary engineers. 
(3) Teehnical schools, where artisans or people who are engaged in commer- 
cial life are given evening instruction in mathematics, English, bookkeeping, 
science, drawing, or needlework which appertain especially to their vocations. 
The work of the department is rapidly extending, as indicated by 
the increase of its expenditures from $33,068 in 1909 to $53,998 
in 1911. 
Interest in rural industries is promoted by the agricultural college 
at Truro, which, in connection with the Provincial Normal School, 
conducts a summer school of rural science for the purpose of affording 
teachers the opportunity to acquire the special knowledge required 
for teaching the elements of the sciences relating to agriculture, 
household, industry, ete. The attendance at all the technical and 
special schools directly under the education department increased 
from 2,306 in 1910 to 2,476 in 1911. 
This total includes 134. teachers attending the vacation course at 
Truro, and 83 teachers a shorter, but similar, course at the summer 
science school of the Atlantic Provinces. 
From this summary it will be seen that Nova Scotia has taken 
advanced standing in respect to organizing practical studies.and in 
preparing teachers for their proper conduct in both elementary 
schools and higher institutions. 
The work started by private benefaction and enterprise is main- 
tained in some form in all the Provinces, as indicated by current  
-P-A-G-E-492
  466 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
reports. The director of the Macdonald College school for teachers, 
in his report covering the year 1911-12, says: 
The educational propaganda recently carried on by the Quebec government 
has done much to awaken interest in rural education. In many localities there 
is great need for consolidation, which would make it possible, by the combina- 
tion of two schools, to pay a salary which would secure a trained teacher. 
There is also need for some form of rural trustees’ association by which school 
commissioners could meet together and discuss the needs of rural schools. An- 
other desirable change proposed is the granting of rural-school diplomas to 
students taking an extended course in agriculture or household science at 
Macdonald College with a minimum training in teaching. The first essential 
characteristic of a rural school-teacher is that he know and appreciate his 
environment, be able to make the best of rural conditions, and desire to live 
in the country. Macdonald College is unsurpassed and probably unequaled in 
its facilities for imparting such a spirit to the students who desire to teach 
rural schools. A vote of students in the classes of the past few years showed 
that the majority of our students prefer to teach in the country; indeed, a 
number of them have returned to their own homes to teach at salaries half 
as large as they could have obtained in the city. 
The director of manual training for the Province of New Bruns- 
wick reports that: 
Seventeen school woodworking shops have been in operation, all of which 
have been visited, as required by law, during the term. Of these, four are in 
rural schools and three in consolidated schools, and in them the woodwork is 
taken by all the boys from grade six up. This condition also obtains in five of 
the city and town schools. In the remainder shopwork is only given to the 
boys of grades six to eight, inclusive, except in the city of St. John, where 
this work is confined to the boys of grades seven and eight. 
Nine household science departments have been open in the Province. In all 
but two of these the subject has been presented to the girls of grades six to 
eleven, inclusive. In St. John only the girls of grades eight and nine take the 
work, although sewing is carried on to a limited extent in some of the lower 
grades in that city. In some schools throughout the country grades four and 
five take sewing regularly. 
Systematic handwork, however, is carried on in very few of the 
elementary schools. In 1911 school gardens were maintained in 
connection with 17 schools. 
In Prince Edward Island a central institution, the Macdonald 
manual training schools, offers opportunity for the boys in the three 
school districts to take manual training as part of the regular school 
course. The plan of consolidated rural schools has thus far awak- 
ened but little interest in the Province, but one school of this kind is 
maintained to serve as a model, with financial aid from Sir William 
Macdonald. é 
The inspector of manual training for the Province of British 
Columbia reports steady growth of the manual-training movement - 
throughout the Province. There were 17 centers for this work in 
 
-P-A-G-E-493
  EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES IN CANADA. 467 
1911, with a total attendance of 3,292 boys. Arrangements were 
made for the equipment of additional centers for 1912. 
Manitoba reports classes in woodwork and in sewing and cooking 
in several cities; in Winnipeg this work is carefully systematized 
for the girls, and a corresponding course in manual training is con- 
ducted for the boys. Recently the capital city has created two large 
technical high-school buildings, at a cost of $400,000 each. Both 
schools are well equipped with shops and laboratories. Interest in 
the improvement of rural education is indicated in a few districts 
by the establishment of consolidated schools. One of these, the Star- 
buck consolidated school, is a model in arrangement and equipment. 
In Edmonton, capital of the lately organized Province of Alberta, 
manual training and domestic science are subjects of the regular 
school program, beginning in the grades and extending through the 
high school. 
COMMISSIONS ON INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
Manual training and instruction in rural industries have thus far 
been promoted in the Canadian Provinces with chief reference to 
their power in stimulating natural activities and utilizing familiar 
experiences; but, as the movement progresses, the relation of this 
practical training to the industrial life of the individual and of the 
State is emphasized, and this larger conception leads to the examina- 
tion of the subject from both the economic and the educational 
standpoint. 
In 1910 a royal commission on industrial education was appointed 
under the chairmanship of Prof. Robertson, for a comprehensive in- 
vestigation of the conditions of industrial efficiency in the principal 
countries of the world. This action was taken at the request of the 
premiers of the several Provinces, prompted by the conviction “ that 
the industrial interests of Canada may be best promoted by the 
adoption of approved systems and methods of industrial and tech- 
nical training.” * 
From advanced notices of the report of the commission, it appears 
that while the higher forms of technical training were investigated, 
the ordinary school systems were particularly considered as the basis 
upon which all other education must rest. 
The appointment of the commission for the Dominion was fol- 
lowed by the appointment the same year (1910) of a royal commis- 
sion to inquire into the industrial needs of the people of the Province 
of Manitoba, and to recommend to the government of the Province a 
system or plan for establishing such technical or industrial schools

or colleges as the circumstances of the Province will admit. In the 
course of their investigation this commission conferred with manu- 
facturers and other employers of skilled labor, mechanics represent- 
ing the various trades, social workers, teachers and school officials, 
and citizens whose position and experience gave weight to their 
opinions. The witnesses were unanimous in the opinion that the 
conditions of the Province require the adoption of some well-con- 
sidered scheme of vocational training “ based upon and accompanied 
by the essentials of a good general education.” 
This opinion was embodied in the recommendations of the com- 
mission, which included the formation of an advisory board to assist 
the education department in the development of a scheme; the 
appointment of an officer familiar with the aims. and methods of 
vocational education, whose duty it would be to advise with and 
assist school boards in the organization of such work, and the pro- 
vision of grants by the provincial government, as in the case of 
manual training and household science, to assist in meeting the cost 
of equipment and maintenance of approved forms of vocational 
training. 
In the progress of the investigation a subcommittee was appointed 
to investigate and report upon systems and institutions for industrial 
education in the United States, and the results of this investigation 
form a very interesting part of the report of the commission, to 
which comparative significance is given by résumés of the reports 
of recent similar commissions whose investigations were extended to 
European countries. 
HIGHER EDUCATION. 
The recent development of higher education in the Dominion of 
Canada has been marked in the older Provinces by the federation 
of colleges with central universities. In Ontario this result has 
been brought about by the federation of colleges with the University 
of Ontario; in Quebec, by federation with McGill University, Mont- 
real, and with Laval University, which is the center of higher 
education for the Catholic population of that Province. The rela- 
tions thus established give uniform value to the degrees which are 
granted only by the universities. The need of consolidation has been 
recognized in Nova Scotia, and also in New Brunswick. In the 
newer western Provinces the movements for higher education center 
about three recently established universities. Of these, the University 
of Alberta is the oldest, having been established in 1908. The year 
following, the University of Saskatchewan was founded; and the 
year 1912 hus been marked by the culmination of measures for the

establishment of the University of British Columbia. The pro- 
vincial government has contributed for this institution a valuable 
site of 217 acres (of an estimated value of 24 million dollars) in one 
of the choicest districts of the city of Vancouver; 2,000,000 acres of 
public land have been set apart for an endowment fund. Measures 
are also in progress for the establishment at Calgary of a private 
university, for which liberal contributions, both in money and land, 
have already been made by private individuals. The following table

the Dominion already established.

INTRODUCTION. 
The Latin-American countries are marked by common scholastic 
traditions and impulses derived from their early subjection to Span- 
ish and Portuguese influences, hence the predominant regard for 
higher education’ and the indifference to popular education which 
prevailed throughout the several Republics to a very recent date. 
Notwithstanding the fact that the leaders in the revolutionary move- 
ment which freed the different States from dependence upon Eu- 
ropean powers all advocated plans for the enlightenment of the 
people as of first consequence in the political experiment upon which 
the States were entering, efforts in behalf of popular education have 
been on the whole feeble and spasmodic until the present time. The 
following survey relates chiefly to the changed policy in respect to 
this fundamental interest. 
  
MEXICO. 
The political disasters of Mexico have diverted attention from the 
educational activities which were promoted by President Porfirio 
Diaz during his long administration and continued with undiminshed 
vigor until the revolutionary outbreak. In his address at the opening 
of the fourth period of sessions of the Twenty-sixth Congress of 
Mexico, April 1, 1912, President Madero declared that education 
was a matter of special concern to the Executive, and that every 
endeavor was made to secure competent instructors for the public 
schools and to encourage them by “high salaries, promotions, pen- 
sions, and every other privilege conducing to their advantage.”

  472 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912, 
Measures for promoting the health and physical welfare of school 
children were summed up in the message, as follows: 
Scrupulous care is also exercised with respect to the morality of the instructors 
and the hygiene of the schools. With this latter object in view, a careful exam- 
ination is made of all premises offered as schooihouses, and even of the premises 
already occupied as such, in order to reject those that are unsuited or expensive. 
The object, of course, of these endeavors to secure better instructors and prem- 
ises is the welfare of the pupils, whose attendance at school is thus facilitated 
and who are led to feel an affection for their schoolhouse. 
CHILDREN WITH SKIN DISEASES. 
The various departments of the special school for children suffering from skin 
diseases continue to be numerously attended. Various experiments have been 
made at this school in the tse of the X rays for the cure of ringworm, and 850 
pupils affected with common warts have received treatment. 
HELPING SCHOOL CHILDREN. 
Among measures adopted for the benefit of school children may be mentioned 
the establishment of school refectories, of which there are now 29 in the Federal 
District, attended on an average by 5,800 pupils, who there receive food free or 
at yery low prices, and the distribution of 25,000 pairs of shoes to be effected 
in the schools, also free or at very low prices. It may be added that the manu- 
facture of these shoes was intrusted to shoemakers out of work, who were thus 
themselves greatly benefited.     
The President noted also that, in accordance with extensions of its 
authority in school matters, by act of July 1, 1911, the Federal Gov- 
ernment had made a beginning in the establishment of rudimentary 
schools throughout the Republic. In each State an official had been 
appointed to install these schools, and it was proposed to create 
approximately 500 of them.t 
Mexico shares also in the world-wide movement for agricultural 
improvement, an interest which is being promoted by a number of the 
State governments as well as by the Federal Government. An agri- 
cultural experiment station has been established in San Juan Bau- 
tista, the capital of the State of Tabasco, which is subsidized by the 
Federal Government. The station will be devoted to experimental 
agriculture and all agricultural and kindred interests of this State. 
Pupils will have to pay only actual cost of food, books, and lodging, 
no admission or tuition fee being charged. 
  CENTRAL AMERICA, 
The status of public instruction in the States of Central America 
remains practically the same as that shown in the commissioner’s 
report for 1910.2. Costa Rica still leads in respect to the actual pro-

vision of schools and in measures for further progress. During the 
current year the assistant secretary of public instruction, Sefior 
Brenes-Mesén, was commissioned by his Government to make an 
investigation of the systems of public instruction in the United States, 
and in particular to study the organization and work of rural and 
industrial schools for the purpose of gaining suggestions applicable 
to Costa Rica. 
Panama—In his address on the occasion of his inauguration as 
President of Panama, October 1, 1912, Dr. Belisario Porras, after 
reviewing the general condition of public affairs in the State, 
continued : 
Of our administrative services, none is so respectable, so important, and so 
sacred as that of public instruction. The physical, moral, and intellectual 
development of our children and our young men should cecupy more of our 
time. It is well known that men may become what we wish them to be if 
trained from infancy. * * * 
The first influence is decisive in man’s destiny. Morality exists in habits 
or customs; repeated acts constitute vice if they are bad, and virtue if they 
are good. It is never superfluous to repeat such simple truths. It therefore 
seems logical that our country may live in peace and order if her men are 
taught from childhood to respect each other’s religious beliefs and politica! 
opinions, existing interests, and all legitimate aspirations. Human right is 
just that. It is also very plain that in order that our country should prospec, 
it would suffice to have healthy, strong men, lovers of progress and of work, 
and in order that it may be lasting it must have devoted citizens, decided, con- 
stant, loyal, and brave. Hence the main reason why public instruction must 
not be only an apprenticeship of arts and sciences but of sound education. 
The acquirement of teachers who will know how to educate and mold the 
souls is the principal problem, and shall be, therefore, the object of my most 
earnest and well-intentioned efforts. 
The Congress of Panama has just passed (February, 1913) a new 
public-instruction bill, which will undoubtedly receive the President’s 
signature. According to a synopsis forwarded from the American 
consul general: 
The Republic is divided into scholastic districts, each under an inspector, 
except the capital, which is to have two. The bill also provides that parents, 
tutors, or guardians of children who have attained school age must prove, if 
required, that these children are receiving elementary education, while persons 
employing children under 15 years of age can not bring any objection to their 
being educated. 
Further provisions of this bill are: Promotion of education among adults 
in condition to receive same by the establishment of night schools, or teaching 
in night schools, prisons, colonies of farmers, or any other place containing 40 
adult uneducated persons; the founding, where the Executive deems most con- 
yenient, of two schools of agriculture or model farms, in place of the one pro- 
vided for in Law 48 of 1911, and the Executive may engage two foreign directors
-P-A-G-E-500

for these schools; the creation of the post of dressmaker and cutter in the 
normal school, who shall devote at least 15 hours weekly to this work.’ 
SOUTH AMERICAN REPUBLICS. 
The dawn of a new era in the States of South America is marked 
by efforts for the spread of public education and the improvement 
of schools and higher institutions. These efforts are pursued under 
widely different conditions of population and social order, and in 
several of the countries referred to are constantly interrupted by 
political disturbances. Argentina and Uruguay have been specially 
progressive by reason of more stable conditions and the character of 
their populations; but while the States named have recently made the 
greatest progress in the development of popular education, other 
States are taking active measures in the same direction, and several 
maintain institutions that have contributed greatly to the general 
movement. It is impossible to show by statistics the actual condition 
of elementary education in the different States, from the lack of uni- 
formity in their reports and the difficulty of securing details from 
the local authorities, which, in general, have independent control of 
the schools within their respective areas. The following table, drawn 
from current reports and special documents? received in this office, 
shows approximately the extent of primary education at the present 
time. It should be considered, liowever, that the public primary 
schools do not draw pupils from the upper classes; their children 
attend either the preparatory departments of the colleges or private 
schools, with respect to which this office has only fragmentary infor- 
mation. The table as it stands will serve as a basis for future com- 
parisons, and it will also conduce to a clearer understanding of the 
particulars which follow.

    475 » EDUCATION IN THE LATIN-AMERICAN STATES. 
ARGENTINA. 
Argentina in 1910 had an estimated population of 7,091,822, includ- 
ing only 30,000 Indians. Of the total given, 1,995,211, or more 
than one-fourth, was comprised in 13 cities, ranging from San Luis, 
with 13,994 inhabitants, to Buenos Aires, with 1,319,747. If to this 
number be added the population of the Province of Buenos Aires, 
not including the capital, the total is 3,791,531. In other words, 
more than half the population of the State is sufficiently concen- 
trated for the creation of strong public opinion and diversified indus- 
tries. 
Public primary education is organized in accordance with a law 
of July 8, 1884, which reflects very plainly the influence of move- 
ments taking place in France at that time. In fact, French 
influences have had much to do with shaping both political and 
educational systems throughout South America. In the present 
movement for the uplift of primary schools and provision for tech- 
nical education there is a general tefidency to look to the United 
States for guidance. 
By the law of 1884 primary education in Argentina is free for 
all children and obligatory for ages 6 to 14. Religious instruction 
is excluded from the regular programs, but it is permitted in the 
schools, and by the clergy, authorized, before and after school hours. 
Local school committees are appointed to look after the matter of 
school attendance, and fines are imposed for violation of the law 
in this respect. The law also requires that local appropriations shall 
be made to assist needy pupils. 
The control of education in the 14 Provinces having been reserved 
to them by the constitution, the law of 1884 applied only to the 
Federal district and the territories; but as the provincial laws em- 
body the principles of the national law, primary education is, theo- 
retically, secular, free, obligatory, and graded throughout the 
Republic? 
The failure of the provincial authorities to enforce the compul- 
sory school-attendance law, and to make due provision of schools, 
led to the enactment in 1905 of the Liiinez law, which authorized 
the Federal Government to maintain national schools in the Proy- 
inces, as a means of preventing illiteracy. 
For the support of schools under the control of the Government 
a fund is maintained to which are applied certain taxes and 40 per 
cent of the direct contributions for national expenditures from the 
capital, the territories, and the national colonies. 
In addition to the regular primary schools, there may be main- 
tained at public expense infant schools, schools or classes for adults, 
and ambulatory schools.

For the service of the public schools 14,451 teachers (2,428 men, 
12,023 women) were employed. 
The great excess of women teachers is regarded as a serious evil, 
and the importance of bringing all boys under the virile influence of 
men is urged, as in the United States. The causes of this excess are 
said to be the small inducements, material and social, that the work 
offers, and the political persecutions and irritating favoritism that 
mark official life in the Provinces and make it especially irksome to 
earnest men. 
The enrollment in all classes of primary schools, viz, 765,105, is 
equivalent to 10.6 per cent of the estimated population; omitting 
private schools, the enrollment in public schools equals 9 per cent 
of the population, a ratio which places Argentina at the head of 
the Latin States of the Western Continent in respect to the diffusion 
of elementary education. The statistics show, further, a marked in- 
crease in the relative school attendance; in 1902 the enrollment in 
all classes of primary schools was equivalent to 8.6 per cent of the 
population, as against 10.6 per cent in 1911. This increase is due 
largely to the efforts of the General Government, as the statistics 
show a decline in provincial schools since the Liinez law went into 
effect. 
The State appropriations for education have greatly increased 
during the past half decade, rising from 10,221,421 pesos ($9,863,671) 
in 1906 to 22,000,000 pesos ($21,230,000) in 1911. The estimated 
appropriations by the provincial governments for the latter year, 
15,000,000 pesos, would raise the amount available for primary edu- 
cation to 37,000,000 pesos ($85,705,000), or very nearly $5 per capita 
of population. 
The principal cities of Argentina are very progressive in educa- 
tional matters, and their schools compare favorably with those of 
the principal cities of the United States and Europe, especially as 
regards buildings and equipment. Attention to the educational side, 
that is, to organization and methods of instruction, is indicated by 
the revolution in the system of drawing in the schools of Buenos 
Aires and La Plata. This change, which is due largely to the in-
-P-A-G-E-503
  
EDUCATION IN THE LATIN-AMERICAN STATES. 477 
vestigation of systems in the United States, has substituted for the 
constant copy of conventional forms the study of natural forms, their 
reproduction, and the analysis of their elements as a basis of design. 
In the broad scheme for reorganizing the public system of in- 
struction, which is under discussion by the Government, the closer 
coordination of all classes of schools is purposed, and hence experts 
recently sent to the United States and to Europe for educational 
investigations are instructed to observe particularly the relations 
between different orders of instruction, i. e., primary and secondary, 
general and technical, etc., in the principal countries. A practical 
experiment in the integration of different classes of schools in Argen-_ 
tina has been made by the recently established University of La 
Plata, which through its affiliated secondary school opens a direct 
course from the elementary school to the university. The university 
school is a model institution, combining some of the best features of 
English secondary schools with the cote, more natural life of schools 
of the type of Abbotsholme. wt ( 
The close relation between 2: schools and Gmirencitics 
which exists in Argentina, as in all other South American States, 
makes it difficult to give new direction to the secondary curriculum 
without the cooperation of the universities. The two classes of in-| 
stitutions offer a complete scheme of education, having little relation 
to the work of the primary school; the courses of instruction of the 
secondary schools (colegios) are the preparatory stage for the spe- 
cialized university faculties. The University of La Plata, with its 
secondary school, is, therefore, a new departure in education of 
great interest to all the Latin States. 
In the provision for technical and industrial education agricul- 
tural interests, which exceed in value all others in the State, claim 
first consideration. Five national schools of agriculture have been 
established in accordance with a decree of February 19, 1908; the 
higher school of agriculture which was created in 1904 was trans- 
ferred in 1909 to the University of Buenos Aires, and now has the 
dignity of 2 university faculty. 
  
BRAZIL. 
Brazil, covering an area exceeding that of the United States, ex- 
clusive of Alaska, comprises 20 States and the Federal District, 
having a total population of 21,461,100. The Federal Government 
is responsible for university education throughout the Union, but has 
no control of elementary schools outside of the Federal District. 
This district, under the fostering care of the Government, maintains 
an excellent system of public schools, in which respect it is rivaled 
by several of the States, in particular that of Sao Paulo, but there
-P-A-G-E-504
  478 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
are vast stretches of territory which are without the means of educa- 
tion. The latest statistics (1910) give for all the States a total of 
634,539 pupils in elementary schools, which is only 3 per cent of 
the population. The disposition on the part of leading men in the 
different States to remedy this condition, and to supply the means 
of education for the entire population, is indicated by a decree, bear- 
ing date April 5, 1911, which was sanctioned by the National Con- 
gress, providing for a reform in the system of public instruction. 
One feature of the proposed reform is a central board of education, 
charged with advisory functions and with the power of establishing 
schools in case the local governments neglect this duty. 
Rio de Janeiro, like the chief cities of the Latin States in general, 
is the seat of a number of special institutions for higher education 
and for commercial and technical training. The technical school 
(Escola Polytechnica do Rio de Janeiro) maintained by the Federal 
Government enjoys great distinction, not only in Brazil but in the 
adjoining States. 
The report of the minister of agriculture for 1912 shows that there 
is great activity in respect to provision for special training for the 
industries pertaining to agriculture in several States of the Republic. 
The schools under this ministry include a Superior School of Agri- 
culture and Veterinary Medicine, middle schools of agriculture, 
schools of agricultural apprenticeship, and traveling lecturers, be- 
sides the auxiliary agencies, namely, demonstration camps, model 
farms, breeding stations, and meteorological stations. 
According to a consular report — 
the Superior School of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine has just been 
installed in one of the Government buildings in Rio de Janeiro, and classes are 
expected to begin in April. Instruction will be divided into two special courses, 
one of agronomical engineering and the other of veterinary medicine. 
There are three middle schools of agriculture, which furnish the theoretical 
and practical education of which the conservative Brazilian farmer stands in 
need. One of these is attached to the breeding station at Pinheiro and was 
begun in 1912, another is situated in the town of Sao Francisco and has been 
in operation for two years, and the third is that of Rio Grande do Sul. The 
curriculum of these schools embraces the general principles of agriculture, 
zootechnics, and veterinary science, and is preferably concerned with the most 
usual and best-known branches of rural industry. This is considered the best 
possible type of school for Brazil, and official opinion as to the utility of these 
institutions is confirmed by the large number of applications for admission to 
those established, especially the one at Pinheiro, in Bahia. The third type of 
agricultural schools is the apprenticeship school, which teaches rational methods 
of exploiting land, the handling of agricultural implements, the breeding of 
cattle, the hygiene and feeding of animals, and various agrarian industries. 
Thus they are intended to supply capable workers for the rural farms and 
estates within a brief period. There are eight cf these schools, all in active 
operation, and others are being constructed.

EDUCATION IN THE LATIN-AMERICAN STATES. 479 
Traveling professors, chosen according to their specialties, the nature of their 
districts, etc., disseminate professional instruction in the various branches of 
agricultural industry. There are 12 of these instructors, and the system con- 
stitutes one of the most efficacious methods of developing agriculture, especially 
considering the fact that the benefits are more immediate and direct than those 
from the. schools. 
EXPERIMENTAL SUGAR PLANTATION—DAIRYING AND SERICULTURE SCHOOLS— 
REAFFORESTATION. 
Measures for developing agriculture and disseminating agricultural informa- 
tion are not confined altogether to the conducting of schools, however. Among 
other things the Government has established an experimental sugar plantation 
at Campos, in the State of Rio de Janeiro, and has decreed the establishment 
of another at Escada, State of Pernambuco. The sugar industry, formerly 
so prosperous, is said to be passing through a serious crisis, 1nd it is expected 
that these new institutions will be the source of considerable knowledge on the 
planting and rational cultivation of cane, distribution of selected plants, fer- 
tilizers necessary to increase the saccharine content, ete., which will increase 
production. It is expected that the new establishments will demonstrate the 
value of replacing the slow and costly method of boiling in large tanks by 
modern and economical machinery. The Secretary of Agriculture expresses 
the opinion that when these modern plants are adopted, the interior of the 
States is traversed by railway lines, and native sugar is used for the manufac- 
ture of native confectionery and preserves, the sugar industry will no longer 
suffer from the periodical fits of depression that mark it now. The Government 
expects to establish many more such experiment stations. 
Schools of dairying and sericulture have also been established, and an expert 
from the United States, who made an investigation to determine the practica- 
bility of using dry-farming methods in the north of the country, has aflirmed 
that this process can be adopted with absolute certainty of favorable results 
in the States whose soil, vegetation, and climate he studied. A demonstration 
camp is to be established in one of the States which suffer from the drought. 
The continuous destruction of the forests of Brazil has disturbed the hydro- 
graphic system of many rivers and has made necessary measures to protect the 
forests and to replant many of the waste lands formerly covered with trees. 
The botanical gardens were given the name of Forest Garden, and the scope 
of work considerably broadened in order to make a study of reafforestation ; 
and from May to August, 1912, 273,622 saplings of fruit-bearing and ornamental 
trees and shrubs were sent out to municipalities and private individuals. 
    BOLIVIA. 
Bolivia, in which the general diffusion of education is at present 
impossible, has the nucleus of future development in an excellent nor- 
mal school at Sucre, whose director, Dr. G. Rouma, is recognized as 
a leader in those psychological investigations which are bringing ele- 
mentary training into greater harmony with the natural interests 
and spontaneous activities of the young.

CHILE. 
The system of public instruction in Chile received its formal organi- 
zation by law of January 9, 1879, but education was the subject of 
Government concern from the time the Chilean patriots achieved 
their independence of Spanish rule, and especially after the adoption 
of the constitution of 1833, which assured stable government. The 
importance of a new order of secondary schools was early recognized, 
and as a means of avoiding the excessive literary tendencies of the 
schools established during the Spanish régime the Instituto Peda- 
gogico was founded (1813) for the training of professors for the 
secondary schools (liceos). German professors were invited to form 
the faculty of this institution, and as a consequence secondary edu- 
cation in Chile has developed under German influences and with a 
due proportion of scientific studies. The Pedagogical Institute is, in 
fact, a university school of education and the chief center of modern 
studies in South America. It was eventually opened to women, and 
thus widely extended its influence. 
The curriculum of the institute is divided into seven distinct 
sections, as follows: (1) Spanish; (2) French; (8) English; (4) Ger- 
man; (5) history and geography; (6) mathematics and physics; 
(7) biology, chemistry, and mineralogy. All students are required 
to take the strictly professional studies, namely, pedagogics, experi- 
mental psychology, logic, ethics, the history of philosophy, civics, 
and educational organization and legislation. 
In addition to the public liceos for general education, numbering 
89 for men with an enrollment of about 9,500 students and 31 for 
women with an enrollment of 6,400, the provision for secondary 
education comprises technical schools of recent origin, which have 
assumed great importance in the industrial and business world. 
They include commercial schools at Santiago, Valparaiso, Concep- 
cion, and other cities, which take pupils from 12 to 15 years of age 
and thus represent the first stage of commercial education. The 
school of mechanical arts at Santiago bears the same relation to 
industrial education; Santiago has also led in provision for the 
industrial training of girls by the establishment of a school in which 
such trades as dressmaking and millinery are taught, as well as 
bookkeeping, stenography, etc. 
The institutions for higher technical training maintained by the 
Government include a central agricultural institute and mining 
schools at La Serena, Santiago, and Copiapo. Textile industries 
are promoted by a private society, which maintains 14 schools, with 
about 1,000 pupils in training. The provision for various degrees 
and kinds of technical training and the scientific and literary char- 
acter of the Pedagogic Institute have given Chile educational leader- 
ship among the western States of South America.

PARAGUAY. 
The purpose of the Government of Paraguay with respect to the 
development of popular education is indicated by the appointment 
of a commission in 1911 charged to investigate the educational sys- 
tems of the United States and Europe and to make recommendations 
as to needed reforms in the system of their own country. 
  
PERU. 
The industrial enterprise which marks the current history of Peru 
has lead to close scrutiny of its educational condition and needs, and 
in 1909 measures looking to a complete reorganization of the system 
of public instruction were adopted. For the practical development 
of these measures assistance was sought by engaging a number of 
teachers and inspectors from the United States to take charge of in- 
dividual schools or for the practical oversight of particular districts. 
At the same time a specialist in educational administration, Dr. 
H. E. Bard, who had served in the educational department of the 
Philippines, was selected to act as a consulting expert to the minister 
of public instruction. As a result of prolonged investigations and 
conferences a bill providing for the complete reorganization of the 
system of public instruction was prepared, but before legislative 
action could be secured the change in the Government which took 
place in October of the present year interrupted the proceedings. 
While political and social conditions interfere with the progress 
of elementary education the traditions of the country favor the de- 
velopment of higher education not only in its literary and phil- 
osophical forms, but in tecnnical directions. The engineering school, 
established in 1876 and one of the highest rank in South America, 
has been extended during the year by the addition of a mechanico- 
electrical section which was formally opened April 28, 1912. 
The School of Arts and Crafts, established in 1905, has been en- 
riched on the art side by the addition of a department of sculpture 
and reorganized on the industrial side under the direction of an 
electrical engineer, Mr. Victor M. Arana, a graduate from the Uni- 
versity of Notre Dame, Ind. Mr. Arana was appointed head of the 
electrical department early in 1911, and through his efforts, heartily 
supported by the Government, shops and laboratory facilities have 
been provided. 
The new building of the naval school at La Punta (Lima), which 
was opened with due ceremony September 15, 1912, is the product 
of native skiil in design and construction. The building is of reen- 
forced concrete, with steel and concrete roof, and was erected at a 
cost of $70,000.  
-P-A-G-E-508
  482 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. : 
The greatest hindrance to educational progress is the embarrassed 
financial situation of the country, which, as explained by President 
Billinghurst in his first message to the Congress, demands the im- 
mediate and concentrated efforts of the Government. 
URUGUAY. 
The progressive movement in Uruguay, so far as it pertains to 
education, is directed first to the spread of elementary education, 
and second to the improvement of agriculture through the scientific 
training of farmers and landworkers. As the aboriginal races have 
disappeared from the country, it is freed from one of the greatest 
cbstacles in South American States to the spread of popular educa- 
tion. 
The laws of 1877 and 1885 regulating public instruction in 
Uruguay, afford the basis for a very good system, and in Montevideo 
this has been well developed. The elementary schools of this city are 
organized in three divisions, of which the lowest comprises three 
grades or years; the intermediate and highest divisions follow, each 
covering two years. The course of instruction for the three divi- 
sions includes a progressive course in manual training, beginning 
with the Froebelian gifts and ending with woodwork, after the sloyd 
system. The girls are taught housekeeping, cutting, and sewing, 
and gymnastics is practiced in all the schools. Medical inspection, 
which was authorized by law of August 7, 1908, is established in the 
city and includes the biennial examination of all teachers with re- 
gard to their health. 
According to the census of 1909, the Department of Montevideo 
comprised one-third of the total population of the State; in 1910 the 
enrollment in the primary schools of this Department was equivalent 
to one-third the total enrollment for Uruguay, namely, 76,000, and 
the number of teachers bore the same ratio to the total teaching 
force. Fully 95 per cent of the pupils and teachers in the Depart- 
ment were in the schools of the capital. In this city the current ex- 
penditure for primary schools for the year specified was $332,227, 
equivalent to $14.42 per capita of the enrollment, which gives Monte- 
video very good standing in this respect, as compared with cities of 
the same size in the United States. 
Professional interests are stimulated by the publication at the 
capital of the Anales de Instruccion Primaria, which keeps its read- 
ers informed as to the progress of popular education and promotes 
the discussion of principles and methods. The current volume, for 
instance, presents a comprehensive report on vocational education 
(ensefianza profesional) in Belgium, and a full account of the
-P-A-G-E-509

organization of the American public schools, based upon a study of 
the schools of New York City.t 
Among the State institutions maintained at Montevideo are two 
excellent normal schools, one for men and the other for women, a 
school of arts and trades, military college, and the university. 
Tn the rural districts of Uruguay primary education is in a back- 
ward state. A special investigation made in 1906 drew attention to 
the deplorable lack of suitable schoolhouses throughout the country 
and the bad condition of many that were in use. As a consequence 
of this revelation, above $1,000,000 were appropriated by the legisla- 
ture for new buildings and the improvement of the old, and at the 
same time a service of school inspection was organized. The interest 
thus aroused in the condition of the schools was stimulated by the 
census of 1909, which showed that 33 per cent of the people above 
6 years of age were illiterate, or considering the native Uruguayans, 
above 30 per cent. Efforts were at once made for the enforcement 
of the compulsory education law and for increasing the provision of 
schools. Nearly one-half the entire population is rural and widely 
distributed, the density of population being only 15 to the square 
mile, about the same as in Texas and Nebraska. It is proposed to 
establish a school within reach of every child of school age living in 
the country. Measures have also been taken to raise the standard of 
qualification for rural teachers who have generally little or no train- 
ing and are ignorant of modern ideals and methods of education. 
As a means of arousing interest in these matters, the Government 
has recently sent a select company of women teachers to the United 
States, with instruction to familiarize themselves with the organi- 
zation of primary schools, their methods, and in particular with the 
conduct of manual training. 
The endeavor to promote the general diffusion of elementary edu- 
cation is intimately related to measures for improving rural indus- 
tries. The most important measure bearing directly upon this pur- 
pose is a law, passed in the session of 1910, providing for the 
establishment of six agricultural experiment stations, with a maxi- 
mum of 2,500 acres of land and an appropriation of $20,845 for 
salaries and general operating expenses for each station. For the 
expenses of expropriation, construction, and installation, the maxi- 
mum sum of $827,000 was provided, and the entire work was placed 
in charge of an inspector general at an annual salary of $4,963. 
Elaborate arrangements are making for expositions to be held in 
1913 for the exploitation of the natural resources of the country. 
Among the number is an exposition to be held at Montevideo in 
April, under the auspices of the Rural Association of Uruguay,

which will be devoted to agricultural products, machinery, ete. A 
Government appropriation has been secured for this enterprise. 
The legislative appropriation for the service of public instruction 
amounted in 1911-12 to 3,100,725 pesos ($3,206,150), which was 
nearly one-tenth the entire budget. 
  
VENEZUELA. 
The Government of Venezuela has just entered upon the work of 
reorganizing the system of public instruction, after carefully ma- 
tured plans. Asa preliminary measure, Dr. Guillermo Todd, one of 
the leading professors of secondary education in the country, was 
commissioned to make extensive investigations in the United States 
with a view to advising as to reform measures, and soon after his 
return to Venezuela in 1911, was appointed special inspector of 
the colleges and Federal schools of the country and invested with 
broad advisory functions. These pertain to the means of securing 
the development of primary instruction in the municipalities; the 
development of modern programs for the colleges and schools; the 
selection of suitable illustrative material; the examination and pro- 
motion of pupils from grade to grade; personal instruction to teachers 
with respect to modern ideas and methods in education; advice as 
to textbooks for different grades of schools; the establishment of a 
pedagogical library and museum; close cooperation with the pro- 
fessors of the normal school, with reference both to the organization 
and conduct of that institution; and to the preparation of a manual 
similar to those in standard use in Europe and America, which will 
serve as a model for graduates of the institution in the ultimate 
cenduct of their own schools. 
In the report embodying the results of his investigations Dr. Todd 
dwells particularly upon the importance of normal schools as the 
essential factor in a system of public instruction. Those of his own 
country, he explains, are little more than repetition schools wanting 
in professional instruction and in means for the practical applica- 
tion of pedagogic principles. He expresses the confident belief, 
however, that his recommendations as to these institutions will com- 
mand the support of the minister, since on account of his education 
in Europe and his familiarity with the conditions of progress abroad 
he is able to appreciate their full force. The normal schools of the 
United States and Germany are referred to by Dr. Todd as models 
in respect to the scope of their training and their material resources. 
He cites also the opinion of a “ distinguished foreigner” who had 
jmade a recent tour in the Latin-American States and who was deeply
-P-A-G-E-511
EDUCATION IN THE LATIN-AMERICAN STATES. 485 
impressed by the fine buildings and ample equipments of the normal 
schools of Argentina and Uruguay. 
In view of this report, measures have already been adopted by the 
Government for the establishment of a model institution for training 
teachers, and an appropriation equivalent to $14,985 has been made 
for the purchase of modern school furniture for graded schools and 
an additional sum of nearly $6,000 for the purchase of illustrative 
material. The interests of industry and trade will be promoted by 
Government commercial schools in the leading cities and by a school 
of arts and trades for women to be established in Caracas. An ap- 
propriation has also been made for promoting agricultural education 
and plans have been formed for the equipment of a central agricul- 
tural school and experiment station. 
The backward condition of popular education in the Latin-Ameri- 
can States is in striking contrast to the development of university 
education and of the colleges preparatory to the former. This sub- 
ject is exhaustively treated in a bulletin recently published by this 
office.*

ENGLAND AND WALES. 
SYSTEM OF PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
The public elementary schools of England and Wales are adminis- 
tered in accordance with the education act of 1902, which abolished 
the former school boards and placed the schools under: the charge 
of the local authorities (county and borough councils), and admitted 
private schools (chiefly parochial) to share in the local taxes, al- 
though under private management. Schools are supervised by local 
committees, but are subject to Government inspection. In 1911 there 
were 21,294 ordinary elementary schools, of which 8,377 were council 
(public) schools, with accommodation. for 4,012,544 children, and 
12,917 were voluntary (private), with accommodation for 2,839,576 
children. Enrollment, 6,044,284, or 16.7 per cent of the population;

CURRENT MOVEMENTS. 
The present year (1912) promises to bring to a close the third 
period in the history of the State-aided system of elementary educa- 
tion in England and Wales, which dates from the passage of the 
education act of 1902; for while as yet no measure embodying liberal 
policies in respect to this matter has been submitted, the leaders of 
the Government are publicly committed to the support of such a 
measure. Notwithstanding continued opposition to the act of 1902, 
its benefits are fully recognized, and its best features will undoubtedly 
be preserved in a new education act. Under the county system and 
the extension of local taxes to inspected private (parochial) schools, 
these have been raised to the level of the public schools, a change of 
enormous importance in rural districts, which have no other provi- 
sion; further, the elementary schools have been brought into closer 
relations with the secondary and technical schools of the country. 
Meanwhile, by reason of supplementary measures, in particular the 
act of 1906," providing for the supply of food to school children, and 
the act of 1907,? increasing the administrative scope of local educa- 
tion authorities, the school system has become the medium for many 
services directed to the general welfare of the young. 
SCHOOL ATTENDANCE, 
The school provision of the country is practically complete, the 
accommodation being slightly in excess of the estimated demand. In

large cities the movement of population may at any time cause a 
deficiency of places in one section, even while there is excess in an- 
other; in London, for instance, this is a constantly recurring diffi- 
culty, unavoidable but temporary. The enrollment in all classes of 
public elementary schools for the latest year reported (1910-11) was 
6,067,075; of this number 27,791 were in schools for the deaf, the 
blind, and other defectives, leaving in schools for normal chil- 
dren 6,044,284, equivalent to 16.7 per cent of the total population 
(36,075,269). The average enrollment was 6,036,944, and on this 
number an average attendance of 89 per cent was maintained. En- 
rollment in the public elementary schools has declined since 1909 
on account of the exclusion of children under 5 years of age, the with- 
drawal of children above 12, and the effort to draw off the most 
promising children into secondary schools. The average attendance, 
on the contrary, steadily increases; for 1912 it is estimated at 
5,550,000, or 90 per cent of the enrollment. It appears, therefore, 
. that school attendance for the time actually required is in a fairly 
satisfactory condition. : 
The steady approach to a common limit for obligatory school 
attendance is shown by the fact that 320 local authorities out of 
827 have adopted by-laws covering the full time—i. e., 5 to 14 years 
of age—authorized by the education law. Unfortunately, however, 
the provisions for partial and total exemption are many and various; 
so that a large proportion of pupils cease to attend school at 12 years 
of age and drift into casual occupations or into idleness and vagrancy. 
The school-attendance bill introduced during the current session of 
Parliament was intended to correct this evil. It provided uniform 
conditions for exemption, as follows: A child must satisfy the 
authority that he (a) has attained the age of 13 years, and (0) is 
about to enter into some employment which will, in the opinion of 
the authority, be beneficial to him. The measure had strong sup- 
port, but failed to get through the slow course of parliamentary pro- 
cedure. 
TEACHERS. 
The number of teachers of all grades employed in the schools in 
1911 was 156,266, a decline of 3,248 in two years. This decrease is 
offset by improvement in professional competency. The number of 
trained certificated teachers rose from 47,064 in 1909 to 52,593 in 
1911. The number who without training succeeded in passing at 
least the lower certificate examination increased in the same time 
from 39,672 to 40,351. In other words, one-third of the teachers had 
been specially trained for their work, an additional one-fourth had 
passed an easy examination, while a little less than half the force had 
no assured qualification for the work of teaching. 
 
-P-A-G-E-516
  490 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
The status of the elementary teachers has been somewhat improved 
by the new superannuation act, which was the only one of several 
education bills introduced into Parliament during the session of 
1911-12 that was placed upon the statute book. This measure doubles 
the present rate of allowance, namely, 10s., for each year of recorded 
service; it also increases by 50 per cent the rates of £1 for men and 
13s. 4d. for women at which disablement allowances are caleulated in 
respect of each year of service after the first 10 years. The contribu- 
tions of men teachers to the deferred-annuity fund are increased 
from £3 10s. to £3 12s. per annum; the future rates of contributions 
for both men and women teachers are made fixed and unchangeable. 
The act comprises a scheme of superannuation for other than ele- 
mentary teachers—i. e., secondary and technical teachers—in accord- 
ance with regulations that have yet to be worked out. A special fund 
from the treasury, equivalent to a perpetual annuity of £200,000, was 
placed at the disposal of the minister for the purposes of this act. 
In this connection it may be noted that the board of education has . 
introduced a four years’ course in the training colleges for teachers, 
which, for the present at least, will be optional, Experience has 
shown that, a three years’ course, with the required practice, is not 
sufficient time for the students to prepare adequately either for the 
final examination or for the work which they are to enter. The 
optional course has been made attractive by pecuniary arrangements 
which secure to the men students who live at the college hostel £35 
($175) a year, instead of the £30 ($150) at present received; and to 
the women students £25 ($125), instead of the present £15 ($75). 
‘The significant fact in all these arrangements is the sympathetic 
attitude of the present education department toward elementary 
school-teachers. It remains true, however, that appointments and 
salaries are all in the hands of local authorities, and the complaint is 
made that many of these authorities are indifferent in the matter and 
offer very meager salaries. In his speech on the budget estimates 
Mr. Pease said: 
I stood almost aghast when I realized what the position was when I came to 
my present position. The average salary of an elementary school-teacher was 
£145 ($725) for men and £99 ($495) for women. 
In the large cities, which vie with each other to secure the best 
teachers, the average salary is much higher; this consideration, how- 
ever, is offset by the still lower average in small towns and rural 
districts. 
In addition to the efforts for improving the financial prospects of 
the teachers, the education department during the current year has 
established the long-desired teachers’ registration council. This body 
is, first of all, to determine the conditions upon which teachers shall

be. placed on the register; and as:all teachers are included, whether 
elementary or secondary, the register will fix the standard for pro- 
fessional recognition. 
WELFARE WORK AND MEDICAL INSPECTION, 
The entire life of the children of the humbler classes has become 
a matter of public concern, through the operation of the act of 1906 
providing for the supply of meals to needy children attending public 
elementary schools, and the act of 1907, making it the duty of the 
local councils to provide for the medical inspection of school. chil- 
dren and authorizing the use of public funds for the recreation and 
physical training of pupils. The general direction of these new 
activities and duties is committed to the board of education, and 
thus from the outset means haye been provided for unifying and 
equalizing the work throughout the Kingdom. The board. of educa- 
tion has regarded the provision for the medical inspection of schools as 
part of a general moyement, including also the act of 1906, and hence 
- in plans for the service of medical inspection its relations to other 
forms of welfare work have been kept in view. 
In 1907 a medical department was organized in the board, and 
Dr. George Newman was appointed chief medical officer.. This 
appointment secured for the direction of the service a man eminent 
in the field of bacteriological research, an authority on subjects of 
hygiene and public health and experienced also in the practical 
duties of a medical officer. Associated with Dr. Newman was Dr. 
Alfred Eichholz, member of the staff of Government inspectors, and 
subsequently the department was strengthened by the addition of 
Dr. Janet Mary Campbell, formerly in the service of the London 
County Council, and Dr. Henry Crowley, formerly medical officer at 
Bradford. The four reports of the chief medical officer already 
issued are replete with information and suggestions valuable to all 
persons engaged in the service of public health and sanitation. In 
his third report (covering 1910), Dr. Newman asserts in emphatic 
terms the national importance of the service with which he is charged. 
On this subject he says: 
The conditions of life, both in respect of personal hygiene and of environment, 
which result in a high mortality among infants under 1 year of age, lead at the 
same time to a high degree of sickness and disablement among children of school 
age, and in the same way, and probably in even greater degree, sickness and 
disease of children lead to disease and disablement among adolescents and 
adults. 
The whole business, both of inspection and, treatment of children, must be 
viewed as an undertaking of absolute necessity, if the health and physical fitness 
of the Nation is first to be secured and then maintained. : .

  492 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
While approaching this subject with great professional experience 
and enthusiasm, Dr. Newman recognizes that these qualities alone 
will not suffice for an efficient enforcement of the law. “No amount 
of medical skill, experience, and industry,” he says, “can of itself 
avail to do what is requisite without a large measure of administrative 
ability.” 
In England, as he explains: 
Successful administration is dependent upon an effective coordination between 
all the local authorities concerned with health questions in an area, and upon 
a genuine and intimate cooperation between their officers, medical men, health 
visitors, school nurses, teachers, and attendance officers. Secondly, the differ- 
ent branches of school medical work need to be unified under the school medical 
officer. 
The branches which should thus be unified are: 
Medical inspection, medical treatment, the sanitation of schools, the provision 
and management of special schools for the defective, physical training, and 
the feeding of school children. These six activities are but parts of one "mder- 
taking in behalf of the children, and the full value and effect of these contribu- 
tory factors can only be secured as they are corelated and associated together 
in each area.* 
THE FUNCTION OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION. 
The duties thrown upon the board of education in respect to the 
service of medical inspection being of a purely advisory nature, the 
medical department began its work by the issue of circulars to the 
local authorities responsible for carrying out the provisions of the 
law. The scope and practical spirit of these circulars are clearly 
indicated by the subjects of which they treat, namely: Organiza- 
tion of the local service (Circular 576) ; schedule of medical inspec- 
tion (582) ; scope of the service (596) ; form of reports (728). 
Although the board of education is chiefly an advisory body, it 
has a compelling authority in regard to medical inspection through 
the control of conditions upon which the parliamentary grants for 
elementary education are disbursed. Immediately upon the passage 
of the law authorizing the service, certain conditions pertaining to 
it were embodied in the annual code, or body of regulations, with 
which a school must comply in order to secure a share of the grant. 
The sections of the code for 1912 pertaining to this matter are as 
follows: 
Satisfactory provision must be made for the medical inspection of children 
attending the school in accordance with section 138°(1) (b) of the Education 
(administrative provisions) Act, 1907. (Sec. 25 ¢.) 
The board must be satisfied that provision has been made for the school in 
the year, and of all children who are expected to leave school in the year—the 
year in each, case being the 12 months ending on the 31st of July. (Sec, 58 db.)

STATE OF MEDICAL INSPECTION. 
From the report of the medical officer for 19111 it appears that 
the schedule of medical inspection issued by the board has been 
adopted by 302 out of the 317 local authorities responsible for the 
execution of the law. These authorities reported for the schools 
under their control an average attendance in 1911 of 5,371,662 pupils. 
According to the official basis of estimate, the number of children 
subject to medical inspection—namely, those just entering and just 
leaving school—was 1,365,000. The “special cases,” about 250,000, 
would bring the total to one and a half millions. The services of 
943 medical officers were required, including 74 women working in 
47 different areas. Reports of the service were received at the cen- 
tral office from all the local offices, as required by law. 
In connection with the medical inspection, 212 local education 
authorities have appointed nurses or health visitors; the number of 
these auxiliary assistants for the year was 353, of whom 74 gave 
their entire time to the work. 
The pressing need of medical inspection is shown by. the mere 
summary of conditions disclosed in the last year. Of the children 
attending the schools, 10 per cent had defective eyesight, 4 per cent 
defective hearing, 7 per cent adenoids or enlarged tonsils, 40, per cent 
decayed teeth, 38 per cent were suffering from utter neglect of clean- 
liness, 1 per cent were tuberculous, and nearly 2 per cent had heart 
disease. Seventy-two authorities were giving free spectacles to 
children needing them, 22 authorities made provision for treating 
children in hospitals, and 48 authorities had established free clinics. 
Special interest attaches to the report of the medical inspection in 
London on account of the vast population to be dealt with and also 
because the London council did not immediately comply with the 
requirements of the board. The differences between the two bodies 
having ceased, the work is proceeding in accordance with the code 
conditions. Decided changes are therefore taking place in the system 
of inspection that has been long maintained in the metropolis. 
The summary for London shows— 
that medical inspection of some kind was carried out in 393 schools (in a total 
of 925) during the year (1910-11), and that 172,619 children were examined, 
of whom 42,886 were entrants and leavers as defined in the code, 23,214 were 
children between 8 and 9, and 5,812 were “specials” referred for medical 
examination by the teachers. 
' The year under review not only saw the system of medical inspec- 
tion of school children in practical operation in every administrative 
area, but gave new and very convincing proof of the determination 
of the Government in this matter by a grant specifically assigned to   
1Issued by the board of education, 1912.

the work. The amount of this grant, £60,000 ($292,000), is not-large. 
and the regulations for its distribution are not yet definitely deter- - 
mined, but from the present outlook it is certain that the amount will 
be increased as the demand arises. “It is evident also that the health 
care work. will not be restricted to the perfunctory examination of 
school children as they enter and pass out of school; measures’ will 
be taken to carry the benefits of the service into humble homes, to 
stimulate, improve, and organize parental cooperation in the effort 
to safeguard the public health by insuring that of the rising genera- | 
tions. This form of effort is reenforced by the provisions of the 
national insurance act relative to allowance for the sick, sanatoria 
for consumptives, ete. One of the chief medical authorities of the 
Kingdom declares that the full development of that act depends upon 
the health of the children at the public elementary schools The 
ultimate hope of national health lies in the fact that the typical child 
“attending school from 5 to 14 is under continuous supervision by 
one authority.” 
AUXILIARY AGENCIES. 
The complement of such supervision is found in the various reme- 
dial agencies which had been provided in a few places even before the 
Government moved in the matter. 
Among these agencies are open-air schools, playground classes, and 
country schools for town children, which counteract the enfeebling 
influences of city life and indoor confinement. 
Arrangements are made for open-air classes in several ways. Of 
these the simplest is that of utilizing a selected classroom for the 
purpose. In such. cases the window space is greatly extended, in 
order to provide a constant flow of fresh air, and the number of chil- 
dren restricted to half the number-in an ordinary classroom. The 
children are selected by the medical inspector. This experiment has 
worked so well in Monmouthshire that the county education commit- 
tee recommend that in plans for new schools a special open-air class- 
room should be included. _ 
A second method is that of conducting classes in the playgrounds. 
The London authorities during the year maintained 50 such classes 
in session from April to September. Similar classes have been con- 
ducted in London in the playgrounds of schools for the defective, 
i. e., the blind and the deaf-mute, under the immediate supervision ai 
a medical officer of health, 
The experiment of sending children out from congested districts of 
large cities to country places for the purpose of education and health 
was continued duriny the year by public or private agencies centered

in London and five other cities. With few exceptions, the country 
schools referred to have been in operation for two or three years." 
THE PROVISION OF MEALS, 
The main purpose of the supply of meals at public expense, as 
provided for by the act of 1906, is to insure that no child shall fail 
through lack of food to profit from the provision made by the State 
for its education. On the relation between this provision and the 
medical inspection authorized by the act of 1907 the chief medical 
officer says: - 
It is certain that malnutrition and physical defects are closely associated and 
react upon each other, but it is difficult to determine their exact relation in each 
child or to say in what degree malnutrition causes the other physical evils. 
Merely to increase the supply of food would in many cases not solve the complex 
problem of the individual child, although in many cases lack of food lies. at the 
root of the mischief. I am convinced that any work which a local education 
authority can usefully do to combat malnutrition must be done as a branch of 
their medical work; and that on grounds of service as well as of convenience 
the provision of meals must, as far as possible, be effectively connected with the 
machinery of the school medical service. 
From a tabulated summary relating to the supply of meals at public 
expense, it appears that in 1910-11, of the 322 local administrative 
areas in England and Wales, 117, including 54 counties, 35 boroughs, 
and 28 urban districts, made provision for feeding children. The 
expenditure brought upon the local taxes varied greatly, falling as 
low as £3 ($15) in the small borough of Bury St. Edmunds and 
reached its maximum, £48,126 ($234,892), in London. The amount 
claimed from the local tax was generally at the rate of half a penny 
in the pound. The total number of meals furnished to school chil- 
dren in 1910-11 by local authorities outside of London was 7,634,395. 
The total for London was 8,487,824. On an average the London 
authorities fed 41,672 children every week. 
The final outcome of this service as it appears to Dr. Newman is 
significant. On this subject he says: 
In anything like the social and economic conditions which now prevail, the 
work which the local education authority can do in directly preventing and 
remedying the evils of malnutrition has somewhat definite limits. The proper 
and sufficient feeding of the child is primarily the function of the home, and it 
is to the gradual improvement of the home that local education authorities must 
look for relief from the spécial difficulties which confront them through the 
malnutrition of the child. To the agencies which are working in that direction 
local education authorities can themselves contribute materially by bringing 
into the home, through their own schools and classes and through their medical 
and nursing services, knowledge of the best ways of feeding and caring for 
children.”

EXTENSION OF MEDICAL SERVICE TO JUVENILE WORKERS. 
The basis for public action in respect to safeguarding young peo- 
ple who are early thrust into industries is provided by the act of 
November 28, 1910, which authorized the education authorities to 
give assistance to boys and girls under 17 years of age in securing 
employment. For this purpose employment committees advisory to 
the education authorities are appointed and juvenile labor bureaus 
established. Through these agencies attention has been called to the 
physical condition of the boys and girls seeking employment, which 
is found to have a very important bearing upon their success.1 Al- 
ready in some cities medical inspection is maintained over school 
children employed out of school*hours or under partial exemption, 
and plans are considered for extending the inspection to young people 
above 14 years of age who are at work in factories. Such a plan has 
already been carried out at Dewsbury, where the school medical offi- 
cer is also the certifying factory surgeon. The London County 
Council in its capacity as education authority has made arrange- 
ments whereby school children placed in employment may be kept 
under supervision until 18 years of age. Similar arrangements have 
also been made by the Birmingham authorities. Some idea of the 
magnitude of this proposed work may be formed from the fact that 
between 2,500 and 3,000 children were placed in employment by the 
advisory committees every week during the past year. 
The organization and extension of welfare work is the chief feature 
of the current record of elementary education in England. In re- 
spect to this service England has suddenly taken a foremost place 
among nations. . The significant lesson of this achievement, reiterated 
by the chief medical officer, is that of the close relation of the various 
forms of welfare work and their dependence upon professional skill 
and knowledge. This lesson is emphasized: by the action of the Lon- 
don council, which is responsible for the largest school population 
in the world comprised under one authority. In the reorganization 
of the work of medical inspection the London council has placed the 
medical inspection of children, which was formerly dealt with by the 
public health department, and the work of medical treatment, which 
devolved upon the education department, under the sole control of 
the chief medical officer of the county. 
PROVISION FOR VOCATIONAL TRAINING. 
The problem of vocational training engages great attention in 
manufacturing and commercial centers of England, but no marked 
advance has been made during the year toward its adequate solution.

GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 497 
The higher orders of technical training, as experience shows, are 
more readily secured than that elementary provision which prepares 
the great body of laborers for industry, opportunity, and good citi- 
zenship. The lack of agencies for the continued training of children 
beyond the primary school is declared by Mr. Péase, president of the 
board of education, to be “the great blot on the English system.” 
The drop in school attendance of children above 12 years of age is 
alarming. More than one-third leave by the time they are 13; last 
year the pupils between the ages of 14 and 15 numbered only 36,000, 
being one-sixth the number between the ages of 12 arid 13. It is 
estimated that 6 out of 7 children never appear in school after reach- 
ing the age of 15. “At any rate,” says the minister, “ the proportion 
of individuals who are educated only up to the age of 14 is excessive, 
and enormous sums of this country’s money are being wasted because 
we have no proper system of continuing the education of our young 
people.” 
The existing agencies for vocational training available for those 
who make up the great industrial army consists of evening technical 
schools, trade schools, day and evening, and tutorial classes con- 
ducted under the combined auspices of the universities and the 
Workers’ Educational Association. The trade schools and technical 
classes serve in the main those who are already at work. The tutorial 
classes are not vocational, but have a broader educational aim. ‘They 
are due to the efforts of workingmen themselves for the development, 
social and civic, of their own class. The vocational problem is quite 
different, but here again the help of the workers and also that of 
the employers of labor is essential, and the most hopeful sign in re- 
spect to this matter is the recent action of these two factors. 
The Trades-Union Congress, at its annual meeting in September, 
unanimously adopted a resolution embodying an elaborate scheme of 
education and nurture for children, of which one clause is as fol- 
lows: 
That secondary and technical education be an essential part of every child’s 
education, and secure by such a reform and extension of the scholarship 
system as will place a maintenance scholarship within the reach of every child, 
and thus make it possible for all children to be full-time day pupils up to the 
age of 16. 
On the part of employers, the example of the North Eastern Rail- 
way Co. may be cited. They send some of their young people to 
the Armstrong College, at Newcastle, and not only pay their fees, 
but also their wages while they are attending technical classes. In 
this matter the company is doing voluntarily what several German 
States are obliging employers to do, and what, it is urged, England 
must soon require by law.  
-P-A-G-E-524
  498 EDUCATION: REPORT, 1912. 
In regard to provision for the higher orders of technical training 
the industrial centers of the Kingdom—Birmingham, Manchester, 
Leeds, ete.—are making wonderful strides by the establishment of 
municipal technical schools, which open a way from the higher 
elementary ‘schools to the provincial universities, with which the 
technical schools are in close relation. 
AGENCIES FOR RURAL UPLIFT. 
The establishment of continuation schools fitted to the needs of 
the rural population as a whole progresses very slowly. The report 
of the. Rural Education Conference, published in May, 1911, dealt 
particularly with this condition, and suggested a type of higher 
grade rural school as one means of improvement. The report of the 
conference, issued in November, 1911, deals with the consolidation 
of rural elementary schools, and as a result of extensive investigation 
expresses approval of the principle of consolidation, urges its adop- 
tion in suitable localities, and a special grant from the Government 
to aid in such experiments. The conference has issued two reports 
during the current year. The first, dated February 27, 1912, embodies 
the results of an inquiry into the courses of study for agricultural 
colleges; and the latest, bearing date June 13, 1912, treats of the co- 
ordination of the various agencies engaged in the work. Thus, while 
the county authorities almost without exception have provided for 
a system of agricultural education, the conference supplies expert 
opinions and directions to guide in the choice and conduct of agencies. 
The elementary stages of training for rural industries as at present 
developed in England comprise gardening, which is taught in 48 of 
the 49 county areas in England, and in 11 of the 13 in Wales. About 
80,000 pupils take the subject. Dairying as a subject in elementary 
schools has only 180 pupils, chiefly girls. The teaching of domestic 
economy, including practical work in sewing, cooking, and other 
household arts, is required in all the schools for girls above the 
lowest or infant grade. The number of pupils reported in cookery 
classes in 1911 was about 320,000, and in laundry work 120,000. Of 
the total more than one-third were in schools outside of London and 
the other large cities. This work, which is increasing year by year, 
is effecting great improvement in the home life of rural communities. 
The county system of agricultural education’ has made progress 
during the year. This provision is only one feature of a broad 
policy which includes the scheme of small holdings, under the act of 
1907, improved rural housing and sanitation, reafforestation, and 
1See Report of the Commissioner of Education, 1911, vol. 1, Ch. X, pp. 382-385.

scientific farming. These projects are promoted by the farm schools 
and colleges of agriculture, whose effects are seen in the increased 
output of small farms and the spirit excited in owners and land 
agents. The schools and colleges which are also supplying to 
England a body of experts for the growing services of agricultural 
research, have the benefit of the treasury grant for agricultural 
education and research, amounting in 1912 to £18,840 ($89,562). 
The welfare activities covered by the latest report of the chief 
medical officer (1911) include measures for extending the benefits 
of public care and supervision to children below and above the school 
age. Among these measures must be included provision for teach- 
ing infant care, described as “ mother craft.” -As a consequence of 
a memorandum on the teaching of infant care and management in 
public elementary schools,’ such instruction is rapidly becoming a 
part of the ordinary school course for girls and of the professional 
training for teachers. In the opinion of the medical officer, continu- 
ation classes and schools for teaching infant care and child hygiene 
to both mothers and girls are even more desirable. Experiments of 
this kind are reported from several towns, and in the county of 
Derbyshire an organizer has been appointed to arrange and supervise 
the teaching of home management, personal hygiene, etc. As yet no 
public authority has definite responsibilities in regard to. these mat- 
ters, beyond the immediate province of the school, but there is a 
growing recognition of the need of such provision. 
EXPANDING SCOPE OF THE STATE SYSTEM, 
The movement for vocational education in England is closely re- 
lated to the upward expansion of the system by subsidizing private 
secondary schools which accept official inspection, and by the con- 
tinuance of the work formerly conducted by the science and art. 
department. ‘ 
The number of private schools coming into the arrangement is 
steadily increasing, and although the system does not accord with 
the rising spirit of democracy, it has turned to public service many 
endowments which were practically running to waste. 
The regulations issued by the department during the year for 
grant-aided technical institutions bring to an end the famous South 
Kensington system, with it elaborate lists of specific subjects from 
which students might choose, its syllabi for guidance and control, 
and its official examinations. The specific subjects are replaced by a 
grouped course arranged in junior, senior, and advanced sections.   
1Board of Education, Circular 758, 1910. 
 
-P-A-G-E-526
  500 EDUCATION. REPORT, 1912. 
Only two examinations are required in the course, and these may be 
conducted by the institutions themselves with the cooperation of an 
official examiner. Thus, throughout the system there is the evident 
purpose to meet the needs of students rather than to maintain tradi- 
tional standards. 
The present scope of the State-aided system is summed up in sub- 
stance by the minister as follows: 
In addition to the 5,500,000 children in average attendance at ele- 
mentary schools there are 982 inspected secondary schools, with 
170,700 pupils; 84 technical colleges, with nearly 13,000 students; 
and in various technical classes throughout the country about 
830,000 pupils. In addition to these institutions, all of which are 
aided from the public treasury, the education department dispenses 
grants to 22 universities and other higher institutions. Estimates 
submitted by Mr. Pease for the support of this system for 1912, so 
far as it is borne by the Government, amounted to £14,500,000 
($70,470,000). Of this sum, £13,750,000 ($66,825,000) was distrib- 
uted in grants in one form or other, and £159,000 ($772,740) in pen- 
sions for elementary teachers. The balance was required for the 
administrative work of the board of education. 
SCOTLAND. 
  
Scotland has an advantage over England in the unity of its edu- 
cational system, with the consequent coordination of all grades and 
classes of institutions and the maintenance of the open door from 
the elementary school to the university, which was the boast of the 
old parish system. 
The following statistics show the different classes of schools below 
the university plane that are supported or fostered by public funds:

The primary and higher grade schools correspond to the elementary 
schools of England; their enrollment (845,055) was equivalent. to 
174 per cent of the population. The tendency to enter children at 
the earliest statutory age, 5 years, is encouraged by the school authori- 
ties, and it is noted with satisfaction that 20 per cent of the pupils 
are below 7 years of age; at the same time efforts are made to con- 
tinue the attendance of children at school after the upper statutory 
limit, i. e., 14 years, is reached. These efforts are promoted by the 
close coordination of the different classes of schools; as indicated by 
the normal age limits, pupils may pass from the ordinary pri- 
mary schools into the higher grade schools or the secondary schools 
at 12 years of age, or may complete the primary school course and 
continue their studies in continuation classes. 
MEASURES FOR PROLONGING SCHOOL ATTENDANCE. 
Apart from the success of the efforts to get all the children under 
instruction, the current events of greatest interest in Scotland relate 
to the new powers conferred upon the school boards by the education 
act of 1908. This act authorized the boards to make attendance com- 
pulsory at continuation schools, and, further, to provide for the 
physical and social improvement of the school children. The system 
of continued education begins in the ordinary schools with the sup- 
plementary classes, which lead to the continuation school and thence 
to higher institutions. 
SUPPLEMENTARY CLASSES. 
The supplementary classes have vitalized the work of the pri- 
mary schools by providing special facilities for the more capable 
pupils without breaking up the unity of the lower classes. The 
classes are parallel with the last two years of the regular course, but 
follow special programs with vocational ends in view, according to 
local conditions.’ Children are transferred from the regular to the

supplementary classes upon examination and the record of previous 
work; special teachers are employed, and thus while backward and 
mediocre pupils pursue the elementary course to the end, the more 
capable children get the full benefit of the school provision.* 
The number of pupils approved for transfer to supplementary 
classes in 1911 was 59,406, and the special grants allowed for the 
same were claimed on an average attendance of 47,565 in 2,000 schools 
out of the total, 3,369. These figures are emphasized by the reports 
of the Government inspectors. 
The inspector for the Western Division (population 2,216,288) 
reports for Glasgow 56 supplementary courses, with 3,146 pupils, 
which number he hopes to see increased shortly to 5,000 or 6,000. 
Provision is made for instructing the boys and girls separately, with 
a view of giving the girls training in cookery and the domestic arts, 
mending garments, nursing children and the sick, housekeeping, 
with advice regarding the purchase of household necessities, which 
subjects, the inspector observes, are naturally taught by a woman 
only. 
The inspector for the Southern Division (population 1,229,983) 
gives the following statistics showing the character and growth of 
the supplementary classes in one district, population 135,062.

The inspector observes that— 
The teaching of these subjects is usually in the hands of special teachers, 
and follows recognized and well-defined lines. An exception to this rule is 
gardening, for which a special teacher is not available. The gardens have, 
however, all been laid out under the supervision of either the West or the Hast 
of Scotland College of Agriculture, and the officers of one or other of the 
colleges have given advice as to syllabuses of instruction. 
Highland Division—According to the inspector the subjects which 
have up till now figured less frequently in supplementary courses 
than one could wish are branches like cookery, laundry work, wood- 
work, and school gardening. Their introduction into the smaller 
schools has been retarded by various causes, of which the principal 
are the reluctance of boards to face the initial expense, the want of

specially qualified teachers, and also the prejudice not infrequently 
entertained with regard to these branches by the public or by school 
managers. This attitude, however, is now becoming less common, 
nor, indeed, was it at any time universal. Further, school boards are 
now combining to maintain a special teacher, which reduces the cost. 
CONTINUATION CLASSES. 
Continuation classes are regulated by a special code applicable to 
either day or evening sessions. School boards may enact by-laws 
making attendance at, such classes obligatory up to the age of 17 
years. For 1911-12, 603 authorities reported classes of this kind in 
1,150 centers, an increase of 34 over the previous year, when the num- 
ber of pupils was 137,180. ‘Sixteen school boards have framed com- 
pulsory by-laws requiring attendance upon the continuation classes, 
but the boards, as a rule, are moving very slowly in this respect, pre- 
ferring rather to excite an interest in the classes by rendering them 
practically effective. 
The courses of study for continuation classes are arranged in four 
divisions, of which the first is for the completion of general elemen- 
tary education; of the remainder two are specialized courses, either 
theoretical or strictly trade and technical, such as bookbinding, elec- 
trical engineering, etc.; the fourth course comprises subjects of varied 
character, i. e., dressmaking, military drill, repoussé work, ete. 
Pupils who complete the full three years’ course in the continua- 
tion classes are prepared for admission to the central institutions, 
which form the crown of the system of practical education as dis- 
tinguished from the system of liberal education. The latter shows 
no decline by reason of the new provision which has arisen in re- 
sponse to new conditions and demands that have simply enlarged and 
enriched the field for the exercise of the highest orders of training 
and talent. 
The 16 central institutions are distinctively technical in character ; 
they are aided by Government grants, subject. to close supervision, 
conveniently placed to meet the requirements of the entire country, 
and have such relations with the universities that students, if they 
desire, may eventually complete their studies in the latter and secure 
a full degree. Naturally, technical and trade courses have been 
most highly developed both in the continuation classes and in the 
central institutions, but agriculture is engaging more and more 
attention. 4 
The admirable working of the county systems in England has led to 
similar measures in the Northern Division of the United Kingdom. 
Schemes recently formed for the extension of the work of agricul- 
tural colleges to the farming people include the appointment of a 
college organizer for each county or group of counties comprised in

the college area, dairy and poultry instructresses, and, in the case of 
the crofting districts comprised in the area of the Aberdeen College, 
the appointment of special crofter instructors. The formation of 
local advisory committees to assist the staffs of the colleges in the 
organization of the extension work is a feature of the schemes.

WELFARE WORK. 
The general welfare work in behalf of children is not so highly 
developed in Scotland as in England; a few Scotch cities, however, 
show remarkable progress in this respect. The Edinburgh system of 
providing meals for poor children and also the system under which 
the pupils leaving school are aided in getting suitable employment 
have both attracted wide attention. In the Western Division of Scot- 
land all the counties except Argyle have established medical inspec- 
tion as a county service, and in the county named the work is only 
temporarily delayed. In the burgh of Peterhead, in the north of 
Scotland, through the concerted action of churches, charity organiza- 
tions, and the school board, a joint council has been formed, to which 
are committed all the services comprised under the head of welfare 
work, namely, child welfare from birth to the age of 16, juvenile- 
employment bureau, medical inspection of school children, feeding 
and clothing of school children, and charity organizations. 
IRELAND. 
The reform of é¢ducation in Ireland, to use a phrase which has 
become common in the discussion of conditions in that island, awaits 
the issue of the pending legislation on home rule. Meanwhile, educa- 
tional progress appears from the official reports and is admitted even 
by candid observers who do not favor present conditions. The bishop 
of Limerick, in a recent address, eulogizes the very systems which are 
 
-P-A-G-E-532
  
  506 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
under a constant fire of criticism—the intermediate and the primary— 
as follows: 
In recent years all education in Ireland has made great advances. Under the 
commissioners of intermediate education we must allow, although we need not 
admire their system of examinations, that secondary education has received a 
very strong and vigorous impulse. 
And, what touches us here more nearly, we have in town and country as 
complete, as efficient, as well organized a system of primary education as you 
will find in any country, with, perhaps, the exception of Germany and Scotland. 
I know very well that a different opinion is nowadays expressed by speakers 
on public platforms, but for myself I prefer to exercise my own judgment, 
founded on a long and intimate acquaintance with our schools, than be led by 
these persons, the most of whom, as our Yankee friends would express it, are 
“talking through their hats.” 
And I think that I may appeal to the business community of Limerick to 
bear me out in what I say of our primary schools. The greater number of 
them in this city are conducted by the Christian Brothers and I dare say that 
before a Limerick audience it is not necessary to argue their capability to train 
the intellect or form the character of youth. 
We have also some very fine National schools. I happen myself to be offi- 
cially connected with one of them, Leamy’s School, and I ¢an affirm on my own 
knowledge that it is a school of the very first order. 
The National system, to which that schoel belongs, has spread over the whole 
country and has struck its roots deeply in the confidence of the people, for 
whom it is doing, on the widest scale, an educational work of the highest value.

The National system of elementary education has won its way in 
the face of the schools of the Christian Brothers, which have accom- 
plished great things for Ireland and have a lasting place in the con- 
fidence of its people. These schools are carried on independently 
of the national commissioners, or what may be termed the public 
system, but the latter recognizes all church schools which comply 
with the official requirements. * 
The average enrollment in the National schools for the latest year 
reported (1910-11) was 699,945. The attendance at the schools. of 
the Christian Brothers would bring this total to about 720,000, or 
16 per cent of the population. 
Separate schools are maintained for Roman Catholic and for 
Protestant pupils, the former constituting the great majority, i. e., 
74.5 per cent of the total number. The distribution of the Roman 
,
-P-A-G-E-533
  
GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 507 
Catholic pupils for the year reviewed was as follows: 370,728 pupils 
in the separate schools for Roman Catholics; 128,243 in mixed schools 
taught by teachers of that faith, and 3,987 in mixed schools taught 
by Protestant teachers. The separate schools for Protestants had 
116,383 pupils, and the mixed schools under Protestant teachers 
47,310. 
Early withdrawal from school is an evil of great proportions 
in this country, explained in part by the excess of the rural popula- 
tion, which forms 69 per cent of the total. The same cause accounts, 
also, for the low standing of pupils, of whom at the last report 43 
per cent were in the first grade, the proportion falling to 13 per cent 
for the second grade, and the same for the third, with continued de- 
cline for the higher grades. Thus far, as these ratios indicate, the 
impulse given to secondary education by the system of official ex- 
aminations and Government grants has had little effect upon the 
class of children found in the elementary schools. 
Efforts for correcting the evils of irregular school attendance and 
nonattendance are directed mainly to inceasing the attractions of 
the schools, by means of better schoolhouses and more competent 
teachers. New and improved buildings are replacing makeshift 
schoolhouses, and a general scheme for increasing the salaries of 
teachers has been adopted by the Government, which is gradually 
going into effect. 
The increased expenditure thus incurred has been met by addi- 
tional appropriations from the public treasury, amounting to an 
average annual increase for the past four years of £23,000 ($113,780). 
Of the entire teaching force, numbering 12,829, more than two-thirds 
(68 per cent) have been trained in some one of the 10 training col- 
leges which receive Government grants. 
The commissioners urge large additions to the annual appropri- 
ation in order that Ireland may be brought to the level of Great 
Britain, by provision for public high schools, for school gardens, 
and for medical and dental inspection of school children. 
THE RURAL UPLIFT MOVEMENT. 
The recent progress in education is due in great measure to the 
remarkable movement for rural uplift, which is inseparably associated 
with the name of Horace Plunkett, first vice president of the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture and Technical Instruction. The work which he 
recommended not only transformed Ireland, but blazed the way which 
has since’ been followed in England and Scotland and stimulated 
similar efforts in other parts of the Empire. Primary education has 
been affected indirectly by this movement through the increased pros- 
perity of rural communities; in the same way the development of  
-P-A-G-E-534
  508 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
technical education has given an impetus to primary schools in the 
populous centers. New hopes and interests, arising from the higher 
rewards of industry, excite ambition alike in parents and children. 
In some measure the movement has affected the daily routine of the 
schools by creating an interest in subjects bearing directly upon the 
common. industries of life. This is especially seen in the increasing 
number of schools offering instruction in domestic arts, i. e., cookery 
and laundry work; since 1907 the number of girls taking this instruc- 
tion has more than doubled. In their latest report the commissioners 
call attention to arrangements made with the Department of Agricul- 
ture and Technical Instruction for the attendance of national school 
pupils at classes in domestic economy in technical schools, where the 
local committees in charge of the latter are desirous of cooperating. 
A grant of 7s. 6d. per pupil is made to the authorities of the technical 
school. It is hoped by this means to secure for the pupils of urban 
districts a thoroughly sound course of instruction in domestic econ- 
omy. In this way also the elementary schools are brought into 
relation with the system of technical education. 
The revival of cottage industries, more particularly that of lace 
making, has brought different classes of society more closely together ; 
women of the wealthier classes started the industry, furnished pat- 
terns and material at their own expense, and developed plans for 
marketing the lace. The congested districts board, which has taken 
up the work in the unproductive districts of western Ireland, has 
simply adopted the methods originated by Lady Aberdeen and her 
associates in the enterprise. The relations brought about through 
these benevolent activities have done much to revive the sense of 
national unity and improvement, which has stimulated an interest in 
the revival of the Irish language. Leagues for the study of the 
Gaelic language and literature have been formed, and the subject has 
been included in the school programs, and in 1911 was taught in about 
one-third the entire number of national schools; in 191 schools a 
bilingual program of Irish and English has been adopted. 
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION. 
The latest report of the work of the Department of Agriculture 
and Technical Instruction, covering the year 1911, shows an expendi- 
ture for the agricultural division of £139,000 ($647,540). Of this 
amount £3,500 ($17,010) was appropriated for investigation and 
research. The amount applied directly to the various agencies for 
agricultural education, i. e., agricultural colleges and stations, schools 
and classes, lectures and demonstrations, was in round numbers 
£33,000 ($165,000).
-P-A-G-E-535
GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 509 
Among the agencies sharing in this fund were 9 schools of rural 
domestic economy for girls, with 656 pupils; 40 county instructors, 
who made during’ the year 14,700 visits to farms; and the Albert 
Agricultural College, at Glasnevin. 
The current year completes a decade in the movement for tech- 
nical education in Ireland which has borne an important part in the 
recent industrial progress of the country. The Department of Agri- 
culture and Technical Instruction began the work of the latter 
division in 1901 by establishing summer courses for training teachers 
in the sciences that underlie the industrial arts; classes in drawing 
and in manual work for teachers followed. Subsequently the depart- 
- ment developed schemes of instruction and plans for the organization 
of technical and industrial classes for young pupils, in combination 
with local agencies. Scholarships were also established to assist 
pupils in pursuing these courses. The work spread until nearly 
all the secondary schools of Ireland have adopted the department 
program of experimental science and drawing. The final stage in 
this development is marked by the establishment of municipal tech- 
nical schools, which are aided by grants from the department. 
In a review of the decade the chief officer of the technical division 
of the department says: 
So far as rural industries are concerned the powers of the department are 
undoubtedly wide, and they have been freely and beneficially exercised. In- 
dustries for the making of lace and crochet and in embroidery, for which 
Ireland has become world-famed, have been encouraged and have developed; 
art crafts are practiced with success in many places. But outside the wide field 
of agricultural industries and of home industries, including machine knitting, 
sprigging, and the like, the department must confine its efforts to educational 
aid. Here, however, some interesting developments have taken place. * * * 
Among these may be noticed the glove-making industry in Tipperary and the 
machine-embroidery school at Ballydougan. 
The Municipal Technical Institute opened during the year at 
Limerick is an important addition to the six recently established in 
as many cities. The bishop of Limerick, who was the chief speaker 
at the inauguration of the building, congratulated his fellow towns- 
men that the institution was entirely their own, and he expressed 
the confident belief that it was destined to exercise for generations 
to come a “profound and far-reaching influence upon the progress 
and prosperity of the city.” 
Although the Government does not contribute to the erection of 
the buildings for the municipal schools, they are partly maintained 
by grants from the department. The annual sum appropriated by 
this body for technical instruction is £55,000 ($275,000). Of this 
amount £26,000 ($130,000) is allotted to cities (county boroughs) 
and £29,000 ($145,000) is applied elsewhere.

SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES. 
The Scandinavian countries are characterized by their ample pro- 
vision of schools and the close adaptation of the teaching to the civic 
and industrial conditions of the people. Elementary education is 
free and compulsory for all children, the standard of qualifications 
for teachers is high, and continuation schools afford the means for 
prolonging the training of the people beyond the elementary stage. 
DENMARK. 
The basis of the general education in Denmark is the common 
school, or people’s school (decree of July 24, 1814, and act of March 
29,1904). Its task, according to an official statement— 
is to make its pupils good and righteous citizens in conformity with the Byan- 
gelical Christian religion (of the Lutheran State Church) and to give them a 
certain amount of instruction and expertness, so that they may eventually 
become useful citizens. The subjects taught are Danish, religion, penmanship, 
arithmetic, geography, history, singing, and gymnastics. The instruction given 
in the people’s schools is enlarged upon in the continuation schools, the evening 
schools, and the ‘ people’s high schools.” *

  The grand total expended by the State during the year 1910-11 
for all the different schools was 7,101,154 kroner ($1,903,109). Of 
this sum the amount appropriated to each of the institutions for 
higher education was: For the University of Copenhagen, 765,958 
kroner; for the Polytecnicum, 331,009 kroner; for the Lyceums, 
509,158 kroner; for the Royal Academy, 128,330 kroner; for the 
Veterinary High School, 477,967 kroner; total, 2,212,422 kroner. 
The communal expenditures for the year 1909-10 were as follows: 
Copenhagen, 5,275,162 kroner; provincial towns, 5,165,000 kroner; 
rural, 8,401,000 kroner; making a total of 18,841,162 kroner ($5,049,- 
431). 
As is evident from these statistics the State and communal ex- 
penditures for public education are nearly 10 kroner ($2.86) for 
each inhabitant. Although the amount is rather large, yet it is 
bearing good fruit, for Denmark ranks high among the nations in 
respect to the standard and diffusion of public education. 
DANISH RURAL SCHOOLS. 
In the present world-wide movement for “rural uplift” Den- 
mark has attracted special attention by reason of its progress in 
this respect. This advanced position is due to the system of agricul- 
tural and distributive cooperation, and the diffusion of education 
which made this cooperation possible. The following statement * 
pertains to the means by which the Danish rural schools are 
maintained at their high state of efficiency: 
Attendance.—All normal children must attend the school sessions regularly 
through the eight years of the elementary schools. A fine is assessed and 
enforced by the Government for each and every day that is missed by any 
would-be truant. As a result Danish country districts show less than one- 
twentieth of 1 per cent illiteracy to-day. 
Size of school districts——Two things determine the size of the school dis- 
tricts: (1) The number of children to be taught; and (2) the distance of the 
children from school. No child shall be obliged to go farther than 14 English 
miles to school, and there must not be more than from 30 to 35 children in a 
room. Where the rural districts are thickly populated one may see two, three, 
and even four room schools. These are all well graded, but none of them

  EDUCATION IN SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES. 513 
undertakes to do what we would call high-school work. This is the field of 
another kind of school—the folk high school. 
Schoolhouses.—All new school buildings in the country must be erected in 
compliance with certain rules laid down by the ministry of education. Sani- 
tation, proper ventilation, heating and lighting are covered by these rules. 
Every rural community of reasonable wealth must provide a suitable covered, 
gymnasium. The less well-to-do communities must furnish a well prepared, 
leveled, and sanded space for outdoor gymnastics and play. This must meas- 
ure at least 600 square meters. The space must be inclosed and have small 
sheds for the preservation of gymnastic apparatus. Thus in Denmark every 
country boy and girl may have daily gymnastic training. 
Sanitation.—All classrooms must be thoroughly aired before and after school, 
as well as during intermissions. All floors must be scrubbed daily. Wood- 
work and furniture must also be wiped with a wet rag daily. Once a week 
the schoolrooms must be cleansed with soap and water. 
The school year.—The length of the school year is uniformly a minimum of 
41 weeks of 246 school days in rural communities. School is carried on 6 days 
in the week. Some schools run as much as 300 days a year. However, this 
does not mean that all the children must attend all of these days, for an old 
law gives this minimum prescription that all children shall have at least 21 
hours of instruction per week for 41 weeks. It is so arranged that the older 
pupils may attend 3 whole days and 2 half days, instead of the full time, during 
the summer, while the same holds good for the children during the winter 
months. In some cases the attendance may even be further reduced. 
Teacher preparation.—All teachers are licensed by the Government through 
the ministry of education, and just as thorough preparation is required of a 
' teacher in the rural schools as of one in the grade schools in the towns and 
cities. The free public school covers the first eight years in the school system, 
whether in town or in the country. To supply teachers for these schools, 20 
teachers’ seminaries have been established. Teachers for the higher schools 
(middle schools, gymnasia, etc.) are trained in other higher institutions of the 
land. The training in these seminaries is uniformly strict and thoroughgoing. 
This means that rural districts get as thoroughly trained teachers as the 
towns do. 
Salaries for rural teachers.—Under the law of 1908 teachers in one-room 
schools receive a beginning salary of from 900 to 1,400 kroner per annum and 
receive an annual increase for 20 years until 1,000 kroner additional has been 
reached; i. e., a teacher may ultimately reach 2,400 kroner in money. Besides 
this, he receives free house, fuel, and good garden. These perquisites amount 
to another 1,000 kroner. Then he may earn 100 kroner to act as church 
chorister. This makes 3,500 kroner ($945), almost three times the average pay 
for rural teachers in the United States. 
The “ People’s High School” is the institution by means of which 
Denmark has solved for itself the problem of the ethical and civic 
training of its adult population, and for this purpose it has been 
adopted by the other Scandinavian countries. 
During the present year 80 schools of this class were conducted in 
Denmark, with an attendance of about 8,000 young men and women. 
They were maintained usually by private contributions, the small 
fees paid by the students, and a State grant which averages for each 
school about 3,000 kroner ($800) a year.

  514 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
These high schools are intended for adults—that is, persons over 
18 years of age—who pay their board and tuition for the session. 
In extreme cases they may get a public grant amounting to about 
half the expenses. The schools are privately owned, but in case not 
less than 20 persons attend one of the centers for three successive 
terms the State grants a small subsidy for its support. The session 
for men lasts for five months in the winter, and for women three 
months in the early summer. The more successful schools also take 
short-time scholars, generally elementary teachers, who spend a fort- 
night of their vacation in this way. The great majority of the 
students come from country towns and villages and from small 
farms, often at great sacrifice of time and money, animated by the 
desire for intellectual and moral guidance. The fact should be 
emphasized that this unique institution does not offer technical 
training. As one authority says: 
Nothing is taught that could be of any direct use to any scholar in his or her 
walk of life. The aim is to awaken souls, not to give practical knowl- 
edge. * * * To this end song and speech are the ancient and proved 
weapons employed. Nearly all the teaching is in the form of lectures. Not 
facts are sought, but truth; not information, but new life. History is the main 
subject; history, the living spirit of the people, uniting all the sons of men. 
Lectures are also given on language and literature, on politics, poetry, science, 
and nature study. Much latitude is allowed to the teacher. It is recognized 
that not the word spoken, but the speaker of it, signifies. One hour’s daily gym- 
nastics is compulsory on all. In the larger schools there are social evenings, 
when the pupils ask questions which the head master answers and discusses. 
The value of the people’s high schools as agencies for civic and 
moral improvement was recognized during the year by the place given 
them in the program of the second international congress on moral 
education. As set forth in a paper presented on that occasion— 
The spirit that characterizes this institution springs from the belief that 
different as the work is to every one of us, nevertheless an education exists 
which is common to us all, attainable through the common admission to the 
supreme good of the spiritual life. * * * 
The men of the high schools believe in the possibility of representing the life 
and work of even the greatest personalities in a way which makes at any rate 
the nourishing, inner kernel of it available and approachable even to the hum- 
blest man or woman. And this has a special application upon the spiritual 
property of any single people. A “popular” (folkelig) education means an 
education which has sprung up from a heartfelt living together with the history 
of the people and from a belief in this history as the property of all the mem- 
bers of the people being able to unite them into one living organism.*

EDUCATION IN SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES. 515 
SWEDEN. 
Each country of the Scandinavian group offers some striking 
example of the means of promoting the general welfare of the people 
through school agencies. Sweden leads in respect to the provision 
of school gardens and vacation colonies, and the physical and manual 
training of school children through its unique system of gymnastics, 
and the complete adaptation of the sloyd exercises to different classes 
of schools. i 
Notwithstanding its completeness and recognized excellence, the 
entire educational system of Sweden has recently been brought under 
special investigation with a view to needed modifications. Of three 
commissions appointed for that purpose two have submitted exhaus- 
tive reports during the current year covering the fields assigned them. 
The first commission, appointed in 1906, was charged with the ~ 
investigation of normal schools, primarily in Sweden, but for pur- 
poses of comparison including also foreign countries. The report of 
this commission brings under review all conditions affecting the 
training of teachers in Sweden, admission to the teaching service, 
and the financial status of teachers. These matters necessarily in- 
volve the primary schools; hence the inquiry has covered the entire 
field of primary education. So far, time has been wanting for full 
consideration of the recommendations of the commission, which 'per- 
tain almost entirely to minor features of the system.* 
The second commission was appointed in 1907 to investigate the 
system of technical and industrial education and, like the commission 
on normal schools, included foreign countries in its scope. The 
report of this commission brings together, therefore, a mass of infor- 
mation of great value to persons charged with the administration of 
the various orders of vocational and technical schools.* 
NORWAY. 
Norway is noted for its ample provision of industrial schools which 
maintain and develop the arts characteristic of the nation, in particu- 
lar work in metals and wood, and the feminine industries of em- 
broidery and lace work. Recently attention has been directed to the 
need of training for agriculture, although Norway has a compara- 
tively small proportion of productive soil, 25 per cent, as against 90 
per cent in Denmark. It is estimated that less than 4 per cent even 
of the productive land is under full cultivation. As a consequence of 
the recent agitation of this subject, measures have been taken to 
establish agricultural schools at selected centers and to interest

farmers in improved methods and implements of agriculture by 
means of lectures and demonstrations. 
The manner in which technical schools arise in response to local 
needs is illustrated by the plans for a new trade school at Stavanger, 
described by the American consul at that town as follows: 
The school will start with three separate six month’ courses in electro- 
mechanics, architecture and building, and the canning and preserving industry. 
The plan is to give a practical elementary training to persons actually em- 
ployed in the vocations covered by the subjects. Those receiving the training 
must have a public-school education and have been actually employed in their 
several vocations for three years preceding their entering the school. Only a 
nominal tuition fee of 5 kroner ($1.34) per month will be charged, the only 
expense to students. 
Besides three trades teachers in electromechanics, building, and practical 
machinery, the school will have a teacher in chemistry one hour daily and 
one in arithmetic two hours daily. The trades teachers will receive a salary 
of 2,400 kroner ($643.20) per year. The plan is to have the day-school teachers 
employed also in the present night school, which will increase the above salaries 
somewhat. 
The expense budget for the school as adopted calls for the following ex- 
penditures: Salary, for manager, 600 kroner ($160.80); three trade teachers, 
at 2.400 kroner, 7,200 kroner ($1,929.60) ; one arithmetic teacher, 600 kroner 
($160.80) ; one chemistry teacher, 450 kroner ($120.60); apparatus, janitor 
services, etc., 1,500 kroner ($402) ; library, 500 kroner ($134) ; free tuition for 
pupils, 300 kroner ($80.40); office supplies and examination expenses, 650 
kroner ($174.20) ; total, 11,800 kroner ($38,162.40). 
The following is quoted from the local “Aftenblad.” 
This (Stavanger) amt is largely interested in mechanics, having 9,887 indus- 
trial workers. Few can afford to go to the elementary technical schools in 
Christiania, because of the cost and loss of wages. There is an especially 
strong demand for some technical education for those engaged in the canning 
factories, giving them at least elementary training as to raw materials, and the 
mechanical processes involved in canning and preserving fish, as well as some 
knowledge of elementary chemistry. The school is needed not only for the bene- 
fit of the laborers, but for the industrial concerns employing them. Already 
these industries have been greatly benefited by many inventions of workmen 
employed in the factories. And if: these workmen are given some technical 
training the factories are bound to profit thereby.* 
BELGIUM. 
SCHOOL PROVISION. 
In regard to the diffusion of public instruction Belgium presents 
great inequalities, some communes standing very high in this respect 
and others being exceedingly backward; hence the high degree of 
illiteracy, as shown by successive censuses. According to the latest 
census (1900), in Luxembourg, the Province in which instruction is

  EDUCATION IN BELGIUM. 517 
most widely diffused, 20 per cent of the population above 8 years of 
age were illiterate, and in East and West Flanders, which stand low- 
est, 39 per cent. This showing is emphasized by the reports of the 
examination of recruits: In 1910 nearly 8.9 per cent of the young men 
called out for military service could neither read nor write, while in 
the neighboring nations there are practically no illiterates. The ab- 
sence of a compulsory-school-attendance law has long been deplored 
by leaders of the Liberal Party, as well as by prominent men among 
the Conservatives, but it is impossible at present to secure a majority 
for an educational measure. Bills introduced in the legislative ses- 
sions of 1910 and 1911 provided for limited compulsion, but none of 
them was passed. They served, however, to keep the subject before 
public attention. 
WELFARE ACTIVITIES. 
In striking contrast with the high degree of illiteracy in Belgium 
is the activity of individuals and of associations in promoting lib- 
eral ideas of popular education, and the support of enterprises for 
insuring the health and the social welfare of the young. Brussels 
is one of the chief centers of these activities in Europe, and affords 
suggestive lessons for other cities in respect to provision for school 
hygiene, medical inspection of school children, and general care for 
the health and welfare of the poor and necessitous. 
Vacation colonies are maintained every summer by the cooper- 
ation of the city authorities and numerous private associations. Of 
2,500 children having by this means the benefit of a brief stay in 
the country during the past year, 350 boys and 370 girls were taken 
to colonies maintained by the city; the remainder were in charge 
of private associations. 
For the medical inspection of school children a force of 15 doctors, 
2 dental surgeons, and 4 nurses is employed. The medical corps 
includes a specialist in affections of the throat, nose, and ear, two spe- 
cialists in defects of vision, and two women doctors attached to the 
special schools for girls. The nurses, who are a recent addition to 
the force, visit the homes of pupils needing particular attention. As 
the hospitals of Brussels are municipal institutions, it is easy to 
arrange for the continued care of those pupils who are found to be 
critically ill. 
Food and clothing are supplied to very poor children attending 
the public schools by two societies, viz, L’Huvre de la Bouchée de 
Pain and L’Q@uovre de la Soupe Scolaire. A third society, L’@uvre 
du Bol de Café, simply gives coffee and biscuit. The city govern- 
ment aids the work of these societies by appropriations amounting 
to about $3,000 annually. 
 
-P-A-G-E-544
  518 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
Distribution of clothing to destitute pupils is made both by the 
city and by private societies. In 1910 above 6,000 children bene- 
fited by this assistance. 
The latest endeavor for the welfare of pupils is the formation of 
committees to assist those who leave school, in their efforts to find 
suitable employment. The first committee of this kind was formed 
in 1910 in connection with a single school; the example has since been 
followed in several other districts of the city. 
The inculcation of thrift and temperance is enjoined upon teach- 
ers of all grades of schools throughout Belgium; in the former sub- 
ject the teaching is reenforced by the school savings banks, which 
according to the latest report had a total of 472,697 depositors in 
primary schools, and 35,646 in schools for adults. The deposits by 
the children amounted to 13,106,910 francs, and by the adults to 
1,438,946 francs; or a total equivalent to $2,909,171. 
TECHNICAL SCHOOLS. 
The year has been marked in Belgium by the publication of a 
report on technical education, including technical schools of high 
order, and trade and industrial schools1. The report covers the 
decade ended 1910, during which period the number of technical 
schools subsidized by the Government increased from 579 to 703. 
The latter comprised 389 schools for girls, of which 330 were schools 
of domestic science and household arts, including professional schools 
for training teachers of these branches; the remaining technical 
schools for girls pertained to industries in which women are em- 
ployed, such as dressmaking, embroidery, making artificial flowers, 
lace work, decorative art, etc. 
The technical schools for boys include institutions as dissimilar 
as the vocational classes, which are held on Sunday, and highly or- 
ganized technical schools like the central schools of arts and trades 
at Anderlecht and Liege. 
The elaborate system of technical education is maintained by the 
cooperation of the State, the communes, and private bodies, but 
however maintained, the technical and industrial schools subsidized 
by the State are under Government inspection. 
STATISTICS. 
In 1910, the latest year for which official statistics are available, 
the number of children in primary schools, omitting infant schools 
and schools for the defective, was 929,347; in continuation schools

and classes for adults, 240,019; or a total of 1,169,366 pupils in ele- 
mentary schools under the ministry of public instruction. This total 
was 15.5 per cent of the population (7,516,730). 
-The pupils in schools of commerce, industry, and agriculture num- 
bered altogether 52,486. These are the select and most ambitious 
graduates from the primary schools. 
The higher technical schools, 14 in number, are not included in the 
foregoing statement, as they draw their students from secondary 
schools, generally those of the lower order. The higher order of 
secondary schools (athénées royaux) prepare for the universities, 
which comprise in their organization the highest technical institutes 
in the Kingdom. The statistics for 1910 give a total of 6,073 
students in the athénées; 27,739 (18,572 boys, 9,167 girls) in the com- 
munal college, lower secondary schools; and 1,568 in the technical 
schools; or altogether in secondary schools, general and technical, 
35,380 students; at the same time the four universities had 7,880 
students, of whom one-third were in the technical departments.* 
By its scope and supervisory service the system of technical edu- 
cation illustrates the broad distinction between skilled and unskilled 
labor as economic factors in the State. This distinction gives ground 
for the propaganda in behalf of the social and intellectual uplift 
of the masses, which has its center in the University of Brussels. By 
reason of its private endowment and control, this university has been 
free to take advanced ground in respect to social and economic 
teachings. 
THE NETHERLANDS. 
Attention has been particularly directed to the Kingdom of the 
Netherlands during the year by the sessions of the second interna- 
tional congress on moral education which were held at The Hague 
August 22 to 27. The choice was determined in part by the dis- 
tinction of this city as a center of international interests; but it 
was also selected as a place favorable to free discussion of the ques- 
tions before the congress, for in the Netherlands tolerance is exer- 
cised toward all religious creeds and ethical doctrines. This spirit 
is fostered by the school system, which gives equal recognition to 
public nonsectarian schools and to religious schools of different de- 
nominations so long as they meet the Government requirements in 
regard to the qualification of teachers, programs, and standards. In 
this respect the Netherlands is naturally contrasted with Belgium,   
1The reports of the minister of public instruction are issued triennially in separate 
volumes for the three departments, primary, secondary, and superior. The latest reports 
bring the record through 1908-9. The statistics for 1910 are derived from the Annuaire 
Statistique de la Belgique, issued by the Ministry of the Interior in 1912, 
77236°—xp 1912—voL 1——35

where denominational prejudices seriously affect the progress of 
education. 
The population of the Netherlands was 5,945,155 in 1910, of which 
59.5 per cent was rural. The enrollment in elementary schools the 
same year was 904,142, a little more than 15 per cent of the popula- 
tion, about the same ratio as in Belgium. School attendance, how- 
ever, is much more regular than in Belgium and the proportion of 
illiterates much lower. 
The sentiment of the people and the many inducements offered 
pupils in the way of prizes and of admission to industrial and tech- 
nical schools have combined to promote school attendance, and until 
a recent date the Netherlands had no compulsory law. Propositions 
for amending the school law in this respect were repeatedly con- 
sidered but abandoned for fear of disturbing the harmony that 
prevailed regarding the system. With the increase in urban popu- 
lations, which has been marked at each census since 1869, and the 
accompanying industrial changes, irregularities in school attendance 
increased, and in 1900, by the common consensus of all parties, a 
compulsory school-attendance law was passed. The effects of this 
law are already marked. According to official data for the com- 
munes reporting the item, the proportion of children of school age 
(7 to 13) not receiving instruction and not legally exempt from 
school attendance was 0.21 per cent in 1904; in 1908 the proportion 
had fallen to 0.10 per cent. The example of the Netherlands in this 
respect has given new impetus to the campaign for compulsory edu- 
cation waged by the Liberals in Belgium. 
During the present year the Kingdom has been excited by 2 claim 
on the part of the clerical authorities, both Catholic and Protestant, 
that the church school shall have equal claim with the public schools 
upon Government support; an amendment to the constitution has 
been proposed which would establish this provision as the funda- 
mental law of the land. Thus, on the eve of the new elections, which 
take place June 4, 1913, the question of church versus state has become 
a burning issue in this Kingdom.

FRANCE. 
CONSPECTUS OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. 
The system of public instruction comprises separate departments 
of primary, secondary, and higher education, each under its own 
chief director; the supreme authority being centralized in the minis- 
ter of public instruction. The minister, in advice with the superior 
council of education, drafts all laws modifying the system, and sub- 
mits the budget for education. These measures he supports in the 
legislature. 
For local educational administration, France is divided into 17 
circumscriptions, called academies. The rector, or chief of an 
academy, assisted by the academic council, directs all classes of in- 
stitutions within his circumscription in accordance with the laws and 
ministerial decrees. The area for the administration of primary 
education is the Department, a civil division, but in respect to the 
control of schools subordinate to the academic rector. Primary 
schools are under the supervision of Government inspectors, and also 
of local inspectors and committees. 
Primary instruction is strictly secular, free, and compulsory for 
all children, ages 6 to 13, or until exemption certificate is secured. 
Teachers must be French citizens, belong to the laity, and have 
Government diplomas. Other ministries than that of public instruc- 
tion are charged with the administration of special classes of schools, 
i. e., technical, agricultural, military, etc.

SCHOOL ATTENDANCE. 
In France the provision of public primary schools is quite equal 
to the demand, but school attendance is unsatisfactory. Thirty years 
have elapsed since the passage of the compulsory school law, and 
France is still disturbed by the number of illiterates. In 1907, of the 
total recruits entering the military service, 3 per cent were illiterate, 
while for Prussia and Switzerland the ratio was less than 1 per cent. 
This disparity fixes attention upon the state of school attendance, 
as reported by local inspectors from many parts of the country. It 
is estimated that in the suburbs of Paris two-thirds of the children 
of school age are absent from May to November, or during that time 
attend school only 60 or 80 half days. In many country districts the 
degree of irregular attendance or nonattendance is much greater. 
Yet, according to the law, every commune has a committee to look 
after school attendance and a fund to assist poor. children in order 
that they may attend. The machinery simply does not work. 
What is needed— 
says one inspector— 
is not alone better enforcement of the compulsory law, but a new conception of 
popular education, a new spirit in the teaching corps, 
themselves. and in the people 
The irregularity of school attendance and the tendency to early 
withdrawal are the more noticeable from the fact that the census of 
the school population and the actual enrollment in school are strictly 
supervised. The enrollment in primary schools (excluding infant 
schools) has been maintained for several years at 14.2 per cent of 
the total population (39,601,509) ; this is a fair ratio for France, in 
which the child population is comparatively small.

MEDICAL INSPECTION. 
_ Although the actual work of the schools is peculiarly uniform 
throughout France, city schools offer many advantages that are want- 
ing in the country. For instance, in the former, medical inspection 
ds generally well organized and effectively carried out. In the 
Department of the Seine (population, 4,154,042) there are 275 medi- 
cal inspectors who visit the schools of their respective districts every 
week. Equal provision is made by other cities, Lyon, Bordeaux, 
Nancy, Lille, Havre, etc. In the rural regions the service is neither 
well organized nor adequate, and it is to their interests that 
the pending bill is directed, providing for medical school inspection 
throughout the nation. The measure was strongly supported by the 
congress of school medical inspectors held during the year. 
THE TEACHING SERVICE. 
The spirit of the teaching force at the present time is in striking 
contrast with that which prevailed during the early years of the 
third Republic. The primary school was then the hope of the future, 
and men and women were drawn to its service by patriotic fervor. 
This high enthusiasm has passed, and to-day the recruitment of the 
service is subject to the same conditions as in other countries. The 
falling off in the number of candidates, as well as in their quality, 
excites apprehension for the future. 
For a full understanding of the changed conditions it should be 
recalled that one feature of the system of primary instruction cre- 
ated by the Republic was the ample provision of local normal schools. 
The law required that there should be two in every Department (one 
for each sex), excepting in case a Department should be authorized 
to combine with another for this purpose. Unity of ideals, as well 
as the efficiency of the primary normal schools, was secured by the 
creation of two higher normal schools—St. Cloud for men, Fontenay- 
aux-Roses for women—to prepare professors for the departmental 
schools. 
Candidates seeking admission to the primary normals must be at 
least 16 years of age and must have already passed the examination 
entitling one to the brevet élémentaire, or lowest. grade teacher’s 
diploma. The course of the primary normal schools covers three 
years, the last year being given entirely to professional training, 
theoretic and practical; only students who pass successfully the 
examination at the end of the second year, which entitles them to 
the brevet supérieure, or teacher’s diploma of the higher degree, are 
allowed to remain for the third year. 
Not the social welfare alone, but professional pride as well, is 
imperiled in the lowering standard of the teaching service, and in
-P-A-G-E-550
  524 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
the interest of the profession itself an inquiry into the causes of the 
present crisis has been conducted during the year by the Manuel 
Général, which, under the direction of M. F. Buisson, has long been 
the forum. and bulwark of the primary teachers. The inquiry dis- 
closes the fact that the number of candidates for admission to the 
primary normal schools fell from 4,909 in 1906 to 3,692 in 1912, a 
decrease of 1,217, or one-third of the present total, in six years; 
but of the 3,692 candidates offering themselves in the current year, 
only 1,630, or less than one-half of the whole number, passed the 
admission requirements; the failure in this respect was common to 
all the 87 Departments, and it implies, further, a decline in the stand- 
ard of the first-grade diploma, which is held by many probationary 
teachers who do not enter the normal school at all. The reporter 
commenting on the situation says: 
The greatest need of the present moment is to assure to the schools a 
sufficient number of qualified teachers. To this purpose many things must 
conduce. The efforts of the teachers themselves will not be wanting, but they 
demand that they shall have some other aid than discourses and soothing 
felicitations upon their devotion to the grandeur of the work which they 
accomplish. 
THE GOVERNMENT ¥, TEACHERS’ SYNDICATES. 
Unusual complications affecting the service have arisen during the 
year from the action of the Government in respect to teachers’ syndi- 
cates. As civil servants, teachers are forbidden to form trade-unions 
or to take part in political affairs. The legality of teachers’ unions 
which have existed for many years was, however, provisionally 
affirmed by the French Legislature in 1905 in connection with legis- 
lation affecting the religious orders. The unions, er “ amicales,” as 
they are called, are rather loosely organized and have for their object 
simply the promotion of the professional spirit and the welfare of 
their members. The general association of teachers is formed by the 
federation of the “ amicales,” and numbers about 98,000 members. 
From the unions have arisen teachers’ syndicates, which are more 
closely organized than the unions, and carry on an active and agegres- 
sive campaign for the social and financial improvement of teachers. 
While it is difficult to distinguish between the syndicates and the 
amicales, the great body of teachers belonging to the latter are not 
members of the former. 
Through the similarity of their purposes the syndicates were 
drawn into close relations with the unions of workmen (trade- 
unions), and finally the federation of the teachers’ syndicates was 
affiliated with the Confédération générale du travail (C.G. 7.) an

  EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS IN FRANCE. 525 
At the annual congress of the Teachers’ Federation, held at Cham- 
béry in August of the present year, resolutions were adopted express- 
ing sympathy with the trade-unions, especially in view of recent 
repressive acts of the Government, and pledging a fund, the “sou 
du soldat,” intended to aid “their comrades, the syndicated soldiers, 
morally and financially.” 
The resolutions gave rise to somewhat heated discussion in the con- 
gress as to the true relations between the federation of amicales and 
the teachers’ syndicates, but the congress finally accorded the syndi- 
eates full liberty to retain their relation with the amicales. 
On the part of the Government the resolutions adopted by the 
congress were regarded as unpatriotic, designed to promote the anti- 
military. propaganda among the French regiments, and in general as 
a sign of insubordination on the part of the teachers. Consequently, 
the minister of public instruction issued a circular letter directing 
the dissolution of the syndicates before September 10,1 and on the 
opening of the fall session of the schools a second circular letter 
addressed to the academy inspectors instructing them to enforce the 
previous order.? 
The order of dissolution does not apply to the amicales, but the 
executive committee of their federation protests against it as contrary 
to law, and they claim for teachers the common rights in regard to 
association. The union of the Seine, which is the largest in France, 
has denounced the order in much more resolute terms, and at the 
same time declares that the only remedy for the unsatisfactory state 
of the teaching profession is to increase the salaries of teachers, pro- 
tect them from social indignities, and guarantee them civil rights. 
The teachers generally support their comrades of the syndicate, and 
maintain that the spirit of the resolutions adopted at the congress 
has been wrongly interpreted; but as the excitement subsides it is 
admitted by many that the language of the resolutions was imprudent. 
Although the Chamber of Deputies has sustained the ministerial 
order, the provisional measure of 1905, authorizing teachers’ unions, 
has not been rescinded. 
The final disposition of the case awaits legislative action, which 
will determine exactly the limitations upon teachers who are members 
of the civil service. In this respect the position of French teachers 
is in marked contrast with the freedom of teachers in England and 
in the United States. It is of interest to note the opinion of M. 
Poincaré on this subject, who, since the events referred to, has been 
elected President of France.

  526 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
In an address delivered at Nantes in November, M. Poincaré, at 
that time Prime Minister of France, said: 
The provisional and irregular state of the administration at the present time 
can not be prolonged without peril to the public order. The Government has, 
therefore, agreed with the committee of the Chamber of Deputies upon the 
essential outlines of a bill. The chairman of the committee has finished his 
report. Everything is now ready for a discussion, and this can not be prolonged 
without aggravating the difficulties of a problem which becomes more and more 
complicated. Certainly no one could desire to restore the inflexible rigidity 
of the administrative hierarchy of the year VIII; the associations of civil 
servants have united in a movement which it would be idle to attempt to re- 
press and the importance of which can not be denied; but public servants have 
some social advantages which neither workmen nor farmers possess, and conse- 
quently they have not a right to the same independence. It is necessary, there- 
fort, that the law, while giving to them the guaranty of a fixed and regular 
statute, shall determine precisely their prerogatives and their obligations.* 
MEASURES IN THE INTERESTS OF TEACHERS, 
The pressing need of improved conditions for the teachers in the 
service of the public elementary schools is fully recognized by the 
Government, which by longer delay in this respect is exposing itself 
to the perils of illiteracy and to the insidious criticism of anti- 
republicans. 
Tn his estimates for the service for the coming year (1913) Minister 
Guist‘hau provides for increases in the annual salaries guaranteed 
by the States as follows: For probationers, from 1,000 francs to 
1,200 france ($200 to $240) ; of the lowést grade certificated teachers, 
from 1,200 francs to 1,500 frances ($240 to $300); the maximum 
salary for a man, from 2,200 frances to 2,500 francs ($440 to $500) ; 
and for a woman, from 2,000 francs to 2,300 francs ($400 to $460). 
Special provision is also promised for teachers who suffer from 
tuberculosis. These measures, which are to come gradually into 
effect during the next five years, it is estimated will cost the treasury 
40,000,000 franes ($8,000,000). 
In addition to this financial relief the minister made an urgent 
appeal for measures looking to the protection of teachers against 
local tyranny and clerical attacks and an increase in the number of 
teachers appointed on the departmental councils which advise in 
matters pertaining to elementary education. 
NEED OF CONTINUATION SCHOOLS, 
The problem of school attendance merges into the larger problem 
of compulsory attendance upon continuation schools, “poste scolaire   
1Cited from Le Volume, No. 7 (Nov. 9), 1912, p. 100.
-P-A-G-E-553
EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS IN FRANCE. 527 
obligatoire,” which has also been the subject of a special investigation 
during the year on the part of the “Manuel Général.” In France, as 
in other countries, the question of legal provision for prolonging the 
period of school attendance is inseparable from that of vocational 
training; but in regard to the latter question France differs some- 
what from other countries from the fact that it has long been pro- 
vided with facilities for preserving the distinctive qualities of its 
manufacturers, artistic design and perfect finish, which require an 
élite body of workmen in every trade; it is for the maintenance of 
such a corps that the network of technical schools, public and private, 
has developed. The extent and the limitations of this provision are 
indicated by Prof. Mortier, of the Ecole Nationale Professionnelle, 
of Vierzon, an authority on this subject. In a recent article Prof. 
Mortier sums up the present situation substantially as follows: 
Both from economic and moral considerations, the welfare of the nation and 
the rights of the child, it is a duty to secure to each individual a vocation after 
having given him primary instruction. These are pressing questions, to the 
study of which we have seen during the past few years both workmen and 
employers multiplying their efforts, rivaling each other in zeal—as well as 
the press, public authorities, and educators. From this study we learn that 
out of a million of young French people reaching the time of ‘independent work, 
only 25,000 have been trained in the vocational schools (écoles professionnelles) , 
5,000 of these in private schools, while from 60,000 to 70,000 attend with a fair 
degree of regularity courses of public instruction, vocational in their character— 
100,000 privileged youths out of 1,000,000! In this respect we are surpassed by 
Prussia with its 1,719 courses for industrial training and its 381 commercial 
schools; or altogether 21 schools or classes comprising about 360,000 pupils 
(600,000 if all Germany be considered). ‘These numbers do not include the 204 
special schools for building trades, construction of machines, industrial arts, 
textiles, etc., with nearly 45,000 pupils. Even Belgium leaves us far behind 
with its 70,000 pupils; and Denmark, with a population of 2,500,000, counts in 
its industrial and commercial schools 23,000 students, as many as France with 
its much larger population. Moreover, to these schools we devote only 7,000,000 
frances ($1,400,000), while the board of education for England disburses for the 
same work more than 380,000,000 francs ($6,000,000); Germany, more than 
40,000,000 ($8,000,000) ; Austria, 15,000,000 ($3,000,000); and Switzerland, 
8,500,000 francs ($1,700,000). No wonder that, according to statistics during 
the past 20 years, 1890-1910, the increase of the exportations of Germany and 
of Belgium, for example, was from 124 to 129 per cent against 66 per cent 
increase for France. 
Although the year under review has been marked by agitation and 
discussion of the problems here considered, the only important meas- 
ure adopted by the legislature looking to the general welfare of the 
young is the appointment of a parliamentary commission to study 
the means of supplementing the work of the schools by provision for 
physical education, hygiene, and sports.

DEPARTMENT OF SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
Secondary education in France comprises the State lycées and 
communal colleges for boys, and institutions bearing the same titles 
for girls; the latter, however, have distinctive courses of study. The 
typical secondary schools are the lycées for boys, established by the 
State with the concurrence of the municipalities. Every effort is 
made by the Government to attract to these schools the most promis- 
ing youth of the nation, and to surround them with influences that 
shall insure their devotion to the Republic. 
The communal colleges follow, nominally, the same program as 
the lycées, but, as a rule, do not maintain the complete secondary 
course of study. Under recent regulations, the colleges are assum- 
ing more and more the character of local high schools similar to the 
higher primary schools. 
The following table shows the enrollment of students in the lycées 
and colleges for boys for the latest year reported:

THE NEW PROGRAM. 
Current discussions pertaining to secondary education relate chiefly 
to changes in the curriculum as determined by the program of 1902, 
which has been under constant criticism ever since its adoption.t 
The official program, it should be recalled, is uniform for all pub- 
lic secondary schools, and since it leads to the baccalaureate exami- 
nation, it virtually. controls the course of instruction in private sec- 
ondary schools and therefore determines the intellectual character of 
the nation itself. 
Slight modifications have been made in the program from time to 
time, but none so important as that authorized by the arrété of No- 
vember 15, 1912.2 This relates to the literary subjects which form 
the center of liberal education, as the term has long been interpreted 
in France. The program of 1902 was intended to give scientific 
studies equal value with the literary or classical; the new program 
indicates a disposition to give slight preference to the latter. The

EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS IN FRANCE. 529 
changes pertain mainly to the division of time assigned to French, 
ancient languages, and modern languages. By grouping the sub- 
jects, it is possible to allow some choice as to the language that, shall 
receive chief attention without material change in the division of 
time between different groups. Similar combinations had already 
been authorized for the cognate branches, mathematics, physics, and 
natural sciences, by an arrété of May 18, 1912,1 and in the extension 
of the group system it has been found possible to increase slightly the 
amount of time given to language studies. 
The chief significance of this change lies in the adoption of the 
group classification, but it has also other purposes which illustrate 
certain principles of general application. By common accord, 
teachers, parents, and physicians who were consulted on the subject 
urged some reduction in the number of recitation hours required by 
the program of 1902 and in the number of different subjects between 
which the time of the pupil was divided and his attention distributed ; 
hence, slight reductions have been effected in these particulars, espe- 
cially in the lower classes. By the combination of allied subjects it 
has been possible to arrange so that in the earlier years the pupil 
remains longer under the direction of one master, whose essential task 
it is to teach him how to study. As the pupil advances in age, on 
the contrary, he will be left more to his personal effort and to the 
habit of relying upon his own powers. It is pointed out that the 
combinations impress upon students the actual relations between 
subjects and, further, that by keeping a group of subjects under one 
authority or direction the system meets the views of associations of 
professors and of parents, who have urged upon the legislature and 
in the press the importance of emphasizing the réle of principal pro- 
fessors. This arrangement also leaves the teacher freedom to give 
most time to the subjects in which his pupils are weakest or which 
for any cause need special attention at a given time. 
The persistent efforts of the literary forces in France to preserve 
the culture influences of the classics in the secondary schools have had 
their effect in the readjustment of the program. The grouping of 
language studies emphasizes anew the pursuit of Latin as a means of 
perfecting the student in his native language, which, in the opinion 
of French professors and the literati of the country, is its main pur- 
pose. An endeavor has also been made to prevent further decline in 
the study of’ Greek, by creating a classical division in which this 
language is obligatory.

SECONDARY EDUCATION FOR GIRLS. 
The establishment of public secondary schools (lycées and col- 
leges) for girls, which date from 1880, was regarded at the time as a 
hazardous venture on the part of the Government, but the schools 
have prospered and their patronage has steadily increased. In the 
scheme of study for these institutions, no effort was.made to dupli- 
cate that of the lycées for boys, its distinctive character being deter- 
mined by reference to the careers, social and professional, upon which 
the students would naturally enter. In time, new demands arose 
by the increase in the number of young women desiring to enter the 
university faculties, but who were obliged to prepare for the admis- 
sion examination by private tuition. As a means of correcting this 
injustice it was determined in 1909 to open in a few lycées for girls, 
a special course assimilated to that of the lycées for boys, and, like 
the latter, preparing for the bachelor’s diploma. 
As a result of this experiment the question of unifying the two 
orders of secondary education has been seriously discussed during the 
current year. The proposition marks a stage in the progress of 
higher education for women which derives special interest from the 
death of M. Camille Sée, author of the law creating lycées for girls 
and an enthusiastic supporter of their special programs and aims.? 
  
1 This distinguished author and legislator died Jan. 22, 1913, in the ninetieth year of 
his age.

HIGHER EDUCATION. 
Provision for higher education in France is made by universities 
and special schools. The former number at present 16, including 
the University of Algiers, which was organized in 1909. The devel- 
opment of the provincial universities of France continues to excite 
interest and satisfaction, because it increases intellectual activity 
throughout the country and multiplies its scientific forces. Paris 
remains, however, the chief center of learning and research, draw- 
ing to itself, as will be seen by the distribution of students, shown 
in the table below, one-third of the entire student body and two- 
thirds of the foreign students. From the distribution of students 
by faculties, it appears that law attracts one-third the total number; 
medicine, one-fifth; the faculties of letters and of sciences, nearly 
equal registration.

REORGANIZATION OF MEDICAL STUDIES. 
The topic of chief discussion during the year in respect to univer- 
sity matters was the decree of November 29, 1911, reorganizing 
medical studies. The existing order of studies authorized by decree 
of January 11, 1909, is not changed, but the course of instruction is 
extended on both the theoretic and practical sides and with par- 
ticular regard to specialties. Hospital service is made an obligatory 
part of the entire course and is included in the final examinations 
for the diploma. While this obligation meets with general approval 
on the part of the profession, it raises serious question as to the 
means for its practical realization. For example, in the discussion 
of this proposition in the Chamber of Deputies it was stated that 
even in Paris, which is noted for its ample hospital provision, it 
would be impossible to accommodate the 3,000 students subject at 
present to the obligation, and much more impossible when the 
number should be increased, as was anticipated, to 5,000. On the 
contrary, many of the provincial faculties have hospital accommo- 
dations, as well-as ample laboratories and demonstration halls, which 
are not utilized because students are wanting. A more uniform dis- 
tribution of students was declared to be desirable, but this again is 
impossible so long as Paris and a few other universities maintain 
their distinction.? 
The requirements for admission to the medical faculties and the 
duration of the studies is unchanged by the new decree. All candi- 
dates for admission to the medical faculties must have completed the 
course of secondary studies and have obtained the bachelor’s degree. 
This requirement applies to foreign students who wish to practice

cant. must have the special. certificate in physics, chemistry, and 
natural sciences (P. C. N.), secured by a year of study in the faculty 
of sciences: The course of medical studies is five years, with a nine 
months’ session each year.

instruction in 1911 was 290,460,931 francs ($58,092,186). Of this 
amount, 224,776,306 francs ($44,955,261), or 77.4 per cent, went for 
the service of primary education. The total amount carried in the 
estimates for. public instruction for 1912 was 297,944,599 francs 
($59,588,919). 
PUBLIC EDUCATION IN SWITZERLAND. 
GENERAL SURVEY. 
Switzerland presents a striking example of a small nation holding 
a creditable place in the economic struggle with larger and more 
powerful nations, by reason in great part of the complete provision 
for the education of its people and the practical character of that edu- 
cation. The total population of the federated Cantons is 3,741,971, 
about the same as that of the State of Massachusetts, and is comprised ~ 
in an area of 15,976 square miles.. The largest of the Cantons is 
Berne, with a population of 642,744, less than the city of Boston; 
Zurich stands second, with a population of 500,679. The population 
of 13 of the remaining Cantons ranges from 116,000 to 515,000, and 
of the smaller Cantons from 18,700 to 76,000. Hence as areas of 
school administration these divisions are properly compared with 
cities of the United States. :

536 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
Two important principles were settled by the constitution of the 
Federal Republic (adopted May 29, 1874). Every one of the 25 
Cantons is “to provide sufficient elementary education” free to all 
children without prejudice to “freedom of faith and conscience,” ° 
but with this restriction: Each division has entire management of 
its schools. This independence is indicated by the varied organiza- 
tion of the several systems, some of which reflect French influences; 
others, German and Italian influences; but in all there is evident 
a common purpose, namely, to develop every order of ability among 
the people and to afford adequate preparation for every calling, 
professional or industrial, that may be exercised in the Republic. 
The independent control of education, guaranteed by the constitu- 
tion, is jealously guarded by the local government; at the same time 
the need of Federal aid in this work has been recognized, and in 1902 
an amendment to the constitution was authorized by popular vote 
which established the obligation of the Federal Government to subsi- 
dize primary schools. The right of cantonal control was reaffirmed in 
the amendment. The amount of the Federal subsidy is fixed at the 
uniform rate of 60 centimes (12 cents) per capita of the population, 
excepting in eight cantons in which, by reason of special difficulties, 
the rate is increased by 20 centimes (4 cents). This subsidy, which 
in 1910 amounted to $450,000, has aided greatly in equalizing the 
school provision of the country. 
The military system adopted in 1875 provided for recruit exam- 
inations, and these have fostered education by exciting keen rivalry 
among the Cantons in respect to the success of their youth in the tests. 
The provision of primary schools is ample throughout the Republic, 
and, without exact uniformity, the regulations respecting schools of 
this grade are practically the same. Children enter the primary 
school at 6 or 7 years of age and remain for seven or eight years. 
Continuation schools are universally maintained, and in 16 Cantons 
attendance upon these schools is also compulsory. 
In Switzerland, as in European countries generally, secondary 
education is continuous with university education; but in the Repub- 
lic there is no marked distinction of social classes between the pupils 
of primary and secondary schools, and the programs are so arranged 
that pupils from the former may pass over to the latter at ages 
varying from 10 to 12 years. 
STATISTICAL SUMMARY. 
The following statistics taken from the latest yearbook? indicate 
the extent to which the people of Switzerland are reached by the 
ample provision for education:

From the foregoing table it will be seen that the primary and 
higher primary schools enroll nearly 595,000 pupils, or about 16 
per cent of the population; the enrollment in continuation classes of 
all orders, 101,947, raises this ratio to 18.6 per cent; that is, nearly 
one-fifth of the people preparing for the practical work of life. 
The pupils in secondary or “ Mittel” schools, under which head 
are included gymnasia, lycées, and higher schools for girls, are 
drawn chiefly from the professional and higher official circles; the 
students in the secondary technical schools will be the future fore- 
men and leaders of industry. The total of pupils in these two 
classes of schools is 24,583, equivalent to 1 student for every 152 in- 
habitants pursuing studies up to the level of the universities and 
higher technical schools. 
CONTINUATION SCHOOLS. 
The striking fact brought out in the table is the large number 
of young people in the continuation schools and in schools which 
are distinctively vocational or trade schools (Berufschulen). The 
elementary schools and the continuation and vocational schools based 
upon them make up a system of popular education unsurpassed for 
completeness and efficiency, and which has enabled Switzerland to 
withstand the industrial competition of neighboring nations. The 
continuation schools or classes either complete the elementary sub- 
jects of the primary schools or give vocational training. The courses 
of instruction are generally arranged for two years, covering six 
periods a week during the winter. Continuation schools that are 
distinctly vocational differ little from trade schools, with which 
they are often classed. 
The trade schools are established by local effort, either public or 
private, and, carefully adapted to local demands, they are usually 
one-trade schools, but sometimes have a polytechnic character. They 
are directed to enterprises and institutions for (a) art and ~indus-
-P-A-G-E-564
  538 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
trial training, (6) domestic and vocational training for women, 
(c) commercial education, and (d@) agricultural education. Al- 
though local in scope, the national importance of trade schools is 
recognized by Federal grants, which are always conditioned upon 
the local contributions—cantonal;- municipal, individual; hence the 
Federal aid acts not only as a stimulus but tends to prevent the 
multiplication of feeble schools, of which complaint is frequently 
made. 
In the present interest’in vocational training Switzerland com- 
mands attention as. one. of. the chief exemplars of this form of 
training. This distinction the Republic shares with Austria and 
Germany, but in respect to the local adaptations of the schools and the 
‘ combination of civic and ethical instruction with the technical train- 
ing, the Swiss schools are preeminent; for this reason they are espe- 
cially instructive to other republics which depend for their political 
security upon the civic intelligence as well as the industrial efficiency 
of all the citizens. This principle was emphasized in the twenty- 
second congress of the Swiss association of. teachers (Schweizerischer 
Lehrerverein) which assembled at Basle in October, 1911. Civic 
education was the prominent topic of discussion by the congress, on 
the ground that “in a democracy where the people rule every child 
must be prepared for his duty as a citizen. He must be taught to 
understand and love his country.” This preparation, it was said, 
“is already made to some extent, but it appears more and more in- 
sufficient.” It was unanimously resolved by the congress that civic 
education is an “imperative obligation for every class of schools.” 
EXPENDITURE FOR EDUCATION. 
The current expenditure for public education in 1911 and the 
amount from each contributing source were, in round numbers, as

institutions, making a sum total of 89,400,000 frances ($17,880,000).

EDUCATION IN GERMANY.

ConTeNTS: I, German school reform; II, The proposed Saxon school law; III. The reli- 
gious question; IV. Continuation schools; V. Education for citizenship; VI. The teach- 
ing . profession. 
I. GERMAN SCHOOL REFORM. 
Germany, like every other civilized nation, is astir with the spirit 
of a restless changing life that is reflected in the activity of the 
‘schools. The broadening sense of human brotherhood and the deep- 
ening feeling of social responsibility, as well as the better-recognized 
scientific and industrial development of our time, have wrought a 
veritable transformation in the aim and scope of public education. 
Nowhere is this more keenly felt than in Germany; yet so far the 
highly developed organization that is characteristic of German insti- 
tutions in general has prevented anything other than an orderly 
change in the school system. There has been no revolution; and even 
the vigorous movement for “school reform” that now holds the 
stage in Germany is not revolutionary in the usual sense of the term, 
since it is essentially reform from within, based on the principle of 
evolution from the less to the more perfect type. Only by realizing 
this may we grasp the true significance of the present situation’ in 
Germany, where a school system which to a foreign observer seems 
unprogressive in certain particulars is wonderfully progressive in 
others. 
The German educational system has been allowed to develop, rather 
than to make sudden.and violent upheavals; for this reason it appears 
to be slow in adopting new ideas when it is generally only reluctant 
to accept what is new until it is shown to be in the line of organic 
development. No matter how ardently the German educator throws 
himself into the movement for economic and social uplift through 
education, he continually reminds himself that “ we must never lose 
our connection with the past of pedagogic development. Only that. 
which develops organically can be perfect.” Hence the frequent

  540 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
charge that the German schools are too conservative, urged more 
recently in the case of the secondary institutions and in the field of- 
school administration in general. Thus the statement is frequently 
heard that the separate continuation school system as it has developed 
in Prussia and other German States is due to conservatism on the 
part of the educators. So far as this criticism is directed at the 
teachers themselves it is scarcely justified, unless the teaching force 
has changed essentially in the past score of years, for the teachers of 
the present generation are more apt to be charged with being too 
advanced than otherwise. 
There are at least two ways in which educational ideals may be 
formulated into practical demands: Either in proposed legislation, 
where one group asks as much as it dares and the other group con- 
cedes as little as it can, or in definite programs agreed upon by or- 
ganizations of the teachers. The attempt to write into law some of 
the aspirations of German school reformers will be discussed below 
under the proposed Saxon school law. The teachers themselves in 
their meetings have frequently drawn up articles of faith, and one 
of the most recent of such pronouncements, that adopted by the 
Society for the Promotion of Popular Education at its Wiesbaden 
meeting, is here given: 
1. The school must stand in the most intimate possible relation to the life of 
the people and be the connecting link between life in the family and life in the 
State. 
2. The ideal of education that is to be realized in the school and express 
itself in the content of education must correspond to the demands of the cultural 
life, and the actual work of education must correspond to the demands of 
scientific teaching method. 
3. The school of our time must give heed to the ideal subjects as well as to 
material subjects; it must give special attention to technical training with- 
out neglecting the demands of the life of culture. 
4. Since the child when he becomes a man must play an active part in the 
duties of national life, subject matter that is “national” must be a central 
part of the curriculum; and since the duties of national life are embodied in 
the State, training for State citizenship must be especially fostered. 
5. The work of education should bring the pupil so directly into touch with 
actual things that his educative impulse will awaken and those qualities de- 
velop with which he may gain education by self-activity. 
6. In the preliminary educational process of the first.six years, as opposed to 
the later special training, the chief aim must be the development of the various 
abilities into definite forces for good, in order that a harmonious personality 
may develop. In the special training that follows these special abilities must 
be particularly fostered. 
These are, of course, general demands. At the same meeting an- 
other set of resolutions was adopted specifying more particularly 
what changes were immediately necessary to begin carrying out the 
general program. First and foremost, this set of resolutions de- 
manded the abolition of all schools that tended to foster class
-P-A-G-E-567

distinction and the introduction of the general common school— 
which, contrary to the general impression, does not exist in Ger- 
many, at least in the sense in which it is understood in the United 
States. “The basis of the whole school system should be the same 
for all classes of the population—the general common school,” de- 
clare the resolutions, “and on this common basis higher institutions 
should build.” 
Educators are by no means alone in this insistent demand for 
the genuine “Allgemeine Volksschule.” Thus Richard Nordhausen, 
in a recent issue of Der Tag, argues that the real trouble with the 
“Gymnasium” is that the material it receives is dependent on the 
ability of the parents to pay rather than on the ability of the stu- 
dents to do the work. “All the children of our people ought to go 
through the elementary school together,” he says. “Then the more 
highly gifted ones should be selected and assigned to the Gym- 
nasium, without regard to the financial ability of the parents,” and 
the others provided for according to their special gifts. 
All efforts at reform in the Gymnasium are wasted so long as such a division 
is not made. We are wasting precious strength in sacrificing our time to little 
Gecorative details of the structure, while foundation walls and lower stories are 
rotting away. 
II. THE PROPOSED SAXON SCHOOL LAW. 
The proposed new school law for Saxony furnishes one of the best 
indications of the year as to what the school men themselves wish to 
have, and its importance is enhanced rather than otherwise by the 
fact that it ultimately failed of enactment. Teachers and others 
have for years urged the enactment of an adequate school law to 
replace the outworn legislation of 1873. 
It is true that even the original draft of the bill, and the form in 
which it was accepted by the Liberal majority in the Lower Chamber, 
did not satisfy the teachers. They wished to see the general free 
common school specifically provided for; they desired a definite pro- 
nouncement on the question of improving the religious instruction in 
the schools; they sought to obtain something in the way of inde- 
pendence from the church, if only the abolition of the unpopular 
clerical supervision; they hoped for some definite recognition of the 
principle of the “Arbeitschule ” as developed by Kerschensteiner and 
others; they hoped to see recognition of the comparatively new de- 
mands of hygiene and sanitary science; they desired to have the 
principle of the continuation school extended as widely as possible; 
and there were other items in their bill of particulars. The first draft 
of the bill answered but few of these demands, but it did answer some 
of the most important. The Liberals supported the bill, and: it 
passed the Lower Chamber without difficulty, but it was held up in 
 
-P-A-G-E-568
  542 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
the Upper Chamber, and long conferences between the two bodies 
failed to produce any agreement. Thus the proposed law, after long 
discussion, has failed of enactment. 
Ordinarily a rejected law is properly an object of little further 
consideration; but in the present case the special points upon which 
differences arose, and the sharp conflict of opinions, together with 
the acknowledged importance of the whole Saxon situation, make it 
distinctly worth while to examine the bill in some detail. 
The 70 paragraphs of the bill were grouped under five divisions: 
(1) General statements—object: of school, ete.; (2) organization of 
the common schools; (8) preparation, employment, and legal status 
of the teachers; (4) administration and supervision of the common 
schools; (5) provisional regulations and conclusions. The following 
discussion covers most of the important provisions: 
1. Object——The object of the common school is, through instruction, exercise, 
and training, to develop actively the mental and physical forces of the child and 
give him the fundamentals of moral and religious education as well as general. 
knowledge and skill necessary for the life of citizenship. 
This clause was acceptable to the teachers, but not to the Conserva- 
tives. They made it read: “The object’ of the school is to awaken 
and to foster love for King and the fatherland, for the Emperor and 
for the Kingdom.” 
2. Subjects of instruction.—The essential subjects of instruction in the com- 
mon school are: Religion and morals; German language, with reading and 
writing; arithmetic; geometry; local geography; history; geography; nature 
study; singing; drawing; physical training (including games) ; sewing for the 
girls. The.children shall have some preliminary citizenship training in branches 
that will adapt themselves to such instruction. The local school authorities are 
to decide whether domestic science for girls, manual arts for boys, instruction 
in one or several modern languages and in shorthand, are to be offered, and 
whether such instruction shall be elective or prescribed. 
Organization of the common school.—It is left to the free decision of the local 
communities to decide whether they will maintain a general common school 
(allgemeine Volksschule), or the several kinds—elementary, intermediate, or 
higher.. Where conditions allow, the common school shall be established as 
intermediate and not as elementary. 
This paragraph was particularly objectionable to the teachers and 
reformers, because of its attitude toward the “allgemeine Volks- 
schule.” Tt will be noted that it left the matter to the local communi- 
ties and explicitly recognized the three types of school, as at present. 
The following comment on the provision, from a teacher’s journal, 
will explain the objections of the educators: 
Saxony is the only German State which still recognizes the triple division into 
elementary, intermediate, and higher common schools. There are enormous dif- 
ferences between an “ elementary ” and an “intermediate” school. If a pupil 
in an “elementary ” country school should desire the same education quantita-
-P-A-G-E-569
    EDUCATION IN GERMANY. 543 
tively as the student of a Leipzig ‘‘ intermediate” school, with its 8 years, he 
would have to go 44 years longer, or until his nineteenth year. The “ higher” 
common school, for which the old law demanded a 10 years’ course, has likewise 
suffered a lamentable decline. Of the 62 “ higher” common schools now in exist- 
ence, attended at most by 3 per cent of the pupils of Saxony, only 6 had a 10 
years’ course; of the others, 10 had a 9-year course, and 42, or fully two-thirds, 
had an 8-year course, thus differing in no respect from a well-developed inter- 
mediate school. They were and are, in fact, not “higher” common scheols but 
only schools that recognize class distinction. 
A resolution embodying this sentiment was passed by a special 
meeting of the teachers without a dissenting voice. 
The continuation-school provisions of the bill were in general con- 
sidered an advance. They were as follows: 
CONTINUATION SCHOOL FOR BOYS. 
1. In the continuation school for boys instruction shall be given at least 3 
hours every week; where the necessary arrangements can be made, it shall be 
extended to 4 or 6 hours per week. By order of the local school authorities it 
may be increased to 12 hours a week. 
2. Under exceptional conditions, arrangements may be made by the local 
authorities for special reasons to have the instruction limited to eight consecu- 
tive months of the year, provided during this time at least 126 hours of instruc- 
tion are given. 
3. The instruction will take place in the daytime on work days. During the 
summer semester no instruction shall be given after 8 o’clock in the evening, and 
during the winter term none may be given after 7 o’clock. After this time, and 
on Sundays and holidays—but not until after the close of the morning church 
service—under exceptional conditions special instruction may be given in so far 
as it is in excess of 6 hours per week, in not more than 2 hours weekly; but in 
general compulsory continuation instruction shall not be thus given. Gym- 
nasium instruction may also be given in the evening. 
4. The number of pupils in a class shall as a rule not exceed 30. 
5. In larger schools special classes for defectives shall be formed. 
CONTINUATION SCHOOL FOR GIRLS. 
1. In the continuation school for girls the instruction shall be at least 2 hours 
weekly in the 2-year course and in the 1-year course at least 4 hours per week. 
2. Other provisions applying to the boys’ continuation. schools with respect to 
time of instruction, number of hours, and number of students in a class, as well 
as the formation of special classes for defectives, are considered to apply to girls 
as well as boys. 
The training of continuation-school teachers is provided for as 
follows: 
1. An applicant for a position as head of a continuation school shall have 
passed the examinations previously defined and have taken successfully one of 
the special courses for continuation-school teaching established by the education 
department. 
2. Special teachers may be allowed to give instruction in the continuation 
schools if they show that they possess the requisite general knowledge and the 
special qualifications for teaching.   
-P-A-G-E-570
   
  544 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
3. But special teachers shall only be installed as principals when they have 
passed an examination before the board of examiners consisting of a commis- 
sioner from the department of education, and of accredited continuation-school 
directors, teachers, and technical experts selected by the chief school officers. 
No feature of the proposed legislation caused more discussion than 
the various religious provisions. Supervision by the clergy would 
have been in part abolished by the bill, but the denominational prin- 
ciple was strictly upheld in school organization. Even the auxiliary 
schools ‘were to be divided denominationally when possible. The 
teachers apparently did not seek to alter this condition, but merely 
sought to put religious instruction on a somewhat different plane. 
A paragraph which caused bitter discussion was as follows: 
The religious instruction to be imparted to the children of the different 
Christian faiths shall be imparted in the spirit of the particular church, with- 
out obligation to the letter of formulated creeds, through living guidance into 
the life and teachings of Christ with the aid of the Holy Scriptures. 
The religious vow to be taken by the teacher was changed. In- 
stead of taking a special oath and forfeiting his position if he left 
the faith, the teacher was required to accept a new vow, which read: 
I promise before God that I shall teach the Gospel of Christ as it is con- 
tained in the Holy Scriptures and as revealed in the first unchanged Augsburg 
Confession, as well as in the two catechisms of Luther, to the best of my 
knowledge and belief, pure and undefiled. 
In some respects the proposed law was distinctly modern. It 
recognized the need of special training for abnormal children and 
made special provision therefor. Special or auxiliary schools or 
classes were to be formed. Vicious or criminally disposed children 
whose presence in the classroom constituted a menace to their com- 
rades were to be segregated and given special instruction by the 
school authorities if institutional care was not available. A similar 
obligation was imposed by the State in the case of children physi- 
cally incapacitated, but the State stood willing to render aid to the 
communities in carrying out this and the previous provisions if 
necessary. 
In the important matter of free tuition the bill marked a partial 
step in advance, to the extent of making free tuition optional -with 
the communities, but this was hardly satisfactory to teachers who 
knew that in Prussia and Oldenburg free tuition was mandatory. 
Some effort was made to reduce further the number of pupils as- 
signable to a single teacher. The maximum, previously 60, was re- 
duced to 50, to take effect within five years; and after ten years from 
the date of enactment no two-class school was to contain more than 
80 pupils. :     
-P-A-G-E-571
EDUCATION IN GERMANY. 545 
It may well be asked how it came about that a bill so mildly pro- 
gressive as to be far from satisfactory to the teachers and reformers 
should prove too radical for the Conservatives in the Upper Chamber 
of the Saxon Parliament. The attitude of the teachers was summed 
up by a writer in the Allgemeine Deutsche Lehrerzeitung in these 
words: 
The bill does much for the continuation schools. For the teacher of the 
regular schools it has a few rather nonessential advantages.. For the common 
school itself it is silent on almost all the fundamental questions. It rejects 
the general common school; it does not free the school from the domination of 
the church; it affords a slight reduction in the number of pupils to a teacher. 
and does not demand obligatory free tuition. Finally, it does not give the 
school system the necessary independence through the creation of a separate 
ministry of education. 
Yet the teachers were willing to accept the bill as it was. Why, 
then, did it not pass? A summary of points upon which the discus- 
sion raged most hotly may answer the question. These were four: 
(1) The denominational instruction; (2) the religious vow to be 
taken by the teacher; (8) the question of free tuition; (4) the general 
common school. : 
Although the teachers professed themselves dissatisfied with what 
the bill granted under all of these heads, the concessions were ap- 
parently more than the Conservatives felt they could allow. The 
latter declare, in explaining the failure of the bill, that the teachers, 
led by the younger and more advanced set, made radical. demands 
that could not be granted. Says the Conservative Correspondence 
for the Saxon Kingdom: 
Agitators and fanatics held the ascendancy ; extravagant demands were made 
in extravagant form; young fellows just entering life with their Nietsche and 
Haeckel still undigested in their brains thought they could foist their youthful 
schemes upon the Saxon people. 
To which a Saxon correspondent of the Berliner Tageblatt replies 
that he saw no 20-year-old youths among the working committees of 
the teachers’ organization. He insists that the religious provisions 
were not the main cause of the failure to agree, but rather the pro- 
posal of free tuition. 
The Conservatives did not want at any price the provision of free school 
tuition that has so long existed in Prussia. The Upper Chamber refused to 
accept any proposition which would make the higher classes of the school open 
to every one without pay. 
In justice to the opponents of the bill it should be said that some 
of the educators themselves do not altogether absolve the teachers 
from blame in their management of the campaign. They suggest 
that the expression of socialistic and anticlerical ideas by some of 
 
-P-A-G-E-572
   
     
546 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
the more radical of the teachers aroused a mistrust on the part of the 
Conservatives which made them wary of granting what seemed to 
be distinctly moderate proposals. 
The more careful observers regret the fate of the bill because of 
the effect it may have in other German States where important school 
legislation is pending, Thus Brunswick has a new school law under 
consideration. In this case the teachers are by no means: satisfied 
with what is proposed, They feel especially disappointed over the 
refusal to grant their request for a ministry of education, with a 
professional educator at its head. 
Ill. THE RELIGIOUS QUESTION. 
Whether or not the religious. question was the main cause of the 
defeat of the Saxon law, it is certainly one of the most troublesome 
questions before Germany to-day. The question is at the same time 
so delicate that it is practically impossible for an outside observer to 
present the issues without danger of misunderstanding. Yet no sur- 
vey of education in Germany. for the year can properly omit some 
statement of the problem of the relation of church and school. The 
controversy in Saxony over clerical supervision, teacher’s religious 
vow, ete., is but one of many indications of current religious feeling 
in Germany. 
It needs to be remembered, first of all, that education in the Em- 
pire, and more particularly in Prussia, is for historical and other 
reasons regularly found in intimate connection with the church. 
The schools are in the main denominationally religious despite the 
growth of the so-called “Simultanschulen” of recent years. The 
children are separated rigidly according to the religious faith of the 
parents.. To one unfamiliar with this fundamental fact the Prussian 
figures are surprising. Of the 6,572,000 school children in Prussia 
8,815,000 are in Protestant schools, 2,383,000 in Roman Catholic 
schools, and the comparatively small number of 368,565 in the 
“Simultanschulen,” or nonsectarian schools, where the pupils take 
most of the subjects in common but receive the religious instruction 
separately in the faith to which they belong. Again, it must not be 
forgotten that religion is the one constant subject in the curriculum 
of German schools. It appears everywhere, except in the continu- 
ation schools, as a leading school subject. These facts rightly con- 
sidered will tend to give pause to anyone who may feel that the 
question of the relation of church and state in Germany with respect 
to the schools is easy of solution. 
It is in the question of administrative control that the problem 
touches the schools most vitally. “Shall church or state control the 
school?” asks Johannes Tews, secretary of the German Teachers’  
-P-A-G-E-573
    EDUCATION IN’ GERMANY. ‘547 
Association, in an address on the subject “State school or church 
school.” Herr Tews attempts to analyze the attitude of political 
parties and leading individuals on the question of state or church 
control of education. He disclaims any attempt to put forward his 
own opinions or the opinions of others hastily expressed, but proposes 
to confine himself to authenticated and “constantly recurring” state- 
ments of party policy. He reviews in some detail the party programs. 
The Center group, by its platform of 1871, demands “ protection of 
the rights of the religious organizations against the attacks of legis- 
lation by the State.” The German-Conservatives (1892) take their 
stand for the “denominational Christian common school.” The Na- 
tional Liberals (1911) demand— 
complete assurance of the inalienable rights of the state toward the church in 
the domain of the school; cooperation of the religious organizations in such a 
way that the state remains in control of the school and the teacher is inde- 
pendent of the clergy. 
The advanced Liberals (1910) demand— 
independence of instruction from the church; abolition of clerical supervision ; 
the general common school without denominational separation. 
The Social-Democrats (1891) insist upon “secularizing the school 
and compulsory attendance at a common public school.” The Social 
Democracy is thus the only party, according to Tews, that demands 
monopoly by the state. 
In analyzing the utterances of men responsible for party policy, 
Herr Tews credits the Center with the belief that the church alone 
js justified in imparting education. He quotes prominent Catholics 
to prove his assertion. Schiidler (1904): “The secret of education 
is love. But can love be felt for an abstraction? ‘And the state is 
an abstraction!” Other similar statements are cited that tend to 
question frankly the right and ability of the state to dominance in 
education. That the Center and the Conservatives agree in advo- 
cating clerical control is generally acknowledged,* though obviously 
there are widely varying shades of opinion as to how far this con- 
trol shall be exerted or insisted upon in practice. 
Herr Tews himself refuses to argue the right of the state to edu- 
cational control, on the ground that the state has already sufficiently 
maintained that right. 
_ The state does not need to demonstrate its right to educate; it has already 
amply demonstrated it. This much is true—not every state can educate. 
There have been in the past, and there still are to-day, types of government 
to which we can not ascribe educational functions. But in Germany this type 
is, fortunately, past.

He also quotes Friedrich Paulsen: 
If we survey the course of educational progress, two fundamental principles 
stand forth: One is the complete secularization of the system of education; 
the other is the steady extension of education through the schools to ever- 
widening circles—the democratization of education, if you will. 
That Prussia has not developed in the way indicated by Prof. 
Paulsen, Herr Tews admits, but reminds us that Prussia is not an 
island, and will, sooner or later, have to give up her “splendid iso- 
lation.” 
There is also a third standpoint from which the church and school 
question in Germany may be viewed, according to Tews—* that 
neither the state nor the church ‘has control of the school, but that 
the school is established and maintained by a free school community.” 
Though recognizing that this attitude finds realization in parts of 
Germany and more particularly in other countries, he dismisses it 
from consideration as a practical basis of operation. “ It [the local 
community] can never fill the place of the state in education,” he 
maintains, “and is only possible where all strata of the population 
are equally well educated.” 
IV. CONTINUATION SCHOOLS. 
In the field of continuation-school education the two significant 
points of recent educational history are, first, the extension of the 
principle of compulsory attendance to the continuation schools; and 
second, the attempt to amplify the scope of the continuation school 
to include girls as well as boys. With regard to compulsory attend- 
ance, conditions are too indefinite to permit of a satisfactory state- 
ment at this time; the most that can be said is that the compulsory 
principle is distinctly recognized in the continuation schools by 
nearly all the German States, and it is probably only a question of 
time when it will be an accomplished fact. As to the application of 
the continuation-school principle to girls, definite progress is re- 
ported during the past year, the most notable instance being perhaps 
the establishment of a compulsory continuation school for girls in 
the city of Berlin. 
The whole vocational question is such a vital one at this time that 
it seems worth while to give the course of study for sales girls in this 
school, as worked out by a committee composed of representatives 
of various lines of business and officially approved by the continua- 
tion-school authorities, to go into effect April, 1913. Besides the 
appropriate technical subjects, others are provided, including 
economic geography and household arts. The following schedule 
and outline of courses is slightly abridged:

From many other parts of Germany come indications of further 
extension of the girls’ continuation-school idea. In Hamburg the 
authorities have decided to impose compulsory continuation-school 
attendance on all girls under 18 years of age employed as clerks, sales- 
women, or apprentices. The regulation is to apply at first to those 
employed in purely commercial pursuits, but it is indicated that as 
early as possible the regulations will be extended to all branches of 
trade and industry. About 2,000 girls are immediately affected, and 
it is estimated that the cost will be 110,000 marks a year. Saar- 
brucken has extended the curriculum of the continuation school to 
include women clerks and salesgirls. In Insterburg the mayor and 
city council have inaugurated compulsory training for girls, with a 
one-year course that is to become a three years’ course as soon as 
financial conditions will allow. Trade schools for girls are demanded 
by merchants’ organizations of Mannheim and Heidelberg. The city 
of Ulm will have the first trade school for girls in Wurttemberg. 
Thuringen is giving special attention to household-arts education for 
girls. Jena plans a special building that shall not be merely a con- 
tinuation school for girls, but a general-welfare institution. A 
foster home, peoples’ kitchen, and other features will be connected 
with the school, including an evening recreation center for girls, 
where they may rest, read, and study, or hear lectures. 
The training of teachers for continuation schools has been treated 
in detail in previous reports of the Commissioner of Education,’ and 
it is not necessary to add anything to the general discussion here. 
Prussia has, however, during the past year, worked out a new plan 
that should be noted: A seminary for trade continuation-school 
teachers will be established with a one-year course. To this will be 
admitted those who have passed the second examination (i. e., are 
regularly qualified teachers) and have been engaged in the continua- 
tion school in a subordinate capacity, and workmen and technical 
men who have had at least three years of actual work and can show 
an adequate general education. The entrance examination will in- 
clude both a special and a general test. The general examination may 
be dispensed with if the applicant’s education is readily verified by 
academic records, and anyone who has pursued successfully a four- 
semester course at a satisfactory technical school is absolved from the

special examination. In accordance with the preliminary training, 
the teachers will devote more time to drawing, while the practical 
men will give more time to practice in teaching. Instruction will be 
given in vocational science, citizenship, treatment of the drawing. 
courses for the main vocations, with technological explanations, 
hygiene, and pedagogy. 
v. EDUCATION FOR CITIZENSHIP. 
The demand for thorough “training in citizenship” fills the air 
in Germany to-day. The term is used in a much larger sense than 
“civics” or almost any corresponding term in English. It means 
the systematic instruction of the pupil in every conceivable subject 
that will prepare directly for the exercise of the duties of citizenship. 
For some years educators, statesmen, jurists, and others (including 
the Emperor himself) have advocated direct citizenship training by 
the schools, but their agitation appears to have borne little fruit until 
1908, when two books, Karl Negenborn’s “The German as citizen,” 
and Paul Riihlmann’s “ Political education: What it is and what it 
signifies,” stirred the widest circles of educated men to a “crusade 
for national education.” In September, 1908, the “Association for 
Citizenship Education of the German People” was founded. The 
movement did not immediately derive support from public-school 
teachers—only 3 of the 67 men who signed the first call were teachers, 
24 were university professors, 7 were literary men, 5 were mayors, etc., 
but during the past three or four years the teachers have assumed a 
leading part, and Director Georg Kerschensteiner, of Munich, is the 
vice president of the organization and its actual head. The society 
has published 10 bulletins, 4 of them dealing with education for citi- 
zenship in Switzerland, the Netherlands, Denmark, and France, 5 
with questions of method, and 1 a study of Alsace-Lorraine. Lec- 
tures were held in Berlin in the winter-of 1910-11, and to a still 
larger extent in the winter of 1911-12. Some of the subjects of dis- 
cussion at these lectures were: Constitution of the Empire; parlia- 
mentary procedure; public meetings; technique of journalism; sys- 
tems of election; imperial finance reform; insurance; the programs 
of the political parties. 
During the year just passed Germany has been flooded with litera- 
ture on the subject of “‘education for citizenship,” but “no new 
thoughts have been offered,” to quote the opinion of a writer who has 
recently examined the output of the year. The movement has, how- 
ever, received university sanction in a very direct way. In connection 
with the vacation school conducted by Prof. Rein at Jena, the asso- 
ciation gave special courses in citizenship lasting from August 12 to 
17,1912. Of the 748 students present at the summer session, 150 took 
part in the citizenship lectures.
-P-A-G-E-581
  
EDUCATION IN GERMANY. 555 
Part of the time was devoted to general lectures on the main prob- 
lems of economics and government from an international point of 
view; this work was in charge of Prof. Brandenburg, of Leipzig. 
Dr. Geffchen, of the Cologne Technical School, treated of the com- 
position of the German Empire and its significance for the citizen of 
the individual German State. Dr. Riihlmann’s course on funda- 
mental questions of citizenship training is worthy of particular notice 
in this connection, because it really amounted to a course in methods 
for teachers desirous of introducing the new work into their schools. 
The following were among the subjects which he discussed: The idea 
of the modern state; self-government; suffrage; economic competition 
under imperial conditions; the educational system in a modern state; 
its significance for the process of democratization; agencies of educa- 
tion; the press, organizations, etc.; the school and the modern state; 
state or community school; the army and the school; child welfare; 
the school programs of the political parties; education for citizenship: 
its dangers; defense of citizenship training; age of maturity for citi- 
zenship training; self-government of the pupils; results of citizenship 
training in Switzerland, France, Denmark, and Holland. In con- 
nection with the course in methods, Dr. Stutzer, director of the Gym- 
nasium at Gorlitz, lectured on citizenship training in the secondary 
schools, giving particular attention to the time and manner of presen- 
tation of the subject in secondary education. 
The association also maintains a general lecture bureau. Those 
who join in its work agree beforehand to observe “a scientific ob- 
jectivity ” and to forego all political partisanship. 
The agitation is by no means confined to this one society. There 
are other organizations in and out of the school that have given as- 
sistance. For the past two winters the Citizens’ Association of Ham- 
burg has been holding civic lectures, mainly for boy and girls who 
have left school. The student societies have also been conspicuous in 
support of the work. The technical school at Charlottenburg last 
summer held lectures in education for citizenship, in which special 
municipal subjects were treated. A number of the women’s organi- 
zations are also aiding in the propaganda. 
That Dr. Kerschensteiner and other educators most concerned in 
the movement for citizenship education have much more in mind 
than mere instruction in the essentials of government may be seen 
from the Munich educator’s book, Der Begriff der Staatsbiirger- 
lichen Erziehung, where the term is practically made synonymous 
with all education undertaken by the state for the state. According 
to Dr. Kerschensteiner the “ problem of civic education of the people 
is the most difficult. of all educational problems, not in theory, but in 
practice.” He begins by telling what “ citizenship education” is 
not. It is not, he says, mere information about government; it is  
-P-A-G-E-582
    556 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
not mere technical economic education; it is not identical with politi- 
cal education, nor yet with social education, but makes use of all of 
these in its larger purpose of equipping for ideal citizenship. 
The purpose of education for citizenship is, first of all, to teach the pupils 
through correct organization of the schools, through student societies and their 
methods of work how to serve the common good; to accustom them to duty, 
under voluntary adaptation, submission, and mutual consideration; and, finally, 
to advance this civilization morally by voluntary personal sacrifice. 
It is to awaken, through mutual activity in human tasks, that sense 
of responsibility for all that is done and left undone which alone 
gives sound basis for the liberties that we prize so highly in a mod- 
ern state. And, finally, it seeks to show that the state, with its almost 
limitless interrelations of life interests, is only a larger form of 
school organization which has already laid the basis in the students 
for the social virtues. 
In other words, the task of citizenship education is so to educate the citizens 
that their activity, consciously or unconsciously, directly or indirectly, will 
serve to bring the concrete state of which they form a part nearer and nearer 
to the infinitely remote ideal of an ethically perfect commonwealth. 
Some attempt has been made to introduce the systematic study of 
citizenship into the elementary school, but Dr. Kerschensteiner does 
not recommend it, though admitting that such is the practice in 
France, Denmark, and Finland, where citizenship is taught in the 
upper grades of the common schools. There is a real place for it in 
the secondary schools, he believes, though he says he knows of some 
history courses in secondary schools that are taught with a breadth 
of view and a background of good citizenship that render any special 
course in citizenship unnecessary. The one place where Dr. Kerschen- 
steiner is sure training for citizenship ought to be given is in the 
vocational schools, where the pupils are mature enough and yet im- 
pressionable, so that civic ideals once learned will sink in, and where 
the element of the population that most needs citizenship training 
will be reached. While Dr. Kerschensteiner thinks there should be 
no systematic training for citizenship in the ordinary elementary 
school, he believes that a great deal of valuable incidental instruction 
can be given by the teacher in connection with other branches.+ 
VI. THE TEACHING PROFESSION. 
There seems to be some question whether the appointment of 
Wilhelm Rein as the first “ordentlicher” professor of pedagogy is to 
be considered a belated recognition for pedagogy as a science, or 
  
1For more detailed information as to Dr. Kerschensteiner’s present ideas of this sub- 
ject, as well as of the “Arbeitschule ” principle for which he stands sponsor, the reader 
is referred to the two recent books, Der Begriff der staatsbiirgerlichen Erziehung and 
Die Arbeitschule. (B. G. Teubner, Leipzig and Berlin, 1912.)
-P-A-G-E-583
  EDUCATION IN GERMANY. 557 
simply a personal testimony to the work of Prof. Rein himself, who 
has just rounded out a quarter of a century at Jena as “ ausserordent- 
licher,” that is, without the usual rights and privileges of a regular 
member of the faculty. Whatever the motive for the change, Jena 
now has the first regular professor of pedagogy in Germany. A cer- 
tain amount of academic importance attaches to the altered title that 
may not at first be apparent. Prof. Rein will not only have voting 
membership in the university senate, which was denied him as 
docent, but will direct authoritatively the research work that he has 
for many years directed in all but name. 
The German States are bound not to be outdone in teacher train- 
ing. During the past year Bavaria has raised the period of training 
from five to six years, to correspond to the usual requirement else- 
where in Germany, and at the same time has broadened the curric- 
ulum. For purposes of comparison the new course of study for 
Bavaria is given below, side by side with that for Prussia. Prussian 
educators who have examined the Bavarian plan appear rather 
envious of certain features of it that do not appear in the mere titles 
of subjects; they note that the content of the different courses seems 
to have been considerably modernized. Special attention is given in 
the Bavarian plan to school hygiene: (1) Hygiene of instruction 
(mental fatigue, etc.) ; (2) sanitation; (3) hygiene of the teaching 
profession; (4) school building and equipment.

Little in the way of improvement in the economic status of the 
teachers can be reported. From various localities come notices of 
campaigns for higher salaries, frequently with favorable results, 
but the increasing cost of living seems to eat up the advance almost 
before it is conceded. The teachers’ demands for an adequate eco- 
nomic return are well summed up in resolutions adopted at a recent 
meeting of the German teachers’ associations, when representatives 
were present from all parts of the Empire. The resolutions were: 
1. If the German public school is to fulfill its duties in the service of popular 
education as well as in economic development, it is the duty of the German 
people to give their teachers an economic status corresponding to the im- 
portance and difficulty of the task intrusted to them. 
2. With all due acknowledgment of the progress which has taken place 
through legislation in most of the German States during the last few years 
in teachers’ salaries, it must be said that no salary law thus far passed fully 
complies with this fundamental demand. 
8. The work of the common-school teachers does not differ in character as 
mental activity from that of the “academically trained” teachers. Salary 
regulations that measure the pay of common-school teachers by half of the 
pay of academically trained teachers are therefore not justified. On the con- 
trary, the salaries of the common-school teachers, which, aside from rent 
money, must be equally high in city and country, should be made much nearer 
those of the academically trained teachers than is at present the case. 
The German plan of payment for teachers, as is well known, 
includes “house money”; that is, a certain amount in lieu of 
residence. An important phase of the cost-of-living problem in 
’ Germany has been to make this house allowance adequate for the 
rapidly rising rents. The cities of Ulm and Frankfort have recently 
attacked this problem in an interesting way. They have tried the 
plan of selling to their teachers good municipal land at a low price 
and accepting a mortgage on it at low interest. In Frankfort this 
mortgage may amount to 90 per cent of the value, so that the appli- 
cant has to provide but 10 per cent from his own funds. The tax 
and mortgage payments together, it is said, do not amount to as much 
as apartment rents in less desirable neighborhoods, and with his 
regular “ Wohnungsgeld” the teacher is soon: the owner of his own 
home. This seems to be a novel application of a valuable prin- 
ciple, and the results will be watched with interest.

The upheavals and wars which have disturbed all the nations of 
Southern Europe during the year have seriously interfered with their 
educational progress. At the same time, these events have raised 
new demands for the agencies by which intelligence and industrial 
efficiency are developed. 
ITALY. 
Italy, the leading nation of the Mediterranean group, is seriously 
hampered by the unequal distribution of schools and higher institu- 
tions; and this inequality is reflected in the extremes of culture and 
ignorance which characterize the people. 
The general control of education is exercised by the minister of 
public instruction, but his authority is less than that of the minister 
in the highly centralized French system. Public schools are classi- 
fied according to their scope as elementary and secondary, the latter 
subdivided into classical and technical. Above these are the State 
universities and higher technical institutions. 
Official reports pertaining to the entire system of general education 
are issued for five-year periods, the latest of which covers the year 
1907-8. From this source, supplemented by later reports of special 
classes of schools, the following statistics are derived.

MEASURES FOR EXTENDING PRIMARY INSTRUCTION. 
Measures for extending and improving the means of popular edu- 
cation have engaged the earnest efforts of the Government during the 
past decade, in view especially of the revelations of the census of 
1901, which showed that 42.5 per cent of the males above 6 years of 
age and 54.4 per cent of the females were illiterate; the lowest ratio 
being in Piedmont, 17.7 per cent, and the highest in Calabria, 78.7 
per cent. This disclosure led to strenuous efforts for the increase 
of school provision, and at present there are circondari (provincial 
subdivisions) in which no illiterates are found among the young 
people 20 years of age. 
As regards elementary education, the provision of schoolhouses was 
necessary in many districts before the compulsory school attendance 
law could be enforced ; in 1906 an act was passed providing for above 
18,000 new schoolhouses, to be used particularly in southern and 
central Italy, and in the islands of Sicily and Sardinia. 
The 17 State universities had a registration in 1909-10 of 20,652 
students; the 4 private universities, of 1,558 students. There are 
also many institutions of university rank specializing in science, lan- 
guage, etc., which raise the total number of students in higher insti- 
tutions under the ministry of public instruction to 26,584. To this 
total the special schools under other ministries, i. e., war, navy, 
finance, etc., would add about 10,000 students. 
Italy is also well supplied with commercial and industrial schools, 
including schools of design and modeling, which prepare a great 
company of students (above 40,000 in 1910) for remunerative careers. 
Thus, the organized system of public instruction is supplemented by 
important agencies for vocational, scientific, and technical training.
-P-A-G-E-587
ITALY. 561 
Under the education law of June 4, 1911, the State assumed a large 
part of the expenses for primary schools in the different Provinces, 
and special committees were formed for promoting school attendance, 
for the distribution of free meals and clothes, for the establishment 
of libraries, etc. The salaries of teachers were increased, and induce- 
ments were given for grading the schools in small villages and when 
possible even in rural districts by a small advance in the salaries of 
teachers in charge of two classes. A fund was also provided to be 
loaned to communes on long terms for the purpose of aiding them in 
building schoolhouses. As a result of these measures it is estimated 
that the appropriation for education from the public treasury, which 
in 1911 amounted to 34,000,000 lire ($6,562,000) , will reach 74,000,000 
lire ($14,282,000) within a decade. 
The plans of the Government for extending the school provision 
are seconded by the practical efforts of leading men and women who 
manifest the liveliest interest in the welfare of the young. This is 
shown in the provision of open-air schools which originated from the 
campaign against tuberculosis, conducted by an Italian committee 
composed of physicians, scientists, and philanthropists, women being 
specially active in the cause. 
In 1902 a school colony for consumptive children was established at 
Barbarano in the Province of Vicenza by Prof, A. de Giovanni, of 
the University of Padua. In 1905 Alessandro Randi, a prominent 
physician of Padua, assisted by a committee of the Red Cross, opened 
an autumnal school colony on the ramparts around that city. Dur- 
ing the present year open-air schools have been maintained by private 
efforts in the vicinity of Milan, at Rome (on the Janiculum), at 
Varazze, a seaport town near Genoa, and in several other places. 
The sites for these schools are chosen with great care, and they are 
conducted in a truly scientific manner. 
The system of child training developed by Dr. Maria Montessori 
in her work, “Tl Metodo della Pedagogia Scientifica,” has drawn 
universal attention to Rome as a center of scientific research into the 
laws and conditions of education considered as a process of develop- 
ment. 
EDUCATION OF EMIGRANTS. 
Among the important activities growing out of the revived in- 
terest in education are the measures taken to instruct emigrants on 
the eve of their departure for foreign lands. The annual exodus of 
Italians from their native land is enormous; in 1909 more than 
600,000 departed to become laborers in other countries of Europe  
-P-A-G-E-588
  562 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
and the New World. With respect to their condition one of their 
own countrymen, in an official report on the subject, says: 
From want of instruction these emigrants occupy the lowest place in the scale 
of emigration to the other side of the ocean, * * * entirely ignorant not 
alone of the country to which they are going, but of life outside of some mis- 
erable town of the Basilicate or of Sicily, unable to understand any language 
excepting the patois of their village, as ready to trust any knave who would 
take advantage of their misery as to suspect the man who seeks to aid and guide 
them, they fall an easy prey to those who would rob them of their small say- 
ings. They need protection before they depart.* 
In view of these conditions an emigration commission was created 
at Rome some years ago with local committees throughout the coun- 
try whose business it is to look after the intending emigrants, to 
direct and protect them. This agency has been supplemented by 
numerous private societies, such as L’Umanitaria at Milan. The ex- 
‘perience thus obtained indicates plainly that “the problem of the pro- 
tection of the emigrant is, in great part, the problem of his instruction,” 
a conviction which has been deepened by the increasing stringency of 
the immigration laws of the United States, for it is to this country 
that the great body of Italian emigrants direct their course. 
The problem thus presented was the subject of earnest discussion 
in a congress held in 1911 to consider the condition of Italians in 
foreign countries, and on that occasion, upon the motion of Signor 
Cabrini, commissioner of emigration, it was resolved that “the 
congress and its individual members should promote all efforts which 
are intended to elevate the intellectual and moral level of emi- 
grants.” Already classes had been formed for this purpose at vari- 
cus points by private enterprise; the minister of public instruction, 
Signor Credaro, had given full support to these efforts, while at 
the same time he insisted that the rural schools should make this 
work one of their main purposes. “An Italian teacher in a rural 
school,” he said, “ who does not instruct his pupils in the mysteries 
of emigration steals his salary and betrays his pupils.”* It is evi- 
dent, however, that under present circumstances the elementary 
schools can not meet this need very fully, and hence the special 
classes must be sustained. 
As explained by Signor Corradini, the director general of primary 
education, these classes are intended to give the emigrants in a form, 
brief but exact and effective, information as to their rights in the 
countries beyond the ocean, of the opportunities they offer, of their 
geographic and economic features, of the perils and dangers which, 
as emigrants, they must encounter, etc., and they should also famil-

iarize the emigrants with two or three hundred words of the foreign 
language of most immediate use to them in the country to which 
they may be going. He adds: 
But the first endeavor of the teachers should be to rouse the sentiment of 
human dignity and of the importance of the Italian nation, in order that the 
emigrant may preserve in his heart the sense of his own worth and that of his 
native land in the countries in which inexorable necessity forces him to seek 
the means of existence.* 
The Government has taken up this work, not in the interests of 
the emigrants alone, but from national pride as well. In July, 1911, 
a circular was issued by the minister of public instruction comprising 
courses of instruction to serve for the guidance of teachers engaging 
in this work. These model courses carry out in detail the subjects 
briefly outlined by Signor Corradini. They include matters of 
common interest to all emigrants, such as the organization of the 
emigrant service in Italy, railroad services, sanitary inspection, con- 
ditions of ocean travel, exchange of currency, emigrant aid societies, 
etc. There are also special courses treating of the individual coun- 
tries; for example, the United States, its pecs divisions, admin- 
istrative and monetary systems, etc.? 
Early in 1912 the minister of public instruction arranged for the 
opening of 100 schools for emigrants, distributed among the different 
Provinces according to their needs, and in charge of teachers who 
had been trained for this service. The formal instruction is sup- 
plemented by the circulating libraries which maintain special 
sections for the literature of emigration. 
The entire work is animated by philanthropy and patriotism. Ié 
aims not only to safeguard the emigrant, but to promote a community 
of interests among Italian colonists which will strengthen their home 
ties and preserve in their hearts the sentiment of devotion to their 
motherland. 
INSTRUCTION IN ARABIC. 
On account of the relations resulting from tne war with Tripoli 
the minister of public instruction presented a bill to the Senate 
authorizing the introduction of courses in the Arabic language in 
selected schools. The action is urged as a means of promoting 
friendly relations with the new possessions through the services of 
men familiar with the language of the people and able to understand 
their intellectual processes. The bill calls for a provisional sum, 
30,000 lire ($5,000), to meet the original expenses of the experiment. 
Gratuitous instruction is also offered in several Italian colleges for 
young men from Tripoli and other parts of Libya.   
1 Roger, p. 378. 2 See L’Educazione det Bambini, No. 7, 1912 (Jan. 1), pp. 108-111.  
-P-A-G-E-590
564 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
Arabic is already included in the courses of several Italian universi- 
ties, but the subject is treated from the philological standpoint. The 
minister of public instruction has ordered that the language shall be 
at once included in the technical colleges of Genoa, Naples, Leghorn, 
and Caltanissetta, following the practical method of instruction used 
in the principal commercial colleges. Official regulations have been 
issued determining the scope and details of the examinations which 
will entitle candidates to the diploma for teachers of Arabic. 
The examinations include written and oral tests, special stress 
being placed in the latter upon the correct pronunciation of Arabic 
words. The candidates are expected to show familiarity with the 
dictionaries and grammars of the language published in Europe and 
with the principal periods of Arabic literature. 
While measures are thus taken by the Government to prepare 
teachers for the new courses of study, immediate use will be made, 
so far as possible, of the services of missionaries who have been sta- 
tioned in Tripoli and are not only familiar with the language but 
also understand the habits and temperament of the people. 
Thus Italy is following the precedent set by France in its relations 
with Algeria by carefully devised plans for assimilating to itself 
through educational processes a people ethnically and_ socially 
dissimilar. 
CURRENT LEGISLATION. 
The record of current legislation shows the purpose of the Gov- 
ernment to improve the entire system of education without any 
radical change in the existing organization. 
A law of June 27, 1912, provides for permanent inspectors of 
secondary schools, to be chosen among teachers of the same, who 
had taught for at least 12 years in schools of that order. 
A second law of June 27, 1912, substitutes in primary and sec- 
ondary schools the plan of promoting from one class to another 
upon the basis of the work accomplished by the pupils, instead of 
by examination; pupils who fall below the standard fixed must, 
however, pass examination. 
A law of July 14 provides for the reorganization of industrial 
and commercial schools under the charge of the minister of agricul- 
ture, commerce, and industry, and for a State subsidy for private 
schools of this character. 
EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES IN SPAIN. 
Spain has theoretically a very complete system of education, based 
upon the law of 1857, which was enacted in a period of great activ- 
ity on the part of leading men in the cause of popular enlighten- 
ment. The reactionary influences and the decline that ensued are
-P-A-G-E-591
  
EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES IN SPAIN. 565 
matters of history. The present time is characterized by a revival 
of interest in the cause which is due not alone to the efforts of ad- 
vanced thinkers, but even more to the sense of national danger from 
the backward condition of the masses of the people. The census 
of 1900 showed that 63 per cent of the population were illiterate. 
Even in the cities the proportion was high: In Madrid, 30 per cent; 
in Barcelona, 48 per cent. 
As a consequence of this disclosure, a new office, that of minister 
of public instruction, was created, and the administration of public 
schools and higher teaching institutions was separated from other 
Government functions. The minister immediately ordered an in- 
vestigation into the state of primary education, which revealed con- 
ditions alarming to all thoughtful minds. Testimony from every 
part of the country showed that school provision was inadequate, 
school buildings too often unfit for the purpose, many intolerable 
in fact, teachers without preparation and poorly paid, and the 
inspectors inefficient and indifferent. The report of the investigation 
was issued just upon the eve of the revolution which brought the 
Liberal party into power, and the new minister, Count de Roma- 
nones, followed this preliminary action with measures of reform 
which were in part approved by the Cortes. 
In January, 1911, the administration of primary education was 
organized as a separate division of the ministry under its own 
director, and during the year the amount voted for the expenses of 
the department was increased from 27,000,000 pesetas ($5,400,000) 
to 32,000,000 pesetas ($6,400,000), available for 1912. 
The preparation of teachers was early recognized in Spain as 
essential to the development of an efficient system of primary educa- 
tion, and the teachings of Pestalozzi and Froebel were adopted as the 
basis of professional training. The two normal schools at Madrid, 
one for men and the other for women, still retain the spirit of the 
great reformers. In addition to the two schools at the capital, the 
State maintains normal schools in different parts of the Kingdom, 
but these provincial institutions had fallen into a low state. Among 
measures for raising their standards and imparting to them a new 
spirit was the establishment at Madrid of a superior institution for 
the purpose of training professors for the service of the primary 
normals. This institution was created by decree of June, 1909, and 
opened the following year. 
The National Government has also assumed the salaries for teach- 
ers, which saves them from the uncertain action of local authorities. 
The salaries are graded in eight classes, the annual minimum ranging 
from 500 pesetas ($100) in places having less than 500 inhabitants to 
2,000 pesetas ($400). A further advance carrying the maximum up 
to 8,000 pesetas ($600) has been authorized, but the state of the
-P-A-G-E-592
  566 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
treasury has thus far precluded the payment of the higher rates. The 
local authorities may increase the salaries, and this is done in Madrid 
and Barcelona. 
On account of continued disturbances in the country and the apathy 
of many local authorities, it is difficult to obtain complete statistics 
of primary education. The latest official report, published in 1910, 
shows a total of 34,954 public primary schools, including subsidized 
parochial schools and 8,100 private primaries. The total enrollment 
was 2,052,000, which was 10 per cent of the population. 
The reform of secondary education advocated for more than half 
a century is becoming every day more and more imperative by reason 
of the growing commercial and agricultural interests of the nation. 
In southwestern Spain especially there is a strong movement sup- 
ported by the agricultural society of Seville for instruction in the 
sciences bearing upon agriculture. The university extension move- 
ment promotes the same purpose by popularizing scientific knowledge. 
This movement is due to the efforts of the distinguished historian, 
Don Rafael Altamira, and his colleagues of the University of Oviedo. 
Among topics recently selected for the public lectures by workmen 
themselves are X rays, combustion, the flora of the Tropics, ete. The 
lectures not only give the working classes some idea of the practical 
applications of science, but excite their interest in the affairs of life 
by the discussion of historic and literary subjects. 
Through the efforts of the leaders in the extension movement, a 
board for the promotion of studies and scientific research was organ- 
ized at Madrid during the present year, and received a Government 
appropriation of $140,000 in aid of its work. The board maintains 
courses of instruction and scientific laboratories, and is the Gov- 
ernment agent for selecting students to be sent abroad for the 
pursuit of special studies. The Institucion Libre de Ensefianza, 
which was founded in 1876, has maintained for over a quarter of a 
century an active propaganda in the cause of modern education and 
maintains schools and classes in which its principles are practically 
illustrated. 
In this connection, also, reference should be made to the work of 
the International Institute for Girls in Spain, founded by an Ameri- 
can woman, Mrs. Alice Gordon Gulick, liberally supported by friends 
in America. Under the able management of the present director, 
Miss Susan D, Huntington, the institute is exercising a profound 
influence over social and domestic life. A normal course has recently 
been organized to train teachers for the elementary schools of Madrid. 
These movements for the intellectual and scientific advancement 
of the nation had the full sympathy of Premier Canalejas, whose 
untimely death has deprived the country of invaluable services in the 
interests both of harmony and of progress.
-P-A-G-E-593
GREECE, 567 
PORTUGAL. 
Prior to the revolution of 1908 active measures had been taken in 
Portugal looking to the increased supply of primary schools and the 
introduction of practical courses of instruction in the secondary 
schools. Among these measures was the provision of an annual ap- 
propriation, equivalent to $100,000, for scholarships available for 
professors and students selected for special studies and research in 
the chief centers in technical education in Europe (financial law 
of 1907). By this means the Government sought to correct the ex- 
cessive regard for literary and speculative studies on the part. of 
educated classes in the Kingdom. The unsettled condition of the 
country since the Republic was declared has interfered seriously 
with educational progress, but the subject continues to be one of 
earnest discussion, as well as of active efforts on the part of private 
associations. The impetus given to technical education by the re- 
forms inaugaurated by the Marquis of Pombal in 1772 has, indeed, 
never entirely declined: Lisbon and Oporto are well provided with 
‘industrial and technical schools. The former city, which has a 
population of less than 400,000, has 27 industrial schools with about 
5,000 students, 3 technical schools with nearly 500 students, and an 
important school for training officials for the colonial service.’ The 
University of Coimbra, founded in 1290, reported in 1911 a total 
of 1,352 students. 
The expenditure by the Government for public education in 1910 
was 3,742,569 milreis ($4,041,974), not including 476,896 milreis 
granted to the ministries of war and marine for the technical schools 
pertaining to their services. 
GREECE. 
Education is prized by the people of Greece, and the present Gov- 
ernment has recognized its importance by legislation and by appro- 
priations, but outside of the chief cities primary schools are few and 
school attendance is extremely irregular. The total enrollment in 
the schools in 1908, as shown in the table, was less than 9 per cent of 
the population; in part, this low ratio is explained by the prevailing 
‘ indifference to the education of girls, but the enrollment = boys was 
only 12 per cent of the total male population. 
In respect to the desire for education, the alert people of the vil- 
lages and cities offer a marked contrast with the peasantry, and it is 
the latter who, by reason of indifference and natural obstacles, keep 
down the general average of school attendance. Aspiring youth of 
the peasant class desert the country for the cities.

  568 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
Notwithstanding the unsatisfactory provision for elementary edu- 
cation, the traditions of culture are very strong in the nation, and 
the secondary schools are well attended. Under this head are classed 
the Hellenic schools and the gymnasia. The former are in scope 
similar to the higher grade primary schools, which are authorized 
by law, and are maintained in a few places. The Hellenic schools, 
however, pay special attention to the Greek language and literature, 
which occupy fully one-third the time in the three years’ course. 
The proposition has been made to provide for the special study of 
Greek by adding one year to the higher primary course and a pre- 
paratory year to the gymnasia or secondary school proper. The 
latter follow German models in their organization and courses of 
instruction...

CHIEF CURRENT INTERESTS. 
The chief current activities in regard to education pertain to the 
interests of the rural population and to the advancement of women. 
Efforts have been made to introduce modern agricultural implements 
and methods, and for the success of these endeavors better roads and 
better primary schools are recognized as essential. 
The foremost women of Greece have been very active in the 
“woman movement,” and have enlisted the cooperation of eminent 
men in their cause. The results are seen in the greater interests in 
the education of girls, and more particularly in the preparation of 
women for teaching and for other professional services. 
The most important school for girls above the primary grade is 
a private institution, named from its founder and benefactor, the 
Arsakion. It is situated at Athens, but has branches in other cities 
and has about 1,800 students on its register. The program includes a 
three years’ special course for intending teachers, and the certificate 
is accepted for admission to the position of teacher in an elementary 
school.

The opening of the University of Athens to women is an important 
outcome of the general movement. Already one woman has gradu- 
ated from the medical faculty and entered upon professional duties, 
in which the services of women are particularly desirable. This 
expansion of facilities was particularly noticed in the ceremonies 
attending the seventy-fifth anniversary of the foundation of the 
university, which occurred April 6, 1912.

CHILD LABOR LAW, 
The awakening sense of public responsibility with reference to 
children is largely due to the influence of progressive women. They 
were active in securing the passage at the legislative session of 1911— 
12, of a child labor law which forbids the employment of children 
under 12 years of age in mills, factories, mines, on buildings or other 
outdoor work, in messenger or transportation service, in shops, res- 
taurants, coffeehouses, wine shops, bakeries, or hotels. After five years 
these occupational restrictions will be applied also to children be- 
tween 12 and 14 years and to those who have not completed their 
attendance at the primary schools. For such children the day’s 
work will be limited to 6 hours, with 10 hours for children above 
school age but under 18 years, who will not be permitted, however, 
to work more than 8 hours on Saturdays or legal holidays. The 
law also places restrictions upon the employment of women and of 
children between 12 and 16 years of age. Although the provisions 
are very moderate, the law brings Greece into accord with the social 
development of the principal nations. 
TURKEY. 
SYSTEM OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION, 
The revolutionary government etablished in 1909 included educa- 
tion in its proposed reforms, but effected no change in the education 
law of 1869. This law therefore was in force when the Balkan War 
broke out, and is the basis on which the existing schools are operat- 
ing in the Turkish Empire, as the expression may still be understood. 
The law of 1869 required that a primary school be established in 
every commune, and wherever possible a separate school for girls, 
and made the instruction of boys compulsory from ages 6 to 17 years 
and of girls from the ages of 6 to 10. Both public and private 
schools were recognized, the former being Mohammedan. In addi- 
tion to the Koran and the elements of ciphering, the programs were 
extended to include the outlines of Ottoman history, notions of 
geography, and object lessons.  
-P-A-G-E-596
    570 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
Higher primary schools and secondary schools of two orders to be 
maintained by the State were also provided for by the law of 1869; 
the higher secondary leading to the university and special schools. 
For instruction in modern branches the French language was 
prescribed. 
In addition to the public, or Government, system, the law sanc- 
tioned the schools maintained by the various religious denominations, 
which followed pretty closely the program of corresponding schools 
in other European countries. 
In 1910 it was estimated that there were in all the Empire 36,230 
schools, with 1,331,200 pupils, equivalent to 5.3 per cent of the popu- 
lation. The number of schools given is three times as great as the 
number reported in 1908, and may be an exaggeration, although it 
is known that schools have multiplied during the past few years, 
especially in cities and towns. 
SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES IN CONSTANTINOPLE, 
The deposed Sultan, Abdul Hamid, was eager to make his capital 
a model city, and, among other enterprises, he ordered the establish- 
ment of military and medical schools patterned after those of 
Paris. At the time the Revolution broke out (1909) there were in 
Constantinople, according to official reports, 561 primary schools of 
the lower grade, 65 higher primary (34 public, 31 private), and, of 
secondary institutions 11 preparatory and 1 college. 
The plans of the former Sultan for a university at Constantinople 
for instruction in Moslem theology, supplemented by modern sub- 
jects, have never been realized, although the university has official 
recognition; the Imperial School of Medicine, already in existerice, 
forms one of its departments; the Imperial Art School, the “ Great 
Greek National School,” and the Greek Theological Seminary, are 
also at Constantinople. To these must be added two American in- 
stitutions of high repute and remarkable history: Robert College 
and the American College for Girls. 
Robert College, founded in 1859 by a merchant of New York, 
whose name it bears, and maintained half a century by donations 
from friends in America, has been placed upon a solid basis by a 
legacy of $2,500,000 from the estate of Mr. John S. Kennedy, of New 
York. The announcement of this bequest was made at the com- 
mencement exercises of 1910 by the president of the college, Caleb F. 
Gates, L.L. D., who at the same time outlined plans for enlarging 
the scope of the institution, as follows: 
A portion of this sum will be used for extending the campus and increasing 
the buildings, and the remainder will constitute a permanent endowment, which 
will yield a sufficient income to enable us to take care of nearly three times as 
many students as at present.
-P-A-G-E-597
  
TURKEY. 571 
We have had only 23 acres of land, but have already purchased 50 additional 
, 2eres for a campus at the top of the bluff, and are negotiating for the purchase 
of 50 acres more, which will give us the entire slope to the shores of the 
Bosphorus. 
It is proposed to erect a number of new buildings of stone, to be quarried on 
the campus, at a cost of nearly half a million dollars, which, in addition to the 
present buildings, will provide accommodations for more than a thousand stu- 
dents. The present limit is 450. 
Prof. A. D. F. Hamlin, of the chair of architecture of Columbia University, © 
New York City, who is a son of Dr. Cyrus Hamlin, the first president of Robert 
College, has made the designs for the new buildings, has laid out the campus 
on the American plan, and will superintend the improvements, in association 
with Prof. John R. Allen, the dean of our new engineering department. 
Prof. Hamlin has laid out playgrounds, golf links, tennis courts, football and 
baseball fields, dormitories, lecture halls, gymnasium, laboratories, a new 
administration buiding, residences for the president and professors, in a most 
ingenious and artistic manner, with terraces, gardens, and groves. 
FACILITIES FOR ATHLETICS, 
The extension of our facilities for athletics is recognized as of great im- 
portance, and special attention is given to reservations for those purposes. 
Both the playgrounds and the football fields will have stands that will accom- 
modate large numbers of spectators, and we propose to educate public senti- 
ment on the subject of outdoor sports, which have never been encouraged among 
the orientals. Physical culture is another important feature—one of the most 
important in our curriculum. 
Our original gymnasium was built and equipped by the late William E. 
Dodge, of New York. His son, Cleveland H. Dodge, brought out a full equip- 
ment in 1904, and it is now as good as any college gymnasium in the United 
States, and. much better than many. 
It is the only gymnasium of the kind in the East. We consider it of the 
greatest importance, not only for the physical development of the students to 
counteract the natural and traditional habits of the orientals, but of even 
greater importance as a leveler in bringing together students of different nation- 
alities and rank. 
The football field and the gymnasium are the most complete demonstrations 
of social democracy that can be furnished. There all of our students meet on 
a common level, regardless of their birth and rank and titles. 
The most important addition to the institution, however, will be a school of 
engineering. It will occupy two large buildings, with workshops, an electric- 
light and power plant, and a model mechanical laboratory, located in a con- 
spicuous position overlooking the Bosphorus, upon a terrace south of the present 
buildings. 
An engineering school has been needed for a long time, and is necessary to 
meet the demand for trained engineers for the development of the material 
resources of the Empire. There is no school of engineering in this part of the 
world—none south of the Danube. 
The engineering school will be under the direction of Prof. John R. Allen, 
recently in charge of the department of mechanical engineering in the Uni- 
versity of Michigan. He will have charge of the organization of the school and 
the erection of the plant, and will be dean of the department as soon as the 
facilities are provided. * * * ¢ 
There never was sucha pressure for educational privileges as is found in 
Turkey to-day.
-P-A-G-E-598
572 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
The people of this Empire are fully awake to the advantages of education. 
They realize the backward condition of their country and the opportunities that 
exist for educated men and the value of the material resources that are lying 
idle around them. They realize the disadvantages under which they are labor- 
ing and their need of trained men. 
Hitherto no Turk has ever had an opportunity of advancement except in the 
military service or in official position. The new régime offers fields of profit 
and honor for thousands of young men. There is great rivalry among the sons 
“of the intelligent families of Turkey to enter it. 
The American College for Girls, at Constantinople, has developed 
from a high school established by the woman’s board of missions in 
Boston, Mass., and opened for its first session in October, 1871. 
In 1890 the standard of scholarship in this school was approved by 
the Legislature of Massachusetts as sufficiently high to justify the 
granting of a college charter, and consequently the institution was 
incorporated as a college by “act of the Commonwealth of Massa- 
chusetts.” The work of this college for the education of women is 
quite as remarkable as that of Robert College for men. Its students 
are drawn from all nationalities comprised in the Turkish Empire, 
and under the direction of its president, Mary Mills Patrick, Ph. D., 
and a strong faculty comprising graduates from the principal uni- 
versities of the United States, it is imparting to its students ideals 
of home life and social relations, while maintaining at the same time 
high scholastic standards. 
The status of education in Asiatic Turkey i is best indicated by ref- 
erence to particular communities. 
Smyrna.—According to a consular report, at the time of the break- 
ing out of the revolution of 1909, the situation in Smyrna, the chief 
city of Asia Minor, was as follows: 
The chief dependence of the city for modern education was the 
Jewish schools, of which there were 14 public and 3 private, with a 
total attendance of 1,810 pupils. In the environs there were 9 schools 
under the same auspices, with 968 pupils, or altogether 3,098 pupils. 
Of these schools, 4 in the city proper and 6 in the suburbs were 
maintained by the “Alliance Israelite.” The two chief schools of the 
class were a school for boys (822 pupils) and one for girls (303 
pupils), in which French and English were taught, as well as Turkish 
and Hebrew, the elements of science, geography, general history, 
Jewish history, bookkeeping, commercial correspondence, drawing, 
gymnastics, singing, and needlework. The majority of the teachers 
had French diplomas. 
All the schools of the “Alliance Israelite” are subsidized by that 
society, whose seat is in Paris, and by Jewish communities through- 
out Europe. Some of them also receive subsidies from the Anglo- 
Jewish Association in London. In all the schools the majority of the 
pupils pay a small tuition fee, in accordance with their means. This

varies between 20 cents and $1 per month. The atténdance, however, 
of a great number of pupils is entirely free. 
The following particulars, derived from a recent consular report, 
pertain to the vilayet (district) of Mamouret-ul-Aziz. 
School attendance and illiteracy.

The population of the vilayet, it will be seen, is about half a 
million, and, although this is a part of ancient Armenia, the Ar- 
menian inhabitants, or the Christians, number hardly one-fourth of 
the population, yet they furnish nearly one-half of the children in 
attendance upon school, viz, 11,830 out of a total attendance of 24,580 
children. 
The Moslem inhabitants, it is stated, do not appreciate the im- 
portance of educating their children; the Kurds, who are practically 
all Moslems, are indifferent in this matter. In the larger towns of 
the district there are a fair number of schools under Moslem and 
State control, but in the villages there are none. The Armenian com- 
munities, on the contrary, even in isolated villages, are awake to 
the importance of educating their children of both sexes and tax 
themselves quite heavily to keep their schools running, while the 
Moslem communities can and do have schools with Government aid 
when they show an inclination to send their children. Practically 
all the Armenian males can speak Turkish, and fully one-third can 
read and write the language. 
In respect to the education of girls, the consul says: 
Under the former régime it was seldom that Turkish girls had an opportunity 
to learn to read and write, but within the past few years there have been 
several schools for girls opened in the larger towns of the district, but crochet- 
ing and embroidery work and the simplest exercises in reading are about all 
that is taught at present. A Moslem girls’ school is such a new feature in 
this district that it will be some time before they will be extensively patronized. 
The Kurds are in a different class from any of the other races of this district ; 
practically all of them are illiterate, only a very few being able to read or 
write Turkish, although a considerable number of them can speak Turkish. 
 
-P-A-G-E-600
574 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
They have no alphabet in their language. It is simply a spoken language with 
a small vocabulary, and as no assistance is given them in educational matters 
their condition is not encouraging at present.’ 
_ An agricultural school, Or Iehouda, is maintained by the Jewish 
Colonization Association, whose seat is also at Paris.. On a model 
farm, extending some 30,000 donoums, or about 7,500 acres, young 
men coming out of the primary schools of Turkey, Bulgaria, and 
Roumania learn agricultural work, both practical and theoretical. 
The teaching is done by special professors who have first studied at 
the Practical Agricultural School of Mikveh Israel, near Jaffa, and 
then in the superior agricultural schools of France. The young men 
prepared at Or Iehouda establish themselves either as colonists or 
at the farm itself or in foreign lands, principally in Canada, the 
United States, Argentina, and in Egypt. 
The means by which the mission societies are promoting the indus- 
trial interests of the young people of Turkey is illustrated by the 
work of the Industrial Institute, maintained by the American Mis- 
sion, at Ourfa, Syria. This institute is an adjunct of the orphanage 
belonging to the mission, but does not limit its work strictly to the 
boys of the orphanage. 
According to a report covering the year 1912, the industrial equip- 
ment of the institute includes carpentry, ironsmith, machine, tailor- 
ing, and shoemaking shops. During the year there were 43 boys 
under training, 20 from the orphanage and the remainder from the 
city. For the orphanage boys the plan of half-day school alternat- 
ing with half-day shopwork has been introduced. The boys are dis- 
tributed among the shops, the larger proportion in the carpentry 
and cabinet department. With regard to the influence exercised by 
the industrial training, the report says: : 
This year both the ironshop and carpentry shops made a small profit. Grad- 
ually we are getting the shopwork of the institute on a self-supporting basis. 
To do this it has been necessary to build up business in the trades represented 
by these shops. When the institute was started, 10 years ago, the amount of 
business in these trades was almost negligible. Very few eyen of the Christian 
natives wore European styles of clothing or shoes, and practically none of their 
houses contained such furniture as chairs, tables, stoves, and bedsteads, while 
the ironwork of the city was limited to that of the rudest kinds and the trade 
itself regarded with contempt. But gradually a trade in these lines has been 
built up, and the educational value of the institute is shown in the increased 
demand for its products and the popularizing of the trades which it teaches. 
The construction of railroads through the land and the opening up of the coun- 
try to European trade is bound to result in a great increase in business in all 
of these lines. But it is the educational value of this institute that is its justi- 
fication, and this consists not merely in the technical training which the boys 
receive, but also the new system of business ethics which they learn: That pros- 
perity is the result of increased and improved production rather than shrewd,

tricky bargaining, which is the oriental idea of successful business... ‘The ethical 
yalue of this new business policy is beyond estimation in the training of, the 
native Christians for missionary service to the Moslems. 
The mission maintains also a woman’s industrial department, 
which, at the beginning of the year, employed 2,480 women and 
girls in lace-handkerchief work, but it has been greatly affected by 
the events of the year, which have forced a great reduction in the 
number of women employed.t 
MISSIONARY AGENCIES. 
Missionary societies and various orders of the Roman Catholic 
Church carry on an extensive educational: work throughout the 
Turkish Empire, and very particularly in the Asiatic section. Re- 
cent summarized statements pertaining to nine Amerioan societies 
which are working in the Empire give the number of schools and 
higher institutions under their charge as. 670, with about 40,000 
pupils. The work employs 750 American supervisors and teachers 
and nearly 2,300 trained native assistants. The medical and hos- 
pital service maintained by these societies is extensive, and through 
this service the attention of the people is directed to the importance 
of modern medical science. The extensive printing plants main- 
tained by the societies issue, it is estimated, about 75,000,000 pages 
annually. 
EDUCATIONAL STATUS OF THE BALKAN NATIONS. 
The devastatirig war against Turkey, with its far-reaching effects, 
imparts great interest to the internal affairs of the Balkan nations. 
Their long preparation for the conflict by effective military training 
is evident, but undoubtedly general education has played a part in 
the preparation of the confederates, second only to that of military 
discipline and native valor. The primary agent in the development 
of these nations was the Greek Church, which formed the common 
bond between them while they were yet under Turkish rule; for 
teaching is a function of the Greek Church, as of the Roman Catholic 
Church, and in many respects its teachings have been in accord with 
those which Rome imparted to western Europe. It is noticeable 
also that the divisions of the Greek Church in the Balkan nations 
have overcome a tendency to absolutism, which has been fostered by 
the same church in the Russian Empire. Beginning with Greece, 
which was the first to be freed from the Turkish yoke, everyone of 
the allied kingdoms has made education compulsory. Although it 
has been impossible to enforce these laws, their presence on the

  576 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
statute books gives sanction to every effort for their practical realiza- 
tion. While the control of education has not been left to the church, 
clerical authorities have a place in the central administration and in 
the local supervision of schools. 
Higher education is represented in Bulgaria by the University of 
Sophia and in Servia by the University of Belgrade. The former had 
2,116 students (including 237 not matriculated) in the summer 
semester of 1912 and the latter 1,025 (14 not matriculated) in the 
summer semester of 1911. Women are admitted to both universities. 
There is a Government military academy at Belgrade, but the mili- 
tary officers of the Balkan armies generally get their training in the 
military schools of neighboring nations. 
BULGARIA, 
Bulgaria declared her independence of the Turkish Government 
October 5, 1908, and the first law relative to public instruction was 
passed by the National Assembly February 18, 1909, and amended 
by a law of March 8, 1910, which related especially to the adminis- 
tration and classification of schools and the requirements for teachers 
and professors. The latter law .provided that in case a commune 
able to bear the expense for the erection of a school building refused 
to provide one, the Government itself should construct the school 
building and withhold from that commune an equivalent amount 
from its share in the public appropriation for elementary education. 
The census of 1910 showed a population of 4,329,108, of whom 77 per 
cent belonged to the Greek Church and 14 per cent were Moham- 
medans. According to the latest report of education in this Kingdom 
(1909-10), there were 8,786 elementary schools, with 8,697 teachers 
and an enrollment of 483,011 pupils (262,374 boys and 167,717 girls), 
14.8 per cent of the total population, a ratio equal to the average for 
the States of central and western Europe. 
The provision for secondary education included 27 gymnasia, with 
10,299 pupils, of whom 3,307 were girls; 292 lower middle schools, 
with 48,199 pupils, of whom 15,141 were girls. There were also 
technical and industrial schools, with nearly 9,500 pupils, of whom 
one-half were girls. The period of obligatory instruction is brief, 
covering ages 8 to 12 years. Instruction is gratuitous in the element- 
ary schools; the wealthier people are charged a small fee for their 
children attending the secondary schools. 
SERVIA. 
The population of Servia in 1910 was 2,911,700, of whom 99 per 
cent are adherents of the Greek Orthodox Church. The latest sta- 
tistics of education, which pertain to 1909, give a total of 138,434
-P-A-G-E-603
  EDUCATIONAL STATUS OF THE BALKAN NATIONS. 517 
pupils (109,433 boys and 29,001 girls) in the elementary schools; the 
total, it will be seen, is less than 5 per cent of the population. This 
backward condition is due largely to the fact that 70 per cent of the 
people live by agriculture, and the lack of roads and means of trans- 
portation has made it very difficult to establish rural schools. 
MONTENEGRO. 
Montenegro, hemmed in by Austrian and Turkish territory, covers : 
an area of 3,630 square miles. Its population is estimated at 250,000, 
a peasant people, mainly industrial and agricultural. The military 
discipline is very rigid, every male subject being practically a part 
of the army from the eighteenth to the sixty-second year of his age, 
or for a period of 45 years. Of this time, 2 years are spent in the 
recruit service, 83 in the active army (during which period at least 
10 days’ actual service is required annually), and 10 years in the 
reserve. All recruits unable to read and write are given elementary 
instruction while in camp. The women of Montenegro are inured 
to hardship, and thus far little interest has been manifested in their 
education. There is a high school for girls, having about 100 pupils, 
maintained at the expense of the Empress of Russia. 
ROUMANIA, 
Using the term Balkan States in its geographic sense, Rou- 
mania should be included. Among the transformations wrought in 
that country by King Carol I, in the 31 years that have elapsed since 
he accepted the proffered crown, not the least important is the awak- 
ened spirit with regard to education. Provision has been made by 
law for a complete system of public instruction; and attendance 
upon elementary schools, where such exist, is compulsory for a period 
of four years, ages 8 to 12. The supply of public elementary schools 
steadily increases, and in addition to the elements of knowledge the 
spirit of patriotism is inculcated by all teachers. Under the vigorous 
rule of King Carol the revenue of the Kingdom has advanced from 
an annual value of $10,000,000 to $95,000,000; the extent of its rail- 
ways from nothing to a length of 3,473 kilometers; and through the 
system of agricultural holdings and rural banks 5,979,000 acres of 
Jand have come into the possession of peasant owners. The annual 
expenditure for education, which in 1866 was practically nothing, 
now exceeds $10,000,000 a year; thousands of schools have been built, 
lycéeg that will bear comparison with those of Paris, {wo universi- 
ties, a medical school and auxiliary institutions, museum, libraries, 
etc. The talents and influence of the Queen, “Carmen Sylva,” have 
awakened a passion for the liberal arts among the people and given 
Roumania an enviable reputation in the world of letters.

MAGNITUDE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE POPULATION. 
It is impossible to comprehend the current record ofseducation in 
Russia without reference to certain social and political features of 
the Empire. Its area comprises one-seventh of the land surface of 
the globe; its population, as officially estimated in 1910, was 
163,778,000, of whom 135,860,000 belonged to European Russia. In 
this division of the Empire the density of population is 68 per square 
mile; in Asiatic Russia, only 4 to a square mile. Finland, which up 
toa recent date was treated as an allied State, is not included in these 
estimates; as regards popular education, this Grand Duchy is far in 
advance of the Empire as a whole. 
The city population of Russia is comparatively small, only 19 
towns in the vast Empire having over 100,000 inhabitants; for the 
most part the peasant population is collected in small villages. 
The established religion of the Empire is the Greco-Russian, offi- 
cially called the “Orthodox faith.” The adherents of the State 
church are estimated at 70 per cent of the population; the Mohamme- 
dans, numbering about 14 millions, at 11 per cent; and the Roman 
Catholics, about 114 millions, at 9 per cent. Of the remainder, the 
Jews form the largest body, comprising 51 millions, followed by the 
Lutherans with 33 millions. Religion, which has been a determining 
force in education throughout the Empire, makes for diversity in- 
stead of unity, and this tendency is increased by the racial distinc- 
tions of the people. Considering, therefore, the population alone, its 
magnitude and complexity, the problem of education throughout 
Russia is one of enormous difficulty. 
CONTROLLING AUTHORITIES, 
Education is strictly controlled by the imperial authority, which is, 
theoretically although not actually, restricted by the action of the 
Duma, a representative body called into existence by decree of 1905, 
579
-P-A-G-E-606

and formed at present under a carefully prescribed electoral system. 
The chief Government agencies for the direction of schools and 
higher institutions are the minister of public instruction and the 
Holy Synod. The latter body, which has charge of parochial schools, 
is the supreme authority in ecclesiastical affairs, but subject to the 
Emperor in respect to its organization and its civil activities. Its 
membership consists of metropolitans, archbishops, and bishops, all 
appointed by the Emperor. 
Other ministries control schools which are either special or estab- 
lished under special conditions. The schools called, collectively, the 
Empress Maria Institutions have a semiofficial character. The fol- 
lowing table, compiled from the latest official report, summarizes the 
statistics of primary schools for 1910:

PRIMARY-SCHOOL LAW OF 1864. 
The education of the common people excited little attention prior 
to the emancipation of the serfs in 1861. This action necessitated a 
readjustment of community life and industry, and the primary-school 
law of 1864 is one of the measures devised for that purpose; it was, 
indeed, necessary for the success of the other measures; for it was seen 
that unless the millions of freed people were taught at least the rudi- 
ments of knowledge it would be impossible to carry out the scheme for 
the redistribution of the land, the new judicial system, and the work 
of the zemstvos, the organs of local administration. 
The law of 1864 authorized the union into a single group of schools 
of different denominations; required the admission of all children 
without distinction of creed, rank, or sex, unless separate schools were 
provided, and a common program for all. In addition to the three 
elementary branches, this program included church singing and 
religion. The religious instruction must be given by the parish priest 
or by a special instructor approved by the district school council. 
The Russian language alone was recognized as the medium of instruc- 
tion. The zemstvos were authorized to establish and support public
-P-A-G-E-607
EDUCATION IN RUSSIA, 581 
schools; their control, however, was committed to district councils to 
be formed by the central authority, but including two representatives 
of the zemstvos. Modifications of the law of 1864 have increased the 
central control over the primary schools of all classes, and subsequent 
decrees have fostered parochial schools at the expense of the public 
schools, that is, those maintained by the zemstvos. Hence the spread 
of primary education has been hindered by the struggle between the 
two school systems, the public and the parochial, and between local 
and imperial authority. 
EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE THIRD DUMA. 
Reactionary and progressive forces are contending for control 
throughout the entire field of educational activity. This struggle 
has been emphasized the present year by the measures passed by 
the Third Duma, but finally rejected by the Imperial Council. Their 
bearing is indicated by the following epitome of the action of the 
Duma, condensed from an article by the vice chairman of the education 
committee of that body." 
The proceedings of the Duma in respect to education took two 
forms: Criticism of the defects of the present system and construc- 
tive legislation. 
Criticism was made, as a rule, in addresses before the open sessions, 
and therefore excited much discussion in journals and public gath- 
erings. The criticisms bore chiefly upon the “indifference of the 
Government,” the “meagerness of the credits for education,” the 
destructive influence of successive statutes, depriving higher insti- 
tutions, especially the universities, of self-government, the formal 
character of secondary education, and measures restricting the prog- 
ress of the public primary schools. Several prominent members of 
the education committee went so far as to oppose the appropriations 
for education in their reluctance to continue the present conditions. 
The constructive work in education “ was -done chiefly in the com- 
mittees of the budget and of education, partly in the committee on 
gymnasia, and also in conferences for the discussion of individual 
bills”; the ultimate decisions of the education committee were em- 
bodied in a series of bills most of which were passed by the Duma. 
Notwithstanding the fact that the Imperial Council failed to sanc- 
tion these measures, they are of great interest as showing the con- 
victions of the conservative leaders of progress in the Empire. 
In addition to securing “very satisfactory statistics,” the Duma 
established certain principles, or “new traditions,” which it is be- 
lieved will gradually work themselves into the educational policies

Instruction,” Russian Review, July, 1912.

  582 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
of the Government. The outcome is summed up by Mr. Kovalevsky 
as follows: 
The first of these new traditions is the advocacy of the interests of teachers 
of all schools and of all ranks, which has taken the form of increase of salary, 
periodical augmentations, and, lastly, pensions for the teachers of lower schools. 
(Law of June 14, 1910.) 
We have already spoken of the sympathetic attitude of the Duma toward 
women in the sphere of education. 
Besides this— 
acting on a broad conception of educational needs, the Imperial Duma was 
always disposed to support the wish of non-Russian nationalities to preserve 
their culture and languages, within limits which did not openly infringe the 
interest of the State. 
An important factor in the legislative work of the Duma was its aim of 
decentralizing the administration of schools and associating unofficial bodies 
and private persons with the work of public education. 
It is a great thing to have brought system into the extension of school work 
and to have established the principles of universal and free education. ; 
Very typical have been the efforts made to destroy in the school system all 
class barriers and to democratize schools of all types. 
Lastly, we may remark the readiness of the Duma to meet the actual needs of 
the population, not confining itself within the hard and fast limits of general 
theories of education at the expense of practical knowledge, but also not har- 
nessing itself to utilitarian knowledge which denies the profit of general culture. 
Such, we may say, is the theoretical side of the inheritance which the third 
Imperial Duma can hand over to the fourth; the practical results can be 
expressed in two figures. If we add up all the credits which have passed 
through the budget. committee, including the ministries of finance, commerce, 
war, agriculture, and others, in five years the budget of public education has 
reached 170,000,000 rubles, while in 1907 it was only 85,000,000 rubles. In 
other words, the budget has doubled; and in 5 years of the representative 
régime, we have assigned to education a sum as large as that which was spent 
on it in the preceding 105 years under the old régime (1802-1907). 
These are the results of the work of the third Duma on public instruction, 
which, of themselves alone, eloquently show that the last five years of the new 
order of things have not passed without leaving their mark on Russia. 
To the external observer, the most important measure approved by 
the Duma was that establishing the principle of universal and free 
education. This was not done by a sweeping provision, but by a 
gradual process consisting of several financial measures passed at 
different times, but all tending to the same purpose. With respect 
to these Mr. Kovalevsky says: 
The Duma often made use of its own legislative initiative, but it also took 
much trouble over the examination of a whole series of bills presented by the’ 
Government. Its first attention and the chief interest of the country in general 
were directed to primary education. During the first session, in the spring, 
there was presented for discussion by the whole house a bill which, in spite of 
its modest title, was of-extreme importance to education in Russia. It was a 
proposal to assign 6,900,000 rubles for educational needs in connection with the 
introduction of universal education. It fell to the writer of this article to pilot 
through the Duma this bill and all other credits proposed for the same purpose. 
Sanctioned as law on May 16, 1908, this modest financial proposal settled the 
question of universal education in Russia. In it were also to be found those 
principles which were further developed in the law on universal education
-P-A-G-E-609
  
EDUCATION IN RUSSIA. 583 
adopted in the fourth session of the Duma. This was the first time that the 
Government had taken the line of subsidizing the local organs of self-govern- 
ment on a large and systematic scale, for the development of primary schools. . 
The adoption of the principle of free education, and also of direct cooperation 
of the State with the district councils, and the raising of the teachers’ salaries. 
to a minimum of 360 rubles, were the advances made in this law. In the fol- 
Jowing sessions the Duma adopted, almost without debate, financial proposals 
completing and extending the law of May 16, by assigning credits of 6,000,000. 
rubles in 1909, 10,000,000 rubles in 1910, 7,000,000 rubles in 1911, and 9,000,000 
rubles in 1912.* 
Equally important was the so-called building law. The foundation of new 
schools, of course, demanded new buildings. The building fund, named after 
Peter the Great, was taken as the nucleus for giving systematic subsidies and 
loans to the local representative bodies for building schools. After the first 
step of assigning” seven millions to the requirements of primary education, 
the second step became inevitable. The general question of universal education 
could not be advanced without settling that of requirements for building. The 
Duma decided to grant, in 1909, 1,000,000 rubles; in 1910, 4,000,000 rubles; 
in 1911, 10,000,000 rubles; and in 1912 the same. These sums constituted a 
fund which was only to supplement local resources for building. In all, with 
remains from credits for the maintenance of primary schools, school building 
in the course of these five years has cost the ministry of public instruction 
47,000,000 rubles. On July 5, 1909, was sanctioned the law creating this fund, 
“ and regulations were made for allotting both free subsidies and loans, in the 
proportion of 80 per cent of the cost of building. 
Although the measures passed by the third Duma have not been 
sanctioned by the Imperial Council, and therefore have not become 
effective, its work has béen eminently constructive; it has formulated 
principles which the succeeding Duma must take into consideration, 
and it has aroused and helped to focus public opinion on vital matters. 
AGENCIES FOR RURAL UPLIFT. 
Apart from legislative progress and the growth of public opinion, 
there are two agencies working in Russia directly for the uplift of 
the rural populations which deserve special mention. Early in the 
nineteenth century the ministry of imperial domains began to estab- 
lish village schools for the peasants on these properties. The schools 
were maintained by taxes levied on the peasants themselves, and were 
intended particularly to train clerks needed in the work of rural 
administration. 
_ From this initiative the idea of providing rural schools adapted to 
local conditions has spread to other ministries, and has engaged the 
active efforts of many proprietors of large estates as well as of pri- 
vate associations. Hence the need of distinction between rural schools 
and those of populous urban centers, which is claiming attention in 
the United States, has already worked itself into the educational 
policies of Russia.

    584 EDUCATION ‘REPORT, 1912. 
The second agency referred to is that of the peasant industries, the 
importance of which is greatly enhanced by recent efforts on the 
part of the Imperial Government and local authorities to increase 
their financial resources and prospects. 
The position of the peasant in Russia, his well-being or his pov- 
erty, is due largely to the existence of the organized peasant industries 
which have resulted from the instinct for cooperative work fostered 
by the institutions of the “mir” in the villages, and of the “ artel,” 
or voluntary associations of workmen. As a rule, only one industry 
is to be found in each village, as spoon making, linen weaving, or 
ikon painting. According to one authority— 
The most recent investigations seem to show that there are more than 
8,000,000 of the inhabitants of European Russia whose time is shared between 
agriculture and some form of industrial handicraft, meaning by this term the 
production of some sort of merchandise for sale, not for use in the family of 
the producer; and about 4,000,000, or thereabouts, whose whole time is engaged 
in handicrafts and small machine industries not grouped in the modern factory 
system. Where the wares produced are desirable and salable, the concomitant 
advantage of a healthy home life to the producer is a national asset. * * * 
The governments of Moscow, Vladimir, Yaroslaff, and Kostroma are the 
principal linen and flax weaving centers, the drawn-thread work of Vladimir . 
being well known and much appreciated in London and Paris. 
The metal work of the villager ranges from the roughest article of daily use 
for the peasants’ own needs to finely wrought filigree and enameled jewelry 
and to frames for ikons of the greatest merit. Their lace and embroidery have 
already found a market in the first-class shops of. London and Paris. Wood 
and horn carving finds a ready sale all over the Continent, and the quaint 
toys are eagerly acquired not only by English and French children but also by 
their elders.* : 
The Moscow zemstvo in 1885 started a museum in that city for the 
exhibit of the peasant industries of that government, and in 1888 
created a special commission to direct and extend the work. At the 
present time there are more than 15 provincial and district zemstvos 
supplying the koustari (peasants) with raw material, and an ex- 
tremely important form of help to the koustarnui industry by the 
zemstvos is the supplying of the koustari with financial aid. 
The interests of the koustarnui industry are intrusted to the department of 
rural economy and statistics of the ministry of agriculture. This department 
employs a special staff of experts in different branches of koustarnui work, has 
12 technical schools managed by State instructors, lends money on long credit, 
subsidizes koustarnui stores and workshops, publishes albums of drawings and 
designs, organizes exhibitions, and helps to maintain the St. Petersburg Kous- 
tarnui Museum, started by the Government in 1900. Besides this, when the 
State gives orders for koustarnui goods, the department acts as intermediary 
between the zemstvos and the respective Government institutions and, further, 
offers financial aid in exporting the products abroad.’

SECONDARY AND HIGHER EDUCATION. 
The history of secondary and higher education in Russia during 
the past 50 years is marked by a constant struggle between the prin- 
ciples of liberty and institutional autonomy on the one hand and those 
of official restriction and autocratic control on the other. The grow- 
ing disposition to give free scope for the development of liberal edu- 
cation was reflected in the discussions of the Duma and is embodied 
in the summary of its legislative work already cited. The present 
provision of secondary schools and higher institutions and the extent 
of their operations are indicated by the tables which follow:

HIGHER EDUCATION FOR WOMEN, 
The great forward movements in higher education during the 
past 50 years pertain to the education of women and to the exten- 
sion of technical education. 
The movement for the higher education of women has been deeply 
involved with socialistic and revolutionary tendencies, and _ has, 
therefore, been the object of suspicion on the part of the conserva- 
tive forces of the Empire. At the same time the demand for edu- 
cated women in the teaching profession and in the medical service 
has proved irresistible, and the Government has finally assumed a 
sympathetic attitude toward the movement. Provision for the train- 
ing of teachers is made by seminaries, which are included under the 
head of secondary institutions. These seminaries number at present 
87, of which 81 are maintained by the Government, and 6 by com- 
munal or private agencies. An interesting feature of this provision 
is the establishment of seminaries to prepare teachers for Tartar, 
Chuvash, Kirghiz, and other tribal schools. In addition to the 
seminaries, pedagogical courses are maintained in connection with 
higher urban schools and secondary schools for girls, and lectures 
on the theory and art of teaching are also given by university pro- 
fessors at St. Petersburg and Moscow; the tendency to bring the 
training of teachers more and more within the sphere of university 
influence increases. 
Although the universities of Russia have been closed to women, 
courses of instruction of the university standard were provided for 
them in 1911, as follows: 
St. Petersburg higher courses for women, comprising: The his- 
torico-philological section, 2,150 students; the physico-mathematical 
section, 1,507; and the law section, 625. The age of the students 
ranged from 17 to 50, while the greatest number fell between the 
ages of 19 and 28. Most of the students were graduates of gym- 
nasia of the ministry of public instruction, and of the Institutions 
of Empress Maria. 
The Moscow higher courses for women, with 4,676 students, com- 
prising: The historico-philological section, 2,383 students; the 
physico-mathematical section, 1,318; and the medical section, 975. 
The St. Petersburg Medical Institute for Women, organized in 
1904, had 1,618 students in 1910, and is maintained at an annual 
expenditure of about 316,000 rubles ($160,000), of which the Govy- 
ernment supplies a little more than one-third. 
TECHNICAL SCHOOLS, 
Provision for technical education of various degrees is a feature 
of the general movement for the development of the immense re- 
sources of the Empire and.their conversion into commercial products. -
-P-A-G-E-613
  EDUCATION IN RUSSIA. 587 
The need of trained workmen and of directors of large industries 
was first met by the establishment of technical schools in particular 
places, under the charge of different ministries. In 1881 these schools 
were all transferred to the ministry of public instruction, and grad- 
ually under this direction a system of technical schools has been 
organized, comprising: (1) Lower technical schools which combine 
with the elements of knowledge technical training required for the 
ruder kind of mechanical work—for machinists, draftsmen, ete.; (2) 
technical schools which provide for general education of the sec- 
ondary order, combined with technical training required for assistant 
engineers or foremen in the smaller industrial enterprises. 
“technical institutions were already established before the industrial 
movement set in and were intended to prepare experts for the service 
of the State. The scope of the higher institutions has necessarily 
been increased and some additions made to their number through the 
industrial pressure. There are at present six institutions of this 
order, as shown by the following table:

APPROPRIATIONS FOR EDUCATION IN 1911 AND 1912. 
The State appropriations for education in 1911 were as follows: 
Ministry of public instruction, 91,694,204 rubles ($47,222,410) ; other 
ministries for the support of schools, 13,269,204 rubles ($6,833,640) ; 
total, 104,563,204 rubles ($56,056,050). The corresponding amounts 
for 1912 were: Ministry of public instruction, 114,436,072 rubles 
($58,934,577) ; other ministries, 17,289,039 rubles ($8,903,855) ; total, 
131,725,111 rubles ($67,838,432). For elementary schools alone the 
minister of public instruction in 1911 expended 46,083,000 rubles 
and the Holy Synod about 15,000,000, making a total of 61,083,000 
rubles ($31,457,745). -

SPREAD OF MODERN INFLUENCES. 
The continent of Asia challenges attention by the rapid spread of 
modern influences over its vast area, which are marked throughout 
their progress by the rise of schools and educational systems. Siberia 
is included in the Russian plans for public instruction; Persia is 
modifying its schools under European influences; Arabia is affected 
by the forces that are slowly transforming all Moslem peoples; China 
is in a ferment of educational activity ;* Siam has modernized all its 
schools; Japan and India are, respectively, fields of the two greatest 
educational experiments of modern times; and the Dutch in Java and 
the Americans in the Philippines are conducting the greatest work 
in race education. 
SYSTEM OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN JAPAN. 
Administration.—The system of public instruction in Japan resem- 
bles that of France in its general organization and administration. 
Control of the system is centralized in the minister of state for educa- 
tion, who is assisted by a vice minister, chiefs of bureaus, and a 
superior council, which is an advisory body. The official staff of the 
department includes experts for the examination of textbooks, and a 
corps of technologists who advise as to school buildings, hygienic 
matters, and questions pertaining to technical education. The Em-

cently Reconstructed, by Harry Edwin King, vice president of the Peking University.

pire is divided into five circuits, each in charge of an inspector 
appointed by the minister. For local educational administration the 
country is divided into the Hokkaido (territory of the aborigines), 
3 “fu” and 43 “ken,” which correspond to the Departments or 
“prefectures” of France, and these are subdivided into “ guns” or 
cantons. The educational affairs of the main divisions are under the 
control of their chief executive officers, who are appointed by the 
Emperor, but in each division and also in the “guns” the minister 
of education is represented by inspectors. The inspectors, the direc- 
tors of special classes of schools, presidents of the imperial universi- 
ties, ete., are all selected by examination or by official promotion, and 
are members of the superior council, which also includes representa- 
tive men distinguished for learning or educational experience. The 
council, therefore, brings to the service of an imperial and highly 
centralized system professional advice and disinterested councils. 
Jurrent movements.—Since the close of the war with Russia the 
educational system has been the subject of renewed concern to the ” 
Government because of the increasing complexity of the internal 
affairs of the Empire and of its international relations, and for the 
additional reason, expressed by the minister, because “the popular 
tide of ideas and sentiments, which had been disturbed by the late 
war, has been liable to impede the healthy currents of educational 
principles and measures.” 
The purpose of the Government to enlarge provision for popular 
education and to deepen its influence upon the character of the 
people is indicated by an extension of the compulsory period by two 
years—covering ages 6 to 12 years instead of 6 to 10 as formerly— 
by additional measures for securing well-trained teachers, and by 
greater stress on moral training as an essential feature of the ele- 
mentary programs. During the past year the textbooks on morality 
were revised and— : 
the principles of loyalty and filial piety were made clearer than ever in con- 
formity to the spirit of the imperial rescript on education, and special care 
was taken in explaining and enforcing the unique characteristics of the Jap- 
anese people. . 
Secondary education has also been the subject of investigation and 
discussion in order that advantage may be taken of the experience 
of foreign countries in this important field, with a view to such 
modifications of the secondary schools of Japan as accord with the 
institutions of that country. In this relation the minister observes 
that— 
the success or failure of secondary education not only has much to do with 
special and university education, but also exerts a great influence upon the 
refinement of the middle class of the people. 
 
-P-A-G-E-617
SYSTEM OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN JAPAN. 591 
The provision made for the education of women is the most remark- 
able outcome of the modern movement in Japan. In the ordinary 
elementary schools the number of girls is very nearly equal to the 
number of boys, and comprises 84 per cent of the girls of school ages, 
as against 86 per cent in the case of boys. The number of girls in 
high schools has increased rapidly, rising from 81,574 in 1905-6 to 
51,437 in 1909-10, an increase of 63 per cent in half a decade. The 
private university for women, founded in 1901 with the support of 
the leading men of the country, including Marquis Ito, Count Okuma, 
and Baron Utsumi, and encouraged by the active efforts of the Em- 
press, has awakened keen interest in the higher education of women, 
an interest which is constantly stimulated by the influence of its 
graduates who are distributed throughout the Empire. The Japanese 
Women’s Education Society not only promotes the university cause, 
but in addition provision for training girls in handicrafts, according 
to the demands of Japanese industry. 
Technical education has naturally derived a new impulse from the 
expansion of the Empire. Provision has been made for new technical 
schools, carefully adapted to the needs of special localities, and the 
schools already established have been more perfectly equipped and 
their programs revised. By an imperial ordinance of March, 1908, 
the Kagoshima Higher School of Agriculture and Forestry was 
founded, and the school was opened and instruction commenced in 
September of that year. The same ordinance sanctioned the found- 
ing of the Uyeda Special School of Sericulture and Filature, the 
Otaru Higher Commercial School, the Yonezawa Higher Technical 
School, the Akita Special School of Mining, etc., which are to be 
opened next year. 
Recent measures pertaining to the imperial universities are intended 
to extend their scope, raise their standards, or increase their re- 
sources. In the college of law of the Imperial University of Tokyo 
a commercial course was established, to be opened in September of 
the current year; in the college of literature all branches of the cur- 
riculum were made obligatory. Funds are provided to enable young 
men who have been appointed as assistant professors in the universi- 
ties to make special preparation for their duties by foreign study. 
The Tohoku Imperial University includes at present only the Sapporo 
Agricultural College, which was raised to university rank in 1909, 
since which time the requirements for admission and graduation have 
been increased and several new departments added, in particular a 
department of forestry and a department of agricultural engineering. 
Arrangements are now in progress for the establishment of colleges 
of science and of liberal arts to complete the university organization.

SYSTEM OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN JAPAN. 593 
The total expenditure for education in 1909-10 was 76,650,922 
yen, equivalent to $38,172,159. Of this amount, 57,076,003 yen 
($28,423,850) was incurred for elementary schools. The entire ex- 
penditure for education as compared with the previous year showed 
an increase of 5,903,938 yen, of which increase 93 per cent was for 
ordinary expenditures. 
IMPERIAL ORDINANCE RESPECTING EDUCATION IN CHOSEN. 
The spirit and purposes which animate and direct education in 
Japan are reflected in the imperial ordinance of August 23, 1911, 
relating to education in Chosen (Korea). The ordinance provides 
for three grades of education, common, industrial, and special, which 
are defined as follows: 
Common education shall aim at imparting common knowledge and art, with 
special attention to engendering national ideas and the spread of the national 
language. 
Industrial education will include the study of agriculture, commerce, and 
technical industries. 
Special education shall embrace the higher branches of science and the arts. 
The common schools, following the Japanese system, are classed as 
elementary schools, at which attendance is obligatory for all children, 
ages 8 to 12, and high schools,-in which the sexes are separated. 
Boys are admitted for a four years’ course at the full age of 12 years, 
while girls are admitted for a three years’ course at the full age of 
12 years. Both boys and girls must be graduates of the common 
schools. Special courses in sewing and domestic manual work are 
provided for girls. 
Provision is made for normal schools for both sexes, and the in- 
dustrial schools prepare their students for agriculture, commerce, 
or technical industries according to local needs. 
The spécial schools “ giving instruction in higher science and 
arts” are arranged for either a three or a four years’ course. While 
the ordinance prescribes the main features of the system, the full 
details are left to the Governor General, who is also invested with 
the very extensive power of making necessary arrangements affect- 
ing schools which have been heretofore established in Chosen, irre- 
spective of the provisions of the ordinance. 
Tn all classes of schools, inculcating the love of the country in the 
minds of young Koreans and the spread of the knowledge of Japa- 
nese among them must be steadily maintained.

  594 EDUCATION ‘REPORT, 1912. 
INDIA. 
SYSTEM OF EDUCATION. 
The system of education established by the British Government in 
India has recently assumed a new character, a change full of sug- 
gestion for every nation charged with similar responsibilities. No 
other undertaking of the kind, it is true, is comparable with that at- 
tempted in India, which, by reason of its vast population, variety of 
races and religions, deep-rooted social system, extremes of culture and 
ignorance, presented unparalleled obstacles to the introduction of 
foreign ideas and customs. 
It is not intended to review the history of the educational experi- 
ment, which dates from the now famous dispatch of 1854, by which 
the home Government “laid down with fullness and precision the 
principles that were to guide the Indian Government in the perform- 
ance of their great task.” The main features of the educational 
policy here outlined have been maintained to the present time, and 
form the administrative framework of the educational system. This 
comprises (1) the constitution of educational departments in the 
several Provinces (formerly presidencies) ; (2) the establishment of 
universities at the presidency towns; (8) the support of training 
schools for teachers; (4) the maintenance of the existing Government 
colleges and high schools, and the increase of their number; (5) the 
establishment of new middle schools; (6) increased attention to ver- 
nacular schools, indigenous or other, for elementary education; (7) 
the introduction of a system of Government “ grants-in-aid”; (8) a 
system of inspection with periodical reports to the provincial gov- 
ernments. 
The outline of this system may be taken as an index to its opera- 
tions: It afforded ample opportunity for building up an official 
caste; for placing chief stress on higher education of an English 
type through the establishment of Government institutions for that 
purpose; for encouraging a superficial interest in the English 
language as a passport to civil and commercial posts; and it left ele- 
mentary education practically without form or direction. The prog- 
ress of the system and its defects were set forth with great candor 
by successive commissions appointed to examine into its operations. 
The need of a central directive force was urged in particular by the 
commission of 1882, and after two decades, with ever-increasing 
proof of the failure of the system to inmprove the condition of the 
people as a whole, the office of Director General of Education was 
created in 1902, and in 1904 there was issued a Government document 
dealing with the subject, which bears the signature of Lord Curzon. 
This “resolution,” as it was called, declared in no uncertain terms 
the determination of the viceroy to employ the forces at his com-
-P-A-G-E-621

mand for the realization of purposes which had hitherto been ig- 
nored. These purposes were, (1) the education of the people through 
the use of the vernacular tongues; (2) the development of in- 
digenous handicrafts; (3) the systematic development of the agri- 
cultural resources of the Empire. 
THE PRESENT OUTLOOK. 
In the eight years that have elapsed since the order of 1904 was 
issued these purposes have been steadily maintained. The first effort 
of the director general was to get into clear view the educational 
‘problem from the native standpoint in place of the official; this 
effort has resulted in a series of “ occasional reports ” which, written 
in popular style, focus attention upon the rural school, its problems 
and possibilities as they exist in India, and in comparison also with 
the same* problems in other countries. The work has been accom- 
panied by practical measures for the improvement of rural education 
in all the provinces. 
The central authority for education has developed into a depart- 
ment whose chief is a member of the council of the Governor General, 
or, to use the current title, minister of education, a change which for 
the present insures greater prestige and larger resources for the 
system. 
The presence of King George at the “durbar” held at Delhi 
December 12, 1911, gave occasion for the announcement of changes 
in the Government policy with respect to India. An increased 
grant amounting to 50 lakhs of ruppees ($1,620,000) was pledged 
for popular education, and on the part of the Government the in- 
tention was declared of “ making education in India as accessible as 
possible.” The hope excited by this action has been raised still 
higher by the speech made in August, 1912, in the House of Com- 
mons by Mr. Mentagu, undersecretary of state for India, in support 
of the Indian budget. In a summary of this address the London 
Times says: 
The government of India are introducing extensive schemes for the enlarge- 
ment and improvement of facilities for primary education. In the past it was 
justly complained that the British in India devoted themselves too exclusively 
to higher education, and neglected the equally important question of primary 
schools. ‘They sought to build the steeple before the church had been erected. 
That reproach is now in process of remoyal. The program sketched by Mr. 
Montagu will ultimately increase the total number of primary schools by 
90,000, or 75 per cent, and will double the school-going population. The aver- 
age expenditure on each primary school will be doubled, and the wretched pay 
of the teachers will be substantially increased. 
* * * Similar large developments are proposed in the systems of secondary 
and university education. * * * The government of India are already 
proposing to carry their new ideals into practice in the university about to be 
 
-P-A-G-E-622
596 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
established at Dacca. Similar universities are projected at Benares and Ran- 
goon. The older institutions will gradually be transformed. The Mahomedan 
College at Aligarh, which already fulfills in great measure the new require- 
ments, will probably be raised to the dignity of a university. When these 
broad and sweeping changes have been carried out the evils which have hitherto 
seemed almost inseparable from Indian university education, particularly in 
Bengal, may well tend to disappear. 
The increase in resources is, however, less important thar the pro- 
posed change in their distribution. In the decade 1900 to 1910 the 
total expenditure doubled, rising from 11} million dollars to nearly 
23 millions; but the greater part of this amount went to the support 
of secondary and higher education, instead of being devoted to the 
spread of popular education. To this purpose the special appropria- 
tion and the increase of the ordinary appropriation, both promised 
at the durbar, are to be devoted. Even these increased Government 
grants, however, will, it is urged, accomplish little unless they are 
met by equal liberality on the part of the provincial and municipal 
authorities. : 
From the latest statistics it appears that about 54 million children 
attend the elementary schools, but this number comprises only 30 
per cent of the boys of school-going age and 5 per cent of the girls. 
Census estimates show that there are hundreds of thousands of Indian 
children living far beyond the “3-mile limit ” distance from a school, 
and even for those within reach of a school there are few competent 
teachers. In the quinquennial report covering the years 1902-1907 
it was declared that if the whole of the direct expenditure on primary 
education were devoted to the salary of teachers it would yield on 
an average only 8 rupees ($2.60) a month. The local authorities 
were all agreed as to the pressing necessity of improving the teaching 
service, and while some progress in this respect has been made in the 
past five years, the appropriation of the whole amount of the special 
grant to the salaries of teachers would not meet this one need. 
It should be observed further that in the present plans for India 
the expression “ popular education” is taken in its full sense, includ- 
ing not simply the three Rs, but provision for industrial training on 
the basis of native arts and crafts. This purpose strikes to the deep- 
est roots of Indian community life and organization. 
The task to which the government of India stands pledged will be 
better appreciated by-a consideration of the population to be reached 
and the present extent of the system of modern education as shown by 
official statistics. 
STATISTICAL SUMMARY. 
Population—The fourth general census of India, taken on the 
10th of March, 1911, gives as the total population 315,132,537. Of 
this total, 244,267,542, or 78 per cent, were comprised in British  
-P-A-G-E-623
INDIA. 597 
India; the remaining 22 per cent pertain to native States, which 
sustain certain relations to the British Government, but have inde- 
pendent management of education. Considering the entire Empire, 
the population was divided by religions as follows: Hindus, 69 per 
cent of the total; Mohammedans, 21 per cent; Buddhists (nearly all 
in Burma), 3 per cent; leaving 7 per cent for all other religions. 
According to Whitaker’s Almanac about two-thirds of this popu- 
lation “depend directly on agriculture,” while many others are 
partially dependent on the same industry. About 6 per cent are 
engaged in earthwork and general labor. The cotton industry 
supported over 7,500,000 persons in 1901, more than two-thirds of 
whom depend on hand weaving. There are 5,500,000 persons in 
Government service, civil or military. According to the census of 
1901, there are 147 vernacular languages of extraordinary variety 
in use in the Empire. Hindustani, a dialect of Hindi, has become 
the literary language of Hindustan, and is the “lingua franca of 
India.”

  598 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
In addition to the professional courses of instruction comprised in 
the above table, there were other special schools, as follows: Schools 
of art, with 1,673 students; technical and industrial schools, students 
8,447; commercial schools, students 1,460; altogether a total of 34,936 
preparing either for the liberal professions or for technical and art 
industries. 
In 1910, the year to which the foregoing statistics pertain, the total 
expenditure for education in India was £4,592,437; it increased in 
the following year to £4,780,000 ($23,230,800). Of the latter amount, 
more than half, namely, £2,460,000, was met from public funds; the 
remainder from private funds, fees, subscriptions, etc. The public 
funds are derived from provincial revenues, which contributed two- 
thirds of the total, and local and municipal funds the remaining 
one-third. 
The provincial funds are made up from imperial grants and the 
revenues of the respective Provinces. The increased grant, announced 
on the occasion of the Delhi durbar, was not available until 1911-12, 
and consequently does not figure in these estimates. 
EVIDENCES OF THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SYSTEM OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. 
It need hardly be said that the efficiency of the Indian system of 
education can not be estimated by the standards applied in other 
countries, as extent of illiteracy or amount of school attendance. 
Modern education in India is developing under conditions and in- 
volves problems that are nowhere else encountered. It must, there- 
fore, be judged from standpoints peculiar to itself; such are the 
increase in the number of girls brought under instruction and the 
growing interest of Mohammedans in the schools, for progress in 
both respects is the sign of the breaking up of social customs and 
religious prejudices that offered from the first the greatest opposition 
to the spread of modern education. It is, therefore, of deep signifi- 
cance that the number of girls under instruction in secondary schools 
in 1900, viz, 41,356, had increased to 66,228 in 1910, or by 62 per cent; 
and the number of girls in primary schools from, 192,496 to 389,343, 
or an increase of 104 per cent. During the same period the number 
of Mohammedans attending schools under Government or private 
management in which modern secular instruction is given increased 
from 946,988 to 1,394,088, or 47 per cent. 
The fact should also be emphasized that the leading native States 
have not only modeled their systems of education on that maintained 
by the British Government, but have made even greater progress in 
the application of its principles.
-P-A-G-E-625
  INDIA. 599 
THE RURAL MASSES. 
The manner in which the agricultural department of India supple- 
ments the department of education and the difficulties with which 
both have to contend are indicated by the following extracts from 
a recent consular report from Calcutta. 
The dense ignorance and determined conservatism of the greater portion of 
the agricultural population of India are commonplaces of knowledge. They are 
lamented by all who have at heart the progress of that class, and of the Empire. 
By none are they lamented more sincerely than by the officers of the Indian 
agricultural department. These have, ever since they began experimenting with 
Indian agricultural conditions, sought anxiously for means whereby the 
ignorance of the average peasant farmers, the raiyat and zemindar, could be 
informed, and early and radical reforms introduced into the methods of 
husbandry. The legends of the ignorant West about the wonderful fertility of 
India are fading. Men do not now talk with Burke of the land where the earth 
had only to be tickled with the hoe in order to laugh with a harvest. The 
very moderate fertility of the soil of India has now been appreciated at its 
proper worth and due heed paid to the precarious nature of the rainfall upon 
which the greater part of the land must depend for the feeding of its crops, 
however great may be the extension of the irrigation canals. Now, with rare 
exceptions, the methods pursued by Indian husbandmen are as wasteful as those 
of the average American farmer. They lead directly to the deterioration of 
soil and of stock. The yield per acre, good in new-broken-lands, soon is re- 
duced by overcropping and bad tillage to a ridiculously and perilously low 
figure. The cattle also deteriorate through starvation—calves because they are: 
deprived of their mother’s milk, and mature beasts because of drought or lack 
of foresight. Lack of attention and indiscriminate breeding hasten the de- 
generation till the average Indian cattle are the worst in the world. 
How to lessen the dense ignorance and carelessness that cause all this: 
tremendous damage, and to improve Indian agriculture, leading to an early 
betterment of the land and the cattle is a problem that occupies constantly the 
minds of the best among the agricultural officers of the Empire. The problem: 
is a difficult one, for the Indian agriculturist is a difficult person to interest in 
changes, and his ignorance is so intense and contented. The fact that India is: 
a yery huge and varied place, whilst the agricultural officers who have the task 
of its education in hand are very few and somewhat imperfectly acquainted with 
the vernaculars, does not lessen the difficulties. A very small percentage of 
those interested in agriculture can read even their own vernaculars, -and of 
these a still smaller number are capable of really digesting and acting upon 
any useful information that is contained in the literature that may come into 
their hands. * * * 
Those classes can be reached only by oral instruction given in their own 
languages in their own villages. The training of the right kind of farm 
managers and itinerant instructors, well but not too highly educated, and 
preferably belonging to the agricultural classes themselves, must be the most 
important duty of the State experts for some time to come.*

MODERN EDUCATION IN AFRICA. 
ALGERIA. 
The advance of modern education in Africa follows the course of 
Turopean colonization and commercial expansion. In the north, 
Algeria has been fully assimilated to France in this respect and forms 
a division, “academy,” of the French system. Official statistics show 
that this division had in 1910 a total of 116 infant schools, of which 
88 were public, comprising 24,889 pupils, and 1,443 primary schools, 
of which 1,346 were public, with a total of 147,100 pupils; in the 
public lycée for boys there were 2,882 pupils, and in the lycée for 
girls 262 pupils. The faculties which in 1909 were organized into a 
university reported for 1911 a total of 1,283 students. There were 
about 3,500 teachers engaged in the public primary schools, all of 
whom were specially trained for service in this tropical country, more 
than half of them being men well prepared to interest their pupils 
in the development of the natural resources of the country. 
  
EGYPT. 
Modern education in Egypt is the product of missionary enterprise 
and of the efforts of the two European powers, France and England, 
that have successively exercised chief influence in the Government of 
the Khedive. Of about 700 modern schools, more than half are main- 
tained by the Government. They are well graded, carefully in- 
spected, and enroll about 9,000 students, of whom over 1,000 are in 
the professional colleges. These numbers do not include the ele- 
mentary vernacular schools (Kuttabs), which are of very ancient 
origin and generally connected with the mosques, but have recently 
been brought under Government inspection and follow a prescribed 
program. In 1911 the schools of this class were attended by about 
15,000 children. 
  
THE COAST REGIONS. 
The western and eastern coasts of Africa are divided into what 
may be termed “spheres of influence,” chiefly French and German. 
For the areas on the west coast under French control, including the 
Senegal, Upper Senegal and Niger, French Guinea, the Ivory Coast, 
and Dahomey, an inspector general of education was appointed in 
1903, with headquarters at Dakar, and year by year the number of 
schools maintained either by public funds or under private manage- 
ment increases. Nearly 15,000 boys, it is estimated, are receiving 
instruction in French schools under this general administration.

UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA. 601 
The island of Madagascar, on the eastern coast of Africa, which 
has been a French colony since 1896, has a system of compulsory 
_ education ; all schools, whether public or private, are under inspection 
and are obliged to follow Government programs, which invariably 
include the French language. 
While the Germans have not attempted extensive educational work 
in Africa, the seat of government in each of their colonies is a center 
of educational influence and a direct incentive to progress. Mission- 
ary schools are encouraged and native interpreters and native police 
are employed in the Government service; these individuals, selected 
from the mass of rude tribal peoples, are naturally impressed with the 
ideas of discipline and orderly life, which they impart in turn to 
their own people. 
  
UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA, 
The chief theater of educational activity on this southern continent 
-at the present time is the Union of South Africa, constituted by an 
act of 1909, which became effective May 31, 1910. The federation 
comprises the former self-governing colonies of the Cape of Good 
Hope, Natal, the Transvaal, and the Orange River Colony. The seat 
of the Government is Pretoria and the seat of the legislature is Cape 
Town. The executive power of the union is vested in a governor 
general appointed by the British Sovereign; a provincial council in 
each province has power to legislate by ordinance on subjects specified 
in the act and on such other subjects as may be delegated to it. 
Public affairs are administered by executive departments, including 
a department of education, whose chief bears the title of minister of 
education. 
In the act of 1909 it was— 
provided that ‘‘ Education, other than higher education, for a period of five years 
and thereafter, until Parliament otherwise provides, shall be and remain under 
the jurisdiction of the respective provincial councils.” For practical purposes Z 
it has been provisionally determined that all post-matriculation instruction shall 
be deemed to constitute higher education. 
At present, therefore, elementary education in each of the federated 
States is separately administered; the department of education under 
the minister has general control of the University of the Cape of 
Good Hope, situated at Cape Town, a group of seven colleges which 
prepare students for university degrees, and the South African School 
of Mines and Technology, situated at Johannesburg. 
The public schools maintained in the four States which make up 
the Union of South Africa are intended for the children of Europeans 
and their descendants, and, according to current reports, the effort to 
get all such children under instruction has been successful. The total  
-P-A-G-E-628
602 * EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
white population to be dealt with is 1,840,211, and the total school 
enrollment 289,668, or 15.7 per cent of the population. This ratio is 
surpassed by very few European countries. The attention of the 
authorities is at present directed to the improvement of the schools 
by raising the qualifications of teachers and by adapting both schools 
and instruction to local conditions; hence the need of distinguishing 
between urban and rural communities has arisen, and with that the 
question of the language of instruction. The current discussions of 
the latter throw much light on the language problem as it exists in 
other countries; at the present time the weight of official opinion, as 
well as the general preference of parents, favors the use of English 
as the medium of instruction, and the inclusion of Dutch as a branch 
to be taught where circumstances require. 
The education of the native population has been left almost entirely 
to mission schools, which are aided, as a rule, by Government sub- 
~ sidies; it is now generally recognized that this part of the educa- 
tional work,must be brought as rapidly as possible under Government 
control, and the means of extending the public system in this direc- 
tion is at present a prominent subject of thought and discussion in 
all the States. 
EDUCATION COMMISSION FOR CAPE COLONY. 
As a consequence of the relations brought about by the union, an 
education commission was appointed by the Cape Colony Government 
in 1910 to investigate the educational systems of all the States, in 
order to make recommendations with respect to the Cape system, hay- 
ing regard to the circumstances of South Africa as a whole. The 
report of this commission, which has just been published, deals 
minutely and comprehensively with the entire situation and brings 
clearly to view the special problems which it involves, problems 
arising from the racial differences of the white population and their 
relations with the natives. The situation is similar to that in the 
Philippine Islands, and the Government of the latter has already 
sought from the South African authorities information and sug- 
gestions relating to their common difficulties. 
It would be impossible here to attempt any extended analysis of 
the report of the commission; it must suffice to refer to a few par- 
ticulars drawn from an able summary of the document in the London 
Times:+ 
RELIGION, 
As regards religious instruction, the commission finds that the present system, 
which allows committees to give what religious instruction they like, but does 
not compel them to give any, results in practice in general inattention to the 
  
1 The Times Educational Supplement, June 4, 1912, pp. 67-68.
-P-A-G-E-629
  
UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA, 603 
religious and moral elements of education and in widespread ignorance of the 
Scriptures, amounting at times to something like the paganization of the people, 
and likely if not checked to advance and increase in intensity. The importance 
of religious and moral instruction both in the formation of character and in the 
culture of the intellect is insisted on, and the commission recommends that the 
powers of the committees should not be curtailed, but that, subject to a con- 
science clause, Bible teaching should be given in all schools. * * * It also 
recommends that religious instruction should be inspected, but not examined; 
that Bible teaching should include definite instruction in Christian ethics; that 
committees should be free to make all necessary inquiries as to the capability 
of candidates to give Bible instruction ; that a course in religious teaching should 
be part of the course for teachers, whose certificates should show whether they 
have taken it or not. 
THE FREEDOM OF THE TEACHER. 
A third general principle is the necessity of engendering habits of independent 
reading and thinking, as to which the commission reports that matters are by 
no means satisfactory, chiefly owing to the mechanical methods pursued in many 
schools and to a large extent forced upon them by the rigidity of the curriculum 
and the system of inspection. The chief remedy proposed is to give the teachers 
larger freedom. At present the curriculum is fixed and is fairly suitable to the 
European boy of moderate abilities, but not equally so to the country children, 
the girls, the colored, and the exceptionally capable or dull. The commission 
is convinced that a change imparting more elasticity to the system would be 
for the general good and would remove the lack of vitality and originality which 
now exists. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
The report lays great stress on the training of teachers, and says that ideals 
have been pitched far too low, contrasting the training of doctors and of 
teachers. * * * The commission further finds that the training institu- 
tions are not enough in touch with the spirit of the country as a whole, that 
the training is not sufficiently liberal and fails to produce general culture, and 
that no attempt whatever has been made to deal with the problem of the supply 
of teachers with a trained eye for country life. * * * There is general 
agreement that a special course is required for secondary teachers and that this 
must be given in connection with the university colleges, the ideal being a two 
years’ professional course following on graduation or its equivalent, and this 
being the standard for all secondary teachers. 
COMPULSORY EDUCATION, SCHOOL BUILDINGS, ETC. 
The report proposes that compulsion up to Standard (grade) IV should be 
made universal, and that school boards or the administration should be em- 
powered to raise the standard of compulsion to the seventh standard, provided 
that it is not raised by more than one standard a year. As regards school build- 
ings, it calls attention to the pitiable condition of things in country districts, 
instancing a school where there are from 35 to 40 children and the only school- 
room is the teacher’s dining room, and remarks that if some few places are 
housed like Dives in the parable many others are like Lazarus at his gate, and 
that the neglect of open-air schools, which are much used in the far less suit- 
able climates of Germany and England, is hard to justify. It suggests that 
schools should be free to work on Saturdays with two half holidays, if the 
committees so desire, and comments adversely on the prevalent custom of having 
one long session in the school day with short breaks, instead of two sessions
-P-A-G-E-630
  604 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
with a long break, as was contemplated in 1865. The need for medical inspec- 
tion of school children appears to be generally felt, and the commission urges 
that the school boards should be given the necessary powers to conduct medical 
inspections and encouraged to use them. 
FINANCE, 
The report ends with a striking financial scheme. The great bulk of the evi- 
dence is against free education, and the commission approves of the payment of 
fees by parents who can pay them, provision being made for poor students of 
ability not only up to Standard IV, as now, but throughout the school course. 
The difficulty is with regard to the question of grants. The commission observes 
that the pound-for-pound principle is a survival of the old system when’ the 
Government dealt with individual schools, that its continuance maintains the 
inequitable principle of contributing in inverse proportion to the need of the 
recipient and necessitates cumbrous adjustments and readjustments having no 
purpose, and that a scheme suited to the present circumstances has to be thought 
out and should embody four principles. It should be simple and involve the 
minimum of clerical work; it should facilitate the payment of teachers, so that 
poor districts may have good teachers; it should not involve the Government in 
expenditure when there is no local contribution; and it should not involve the 
Government in unlimited liability. * * * The commission estimates that the 
immediate cost of its proposals, on the basis of the latest accounts available, 
which are for the year ending with last June, would be £47,000, made up of 
£12,000 for public and mission schools, £20,000 for training institutes, £10,000 
for industrial schools, and £5,000 for schools for defectives. Possible adminis- 
trative economies are in the main balanced by the new appointments proposed. 
THE COLORED PEOPLE. 
In addition to the matters covered by the summary from which 
the above citations have been made, the report of the commission 
deals particularly with the education of the colored people, which is 
declared to be “very unsatisfactory.” The superintendent general 
of education in his evidence admitted that “the colored people are 
not receiving their rights in the matter of education;” as a conse- 
quence of their general neglect, “a very large proportion of the youth 
of this race,” he said, “are growing up under no restraint of disci- 
pline (for their parents are away at work all day) ; these neglected 
children lead, it is to be feared, vicious lives, and acquire habits of 
laziness that totally unfit them to become good servants.” + 
The opinion is expressed by the commission that— 
the evil tends to increase, for the churches are wearying of the burden of col- 
ored education, and at present they alone stand between the colored population 
and entire educational destitution. In the country districts this is not so seri- 
ous, but in the towns there can be no doubt that our neglect is raising up crime 
and disease, which are bound to grow into formidable lashes for our own backs 
and those of our children. 
It is worthy of note also that the commission insists upon religious 
education and manual training as essential for the development of . the colored race.

AUSTRALIA. 
The Commonwealth of Australia was proclaimed at Sydney, Janu- 
ary 1, 1901. Legislative power is vested in a Federal Parliament, 
consisting of the King, a Senate, and a House of Representatives, 
the King being represented by a Governor General. The several 
State parliaments retain legislative authority in all matters which 
are not transferred to the Federal Parliament. Education is one 
of the important matters reserved to the States. 
The area and population of the six States comprised in the feder- 
ation are as follows:

THE SYSTEMS OF PUBLIC EDUCATION. 
Control of the systems.—The control of education in each of the 
States is vested in a minister appointed for this particular interest or 
combining it with some closely allied interest. To the chief officer 
is consigned not only the general administration of the system, but 
also, to a degree, its local direction. He decides as to the establish- 
ment of school districts and schools, and controls the school funds 
and properties. In Victoria and New South Wales appointments of 
teachers and inspectors emanate from a civil-service board; in the 
other States they are made by the minister. . 
605
-P-A-G-E-632
  
606 . EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
Local boards of advice are constituted by election (in Queensland 
appointed by the governor), and their representatives carry great 
weight in respect to the school affairs of their several districts, but the 
authority remains in every case with the minister. 
Sources of support.—In all the States the schools are supported by 
appropriations from the public treasury. 
Completeness of school provision.—The classes of schools recog- 
nized in the State laws give evidence of the widely different conditions 
under which the schools of different districts are maintained and also 
the efforts to adjust the school provision to these varying conditions. 
The typical school is called simply the public or State school. It 
must maintain a certain average enrollment and must be kept in ses- 
sion the full time. ‘There are also provisional schools; that is, schools 
which may be kept open for the full time annually but whose average 
enrollment is below the standard, and half-time schools in districts 
where the number of children is too small to justify the expense of a 
full-time school. In such cases a teacher is appointed for two or 
more districts and holds the school in each on alternate days or for 
a half session each day, according to the distance to be traveled. 
House-to-house schools have also been recognized as a temporary 
expedient. The plan of conveying children at public expense from 
isolated districts to a central school has been recently adopted and is 
gradually superseding that of special and half-time schools. In Vic- 
toria this plan is extensively employed and has virtually eliminated 
the half-time schools. Night schools, and in some of the colonies 
infant schools, complete the public provision for popular education. 
Compulsory attendance.—Attendance upon school is compulsory 
for all children of legal school age unless they are educated privately 
or exempt by law. 
Secular character of the schools—In Victoria and Queensland the 
public schools are strictly secular; in South Australia nonsectarian 
religious instruction is allowed; in New South Wales and West Aus- 
tralia provision is made for religious instruction in the schools at 
an hour when children may be withdrawn if their parents object to 
their presence. 5 
In addition to the very complete provision for elementary educa- 
tion maintained by the several governments, every State in the 
Australian federation makes appropriations for secondary education 
either by a system of State scholarships, open to competition, or by 
grants to the individual institutions. 
Technical education is also fostered in all the States, and technical 
schools or classes aided by public funds are found in all the chief 
cities. 
The Australian universities have been extensively aided by legisla- 
tive appropriations or by grants of land. These institutions are
-P-A-G-E-633

authorized to confer the same degrees as the universities in England, 
with the exception of degrees in divinity, and women are admitted 
to all their privileges,

tems are here presented. To complete the summary, the statistics of 
private schools and universities are also given.

CURRENT ACTIVITIES. 
The activity with respect to education, which has been particularly 
marked since the formation of the Commonwealth, has been con- 
tinued during the past year. In all the States, two tendencies are 
noticeable: First, that of careful inquiry and investigation, especially 
in regard to the educational provision in foreign countries; second, 
the tendency to increase the scope of the central authority in the sev- 
eral States. Within the past few years the States of New South 
Wales and Victoria have sent commissions of éxperts to inspect and 
report on the methods adopted in the schools of the chief countries 
of Europe and of America, and several of the States have appointed 
commissions to make exhaustive investigation of home conditions. 
An educational. commission of the latter character was appointed 
 
-P-A-G-E-634
  608 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
also in New Zealand in 1908, and its report has been issued during 
the current year. The work of these commissions has excited wide- 
spread discussion in the public press and in legislative assemblies, 
and consequently the people of Australia, and of New Zealand also, 
have been excited to a very lively interest in the measures proposed 
for improving and extending the means of education in their midst. 
The following statements pertaining to individual States embody 
the results of these preliminary measures so far as they have been 
reported to this office. 
NEW SOUTH WALES, 
|The success of the Labor Party in New South Wales, with the con- 
sequent formation of a labor ministry, draws special attention to the 
plans for education adopted under the new party. It was well known 
that the ministry came into office with a definite and long-considered 
plan respecting public education about which expert opinion had been 
sought. As set forth in a communication to the London Times, the 
chief features of this plan were as follows: 
(a) A complete chain of schools leading up from the existing primary State 
schools either to the university or to the child’s future work, and (b) control 
of this chain, as far as possible, by a reformed and widened university senate, 
working in friendly cooperation with the department of education. The first 
was mainly administrative work, the second needed legislation. 
According to the correspondent referred to, it was expected that 
the whole scheme would be in working order by February, 1911, but 
unexpected obstacles arose, and thus far little has been accomplished, 
excepting with reference to secondary schools, which part of the 
scheme, as carried out, is described as follows: 
A child leaving the primary school, usually about 13 years. old, has three 
courses open to him or her. One ends in the university—not necessarily in the 
faculty of arts. One ends in the adoption of some wage-earning calling two 
years later. One contemplates that adoption at once. It is the State’s busi- 
ness, according to the reformers (whose ranks extend far beyond the Labor 
Party), to shepherd its young people through all these stages; and this is how 
it is done. 
The candidate for university teaching may pass through a four years’ course 
at a State high school, or may be assisted with a bursary to take a similar 
course at one of the private secondary schools which has agreed to submit 
itself to proper inspection. Both the bursary examinations and the “ leaving 
certificates ” issued at the end of the four years are controlled by a board in 
the choice of which the university has the chief voice; and the certificates are 
accepted by the university as equivalent to matriculation. Under the univer- 
sity bill most of these certificate holders will pay no university fees, the State 
increasing its subsidy instead. This arrangement is to apply to the professional 
faculties as well as to that of arts. 
The child who can not be spared from wage earning for more than two years 
after leaving the primary school is placed in the upper division of a “ superior ” 
State school, and at the close of a two years’ course may gain an “ interme- 
   
-P-A-G-E-635
AUSTRALIA. 609 
diate” certificate—which the department describes as of a standard ‘“ rougbly 
corresponding to the Oxford and Cambridge junior local examination.” The 
subjects, however, will be very different, as these superior schools are being 
organized into artisan, commercial, and domestic divisions, so that pupils may 
receive instruction more or less adapted to their future needs. Here, as in 
all other cases, entrants who have obtained from their last school a certificate 
of “regular attendance, good conduct, and reasonable proficiency ” will obtain 
their education free. 
For the child who must begin to earn wages at once there are evening con- 
tinuation schools; attendance at these is still voluntary, but the ministerial 
policy contemplates compulsion as soon as time can be found to pass the neces- 
sary legislation. These, too, are divided into artisan and commercial (for 
boys) and domestic (for girls), and provide six hours’ instruction weekly; but 
the training is not specialized, for reasons stated thus by an officer high in the 
department: 
As a rule apprenticeship, or the definite choice of a vocation which determines 
the kind of special training that the youth will need, does not take place before 
the age of 16; it is the intervening period between 14 and 16, with its danger 
of casual and variable occupation, that the evening continuation school is de- 
signed to fill—so that, when the age of definite choice arrives, it will find the 
youth witb a groundwork on which to build his more specialized training. 
The artisan schools give instruction in English, mathematics, science, and 
drawing and manual work; the commercial schools in English, arithmetic, 
geography, shorthand, business principles, and bookkeeping; the domestic 
schools in English, cookery, home management and hygiene, personal hygiene, 
care and management of sick and infants, housewifery, and needlework. Pupils 
must take English and at least” two other subjects. Among the teachers of 
such subjects as business principles and manual work are men actuaily engaged 
during. the day in commercial or artisan callings; and for students who have 
passed through the schools, and have definitely entered on their special career, 
trade and technical schools are being scattered through the more populous 
centers of the State. 
Of the continuation schools there are now 38, with an enrollment of about 
8,000 and an average attendance not far short of that number. A fee of 6 pence 
per week is charged, but remitted to all who attend regularly. While these 
figures probably represent the ambitious youths within reach of existing 
schools, they are not considered at all satisfactory; in Sydney alone more than 
13,000 boys of from 14 to 17 are apprenticed to trades, and it is believed that the 
S'ate contains quite 116,000 children between those ages who are getting no 
education whatever. Only compulsion, therefore, will make the system prop- 
erly effective in turning into good citizens this untouched tenth of the popula- 
tion.* 
Provision has been made for the organization of day continuation 
classes, under the charge of a special official, who bears the title 
Inspector of Continuation Schools. 
The continuation classes are formed in the higher grade public 
schools and are intended for pupils who can continue in attendance 
for two years after completing the primary course of five years. In 
other words, the continuation classes are parallel with the sixth and

to the United States in 1910 in the interest of his department.

seventh grades of the ordinary school. They specialize in three direc- 
tions, namely, commercial, technical, and domestic science, for each 
of which a distinctive program is arranged, adapted to the subject, 
and also to the conditions of New South Wales. The programs in- 
clude as common subjects: English; morals and civics, comprising 
history and Scripture; music and social exercises; physical training 
and organized games. The remaining branches pertain to the respec- 
tive specialties of the three divisions. 
A qualifying certificate is required for admission to these classes, 
which may be gained by the average pupil at about 13 years of age, 
and he then spends two years in vocational training. 
VICTORIA, 
In 1910 a bill* was passed by the Legislature of Victoria the pur- 
pose of which was “ to establish a direct path from the elementary 
schools to the university.” This necessitated the coordination of 
elementary and secondary schools and of the higher technical schools 
with the university, and the extension of Government supervision to 
the entire field. Consequently provision was made in the law for a 
council of public education, charged with advisory functions with 
reference to all questions that may arise in respect to the administra- 
tion and conduct of public instruction. This council consists of 20 
members: Four will represent the education department; four, exist- 
ing schools; three, the university; three, technical education; one, 
music education; and five, industrial interests. Two out of five must 
be interested in agriculture. 
The act provides for the creation of higher elementary schools and 
district high schools, and as a means of extending the opportunity 
for education in secondary schools authorizes appropriations for 200 
public scholarships, each one of which shall entitle the holder to 
free education at a district high school or technical school, or to an 
allowance of not less than £12 ($60) a year toward the payment of 
fees at a secondary school, -with an additional allowance for living 
expenses. The act also provides that— 
evening continuation schools may be established by the minister in approved 
centers, and pupils under 17 years of age may be required. to attend, unless 
they are receiving instruction elsewhere. A penalty is imposed where an 
employer exacts such service as would preclude a pupil’s attendance at such 
continuation classes. 
Compulsory education is extended to defectives, i. e., blind and 
deaf and dumb children. The importance of vocational education 
is emphasized in the act by the authority given to the central depart-

Tutton, Melbourne, Australia.

ment to assume direction of technical institutions, including trade 
and preparatory schools. 
From the current report of the minister of public instruction 
(1912) it appears that the council of public education was formed 
according to the provisions of the act, and has been seriously engaged 
during the year in examining questions of pressing moment, and 
particularly those pertaining to the coordination of different classes 
of schools. The following extract from the report presents the 
results of a conference between a committee of the council and rep- 
resentatives of the University of Melbourne and the director of 
agriculture respecting agricultural education: | 
1. That in the opinion of this conference there should only be one institution 
in the State dealing with education in the higher branches of agriculture. 
2. That a university agricultural school be established in the vicinity of Mel- 
bourne, and that a suitable area of farm land should be attached to such school. 
3. That such school and farm should be under the direction and control of the 
faculty of agriculture, to be reconstituted with a liberal departmental repre- 
sentation. 
4, That the university school farm should be accessible to Melbourne and 
should adjoin the demonstration farm of the department of agriculture. 
5. That there should be a coordination between the work of the department of 
agriculture and the university, particularly in giving instruction to farmers’ 
classes. 
6. That the conference is strongly of opinion that the Dookie and Longerenong 
Agricultural Colleges and the agricultural high schools should be placed under 
the joint control of the departments of agriculture and education. 
7. That the establishment of all agricultural high schools in the future and the 
selection of sites for such schools should be subject to the approval of the depart- 
ments of education and agriculture. 
WESTERN AUSTRALIA, 
During the current year (1912) the education department of West- 
ern Australia issued a report upon continuation schools and the 
question of compulsory attendance, by Cecil Andrews, inspector - 
general of schools, embodying the results of an extended educational 
investigation in foreign countries. In summing up his observations, 
Mr. Andrews draws comparison between conditions in his own 
country and those in Germany, as follows: 
Our problem here differs in many ways from that which is being solved in 
Germany. The whole scheme of German education is based upon a caste sys- 
tem which has no parallel in our democratic community. In’ Germany the 
son of a workman nearly always becomes a workman, and remains in his 
father’s class. The clever boy in the higher classes of a primary school has 
no chance of rising to the university or to the higher technical schools or to 
any of the “ learned professions.” If he was destined for one of these, he would 
necessarily have left the primary school at the age of 10, and entered upon 
an entirely distinct course. Those who remain in the primary school are there- 
fore a group with comparatively uniform aims, and can be systematically 
 
-P-A-G-E-638
  612 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
guided into certain definite channels. A German boy’s future calling is gen- 
erally settled at an earlier age than is the case with the Australian boy. In 
southern Germany a strict apprenticeship system is still in force; in northern 
Germany, where this is not the case, the specialized continuation school takes 
the boy at once and gives him a pride in his own trade or craft, and a belief 
in the value of good work. He realizes that he is still a learner and must give 
proof of his expert work before he can become a qualified tradesman. At the 
same time he is learning something of his duty to the State and the Empire 
and the relation of his craft to the whole community. From 18 to 20 he under- 
goes compulsory military service and learns the habit of subordination. “The 
habit of military subordination unquestionably renders possible and easier 
the industrial enterprises of Germany, which are models of smooth and quiet 
organization.” $ 
With us the conditions are widely different. The boy of 13 in one of the 
upper classes of the primary school may be destined for any profession or 
calling. The education that is given him must be on broad and general lines 
until he has decided whether he will go to a higher school or not; it can not 
be narrowed, as it is in Munich, so as to become merely the avenue to a trade 
school. Even after the boy has left he does not, as a rule, like the German boy, 
immediately decide, once for all, upon his particular trade. Conditions in a 
new and growing country are less settled, and change may be necessary. The 
continuation school courses that will suit our conditions best will resemble 
those of England and Scotland rather than those. of Germany. For the first 
two years the work should not be too much specialized; the industrial course 
should be one that will give a serviceable grounding for any skilled trade that 
may subsequently be selected. The continuation classes will be the link be- 
tween the primary school and the trade classes of the technical school, but will 
be a general preparation for the latter, and will not be subdivided into classes 
for particular trades. A course in English, practical arithmetic, mensuration, 
and elementary mechanics, mechanical drawing, and practical work with tools 
for two years will produce students well prepared to take up intelligently and 
efficiently the specialized work of the trades classes. 
* 5 * * * * eee * 
As far as our skilled trades are concerned, the need for organized continuation 
classes is probably as great as in any other country. The old system of appren- 
ticeship, under which the master workman taught his apprentice the whole of 
his trade work, is practically extinct. A boy who is called an apprentice may 
be little more than a messenger boy or may be employed merely for odd jobs. 
In larger works, where there is much subdivision of labor, the boy’s work may 
be confined to a few operations, and he may get no chance of becoming 
systematically acquainted with the whole of the processes that it is necessary 
for him to learn if he is to become a thoroughly skilled and competent work- 
man. The trade classes in our technical schools have to some extent met the 
need, but they have generally attracted and indeed have been designed for the 
adult rather than for the boy who has just left school. Preparatory Classes to 
lead up to the specialized work need further development, and, as far as possi- 
ble, should be held in the daytime. The State has set an excellent example in 
the railway department, All the boys employed in the workshops at Midland 
Junction are required to attend classes which are held during working hours. 
Since my return I have met, with the director of technical education, the repre- 
sentative of one of the leading trade unions to discuss the possibility of a similar 
arrangement for the boys employed in his trade. The union recognizes the 
necessity of systematic instruction in the principles and practice of the trade, 
   
-P-A-G-E-639
  
NEW ZEALAND EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM, 613 
and the fact that this can only be obtained by continuation classes. The matter 
lias not yet been finally settled, but the prospect of the establishment of day 
classes for this trade seems bright. If the principle is once recognized in this 
way, no doubt other trades will follow suit, and the way will thus be paved for 
a compulsory system in the future. In each such case it will be necessary to 
secure competent tradesmen as teachers of the practical work. We have suc- 
eeeded in doing this for the trades classes already in existence. But if a con- 
siderable development of such courses is to take place we shall probably find 
that the securing of competent teachers is a matter of great difficulty. With 
the growth of a larger system of continuation classes, we shall need many 
teachers, both of industrial and of commercial subjects, who must have real 
practical experience of the work, and at the same time must be skilled as 
teachers. It will not be long before we shall be obliged to formulate some 
scheme of special training for them, whether in connection with the training 
college or the technical school or the university. 
In connection with each of the trades courses to which the preparatory con- 
tinuation classes will lead there should be a small committee, which should 
include representatives of the employers and of the workers. 
Recent awards of the arbitration court have recognized the value of such 
classes in the training of apprentices. First, in the case of the painters’ union, 
and next in the case of the carpenters and joiners, the court has included in its 
award a clause providing that, whenever facilities are provided at the technical 
school, apprentices shall attend classes and that the employers shall pay the 
class fees and generally assist the apprentices to obtain regular instruction. 
Evening classes are at work in the technical school in house painting, sign 
writing, decorating, graining, and marbling, as well as in carpentry and joinery 
and many other trades; the results will be more satisfactory if arrangements 
ean be made to hold the classes in the daytime. 
We have already established, in the last two years, cofitinuation classes in 
Perth, Fremantle, Claremont, Midland Junction, Kalgoorlie, Boulder, Coolgardie, 
Day Dawn, Northam, Geraldton, Albany, Wagin, and Bunbury. These classes 
are free for students under 18, provided that they take a course of three sub- 
jects, of which English must be one. The greatest demand at present has been 
for commercial subjects—arithmetic, history and geography, bookkeeping, and 
shorthand. A combined course of arithmetic and mensuration and courses in 
elementary mathematics are also taken in several centers, and woodwork in 
every center except one, where there is as yet no room provided for the purpose. 
Dressmaking, millinery, and cookery are taken by the girls. 
NEW ZEALAND EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. 
New Zealand comprises an area of 104,751 square miles, with a 
population of 1,071,428, or 10 inhabitants to a square mile. Its capi- 
tal is Wellington, which has a population of 70,729. 
The system of public instruction forms an executive department 
under the minister, but the direct management of the schools is in- 
trusted to local boards. Elementary schools are free and secular, | 
and attendance upon them for children not otherwise instructed is 
compulsory for the ages 7 to 14. Secondary education is the prov- 
ince chiefly of private schools. Arrangements are made, however,
-P-A-G-E-640
614 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912, 
by which classes of secondary grade may be formed in public schools, 
and for these special subsidies are granted. 
In 1911 the total enrollment in the primary schools was 161,648, 
equivalent to 15 per cent of the population; the average attendance 
was 142,186, or 88 per cent of the enrollment; the teachers numbered 
4,551, of whom 1,672 (36 per cent) were men. The schools were 
maintained at an expenditure of $3,855,442, or $23.85 per capita 
of enrollment and $3.59 per capita of population. There were also 
318 private schools of primary and secondary grade, with an attend- 
ance of 18,981 pupils and 892 teachers. The University of New Zea- 
land is an examining and degree- -conferring body; the matriculated 
students, who numbered 1,900 in 1911, pursue their studies in the 
four affiliated colleges. 
EDUCATIONAL COMMISSION, 
The year has been marked in New Zealand by the publication 
of the report of the commission appointed in 1908 to investigate the 
system of public instruction with special reference to means for 
increasing its efficiency. 
In a communication accompanying a copy of the report, the chair- 
man ' of the commission states that— 
The new government is not disposed, on account of the heavy legislative 
program which it has in hand at present, to ask the legislature to adopt 
any of the many recommendations we have made; but from the exceedingly 
favorable reception that has been accorded to our report from all sections of 
intelligent educational thought in this country, I am quite prepared to see the 
Government invite Parliament next year to carry out the majority of our 
recommendations. 
Among the subjects included in the recommendations of the com- 
mission the provision of continuation schools, combined with an 
extension of the period of compulsory education, is emphasized. In 
connection with this subject that of coeducation has arisen and 
promises to bring on a very interesting discussion, as opinions are 
almost evenly divided in respect to this particular. 
The continuation classes and schools that are already in existence 
are chiefly technical in character; with reference to them Mr. Cohen 
states that— 
Satisfactory progress continues to be made by the “controlling authorities ” 
and managers of technical schools and colleges throughout the Dominion in the 
matter of providing, improving, and extending facilities for technical instruc- 
tion. The interest taken in them by the local governing bodies and by the 
various industrial unions has not only been encouraging but has spurred the 
managers to increased effort, as well as helped to make their financial burdens 
much lighter. During 1911 nearly £5,000 ($25,000) in the way of voluntary

continued services in the cause of popular education.

contributions was received from sympathetic public bodies, and to these dona- 
tions the State gave a subsidy of £1 for £1. In all, the Government during last 
year found something like £11,500 ($57,500) by way of building grants, and at 
the moment of writing (August, 1912) the city of Auckland is building a splen- 
did technical college of three stories for the present, but intended to be carried 
to five stories, on the construction and equipment of which over £60,000: 
($300,000) will be spent, and toward this sum the trustees of the local savings 
bank have contributed £10,000 ($50,000) from their accumulated profits. When 
the entire design is carried out it will be one of the most up-to-date and 
thoroughly equipped technical colleges to be found in the southern hemisphere. 
Similarly, at Dunedin, the southern capital of the Dominion, the citizens are 
pressing forward to mark in an appropriate manner the beneficent reign of 
King Edward the Peacemaker, to whose memory they have just dedicated a 
memorial building which will ccst them from first to last £40,000 ($200,000). 
In the various technical classes, both day and evening, there were, at the 
close of 1911, 13,632 pupils, besides 1,341 in attendance at day technical schools. 
The last mentioned is a comparatively new departure, but it has come to stay. 
There are 8 such schools in operation, the principal being at Auckland (317 
pupils), Wellington (268), Christchurch (349), and Dunedin (210). These day 
schools, which provide fairly full courses in science and technology, domestic 
economy, agriculture, and commercial instruction, are well attended and 
apparently attract a number of young people who, in the absence of such oppor- 
tunities, would not continue to improve themselves once they had left the 
primaries. 
Attention is called to the fact that, while the majority of the pupils 
in attendance at the technical schools pursue commercial and indus- 
trial courses, or, in the case of girls, courses in domestic subjects, 
interest is being excited in farming pursuits. On this subject Mr. 
Cohen says: 
There is a satisfactory increase in the number of such classes, and the rural 
course includes wool sorting and wool classing, sheep shearing, dairying, veteri- 
nary science, agriculture, horticulture, beekeeping, and poultry farming. Last 
year no less than 17,200 pupils attended the various rural courses. An immense 
fillip will be given to agricultural education in the near future by the establish- 
ment of an agricultural college in the educational district of Auckland. 
It is stated further that for this purpose a munificent bequest has 
recently been made.

INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATIONS, 
AMERIKA-INSTITUT. 
The Amerika-Institut, founded at Berlin, October, 1910, under the 
auspices of the Prussian ministry of education, is now fully organized 
for effective operation. 
The aim of the institute is to advance and strengthen the cultural 
relations between Germany and the United States by providing an 
organization that shall act as a medium of inquiry and exchange in 
matters that come within its province. These matters pertain to 
education and scholarship, to literature and art, to technique and 
social welfare, to travel and public interests, to peace and inter- 
national understanding. 
The services of the institute are specially important to Americans 
who seek to avail themselves of the facilities for study and research 
offered by German institutions. The number of these steadily 
increases and includes students in particular subjects, officials inves- 
tigating administrative problems, professors on sabbatical leave, 
representatives of scientific organizations, learned societies, ete. An 
important part of the work of the foundation is the exchange of 
617
-P-A-G-E-644
  618 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
information relating, for-instance, to the equivalence of university 
degrees and the advantages offered at different centers of learning. 
* The library of the institute (now numbering about 9,200 volumes) 
is intended to be a representative collection of Americana, dealing 
with the history, life, and conditions of the United States. It is the 
purpose to provide a good working collection, and, by making the 
books more informally available, to supplement the service of other 
libraries in Berlin. 
The whole exchange between the Smithsonian Institution in 
Washington and its correspondents in Germany, the transmission of 
official documents, and the arrangements for copyrights are under- 
taken by the Amerika-Institut. During the two years of its exist- 
ence 1,190 books have been copyrighted through its agency. In 
connection with this service, encouragement is given to the transla- 
tion of books of one country into the language of the other, a work 
which is facilitated by the location of the institute in the new build- 
ing of the Royal Library in Berlin. The financial support of the 
institute is furnished chiefly by the banking house of Koppel, in 
Berlin, and Mr. James Speyer, of New York; Dr. R. B. Drechsler is 
the present director. 
CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE. 
The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace may be regarded 
as a nonacademic educational movement, since its purposes are to 
be promoted by scientific research, by propaganda, and by activities 
directly educational in character. The last named are comprised in 
the division of intercourse and education, which, in accordance with 
the recommendations of its acting director, Nicholas Murray Butler, 
LL. D., maintains a secretariat and bureau at Paris. The division 
is assisted also by an advisory council, composed of representative 
European statesmen and publicists identified with the cause of peace 
and international arbitration. Baron d’Estournelles de Constant, 
well known for his interest in the peace movement, has consented to 
act as president of this council, and Mr. Prudhommeaux, editor of 
La Paix par le Droit, has accepted the office of secretary general of 
the Paris office at a nominal salary. 
According to the statement of the director: 
The division of intercourse and education will undertake to give practical effect 
to the scientific work of the other two divisions by popularizing the results of their 
investigations. It will endeavor to educate public opinion to a higher sense of inter- 
national rights and duties; to a realization of the inherent injustice of war in cases 
where arbitration or peaceful settlement is possible; and to an understanding of the 
causes and effects of war, upon whom its burdens fall, and what economic losses result 
from it to the peoples asa whole. This work of propaganda, to be effective, must be 
= world-wide.
-P-A-G-E-645
  EVENTS OF INTERNATIONAL INTEREST. 619 
This division, therefore, has a threefold purpose; to diffuse information and to 
educate public opinion as to causes, nature, and effects of war; to cultivate friendly 
feelings between the inhabitants of different countries; and to maintain, promote, 
and assist the various existing agencies calculated to accomplish the purposes of the 
endowment. 
Apart from the organization effected, the practical work of this 
division has been carried out in several directions during the current 
year. Under agreement with the Government of Japan, a plan of 
educational exchange has been effected, in accordance with which a 
representative scholar, scientist, or man of affairs will be sent to the 
United States in each alternate year at the expense of his Govern- 
ment. Arrangements will be made— 
for the residence of this representative of Japan at six American colleges and universi- 
ties for periods of approximately six weeks each. At each institution at which he is in 
residence the representative of Japan is to have opportunity, in addition to whatever 
formal and academic lectures may be arranged, to meet, in the freest possible way, 
teachers and students and citizens of the neighborhood, as well as to meet and address 
on various subjects boards of trade, chambers of commerce, literary, scientific, fra- 
ternal, and other organizations. 
-Dr. Inazo Nitobe, the president of the Imperial University of 
Tokyo, who holds also the chair on the policy of colonization at the 
university, was delegated as the first exchange professor to the 
United States and delivered courses of lectures on Japan at the six 
universities included in the arrangement, beginning at Columbia 
University in November, 1911. (See p. 43.) 
With regard to the international visits of representative men, 
the director of the division in his report for 1911 states that: 
The visit of Baron d’Estournelles de Constant to the United States during the 
current year was the first visit of this kind to be undertaken by the endowment; and 
upon Dr. Butler’s recommendation, and with the approval of the executive committee, 
Dr. Charles W. Eliot, president emeritus of Harvard University, has proceeded to 
Japan as the first American representative of scholarship, conciliation, and good 
understanding. 
The plan of subsidizing existing international agencies, both 
institutions and journals, engaged in the peace movement has been 
approved and has been the subject of tentative experiment during 
the current year. 
The appropriations for the administration of the endowment 
made by the board of trustees for the fiscal years ending June 30, 
1912, and June 30, 1913, amounted, respectively, to $28,785 and 
$51,570. For the division of intercourse and education the sum of 
$100,425 was appropriated for the year ending June 30, 1912, and 
$203,850 for the year ending June 30, 1918. The total appropriation 
for the year ending June, 1912, was $275,985. 
The endowment is administered by a board of trustees, of which 
the president is Hon. Elihu Root. The permanent office is located

the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and director of the 
division of international law. 
CONTINUATION COMMITTEE, WORLD MISSIONARY CONFERENCE. 
One of the most important movements in the world is in charge of 
the ‘‘continuation committee” appointed at the World Conference 
on Foreign Missions, which met at Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1911, 
This committee represents all the great missionary societies of the 
Protestant churches, and was formed to examine the missionary 
fields throughout the world with a view to unifying their work for 
the promotion of economy and efficiency. For this purpose it was 
arranged that the secretary of the committee, Mr. John R. Mott, 
should make an extensive tour, holding conferences at appointed 
places with the missionaries in the field and also with native converts 
and thus learn from those most familiar with the conditions the 
actual workings and results of missionary efforts. 
Mr. Mott started on his tour in October, 1912, accompanied by 
several coworkers, having arranged for about 20 conferences in 
northern Africa, Asia Minor, India, Siam, Japan, Korea, and the 
Pacific islands. The extensive work of instruction carried on by the 
missionary societies throughout the world, including provision for the 
medical training of native students and large hospital services, 
imparts to these conferences an educational character which is quite 
as distinctive as their moral purpose. 
It is estimated that the combined expenditure in the foreign 
field of the different societies represented by the ‘‘continuation 
committee” is not less than $28,000,000. 
UNIVERSITY EVENTS. 
  
CONGRESS OF THE UNIVERSITIES OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE. 
By Kenpric C. Bascocx, 
Specialist in higher education, Bureau of Education. 
A notable event of the year in the field of higher education in Great 
Britain, an event truly international in its significance, was the Con- 
gress of Universities of the Empire, which met in London July 2-5, 
1912. Preparations for this great gathering had been in progress 
since 1909, when the senate of the University of London voted that 
it was desirable to hold an imperial universities congress. While 
the University of London made itself responsible for the expenses of 
the cougress, it received generous assistance from various universities
-P-A-G-E-647
  EVENTS OF INTERNATIONAL INTEREST. 621 
of Great Britain and Ireland, the Rhodes trustees, the Carnegie 
trustees, and eight of the great city companies. 
The thoroughness and wisdom of the preparations are evidenced 
by the fact that a delegate or delegates appeared in the congress 
from every one of the universities of the Empire. The very state- 
ment of the geographical distribution of these 51 institutions thus 
represented suggests both the extent of the influence of the congress 
and the complexity of the problems which it met to discuss. Of the 
institutions, 11 are in England and Wales; 4 in Scotland; 3 in Ire- 
land; 6 in Australia; 1 each in New Zealand, South Africa, Hong- 
kong, and Malta; 5 in India; and 18 in Canada—from the University 
of St. Francis Xavier, in Nova Scotia, on the east to the University 
of British Columbia on the west. 
Through the courtesy of the organizing committee other persons 
than delegates who are interested in higher education were made 
associate members of the congress and included in the interesting 
social functions connected with the meeting. Among those thus 
invited to become members or guests, rather than delegates or 
representatives, were five from the United States, including tho 
specialist in higher education of the Bureau of Education and the 
commissioner of education of the State of New York.  ~ 
The dignity and impressiveness of the congress were enhanced by 
the remarkable series of addresses by great statesmen of the Empire, 
who served as chairmen of the different sessions. The Earl of 
Roseberry, who presided at the opening session, dwelt upon the 
rapid increase in the number of universities and their relation to 
the Empire, saying: 
I sometimes wonder if universities sufficiently recognize the function that they 
have to discharge to the Empire in furnishing the Empire with men to carry on its 
work. * * * Take the case of Australia alone. I may be wrong in my figures, 
because I add them up on my fingers and I am not always sure that I have not left a 
parliament out, but I think Australia enjoys the privilege of not less than seven 
parliaments for a population not more than half that of Greater London. These 
seven parliaments, seven ministries, seven prime ministers represent a drain on the 
intelligence and vitality of the Australian nation that can only be adequately met if 
the universities of that country do their duty. * * * No one who observes the 
signs of the times can fail to see that it will be increasingly difficult to maintain this 
Empire in its entirety and cohesion without an intensity of character and devotion 
which it must be the task of the universities preeminently to maintain. 
The Right Hon. Arthur J. Balfour, presiding at another session, 
referred to the difficulties arising from endeavors to adapt occidental 
education to oriental races: 
In the West the changes of knowledge and the changes of tradition have gone on 
by relatively small degrees. There has been in that case mutual adjustment, and 
though in practice we may not be conscious of the difficulties of teaching due to the 
necessity of keeping up that adjustment, nobody is likely to underrate those diffi- 
culties, even in the West. The difficulties are incomparably small compared with
-P-A-G-E-648
  622 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
those which necessarily come upon us when we bring in upon a society unprepared 
by the long training which we have gone through generation after generation the full 
stress and weight of modern scientific, critical, and industrial knowledge. * * * 
How, then, are you going to diminish the shock with which this sudden invasion of 
a wholly alien learning must meet the cultured society of the East? * * * We 
are forced to be catastrophic. It is impossible to graft by a gradual process on the 
East what we have acquired to by a gradual process, but which, having been matured 
up to its present stage in the West, is suddenly carried, full fledged, unchanged, and 
planted down as it were in these new surroundings. 
Lord Curzon, of Kedleston, presiding at another session, dwelt 
upon the interrelation between the older universities and those of 
the newer colonies and dependencies, saying: 
The field is too wide to be covered by any one institution or even a group of institu- 
tions.. * * * We know no rivalry in this happy competition; there is no 
room either for superiority or inferiority; we are all contingents in the same army, 
fighting the same enemy, obeying the same commander, and occupying with a well- 
ordered strategy, with what I hope, after the meetings of a congress like this, will be 
a better-ordered strategy in the future, different parts of a single and almost boundless 
field. And, gentlemen, if these are our sentiments toward these younger universities 
which give a more technical training and provide a more strictly professional outlook 
in our own country, with feelings not less warm may we contemplate the efforts of 
those who * * * are engaged in creating for the first time and in maintaining 
the standards in the over-sea dominions of the Crown and who, for their part, when 
they send their representatives home on such an occasion as this, we would fain 
believe, regard such institutions as Oxford and Cambridge, not as venerable relics of 
an obsolete past, but as sanctuaries of a spirit that never dies but breathes in their 
bodies and burns in their veins just as in ours. 
Another presiding officer was Lord Strathcona, the chancellor of 
the Universities of Aberdeen and McGill. Referring to the develop- 
ment of higher institutions in Canada, he said: 
The pioneers of that Empire, we do well to remember, have often been men who 
owed little or nothing to universities, and in most cases the first settlers who followed 
them were equally devoid of the experience of academic discipline. It is all the more 
remarkable that-among the national traditions which they continued in the lands of 
their exile, none has been more persistently followed or more generously endowed 
than that of higher education. * * * Canada began in 1788, with the estab- 
lishment of King’s College, Nova Scotia, and when I went to America, now 75 years 
ago, there were only three more—Dalhousie, McGill, and Toronto * * *. It is 
an inspiring story (the development of 18 universities in Canada), full of proofs of the 
indispensable part which the overseas universities have discharged and must continue 
to discharge in the material and spiritual development of our Empire. 
The carefully prepared papers and discussions which followed were 
alike marked by earnestness, acumen, and conciseness. Among the 
topics discussed were: ‘‘Specialization among universities,” with 
papers by the vice chancellor of Victoria University, Manchester, 
and the president of Magdalen College of the University of Oxford; 
“Interuniversity arrangements for postgraduate and research stu- 
dents,” with a paper by the principal of McGill University, Montreal, 
and a discussion by representatives of the University of Cambridge,
-P-A-G-E-649
  EVENTS OF INTERNATIONAL INTEREST. 623 
and universities in Wales, Australia, Calcutta, Edinburgh, and Mani- 
toba; ‘‘The relation of universities to technical and professional 
education and to education for the public service,’ with papers by 
the professor of chemistry of the University of Leeds and by the 
first civil service commissioner; ‘‘The problem of universities in the 
East in regard to the influence on character and moral ideals”; 
“Conditions of entrance to universities and the possibility of equiva- 
lence and mutual recognition of entrance tests to degree courses,” 
which really involved a discussion of the whdle question of stand- 
ardization for the Empire; “The position of women in universities” ; 
and “The establishment of a central bureau,” with a paper by the 
organizing representative of the Rhodes Scholarship Trust, Dr. 
George R. Parkin, whose unparalleled experience with universities 
in all parts of the English-speaking world gave his utterance special 
weight. : 
The problems discussed in the paper of Dr. Parkin are peculiarly 
pertinent to the agitation for better coordination of institutions in 
the United States, and the final action of the congress in creating a 
central bureau is suggestive of the possibility of organized coopera- 
tion between existing agencies in America. 
At its final session the congress resolved in favor of a congress of 
the universities of the Empire at intervals of five years. It advised 
the holding of annual meetings of the home universities and periodical 
meetings of the representatives of universities in the various overseas 
dominions, and provided that a committee.of the congress be ap- 
pointed to take steps for the formation in London of a bureau of 
information for the universities of the Empire, such committee to 
consist of 14 members, of whom 7 shall be nominated by the home 
universities committee of this congress, and 7 by the universities 
overseas, viz, for Canada, 2; Australia, 1; New Zealand, 1; the Cape, 1; 
India, 1; other parts of the Empire, 1. 
The congress was preceded and followed by tours of the delegates 
and guests among the home universities. During the days of the 
congress the delegates and members were accorded notable social 
courtesies, including a luncheon as guests of the British Government; 
a reception by Prince Arthur of Connaught, in the great Hall of the 
University of London; and a most delightful entertainment at the 
Mansion House by the Lord Mayor of London and the Lady Mayoress. 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ATHENS. 
The seventy-fifth anniversary of the University of Athens was 
celebrated Easter week, April, 1912, with exercises of a peculiarly 
festive character. These included a series of pan-Hellenic games, 
military maneuvers, and the performance of the dipus Rex of 
Sophocles in the Royal Theater. Delegates were present from the
-P-A-G-E-650
  624 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
principal universities of the world, andthe part which western Europe 
has taken in the revival of Athens as a center of learning was a recur- 
rent theme in the addresses of the occasion. Around the university 
are grouped a number of foreign schools of archeology, directed by 
eminent scholars, attracting students from all parts of Europe and 
America, and furnishing a basis for research in every region of the 
Greek world. In this way an international character has been 
imparted to the university. 
The Congress of Orientalists which was held in connection with 
the university jubilee caused special emphasis to be placed upon the 
facilities for oriental research centering in the historic city. 
UNIVERSITY AT FRANKFORT ON THE MAIN. 
The proposals for the foundation of a university at Frankfort on 
the Main, which have been under consideration for several years, 
have taken definite shape in a scheme which has been submitted by 
the magistracy of the city to the town council. It is understood 
that the scheme has the support of the Prussian minister of education, 
and it is expected that the university will be opened in the summer 
term of 1914. The scheme provides for a teaching university, with 
the three faculties of law, philosophy (including history and litera- 
ture), and medicine; the fourth faculty, theology, which is found in 
all the other German universities, will nof be included. Several 
existing institutions, among them a medical school maintained in 
connection with the municipal hospital, will form the nucleus of the 
new university. The city spends at present about $430,000 on these 
institutions, and this sum will be supplemented by the proceeds of 
several benefactions which have been left by wealthy citizens for 
the advancement of learning. This will be the first German uni- 
versity for many centuries past which owes its origin to private 
initiative. Although it is not a public foundation, it will be subject 
to State control; the ordinary professors will be appointed by the 
Crown, and the extraordinary professors by the minister of education. 
HAMBURG UNIVERSITY. 
It-is officially stated that the proposed new university for Ham- 
burg, Germany, will comprise the four faculties, philosophy, natural 
science, law, and a faculty of the colonial sciences; for local reasons 
it will contain no faculty of medicine. The city, it is understood, 
will appropriate a capital of 25,000,000 marks ($5,950,000) for the 
maintenance of the university. 
NEW UNIVERSITIES IN HUNGARY. 
The year has been marked in Hungary by the creation of two 
new centers of higher learning—one at Pozsony (Presbourg) and 
the other at De Breezen. The decrees authorizing their establish-
-P-A-G-E-651
  
EVENTS OF INTERNATIONAL INTEREST. 625 
ment provide for the full complement of faculties (that is four) at 
each center, but it is not expected that they will be in complete 
working order for some years to come. 
UNIVERSITY OF HONGKONG. 
The University of Hongkong (China), which owes its establish- 
ment to private initiative and contributions, is reported to be in 
full working order, with over 70 undergraduates in residence. Of 
the students enrolled, a considerable number were transferred from 
the college of medicine, and are doing second, third, and fourth year 
work. The majority of the first-year students elected to be trained 
in engineering science; and altogether more than half the total 
number of students, including those who entered from the college of 
medicine, are pursuing technical courses of instruction. It was 
the chief object of the founders of the university to train Chinese 
students as engineers, on account of the enormous demand that is 
sure to arise for experts to assist in the development of the internal 
resources of the country. The spirit which animates this depart- 
ment is indieated by a recent address delivered to the Institution of 
Engineers and Shipbuilders of Hongkong, by Prof. C. A. M. Smith, 
of the engineering department of the university. As cited in 
Nature,! Prof. Smith said: 
In Hongkong we wish to train men who know the East to develop China’s natural 
resources. For that development they must obtain machinery—if we do our work 
aright we shall secure a market for those who are at home, and provide greatly in- 
creased freightage for the shipping to this port. * * * We require at once machines 
for demonstration and experimental purposes. We want to equip laboratories for 
testing the materials of construction, such as steel, conerete, copper, etc. We want. 
oil, gas, and steam engines, and refrigerators, as well as dynamos and all sorts of elec- 
trical apparatus. * * * We will house your gifts and keep your samples running 
and in good condition, We will show your present and future customers the merits 
of your machines, and we will advertise your goods in the center of the greatest 
market of the near future. 
NEW UNIVERSITY FOR INDIA. 
The project of a new university at Dacca, India, was referred to a 
special committee which entered upon its duties June 20, 1912; and 
submitted its report January 1, 1913. This is merely a preliminary 
step, as the final action must be determined by the Governments of 
Bengal and of India and the secretary of state in council. 
SOUTH AFRICAN UNIVERSITY. 
The project of a South African university was announced at the 
opening session of the Union Parliament in November, 1910, by the 
governor general, who said:, 
My ministers are considering a scheme for the establishment of a national South 
African university, which will be submitted for your approval in due course. 
1 Nature, Jan. 16, 1913, pp. 560-561.  
-P-A-G-E-652
  626 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
The matter is still under consideration, as difficulties have arisen 
with reference to the choice of a site; meanwhile, the entire subject 
of higher education in South Africa has been committed to a com- 
mission which, it is expected, will advise as to final action with 
respect to the university. The gift of half a million sterling from 
‘the estates of the late Sir Julius Wernher and Mr. Otto Beit promises 
a rich endowment for the new institution. 
UNIVERSITY OF MEXICO. 
The University of Mexico was organized by law of May 26, 1910, 
and includes the schools of law, medicine, engineering, and archi- 
tecture, which had been previously established, and a national prepara- 
tory school of collegiate grade. To these was added a graduate school, 
intended for the conduct of special research in every field of science. 
The development of the graduate school, which bears the name La 
Escuela Nacional de Altos Estudios, has been pushed as rapidly as the 
political conditions of the ‘country have allowed. For the current 
year (1912) the following courses were maintained: A course in 
botany, with 10 regular students, of whom 4 were women, and 5 
auditors; a course in philosophical studies, with 55 regular students, 
of whom 1 was a women, and 35 auditors; a course in the English 
language and literature, with 13 regular students, of whom 1 was a 
woman, and 19 auditors. 
An interesting feature of the graduate school is the arrangement 
by which professors from other countries are invited to give courses 
of lectures in their respective specialties. Under this arrangement 
Dr. Franz Boas, of Columbia University, conducted during the year 
a seminar with laboratory exercises in anthropology, and Dr. James 
Mark Baldwin, who had been called to direct the reorganization of 
higher education in Mexico, conducted an important course in, 
philosophy and the social sciences. 
The director of the graduate school, Dr. D. Alfonso Pruneda, 
states that efforts have been made during the year to provide the 
material resources required in, the different orders of research. Atten- 
tion has been particularly directed to the- collection of a library 
adequate to the needs of the various divisions of the school. It is 
also intended that this library shall exercise directive influence 
over all the scientific libraries of the country, with particular refer- 
ence to the use of a uniform system of cataloguing. In this endeavor 
the cooperation, of all the public libraries throughout Mexico is 
solicited. : 
The expenditure for the graduate school for the fiscal year 1911-12, 
as reported by the director, amounted to $58,535, of which $30,495 
was used for salaries and administrative expenses.

ASTRONOMERS AT BRAZIL. 
The Brazilian Government extended a cordial invitation to for- 
eign astronomers to avail themselves of the opportunity for viewing 
the eclipse of the sun which took place October 10, 1912. The 
eclipse was visible throughout Brazil, and was total over a strip of 
territory 85 kilometers in width during almost two minutes. 
The interest of the Brazilian Government in the anticipated visit 
of foreign observers was indicated by the petition of the minister 
of agriculture to the Federal Congress for an appropriation of $23,000 
to be used for the reception and entertainment of visiting astrono- 
mers. The minister also requested that their professional instru- 
ments and private effects should be granted the privilege of free 
customs entry, that repairs to their instruments should be made in 
Government workshops. and that they should be furnished with 
railroad passes and telegraphic franks. 
INTERNATIONAL CELEBRATIONS AND CONGRESSES. 
  
MUSICAL FESTIVAL AT PARIS. 
The international gatherings which characterize the holiday season 
in Europe began with the International Musical Festival, held at 
Paris from May 25 to 29. A marked feature of this festival was 
the participation of the school children of London and Paris in a 
musical competition. In accordance with previous arrangements, 
500 children from the public schools of London and 300 from private 
schools crossed the channel onthe 25th of May and were met at 
Boulogne by the mayor and town councilmen, and from that moment 
became guests of the French authorities. In the musical exercise 
which took place at the Theatre Chatelet, Paris, the children ex- 
ceeded the anticipations of their trainers, and, to the surprise of all 
persons familiar with the admirable singing of the Paris school 
children, it was decided that the children from London should be 
awarded highest rank in the judgments. The result was attributed 
to the fine organization of the choir, which relieved the children 
from all nervousness and excitement. The great purpose of this 
visit was not to excite competition between children, but to pro- 
mote good will between, the two nations, and in this respect the event 
was an unqualified success. Everything was done to enable the 
child visitors to see the chief attractions of Paris, a great feature of 
the program being the ‘‘motor-bus rides” through the boulevards. 
All along the routes the people lined the footway in thousands, 
cheering vociferously. Rich and poor alike greeted the procession
-P-A-G-E-654
  628 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
of “busses” as they passed the Louvre, the Chatelet, the Hippo- 
drome, etc. Parents held their little ones up to shake hands with 
“les petits Anglais et les petites Anglaises,’ and were delighted 
when by chance they got near enough to kiss. 
The French children and the English children fraternized in the 
most delightful manner. The girls of the two nations became 
friends and parted with every show of reluctance. At the College 
Chaptal the pupils left in the establishment welcomed the English 
boys, joined them in games and in the songs of both nations. The 
Paris press was full of praise of the manner in which the whole 
arrangement was carried out, and the London papers of apprecia- 
tion for the courtesies shown their young representatives. 
FIFTEENTH MODERN LANGUAGE CONFERENCE, 
The Modern Language Conference (Allgemeine Deutche Neu- 
philologentag), which is held every two years, convened at Frankfort 
on the Main, May 27-31, 1912. The conference always attracts a 
large company of teachers from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland; 
and this year, as the result of a special invitation, several universities 
and colleges of the United States were represented. 
Unusual interest attached to the meeting, on account of the 
increasing international relations. The papers and discussions of 
the conference bore chiefly upon the scope that should be given to 
literary and historic matter in the scheme of modern language 
instruction considered as a means of discipline and culture; the sub- 
ject was presented almost exclusively from the standpoint of German 
requirements. 
In this connection, it is interesting to note the issue of a circular 
during the year by the English board of education on the subject 
of modern languages in secondary schools. Aside from details of 
classification and staff peculiar to English schools, the circular sets 
forth the requirements and the difficulties in respect to modern. 
language instruction which affect all English-speaking countries to a 
greater degree than those in constant contact with people speaking 
different languages. 
CONGRESSES AT LONDON. 
The Imperial Teachers’ Congress, held in London from the 13th 
to the 17th of July, brought together delegates from all the Australian 
States, from India, the Crown colonies, and Canada, together with 
an immense concourse of colonial visitors not included in the number 
of official delegates. The subjects of the widest interest discussed

guages. Circular 797, 1912.
-P-A-G-E-655
EVENTS OF INTERNATIONAL INTEREST. 629 
were as follows: Rural schools; the training of teachers, under which 
head special reference was made to the training for vocational sub- 
jects; and the methods of teaching different branches, in particular, 
English and English literature, history, and geography. The neces- 
sity for concerted effort on the part of English nations to preserve the 
purity of the English language in the increasing contact with other 
nationalities was emphasized, and the proposition was made for the 
appointment of a language commission to inquire into the subject of 
the teaching of the mother tongue and to report as to the best means 
for its preservation and improvement. 
The conference called by the Association for the International 
Interchange of Students was held at London, June 28 and 29. 
Reference to its proceedings will be found elsewhere in this volume 
(pp. 46-47). 
THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF AMERICAN STUDENTS. 
In accordance with a resolution adopted by the Second Inter- 
national Congress of American Students at Buenos Aires, in 1911, 
the third international congress of this series was held at Lima, July 
21-28, 1912, under the auspices of the Centro Universitario de Lima. 
This congress, like those held previously at Montevideo and Buenos 
Aires, discussed pedagogical questions and the means of promoting 
fraternal union between the students of the American countries. 
Although devoid of official character, the congress had the firm 
support of the Peruvian Government, and the various universities of 
America were earnestly requested to participate in the proceedings 
by accredited delegates. 
In response to the invitation the leading universities of the United 
States expressed great interest in the purposes of the congress, but 
very few were able to comply with the request for representation; so 
that the participants were almost entirely from the Latin American 
States. It is evident, however, that these congresses offer oppor- 
tunity for strengthening the ties between the universities of North 
and South America, such as exist already between the latter and the 
universities of France. 
FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON EUGENICS. 
The first international congress on eugenics convened in London, 
July 24-30, 1912, upon the invitation of the Eugenics Education 
Society, England. Above 800 delegates were present representing 
many different countries. Among the eminent men participating 
were the Right Hon. Arthur J. Balfour, of the British Association; 
Prof. A. Pinard, of the French Academy of Medicine; Prof. Tedeschi, 
of the University of Padua; Gen. von Bardeleben, president of the 
Verein ‘‘Herold,” Berlin; and Dr. Fred. L. Hoffman, statistician of  
-P-A-G-E-656

the Prudential Insurance Co., United States. The proceedings of the 
congress have been published by the English society in an unbound 
volume. The proposition for a permanent executive committee to 
be located at London was adopted by the congress, and the commit- 
tee was authorized to proceed with preparations for the next congress 
to meet at the expiration of three years (1915) at either Paris or San 
Francisco. The permanent office of the English society is 6 York 
Building, Adelphi, London, W. C.; the secretary is Mrs. Gotto. 
CONVENTION OF AMERICAN TEACHERS AT BERLIN. 
The Convention of American Teachers held at Berlin in August, 
under the auspices of the National German-American Teachers’ 
Association, afforded to the large company of American teachers 
participating opportunity for hearing the principles of their pro- 
fession discussed by eminent exponents of educational philosophy. 
Among those whose services were freely offered were Prof. W. Rein 
(Jena), Prof. Hugo Muensterberg (Berlin), Prof. v. Schulze- 
Gaevernitz (Freiburg), Dr. G.. Kerschensteiner (Munich), and Dr. 
Eugen Kuehnemann (Breslau). At the close of the congress the 
visiting teachers had the choice of several delightful itineraries. (See 
also pp. 45-46.) 
FOURTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS FOR DRAWING AND ART 
INSTRUCTION. 
The Fourth International Congress for Drawing and Art Instruc- 
tion held at Dresden, August 12-18, 1912, drew together about 2,200 
delegates, many of them from remote parts of the world. 
The chief topics discussed at the congress were: The psychological 
principles of drawing; training of teachers of drawing; artistic pen- 
manship; value of museums in popular education; drawing in the 
secondary schools; commercial draftsmanship. 
At the exposition held coincidentally with the congress, the exhibit 
of art work from schools of the United States received much attention. 
The specimens of decorative drawing and applied design were specially 
commended by foreign observers. 
The official delegates from the United States to the congress were: 
Mr. John S. Ankeney, director art department, University of Mis- 
souri, Columbia, Mo.; Mr. Ernest A. Batchelder, director School of 
Design, Pasadena, Cal.; and Mr. James Frederick Hopkins, director 
schools of art and design, Maryland Institute, Baltimore, Md. 
FIFTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF MATHEMATICIANS. 
The Fifth Intermational Congress of Mathematicians, held at Cam- 
bridge, August 21-28, 1912, was marked by the consideration of the 
work of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction,
-P-A-G-E-657
  EVENTS OF INTERNATIONAL INTEREST. , eat 
which occupied three sessions of the section to which this subject was 
assigned. ees 
A report of the proceedings of this section emphasizes the following 
points: The presentation of 150 printed reports showing the status 
of mathematics, from the kindergarten through the university, in 
most of the leading countries of the world, and affording teachers of 
mathematics the means of comparing their work with the best in every 
country; plan suggested for summarizing the main results of the work 
of the commission in a form available for teachers; comparison of 
America with other countries in respect to mathematical teaching; 
report on the teaching of mathematics from 1900 to 1912.1 
The congress adopted the following resolution, which was trans- 
mitted from the international commission: 
Resolved, That the congress expresses its appreciation of the support given to its 
commission on the teaching of mathematics by various governments, institutions, and 
individuals; 
That the central committee composed of F. Klein (Gottingen), Sir G. Greenhill 
(London), and H. Fehr (Geneva) be continued in power and that, at its request, David 
Eugene Smith (New York) be added to its number; 
That the delegates be requested to continue their good offices in securing the coop 
eration of their respective Governments, and in carrying on the work; 
And that the commission be requested to make such further report at the sixth inter- 
national congress, and to hold such conferences in the meantime as the circumstances 
warrant. 
The congress joined heartily in a resolution of thanks for the pub- 
lication of the bibliography on mathematical teaching, which was 
assumed by the Bureau of Education at Washington.? 
FOURTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF THE HISTORY OF RELIGIONS. 
The Fourth International Congress of the History of Religions was 
held at Leiden, the Netherlands, September 9-13, 1912. As in 
previous congresses of this series, papers and discussion were strictly 
limited to historic research, all questions of faith and dogma being 
excluded. Many countries were represented at the congress by official 
delegates, among them the United States, whose representatives were 
as follows: T. C. Hall, D. D., of Union Theological Seminary; B. W. 
Bacon, D. D., LL. D., of Yale University; and Morris Jastrow, jr., 
Ph. D., of the University of Pennsylvania. Many learned societies 
and universities were also represented by delegates. In an account 
of the congress, Dr. Jastrow notes that: 
Some 70 papers were presented, embracing the entire range of the history of religions— 
primitive cults, the religions of China and Japan, the older Semitic religions, Islamism, 
the religions of India and Persia, of the Greeks and Romans, of the Celts and Teutons, 
and finally Christianity *

    632 EDUCATION REPORT, 1912. 
With regard to the spirit that prevailed throughout the sessions, 
Dr. Jastrow says: 
The scientific meetings passed off without a jarring note. Despite the delicacy of 
some of the subjects presented, the discussions were entirely courteous, and the proof 
was once more furnished that it is possible to hold a congress of this kind without in- 
troducing ‘‘questions of religious belief,’’ which the laws of the congress distinctly 
exclude from consideration.t 
SECOND INTERNATIONAL MORAL EDUCATION CONGRESS. 
The First International Moral Education Congress was held at the 
University of London in September, 1908. The importance of the 
subject and the service which the congress rendered in giving definite 
expression to prevailing opinions and practices in respect to its treat- 
ment as a distinct branch of formal instruction excited wide interest 
in the call for the second congress of the series, to meet at The Hague, 
August 22-27, 1912. The congress convened under the auspices of 
the Queen of the Netherlands and with the active cooperation of rep- 
resentative men of many nations. The program was organized in 
four divisions, dealing, respectively, with the consideration of moral 
education from different standpoints, religious, ethical, etc.; with 
physical training as a means of character building, with the moral 
training of adolescents—i. e., in schools beyond the primary grade; 
in training colleges for teachers and military men, in family life and 
in society at large; and finally with the moral training of abnormals, 
which was the topic of the fourth section. 
Notwithstanding the fact that the congress was well organized, 
and that abstracts of the papers to be submitted were in print before 
its assembly, the number of papers precluded extensive discussions 
of any one of the topics. The report of the proceedings, omitting the 
papers by the American members, which were published separately 
at the expense of the committee for the United States, comprises a 
quarto volume of 1,072 pages. 
Apart from the publication of the report, which is a mine of infor- 
mation relative to the specialties considered, and the inspiring influ- 
ence of the congress upon the participants, its chief outcome is the 
mpressive evidence it offers that the movement for a new emphasis 
upon moral education is world-wide in extent and profoundly sig- 
nificant. Provision was made for future action by the continuance 
of the international committee, with instructions to prepare for the 
third congress of this series. The office of the executive of this com- 
mittee is at London; J. W. Adamson, chairman; Fred Charles, honor- 
ary secretary.

EIGHTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF APPLIED CHEMISTRY. 
The Highth International Congress of Applied Chemistry was held 
at Columbia University, New York City, September 6-13, 1912. The 
officers of the congress were: Dr. Edward W. Morley, of Hartford, 
Conn., honorary president; Dr. William Henry Nichols, of New York, 
president; and Bernhard C. Hesse, of New York, secretary. The 
arrangements for the congress were elaborated by an able executive 
committee, and the occasion brought together a distinguished com- 
pany of specialists representing the principal countries and the lead- 
ing industries of the world. 
One of the most interesting papers presented before the congress 
was by Dr. Hugo Schweitzer, vice president of the Farbenfabriken 
Co., of Elberfeld, who reviewed the remarkable achievements of chem- 
istry in the nineteenth century, which have revolutionized many 
industries and greatly increased the demand for men specially trained 
in the science. : 
The next meeting of the congress will be held at St. Petersburg in 
1915. The exact date has not yet been determined. 
FIFTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE AND 
COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ASSOCIATIONS. 
The Fifth International Congress of Chambers of Commerce and 
Commercial and Industrial Associations, which was held at Boston, 
September 24-26, 1912, although not an educational congress, had 
important bearings upon education. In particular it has given stim- 
ulus to current efforts for promoting the higher orders of commercial 
education on the part of several of the leading universities of the 
United States. Some 50 different countries were represented by the 
770 delegates, of whom 535 were from foreign countries. 
The topics discussed by the congress included the establishment of 
an international court of arbitral justice and the unification of legis- 
lation relating to checks, both of which are of interest to schools of 
commerce and law. 
FIFTEENTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF HYGIENE AND 
DEMOGRAPHY. 
The Fifteenth International Congress of Hygiene and Demography 
was held at Washington, September 23-28, 1912, and was distin- 
guished by its large membership, reaching nearly 4,000, by the num- 
ber of delegates eminent in the sciences to which it related, and by 
the great public interest which it excited. 
Prominence was given in the proceedings to the section of public 
health and hygiene, and both in this section and in the exhibit which
-P-A-G-E-660

accompanied the congress emphasis was placed upon the inseparable 
relation between the broad field of municipal hygiene and sanitation 
and the service of school hygiene and medical inspection. 
TENTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS FOR THE STUDY OF THE HISTORY 
OF ART. 
This congress was held at Rome, October 16-21, 1912. 
The United States was officially represented by Mr. Ralph R. Lati- 
mer, formerly vice principal of the Maryland Institute Schools of 
Art and Design, Baltimore, Md. From a report presented by the 
delegate the following particulars are derived: 
The congress was held in the old Corsini Palace, near the Tiber, on 
the Vatican side of the river. This fine old palace, built by a nephew 
of Pope Sixtus IV, has been purchased by the Italian Government to 
become the site of the Accademia dei Lincei, an institution for the 
promotion of education of all sorts. 
The congress did not in any way deal with the practical teaching of 
drawing or painting, but was concerned with the study of existing 
works of art, which show the growth and influence of a sense of 
beauty in different communities. 
The sessions were occupied by papers and discussions and were 
interspersed with elaborate entertainments for the delegates, who 
numbered 600, chiefly from Italy and the neighboring countries. 
They had unusual opportunity for viewing many treasures of art 
seldom open to visitors, among them the Villa Albani, noted for its 
beautiful grounds and pavilions full of interesting statues, among 
them the lotus-crowned Antinnos. 
At the final session it was announced that the next congress would 
probably be held at Paris.

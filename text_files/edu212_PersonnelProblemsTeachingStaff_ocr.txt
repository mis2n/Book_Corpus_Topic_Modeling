EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
It has come to be recognized that a genuine profes- 
sion in Hducation is rapidly developing—the pro- 
fession of school superintending. During the earlier 
years of the development of the work of the city 
superintendent there were wide differences of opinion 
as to the essential characteristics of his work. Most 
superintendents became superintendents by accident 
rather than by intention. None of them in the earlier 
years had professional training for the simple reason 
that no professional training existed. Gradually, in 
the colleges of education and teachers’ colleges, 
courses have been introduced dealing with various 
types of educational administration. In the meantime 
experience taught boards of education and the more 
professional of our city superintendents that techni- 
cal training of real significance was coming to be 
necessary. 
The problems of the city superintendent are ex- 
ceedingly numerous and spread over all types of edu- 
cational activity. He should be an _ educational 
statesman, a man acquainted with business organiza- 
tion, able to utilize accepted business principles in the 
development of the routine of his own office. He has 
to be a man able to deal with the public in its relation 
to the educational problems of the community. He 
must be versed in all that has to do with the relations

of the city schools to the state, the county and the 
municipality. One type of his professional training, 
therefore, has to deal with these broader relationships. 
Another and very important part of the superin- 
tendent’s work has to do with his relations with his 
teaching force. The greater portion of his time and 
energy in the smaller systems and no small propor- 
tion of his thought and responsibility in the larger 
systems must be given to what the author of this 
volume has called ‘‘The Personnel Problems of the 
Teacher and the Superintendent.’’ These have to 
do with the professional training of the teacher and 
with the very important duty of increasing the effi- 
ciency of the teacher who is actually a member of his 
school system. Possibly above all other single duties 
of importance is that of selecting the proper type of 
teacher and with all that that implies in connection 
with the local problems of home talent and the de- 
velopment of higher standards on the part of the com- 
munity as to academic and professional preparation. 
The task of maintaining the standard of efficiency in 
the teaching force not infrequently carries with it the 
necessity of separating from the corps those who for 
various reasons do not come up to desirable stand- 
ards. The problem of the turnover of the teacher 
and the increasing of the permanency of the tenure of 
office, problems which have to do with maintaining 
high standards of physical and intellectual vigor on 
the part of the teaching corps, all require the use 
of the greatest tact, diplomacy and wisdom on the 
part of the executive head of the school system,

darity of the teaching profession and the desire to 
participate to a greater extent in a considerable of 
the great problems of the city school system by the 
teachers themselves is manifesting itself through the 
organization of various types of councils, federations 
and associations, all of which are causing a necessary 
modification by superintendents of many of their 
original notions as to the powers, duties and limita- 
tions of the administrative head of the school system. 
All of these the author of this volume has consid- 
ered not merely from the point of view of a man 
exceptionally well-trained himself in the theory of 
educational administration but one who has had prac- 
tical experience as superintendent of large school sys- 
tems. In the opinion of the editor of the Century 
Education Series this book will supply a very real 
need to instructors of educational administration in 
our colleges and universities and it ought to become 
a handbook for guidance and reference in the pos- 
session of all of the school superintendents of the 
United States.

  PREFACE 
Books on school supervision deal, for the most part, 
with the teaching and learning processes. Personnel 
problems are neglected or dealt with in a brief chapter 
or two. 
Obviously, the best way to improve a school system 
is to improve the teaching staff and the best way to 
improve the teaching staff is to be expert in selecting, 
training, placing, and promoting teachers. More con- 
scious methods and policies of managing the teaching 
staff are needed in education. This has led to the 
establishment of courses in teachers’ colleges and 
normal schools dealing with administrative manage- 
ment of the teaching staff. The writer taught such a 
course in the University of Chicago during the summer 
sessions of 1921 and 1922 and again in the University 
of Michigan in 1923 and 1924. 
Personnel management has been extensively dealt 
with in commercial and industrial establishments but 
in education it has been practically neglected. Even 
the terms ‘‘Personnel Management,’’ ‘‘ Personnel De- 
partments,’’ ‘‘Personnel Administration’? and the 
like are not found in any of the standard books on 
public school administration. 
The writer feels that systematic courses in per- 
sonnel management in education will materially assist 
beginning superintendents and principals in the selec-

tion, placement, and promotion of teachers and thereby 
improve the schools under their supervision. In fact, 
upon a successful personnel management in educa- 
tion depends to a large extent both the happiness and 
efficiency of the teachers and pupils. 
This does not profess to be a complete treatise on 
personnel management. It is merely an introduction 
to the field but it may stimulate others to a more com- 
plete treatment of the subject. 
Acknowledgments are gratefully made to the many 
students who have unconsciously stimulated by their 
discussions the writing of this book. Special acknowl- 
edgments are due Professor J. B. Edmonson of the 
University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and to Dr. Clif- 
ford Woody of the same institution for their many 
suggestions during the progress of the book.

CHAPTER I 
WHAT IS PERSONNEL SUPERVISION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS? 
Two phases of school supervision.—This book deals 
with personnel supervision in the public schools of 
the United States. 
There are two major phases of public school super- 
vision. One is the supervision of what the French 
call the materiel, The other is the supervision of the 
personnel, 
By material (using the English word) is meant 
buildings, grounds, furniture, supplies, upkeep, main- 
tenance, money, ete. It includes everything of a physi- 
cal nature necessary for the teacher to work effec- 
tively. In large cities, special departments known as 
the business department, the building and grounds de- 
partment, or the like are established to look after the 
physical or material side of public education. Usu- 
ally, in small cities, and in towns, villages, and rural 
communities, the superintendent of schools, as the 
chief executive officer of the board of education, is

   4 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
called upon to supervise the material as well as the 
personnel side of the schools over which he presides. 
By personnel is meant, what the word implies, the 
body of persons necessary to carry out the function of 
the institution. It includes all the employees. In 
education this embraces the superintendent, assistant 
or deputy superintendents, supervisors, directors, 
principals, assistant principals, clerks, teachers, jani- 
tors, engineers, ete. Thus, we may speak of the per- 
sonnel of the administrative and supervisory staff, 
the personnel of the teaching staff, the personnel of 
the engineering staff. 
Obviously, personnel supervision is vastly more im- 
portant than material supervision. Furthermore, it 
is much more difficult. Personnel supervision involves 
human nature and human relationships. It is far 
easier to manage and control physical and material 
properties than it is to know how successfully to man- 
age and direct human beings. 
Six essentials of a good school system.—The impor- 
tance of personnel work may be shown by pointing 
out the six most important essentials of a good school 
system. They are: goodwill, good financial support, 
good leadership, good buildings, good materials of 
instruction, and good teachers. Three of these are 
material in character:—finance, buildings, and sup- 
plies. The other three pertain more exclusively to 
personnel :—goodwill, leadership, and teachers. The 
six are just as essential in a one-room school district 
as in New York City. 
Goodwill is the prime requisite of a good school 
system. The schools, like the government, are ‘‘of

the people, by the people, and for the people.’? Good- 
will connotes a favorable disposition toward, a hearti- 
ness or zeal for, a thing. It leads to love, affection, 
loyalty, aid, and support. In a democracy, the good- 
will of the public is essential for the ultimate success 
of any educational enterprise. With the public’s 
goodwill a school system may do almost anything; 
without it, little of permanent value can be accom- 
plished. School officers are slowly learning the truth 
of this. They are interested as never before in put- 
ting the schools before the public in the best possible 
light in order to gain for them all the moral, intellec- 
tual, and financial support of which the public is 
capable. 
The second essential is adequate financial support. 
Money talks in education as elsewhere. Goodwill 
without adequate financial backing is mere sentimen- 
‘tality and “‘lip’’ service. ‘The solution of practically 
every educational problem is dependent, in a large 
measure, upon the money that is available. The more 
effectually school officers can ‘‘sell’? the schools to 
the people the more generous is the people’s support. 
The third essential is good leadership. Good lead- 
ership is necessary in all departments of education. 
Schools, like other institutions, are rarely any better 
than their leadership. Every possible effort should 
be made to secure and hold superintendents, super- 
visors, principals, and other members of the educa- 
tional staff of the highest ideals, expertness, and good 
sense. 
The fourth essential is good buildings. The heat- 
ing, lighting, ventilation, sanitation, size, comfort, and
-P-A-G-E-24
    6 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
beauty of the place in which work is done are impor- 
tant factors affecting the efficiency and happiness of 
those who do the work. 
The fifth essential is a generous supply of good ma- 
terials of instruction. Books and supplies are the 
tools of the teacher. A workman cannot do his best 
with poor tools or an inadequate supply of good tools. 
Last, but most important of all, are the teachers 
themselves. Goodwill that does not result in securing 
good teachers is futile. So, too, is finance, leadership, 
buildings, and supplies. To the casual observer these 
other things may appear to make a good school, but 
to the thoughtful student they are but the shell, the 
skeleton, the scaffolding. ‘‘As is the teacher, so is 
the school’’ cannot be successfully disputed. 
The competency of the classroom teacher primarily 
determines the efficiency of the public school system. 
Obviously, the schools need the best. Teachers of 
first-rate intellect, morals, skill, and devotion are a 
prime necessity. Locke long ago voiced the truth 
when he said: ‘‘The school which has good teachers 
needs little more, and the school without good teach- 
ers will be little better for anything else.’’ ‘‘The na- 
tion,’’? says Thorndike, ‘‘which lets incapables teach 
it, while the capable men and women only feed or 
clothe or amuse it, is committing intellectual 
suicide.’’ 
However, good teachers are not ends in themselves 
any more than goodwill, finance, leadership, buildings, 
and supplies. All of these things are means to an 
end, of which the teacher is the chief means. They 
are instruments brought together for the sole pur-

pose of making desirable changes in pupils. McCall 
well says, ‘‘The pupil is the center of gravity or sun 
of the educational system. Teachers are satellites of 
this sun and supervisors are moons of the satellites. 
All the paraphernalia of education exist for just one 
purpose, to make desirable changes in pupils. The 
worth of these paraphernalia can be measured in just 
one way,—by determining how many desirable 
changes they make in pupils.’’? 
The teacher problem.—How may every school sys- 
tem secure and hold highly gifted, well qualified, 
trained, moral, and skilful teachers? This is the erux 
of the problem of public education in the United 
States. It is both a local and a national problem of 
the first magnitude. 
Most public school teachers are women. Despite 
all efforts to increase the proportion of men teachers, 
the feminization process continues. Furthermore, 
most public school teachers are young, unmarried 
women teaching in or near their home towns. Of all 
the trades and professions, teaching offers the most 
to the largest number of women who by nature and 
inclination are fitted for it. Hven higher educational 
institutions are slowly recognizing women in their 
faculties. 
Today the levels within the profession of classroom 
teaching range from the simplest one-room country 
school to a professor’s chair in the foremost uni- 
versity of the country. The outstanding personnel 
problem in public education is the classroom teacher. 
Janitors, clerks, supervisors, and principals in turn

-P-A-G-E-26
8 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
present personnel problems decidedly worth attention. 
But the one big problem is that of the classroom 
teacher. The best possible teacher is none too good. 
Surely the recruiting of a competent teaching staff 
is the first duty of a school system. 
What schools may learn from business and industry.— 
Business and industrial establishments have long 
faced a difficult problem in securing competent em- 
ployees. Gradually they have learned in the hard 
school of experience and by the costly process of trial- 
and-error that it pays to have conscious policies with 
respect to all matters affecting the selection, efficiency, 
welfare, and happiness of their employees. The hu- 
man element is being more fully recognized now than 
in the past. Business and industry are learning that 
the conservation of human capacity, human interest, 
and human energy is far more important than the 
conservation of other natural resources. 
They are, therefore, organizing and establishing de- 
partments to carefully recruit and to wisely conserve 
their workmen. Such departments are called person- 
nel departments and are now a well recognized neces- 
sity in hundreds of establishments. For example, the 
New York Stock Exchange established a personnel 
department in 1916. In its report for the year 1923, 
we read that in so far as the building itself is con- 
cerned, it could probably be replaced in two years, but 
“‘to replace the staff of 859 loyal employees, many of 
whom have spent a lifetime in its service, would take 
years of consistent effort.’’ The same thing is true 
in education. A building may be easily replaced, but 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
  
PERSONNEL SUPERVISION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 9 
replacing a highly competent teaching staff requires 
considerable time, and skill-of the highest order. 
The necessity for directing personnel departments 
in shops and factories has created a new profession 
variously called ‘‘Employment Manager,’’ ‘‘Person- 
nel Officer,’’ ‘‘Personnel Engineer,’’ and ‘‘Personnel 
Manager.’’ Regardless of names, such officers are 
usually assigned the duty of both hiring an adequate 
supply of suitable employees and, what is more im- 
portant, of adjusting them to their work in accordance 
with their best capacities, interests, and opportunities 
after they are hired. 
The development of a technique of personnel admin- 
istration and supervision in business and industry 
has given rise to a considerable literature. A recent 
bibliography ? on the subject contains nearly two hun- 
dred titles, among which the following suggest the 
range of topics covered: ‘‘Management and Men’’; 
‘‘Personnel and Employment Problems’’; ‘‘What is 
Personnel Research?’’; ‘‘The Human Factor in Busi- 
ness’’; ‘‘ Written Standard Job Specifications’’; ‘‘Vo- 
cational Tests and Methods’’; ‘‘The Three-Position 
Plan of Promotion’’; ‘‘Personnel and Medical 
Audit’’; ‘‘Personnel Specifications’’; ‘‘Breaking in 
the New Worker’’; ‘‘The Executive and His Control 
of Men’’; ‘‘Mind and Work’’; ‘‘Scientific Manage- 
ment and Labor’’; ‘‘Individuality in Industry’’; and 
‘“‘Personnel Management, its Principles, Practices, 
and Point of View.’’

    10 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
Function of personnel management.—‘‘ Personnel 
work, if it is real, must be personal work.’’ Its ideal 
function is to increase human happiness. To be happy 
as a worker one must be lost in his work. One is 
more likely to be lost in his work if it is suited to 
his best capacities and interests. If one is lost in 
his work he is more efficient. If he is more efficient 
he will do more and better work and, therefore, in 
the long run, earn more. ‘‘Because he earns more, 
he is better equipped to provide himself and his de- 
pendents with those physical and cultural advantages 
which in turn contribute to his happiness. This again 
reacts favorably upon his mental attitude and con- 
sequently upon his power to produce whereby the 
economic benefits to his employer are again enhanced. 
It is a spiral making continuously for increased pro- 
duction and for greater personal happiness.’ 3 © 
Naturally, therefore, personnel work cannot be 
strictly departmentalized. It cannot be exclusively 
housed in one spot bearing the exalted title of per- 
sonnel department. Anyone who successfully directs, 
guides, supervises, or manages the work and welfare 
of others is doing personnel work. 
However, a central office and staff are often neces- 
sary in order to maintain adequate records, conduct 
interviews, formulate policies, do research work, give 
tests, and direct the carrying out of personnel plans 
and policies after they are formulated. All such 
work is usually centered in the so-called personnel 
department. 
What is personnel work?—Personnel work includes 
*Scott, Walter D. and Clothier, R. C. Personnel Management, p. 9.
-P-A-G-E-29
  PERSONNEL SUPERVISION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS il 
anything and everything that may add to the happi- 
ness and efficiency of workers. At first in shops and 
factories new features are often regarded as un- 
economical by some employers and as philanthropies 
by workmen. New features are tested and proved be- 
fore they are generally adopted. If they prove 
to be ‘‘good business’’ their general acceptance is 
accelerated. 
Personnel work attempts to improve the working 
conditions. By ‘‘working conditions’’ is meant ‘‘all 
those influences which surround the worker in his 
work and which affect him favorably or unfavorably 
in its performance.’’ There are physical working con- 
ditions and mental working conditions. 
Physical working conditions include such things as 
air, ventilation, light, safety measures, rest and dress- 
ing rooms, lockers, baths, midday lunches, medical 
attention and examinations, free hospitals, visiting 
nurses, sanitation, factory hygiene, lack of order, lack 
of cleanliness, gloominess, ete. 
By mental working conditions is meant such things 
as worry, fatigue, misunderstandings, wrong super- 
vision, lack of incentives, lack of opportunities for 
advancement, and their opposites. 
Other factors of a moral, educational, and social 
character are amusements, clubs, societies, concerts, 
entertainments, motion pictures, and a great variety 
of educational opportunities such as elementary 
schools, Americanization opportunities, continuation 
schools, apprenticeship, correspondence, trade and vo- 
cational training, and the like. 
Again, there are economic features such as prizes
-P-A-G-E-30
    12. PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
and bonuses for suggestions and for length and regu- 
larity of service, mutual benefit privileges covering 
sickness, accident, and old age, improved housing fa- 
cilities, and codperative buying. 
It would be difficult, indeed, to make a complete list 
of all the features of personnel work that have and 
are being tried in shops and factories. The conditions 
of living and of working are constantly improving. 
More of the good things of life are available to each 
succeeding generation. The luxuries of one genera- 
tion tend to become necessities in the next. ‘‘It is 
the normal method of progress that the refinements 
of life should first be enjoyed by the few, then ex- 
tended to many as a favor, and at length demanded 
by all as a right.’ 4 
Significance to education.—But public schools are not 
business and industrial establishments. Why, there- 
fore, should the attention of teachers and school 
officers be called to personnel management and super- 
vision in such establishments? Are there lessons that 
schools may learn from shops and factories? Is it 
possible that there are personnel conditions in the 
public schools that might be improved by the adop- 
tion of principles and practices now applied in trade 
and industry? The writer believes there are and that 
school teachers as well as officers may profitably study 
ways and means of improving personnel. If personnel 
management is important in business and industrial 
establishments, whose products are material in char- 
acter, how much more important is personnel manage- 
*Jones, Edward D. The Administration of Industrial Enterprises, 
p. 322.
-P-A-G-E-31
    
PERSONNEL SUPERVISION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 13 
ment in the public schools, the products of which are 
almost infinite in their potentialities! 
Professional unrest.—There is a growing separation 
between the classroom teacher, the principal, the 
supervisor, the superintendent, and the school board. 
The classroom teachers feel lost in a machine-like 
organization. School systems are constantly growing 
in size and complexity. Division of labor has caused 
further separation. Naturally, educational officers get 
out of touch with classroom activities. They become 
‘‘office’’ officers. The teacher who is forever on the 
firing line gets to feel that her work is little under- 
stood or appreciated. This gives rise to resentment 
and misunderstanding. Teachers organize against 
officers; they demand more of a voice in the af- 
fairs of the system. The good classroom teacher 
knows that she is more important to the success of 
instruction than is the school board, the superintend- 
ent and his staff, the building and its equipment, and 
all other elements of a school system put together. She 
knows that the chief reason for the existence of all 
the other elements is to guarantee a proper number 
of highly gifted, qualified, devoted, and successful 
teachers. But consciously or unconsciously she is 
often made to feel otherwise. This leads her to organ- 
ize for her own self-defense. A bloc system of control 
develops with all its attendant evils. : 
If the teacher is neglected or treated as a mere 
hired hand, regardless of her interest, it soon affects 
her mentally. She wants to move on, to shift about 
in a vain quest for change. She seeks something 
different, something offering her greater satisfaction. 
   
-P-A-G-E-32
  14 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
In time she may become indifferent, disloyal, and even 
malevolent. Her work suffers in consequence. In 
general, it may be said that the work is no better than 
the worker. It is not sentiment but good business to 
have those in positions of power and responsibility 
who are sensitive to the needs, desires, and interests 
of those over whom they exercise power and 
responsibility. 
Turnover.—Every new teacher introduced into a sys- 
tem, and adjusted to a particular place, entails an 
expense over and above what the continued service 
of a former teacher would have cost. This cost is 
made up of the expense of the employment depart- 
ment, the extra attention required of the principal and 
supervisor, the low rate of initial performance, the 
cost of spoiled work, the extra wear and tear of equip- 
ment, the uneasiness and lack of loyalty of a con- 
stantly shifting force, and the low average perform- 
ance which is likely to characterize a group of teach- 
ers so long as novices or obvious misfits among them 
are permitted to establish a poor performance as the 
permissible minimum. 
It has been variously estimated that cost of pro- 
duction in business and industrial establishments is 
increased from at least 10 to 20 per cent when per- 
sonnel management is neglected. It may be difficult 
to demonstrate the cost of turnover in education, but 
it must be high. Hackett estimates that labor turn- 
over in the United States costs the country $900,000,- 
000 annually. This sum is almost as much as the total 
cost of all forms of public education. More conscious 
methods of personnel supervision in public education 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
  PERSONNEL SUPERVISION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 15 
should decrease the cost of turnover and at the same 
time increase the sum total of human efficiency and 
human happiness. 
Main points of the chapter—The two major phases 
of public school administration are (1) material and 
(2) personnel. 
2. Material supervision includes buildings, grounds, 
supplies, money, and things of a physical character 
necessary to make it possible for the teacher to work 
effectively. 
8. Personnel supervision is more difficult and more 
important because it includes the body of persons 
necessary to carry on the school system; such as 
superintendent, assistant and deputy superintendents, 
directors, supervisors, principals, teachers, clerks, 
janitors, engineers, ete. 
4. The six essentials of a good school system are 
goodwill, good financial support, good leadership, 
good buildings, good supplies, and good teachers. 
5. Securing and holding competent classroom 
teachers is the crux of the problem of public educa- 
tion in America. It is, therefore, the outstanding 
personnel problem. 
6. Business and industry are more and more recog- 
nizing the value of a special personnel department in 
order to maintain adequate records, conduct inter- 
views, formulate and execute personnel policies, do 
research work, give tests, carry on welfare work, and 
in other ways improve the working conditions of 
employees. 
7. It is the belief of the writer that similar depart- 
ments are a necessity in public school systems in order

to combat unrest, reduce turnover, and in other ways 
promote the best interest of classroom teachers, and 
‘through the teacher uplift American children.

  CHAPTER II 
TYPICAL PERSONNEL PROBLEMS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Personnel problem-solving constitutes one of the 
major duties of school officers whether superintend- 
ent, supervisor, or principal. Most of these problems 
should be settled in terms of fundamental principles 
and policies that experience has demonstrated to be 
sound and wise educational procedure. Educational 
administration in the past was based too much upon 
trial-and-error methods. Each administrator did 
what his experience told him to do. He was rightly 
called an ‘‘educational opportunist.’’ Rarely are be- 
ginning superintendents equipped to do personnel work 
intelligently. They receive practically no training in 
either the college or the graduate courses in the theory 
and practice of personnel administration. 
The superintendent’s responsibility—The writer in 
his experience as a superintendent of schools has 
been repeatedly impressed by the lack of professional 
foresight of not only practically all beginning teachers 
but also of many teachers of considerable experience. 
Undoubtedly the conditions are improving. Teachers 
are better paid, that is, they at least handle more 
money and they are better educated than they were a 
few years ago. They are asking and receiving more 
of a voice in local and state school policies. But the 
18

great majority of classroom teachers still feel that the 
profession is scarcely worthy of the name. It is 
merely a job or trade to be held until some better 
opportunity presents itself. 
Surely this attitude is wrong. Yet superintendents 
and supervisors are partly to blame for it. Hvery 
effort should be made to inform teachers concerning 
problems that affect their personal and professional 
welfare. Many extra-classroom problems arise that 
need the teacher’s and superintendent’s codperation. 
The beginning teacher has little chance of getting a 
large view of education. Her contacts are extremely 
limited. She has nothing but her experience to guide 
her in forming her views of the profession. She may 
join a teachers’ club, but occasionally teachers’ clubs 
are one-sided in their views. The teacher comes to 
feel that she is important but quite neglected. 
Now, experience is a good teacher but charges like a 
specialist. Science should guide experience whenever 
and wherever it is possible to use it as a guide. Sci- 
ence is demonstrated truth. Surely, in seventy-five 
years of state, county, and city school administration 
a few scientific principles have been discovered that 
may be applied in the solution of present-day problems 
in public education. While no two problems are, 
or can be exactly alike, yet it should seem that the 
truth of certain principles might be demonstrated 
in the solution of personnel problems in education 
as surely as other truths are demonstrated in the 
laboratory. 
Classification of personnel problems.—School offi- 
cers as personnel managers are concerned with all the
-P-A-G-E-38
  20 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
problems which affect the personal and social welfare 
of the teacher both as an individual and as a teacher. 
Such problems arise both in and out of school. It 
would be difficult to make a complete list of all the 
factors that affect the teacher’s well being. In gen- 
eral, the professional problems may be classified as 
problems concerning the recruiting, training, selecting, 
appointing, and placing of teachers—not only in a 
given system, but likewise in the profession as a whole. 
School officers also need to know how teachers are paid 
and certificated; how they should be paid and certifi- 
cated; how the home talent and married women prob- 
lems are and should be handled; how teachers organ- 
ize and to what purpose; how they codperate; how 
their load and merit are measured; ways and means 
of improving their social status; how they are trained 
in service and promoted; how they care for their own 
health, spend their leisure, and provide for old age; 
how turnover is decreased, tenure increased and what 
ethical standards are, or should be, established and 
observed. All of these are professional problems that 
require for their solution personnel officers of the high- 
est ideals, expertness, and good sense. Unless such 
problems are wisely solved in each locality the children 
suffer. 
Principles of personnel supervision.—There are 
several fundamental principles that must be borne in 
mind in the study of the teacher as an individual. 
First, one individual differs from another in those 
personal aptitudes and abilities with which she is by 
nature equipped and which she is able to contribute 
to her teaching in return for her salary.
-P-A-G-E-39
  TYPICAL PERSONNEL PROBLEMS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 21 
Second, individual teachers differ widely in interests 
and motives and respond best to varying stimuli. 
Third, the same individual changes from year to 
year in ability and in interest (both in degree and 
kind). 
Fourth, different kinds of work require different 
kinds of personal ability in the persons who are to 
perform them. 
Fifth, granting equal ability, different kinds of work 
are done best by persons who temperamentally are 
particularly interested in them. 
Siath, the work in each position changes as time goes 
on. Duties are added and taken away. A similar 
change is apt to take place in abilities and interests 
of the teacher. 
Seventh, environment—working conditions, supervi- 
sion, personal and professional relations with fellow 
teachers, opportunities for advancement and for self 
expression exercise a tremendous influence on personal 
efficiency. 
The teacher-in-her-work unit—The old notion of 
putting square pegs into square holes and round pegs 
into round holes is entirely inadequate. The notion 
of the right man in the right place is little better. 
These notions regard both the job and the worker as 
rigid and inelastic. It is a cold, mechanical point of 
view. The new point of view recognizes that the 
teacher exercises an influence upon her job and the 
job exercises an influence upon the teacher. In fact, 
the job is never the same job when filled by a differ- 
ent teacher. The teacher is never the same teacher 
1 Scott, W. D. and Clothier, R. C. Personnel Management, pp. 12-13. 
   
-P-A-G-E-40
  
  22 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
when in a different job. The job reacts upon the 
teacher and the teacher reacts upon the job. Neither 
the job nor the teacher is rigid and inelastic. 
This has led to a new conception in personnel ad- 
ministration. The new conception is called the worker- 
in-his-work unit. When a new teacher is hired we 
should not think merely of connecting a teacher to a 
job or a job to a teacher. It is the creation of a 
teacher-in-her-work unit. The hiring of a new teacher 
does not reproduce the same teacher-in-her-work unit. 
A new teacher-in-her-work unit has been created. The 
transfer of the teacher from one position to another 
destroys the present unit and creates another new unit. 
The task of personnel supervision in education is to 
make every teacher-in-her-work unit as effective as 
possible.” 
Three factors in a teacher-in-her-work unit—There 
are three factors that must be considered in studying 
a teacher-in-her-work unit. The three are (1) the 
teacher’s capacities, (2) the teacher’s interests, and 
(3) the opportunities presented by the work. 
One’s capacities include a great variety of intangible 
personal characteristics and concrete abilities, all of 
which do or do not make for success in any given kind 
of work. ‘‘A list of one’s capacities would include such 
characteristics as physical health, nervous codrdination, 
appearance and manner, judgment, initiative, aggres- 
siveness, thoroughness, disposition, tact, diplomacy, 
organizing ability, supervisory ability, culture, knowl- 
edge, adaptability, and skill along specific lines.’’ 
?For a fuller discussion of this new conception of workers in relation 
to their jobs see Scott, W. D. and Clothier, R. C. Personnel Manage- 
ment, pp. 13-14.  
-P-A-G-E-41
  
  TYPICAL PERSONNEL PROBLEMS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 23 
“Interest has to do with one’s volitional life. We 
must consider one’s wishes, ambitions, conscious and 
unconscious motives, instinctive and impulsive tenden- 
cies to act, the unconscious mind and emotional set or 
trend, the vague yearnings and the restless and ill- 
defined cravings which are so profound and yet so 
slightly recognized as a part in human efficiency. Ca- 
pacities and interests must be in harmony for the 
highest efficiency and happiness of the individual.’’ 
Finally, the requirements and the opportunities of 
each position must be studied. This requires expert 
job-analysis. Opportunities include (1) a chance for 
the worker to exercise his special capacities; (2) a 
chance to satisfy his special interests; (3) a chance 
to advance, and (4) a chance for self-expression, for 
the ‘‘satisfaction of such creative instincts as he may 
possess, for such growth as he may crave, for the ful- 
filment so far as possible of those desires and ambi- 
tions of a personal nature (for civic activity, for proper 
leisure, for family responsibilities) with which he may 
be endowed.’’ 
Balance between capacities, interests, and opportuni- 
ties.—Tigure 1 ° illustrates what may be regarded as a 
perfect balance in capacities, interests, and opportuni- 
ties. The three triangles are of the same size in this 
figure. Of course, such perfection of adjustment is 
rarely, if ever, obtainable. The elements are not easy 
of measurement. Personnel administration is, there- 
fore, not an exact science. However, a conscious 
appreciation of the principles involved cannot but im-

prove practice. In a perfectly balanced situation, such 
as illustrated in Figure 1, the capacities and interests 
of the teacher will be only those required by the work, 
while the opportunities of the work will be such as to 
give the teacher full expression of her capacities and a 
full satisfaction of her interests. The other figures 
illustrate what happens when capacities are short as 
in Figure 2, or when opportunities are short as in Fig- 
ure 8, or when interests are short as in Figure 4. A 
perfect balance is lacking in the last three figures. 
Main points of the chapter—1. Hundreds of per- | 
sonnel problems arise annually in every school system, 
no two of which are exactly alike. In the past these 
problems were settled by trial-and-error methods. 
2. Science is demonstrated truth. In seventy-five 
years of school administration a few scientific princi- 
ples have been discovered that should be applied in 
present-day personnel administration. 
3. Personnel problems in education may be classi- 
fied into groups such as recruiting problems, training 
problems, problems in selection, appointment and 
placement of teachers, certification problems, financial 
problems, and problems pertaining to health, leisure, 
home talent, teachers’ organizations, teaching load, 
teacher-merit, old age, turnover, tenure, social status, 
ethical standards, ete. 
4. The superintendent, as the chief executive offi- 
cer of the board of education, should be given a special 
course of training in personnel work in order that he 
may assume the responsibility of establishing the 
proper kind of personnel administration in public 
schools.
-P-A-G-E-44
  26 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
5. There are seven fundamental principles that 
must be observed in personnel administration of public 
schools. They are: (1) individual differences in teach- 
ers in aptitudes and abilities; (2) individual differ- 
ences in interests and motives; (3) growth and change 
within the individual as time passes; (4) different kinds 
of work require different kinds of personal ability; 
(5) work will be done best when suited to individual 
abilities and interests; (6) the work itself is not static, 
and (7) working conditions exert a tremendous influ- 
ence on personal efficiency. 
6. The realization of these seven principles has 
given rise to a new conception of personnel adminis- 
tration called the worker-in-his-work unit. 
7. The task of personnel supervision in education, 
as elsewhere, is to make each teacher-in-her-work unit 
as effective as possible. There are three factors in a 
teacher-in-her-work unit. These are: capacities, inter- 
ests, and opportunities. 
PROBLEMS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
1. The directors of country school, District No. 14, are 
looking for a new teacher. One of the directors wants the 
county superintendent to select the teacher. The other two 
directors each have a local candidate to advocate. Who is 
best qualified to select teachers for one-room country schools? 
Why? What, if any, is the trouble with the present school 
law in your state on this matter? 
2. Miss A. was principal of a grade building at the 
time that Superintendent R—— was elected to the superin- 
tendency. She had been appointed from within the staff 
during the war period. Her total length of teaching service 
was eight years. She was a graduate of an approved high 
school, but had done little or nothing to improve her quali-  
-P-A-G-E-45
  TYPICAL PERSONNEL PROBLEMS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 27 
fications during her teaching experience. Superintendent 
R—— observed that her discipline was weak, her supervision 
poor, and her teaching ability about average. When sugges- 
tions were made by Superintendent R—— she complained 
that her teaching and supervisory duties were too heavy. 
Her teaching load was accordingly lightened but there was 
little improvement. At the time for re-appointment Super- 
intendent R suggested that she improve her qualifica- 
tions by attending summer school. Her reply was to the 
effect that because of her heavy duties she had used up all 
her strength and that summer school would ruin her health. 
Should Miss A—— be reémployed? Demoted? Dismissed? 
Made to improve her qualifications? Why? If Miss A. 
is retained should her duties be made still lighter? Remain 
the same? Made more difficult? Why? Asa superintendent 
what recommendations would you make to your board? 
83. The school board of District No. 4 had to meet this 
problem. For the last four years the school had been very 
efficiently run by a teacher who had been teaching under a 
second grade certificate. Last term her certificate ran out. 
She did not attend summer school as required by law and 
the county superintendent said he would not let her teach 
the coming year. The board thought they could not secure an- 
other teacher as competent. The county superintendent said 
the school would be closed the following winter if the di- 
rectors did not change their minds. What would you do if 
you were the county superintendent? <A director? Justify 
your answer. 
4. The town of Y—— (population 4000) employed a part- 
time music teacher. The teacher, Mrs. B. , had excellent 
preparation, and was a fine musician. However, she was very 
temperamental. The teachers disliked working with her and 
the older children dreaded her classes. The high-school 
orchestra and glee clubs dwindled to almost nothing. The 
board had wished to dismiss her for several years. Her 
father and brother were editors of the most influential paper 
in the city and the board hesitated to act. 
The superintendent recommended that a teacher be em- 
ployed full time to supervise the music work and teach two 
classes of English in the high school. He selected the Eng- 
lish-music combination as he knew Mrs. B—— could not   
  
  
   
-P-A-G-E-46
  28 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
qualify. This delighted the board. Mrs. B. was asked 
to consider the combination position, which she refused to do. 
A teacher was found who made good. Attack or defend the 
superintendent’s solution. What is the best solution of the 
music supervision problem in such cities which feel that they 
cannot engage a full time supervisor? 
5. In a certain school system, considerable time is lost by 
teachers because of sickness. The board of education asks 
for a report. The superintendent makes a report. The board 
passes a rule (against the judgment of the superintendent) 
refusing to pay a teacher whenever absent for any cause. 
How might this important personnel problem have been 
solved ? 
6. Miss N- , a country school teacher of two years’ 
experience, applied recently for a position in the city system. 
She was refused a position because of her lack of training. 
She complained that she did not see anything in teaching as 
a profession. She had, on graduating from high school, 
taken 12 weeks of normal training and secured a county cer- 
tificate. The country school where she first taught had three 
terms and she had been reélected each term. She had had 
no social opportunities and wanted to get into the city as 
quickly as possible. Her real purpose in moving from the 
country to the city was to improve her social opportunities 
and to increase her matrimonial expectancy. Teaching was 
a secondary interest. It was a means to an end and not an 
end in itself. She intended to get out of teaching at the 
earliest possible moment. Were her motives worthy ones? 
Was the superintendent justified in refusing to recommend 
her? 
7. Mr. X , who is a member of the school board, and 
his wife have asked each year that the superintendent recom- 
mend their home as a location for one of the out-of-town 
teachers. Their interest is wholly financial. The superin- 
tendent for three years has sent them a teacher to room and 
board. Mrs. X- is very fault finding. The first teacher 
had too many social engagements, the second one was irre- 
sponsible, the third one ate too much and burned too much 
electricity. All were dissatisfied; none felt at home. 
This year Mrs. X- is very anxious to have the music 
teacher, recently elected, as a roomer and boarder in order   
  
  
  
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  TYPICAL PERSONNEL PROBLEMS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 29 
that she may act as accompanist for her daughter, and to 
see that this daughter secures the major réle in each musical 
or dramatic production. 
Mrs. X: wrote to the music teacher, who wisely asked 
the advice of the superintendent before making any arrange- 
ments. The superintendent advised her frankly concerning 
the X- family, realizing that to do so might antagonize 
one board member. What responsibility has the superin- 
tendent in regard to securing pleasant locations for the out- 
of-town teachers? 
8. Superintendent K- was unable to locate a Latin 
teacher with a state certificate. Two weeks before school 
began the N. P. Teachers’ agency recommended Miss J- 
from Virginia. Miss J- had an A.B. from a small college 
in her home state. 
Upon applying for a certificate in this state she was in- 
formed that she lacked two hours of having enough education 
work. Before this report was returned Miss J- had taught 
nearly a month and was doing very well. 
One member of the board was in favor of discharging 
Miss J. as soon as a teacher with a satisfactory certificate 
could be secured. Should the superintendent have defended 
Miss J. , and upon what grounds? 
9. In a school system employing sixty-eight teachers, the 
superintendent has recommended and the board of education 
has adopted a rule which reads: ‘‘A teacher or other school 
employee absent for any cause the day before a vacation, 
holiday, or the end of a semester, or the day after a vacation 
or a holiday shall lose his or her pay for that day. This rule 
should be applied without exception and no excuses of any 
kind be considered.’’ 
Case A.—Miss A: , a high school teacher, is planning to 
spend the summer in Europe. The boat leaves early Satur- 
day morning following the last day of school and she is one 
day from port. She can’t change the sailing date of the 
vessel and she is a member of a party who can’t conveniently 
go on any other vessel. 
Case B.—Miss B. ’g mother is to be married the last 
day of school. She is living in a town fifty-odd miles away 
and the marriage is to be at ten in the morning. 
Case C.—Miss C is planning to attend the summer ses-

sion at a University located 1500 miles away. The last day 
of school is Friday and the summer session began the Tuesday 
previous. She will have to pay an extra fee if she is more 
than one week late. By leaving Thursday night she can be 
ready for work without penalty. 
Case D.—Miss D. is a very faithful and popular teacher 
who has never been absent a day in five years. The last day 
of the Christmas vacation she is quarantined at home because 
her younger brother has scarlet fever. The doctor will not 
allow her to go to school. (1) Should A——, B , CO—, 
or D. lose their pay under the rule? Why? (2) If you 
believe the above rule is too drastic, modify it until it meets 
your ideas. (3) If you do not believe that the above rule 
is too drastic, state your reasons. 
10. A teacher of four years’ experience decides to invest 
some money. She goes to her principal for advice. The 
principal sends her to the superintendent. The superinten- 
dent sends her to her banker. She disregards the banker’s 
advice and loses her money. What can and should school 
officers do to increase the financial sense of their associates? 
11. A teacher is indiscreet in her associates. She is re- 
peatedly and kindly advised to avoid getting herself talked 
about by such indiscretion. She feels that it is her business 
and she can do as she pleases with her leisure. She loses 
her position although she is an excellent teacher. Are the 
moral and social standards required of teachers too exacting? 
12, Mr. X- , a high school teacher of one year’s experi- 
ence, desires to become a city school superintendent. He goes 
to the superintendent for advice. The superintendent be- 
lieves in him and offers to aid him in the realization of his 
ambition. What should he do? How far should superin- 
tendents disturb their own organization in order to promote 
the welfare of their teachers? What principle is involved in 
your answer? 
-- 18. A teachers’ institute is called. Some of the teachers 
don’t want to go. They say they get nothing out of it and 
waste both their time and money. How may the institute be 
made worth while to the teachers, or how may the teacher 
be made to feel the worth-whileness of the institute? 
14. At the school board meeting for reélection of teachers 
for the following year, the superintendent read the names of

the teachers recommended. The board entirely ignored the 
superintendent’s recommendations, and proceeded to select 
the teachers already in the system for the following year by 
ballot. As'a result, four of the best teachers were dropped, 
three of whom were men in the high school, including the 
principal, and one was a woman in the grades. It was fur- 
ther discovered that the board was eager to dismiss the super- 
intendent but the latter had a three years’ contract which 
had been issued by the old school board and which had as 
yet not expired. The new board took the matter of breaking 
this contract to a lawyer but the latter informed them that 
it could not be done. The superintendent was indignant over 
the fact that his recommendations were ignored and also be- 
cause the board was trying to dismiss him. Upon a close 
examination regarding the qualifications of the present board 
it was discovered that the president had been a resident for 
less than three months in this village and also that her name 
was not recorded in the assessment list as a tax-payer; also 
that two other members did not own any property in the 
village nor did they pay any taxes. What would you do 
regarding the failure of the board to accept the superinten- 
dent’s recommendations? Regarding the board’s attempt to 
dismiss the superintendent? What step would you take in 
regard to the qualifications of the members of the board? 
To what official would you bring your complaint? Is the 
superintendent subject to any criticism in the matter of 
nominations?

  CHAPTER III 
PROBLEMS IN RECRUITING THE TEACHING PROFESSION 
In Chapter VII, ‘‘Problems in Selecting Teachers,’’ 
various methods of recruiting the teaching staff of 
a local school system are discussed. Therefore, in this 
chapter we shall confine our attention to the necessity 
of recruiting in order to build up the teaching pro- 
fession nationally. 
The shortage of well-trained teachers.—A discussion 
of the present-day shortage of teachers may seem at 
first to be a question of academic interest only. The 
present shortage is not recognized by many laymen 
and the bearing of the past upon the present is not 
clearly seen by others. It is quite evident that the 
Great War is considered to be the sole cause of what- 
ever depletion there may be, and that as soon as ‘‘re- 
construction’? is well under way our supply of teachers 
will be back to normal. 
Such views seem to hold that the pre-war ‘‘normal’’ 
was ideal. This attitude is the result of a lack of 
knowledge of the real situation. There will be no ade- 
quate appreciation of our present and future predica- 
ment until the public comes to realize that a shortage 
of teachers means a shortage of well-trained and 
highly competent teachers. It is easy enough, espe- 
cially with present salary schedules, to get inexperi-

enced, untrained, and poor teachers. <A real problem 
arises when an attempt is made to get a liberal supply 
of well-trained and highly competent teachers despite 
the failure of the public to appreciate and support 
such efforts. 
We require for the important function of voting that 
the voter shall be 21 years of age. Yet we permit not 
less than 170,000 untrained and immature boys and 
girls seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, and twenty years 
of age to train the children who are the citizens of to- 
morrow! These young people have made but little 
investment in time, study, energy, or money in order 
to prepare themselves for teaching. Many of them 
will remain in teaching only three or four years at 
most. No business man would expect to obtain skilled 
services from untrained, inexperienced, and immature 
employees, yet this very thing is being attempted in 
thousands of the nation’s classrooms. Teaching, if it 
is to be skilled and no other kind should be acceptable, 
demands a trained, experienced, and competent teach- 
ing personnel. The product of the public school will 
in many cases continue to be disappointing until our 
children are instructed by teachers properly qualified 
for this important service. Making good citizens is a 
skilled service and cannot be performed by unskilled 
workers. 
Yet, little interest is shown in most states in the 
qualifications of the teachers. In fact, so little inter- 
est is shown in this important question that it is 
impossible in most states to obtain an exact statement 
of the training and qualifications of their present 
teaching personnel.

    84 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
The meager facts available show that for the United 
States as a whole: 
Twenty-five per cent of the rural school teachers 
are less than 21 years of age! 
Thirty-six per cent of the rural school teachers have 
had less than 2 years’ teaching experience! 
Seventy-seven per cent of the rural school teachers 
have had less than 2 years of training beyond the 
eighth grade! 
Fifty-four per cent of all the public school teachers 
in the United States are not normal school graduates! 
This is about 3 out of 5! 
In certain states over 90 per cent of all the teachers 
are not normal school graduates. (Alabama, 90%; 
Arkansas, 92% ; Florida, 99% ; and Mississippi, 96% !) 
The cost of incompetent teachers.—Large numbers of 
children progress less than one grade for each year 
that they are in school. Why? Unskilled, untrained, 
immature, and incompetent teachers are at least one 
important cause of retardation. ‘‘Untrained teachers 
in many districts prevent children from making the 
progress that would be possible under skillful teachers. 
The one-room school is clearly a cause of much retar- 
dation. The recent Rural School Survey of New York 
shows that over 36 per cent of the pupils in one-room 
schools are ‘retarded from one to four years in their 
school progress. Less than 25 per cent of the pupils 
in the graded schools are similarly retarded.’’ Hle- 
mentary school principals and supervisors have long 
observed the ill effects of poor teachers. Statistics 
are not necessary to prove to them that poor teachers 
increase the volume of retardation.
-P-A-G-E-53
PROBLEMS IN RECRUITING THE TEACHING PROFESSION 35 
Retardation means that children ‘‘repeat’’ work that 
they would have covered the first time if it had not 
been for poor teaching or some other cause. Further- 
more, retardation means that we are a nation of sixth 
graders. During the war about half of our soldiers 
had had the equivalent of six years of schooling. The 
census of 1920 shows that 90 per cent of our popula- 
tion of school age are in school up to 12 years of age 
and 81 per cent until 14. This means that approxi- 
mately 90 per cent of our population should finish the 
sixth grade before they leave school, and approxi- 
mately 81 per cent should finish the eighth grade, 
since they are in school until they are 14 years of age. 
But only about half finish the sixth grade and about 
one-third the eighth grade. Can we afford to remain 
a nation of sixth graders? ‘ 
Necessity for recruiting—Every school and school 
system is a potential recruiting station for teachers. 
So, too, is every examination center and every school, 
college, or university whose graduates teach. Teach- 
ers must be recruited, not only for the local schools, 
but also for the profession as a whole. The necessity 
for recruiting is caused by expansion in the enroll- 
ment and in the educational offering on the one hand, 
and, by replacements, for whatever cause, on the other 
hand. Recruiting may be done locally from the in- 
experienced or the experienced. A teacher may leave 
a local school but continue to teach elsewhere. The 
recruiting is then a local problem. But if she leaves 
the profession it becomes not only a local but also 
a state or national problem. The amount of recruit- 
ing necessary naturally varies with every locality.

The annual turnover in some districts may be one 
hundred per cent, while in others it may be zero. 
“Needed: Two hundred thousand trained teachers a 
year!—The public schools of the United States require 
a personnel of about 700,000 teachers. During and 
since the Great War the country has faced many crises, 
—social, industrial, and political. The educational 
crisis, the most serious of all, bids fair to be lost in 
the shuffle. At the heart of the educational crisis is 
the problem of securing and holding an adequate sup- 
ply of competent and highly trained classroom teach- 
ers. Now, certain crises can be averted almost over 
night once the public is thoroughly awakened to the 
dangers. Not so an educational crisis. Good teachers 
are not to be had at a moment’s notice. The supply of 
trained teachers for the rural and elementary school 
has, according to Bagley, ‘‘Never met more than 20 
per cent of the nation’s need.’’ 
The alarming facts concerning the shortage of teach- 
ers was pointed out by Claxton in 1921. He said in 
part: ‘‘To fill both the actual vacancies and the posi- 
tions held by men and women with insufficient prepa- 
ration, we ought to have two hundred thousand turned 
out from the normal training schools every year for 
the next decade. No less an output could provide for 
the annual ‘‘turnover’’ of about one hundred thou- 
sand, and replace the incumbents whose qualifications 
are below the maximum standard. When once we had 
a regularly trained force and could count upon hold- 
ing it—I am presupposing decent-salaries—then we 
should need an annual increment of only fifty thousand 
for many years to come.’’
-P-A-G-E-55
    PROBLEMS IN RECRUITING THE TEACHING PROFESSION 37 
How many beginners are needed each year?—Are the 
above facts exaggerated? We do not believe they are. 
Yet, exact statistics concerning the necessary annual 
recruitments are not available. No one seems to know 
how many beginning teachers are needed each year 
in the United States. This at first seems strange. 
Surely, someone has studied this question and estab- 
lished a method of determining the number needed. 
Why should we attempt to train teachers and yet not 
first establish objectives covering both the quantity 
needed and the qualifications required? Yet, that is 
what has taken place. We train just as many as we 
can, each institution independently attempting to do 
all it possibly can. For over seventy-five years our 
teacher training institutions have done their best. 
Slowly, very slowly indeed, the general level of train- 
ing has been raised. The educational traditions of 
each generation are, we believe, higher than the pre- 
ceding. But how slowly progress has come about! 
Today we need in America a clearly stated objective 
in teacher training and a concerted effort to accom- 
plish the objective in a given time. Each state and 
community should firmly resolve that, say by 1930, 
every teacher will be at least a normal school gradu- 
ate. Having thus stated an objective, every means 
should be used to accomplish it. 
Teachers themselves need to remember that the in- 
tellectual and professional status of the teaching pro- 
fession depends chiefly upon the efforts of its members. 
The legal, medical, engineering, and other professions 
built their own standards. No outside agencies can or 
will assume the responsibility. They may help. So,
-P-A-G-E-56
  38 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
too, classroom teachers and their leaders must assume 
the burden of raising their standards. Raise the 
standards and shut out the incompetent, untrained, 
short termers, and perchers. By making it less and 
less possible to use teaching as a stepping stone, teach- 
ing as a professional career will become better and 
better established. 
We do not know and cannot know how many begin- 
ners are needed each year until we are able to answer 
for each district questions like the following: 
1. How many beginners does the district need 
each year to take the places of those leaving the pro- 
fession and those leaving the locality but not the pro- 
fession? How many are needed to fill new positions 
created because of expansion in the attendance, or 
in the educational offering, or because of increased 
efficiency? 
2. What is the minimum amount of academic and 
professional education the district will accept for each 
of the next ten or twenty years? 
3. What is the capacity of our present training 
schools and how should they be expanded? 
It is hoped that in the near future careful studies in 
the field of teacher training will be made with the 
object of determining the number of beginners needed 
each year. Then, and only then, will we know the ex- 
act size of the recruiting problem. Until that time 
the figures given above, which we believe are conserva- 
tive, may be taken as a guide. 
Causes of the shortage.—The shortage in well trained 
and competent teachers is not new. It has always 
existed. Thomas Fuller in the seventeenth century
-P-A-G-E-57
  PROBLEMS IN RECRUITING THE TEACHING PROFESSION 39 
noted it when he said, ‘‘There is scarce any profes- 
sion in the common-wealth more necessary, which is so 
slightly performed. The reasons whereof I conceive 
to be these: First, young scholars make this calling 
their refuge, yea perchance, before they have taken 
any degree in the university, commence schoolmasters 
in the country. ... Secondly, others who are able, 
use it only as a passage to a better preferment, to 
patch rents in their present fortune, till they can pro- 
vide a new one, and betake themselves to a more gain- 
ful calling. Thirdly, they are disheartened from doing 
their best with the miserable reward which in some 
places they receive.’’ 
The recent Great War merely made the shortage 
seem more acute, because, at a time when the people 
were seeing and feeling the need of education, they 
were confronted with a tremendous shortage in the 
supply of almost any kind of teachers. 
Some of the causes of the persistent shortage are: 
1. The profession is held in low esteem by the youth 
of the land who ape the attitude of their elders in this 
respect. 
2. The public has an old-fashioned notion that he 
who can govern can teach and, therefore, has not been 
willing to pay the price to attract well trained teachers. 
8. The tenure is too uncertain. 
4. Other trades are more attractive. 
5. The remarkable growth in enrollment has out- 
run the ability of the training schools to supply a suffi- 
cient number of well trained and competent teachers. 
6. Marriage is more alluring for women than teach- 
ing. (Who would have it otherwise?)
-P-A-G-E-58

7. Public service in America is poorly esteemed and 
often the butt of machine politics. 
The New York Tribune in May, 1921, reported an 
investigation which the United States Bureau of Hdu- 
cation made among the employees of the Federal War 
Risk Insurance Bureau. Two hundred seventy-two of 
these who were former school teachers were asked to 
indicate whether or not they intended to re-enter the 
teaching profession and to state their reasons. Nine 
per cent admitted intention of teaching again; forty 
per cent had hopes of escaping; fifty per cent said they 
would not return. ‘‘To all who remember the esteem 
in which teachers were once held in American life, and 
who realize the narrow existence of a government em- 
ployee, this preference will come as a shock.’’ These 
teachers were all graduates of standard normal schools 
or their equivalent. A considerable number had even 
better training. The advance in teachers’ salaries in 
1921 did not lure them back. Their grievances were: 
(1) low salary; (2) nerve strain; (3) many confer- 
ences and meetings requiring outside work with little 
time for self-improvement or social life; (4) politics 
and favoritism; (5) less consideration given to teach- 
ers by boards of education than is given to employees 
in any other work; and (6) a tendency to despise 
teachers. ‘‘Conditions that still weigh heavily in the 
minds of government clerks must be even more pow- 
erful deterrents to the many who left teaching for 
business life.’’ 
How to make teaching more attractive—The writer 
recently asked a group of fifty graduate students in 
education to state how, in their opinions, teaching
-P-A-G-E-59
  PROBLEMS IN RECRUITING THE TEACHING PROFESSION 41 
might be made more attractive. Among the answers 
given were the following: OAD 
10. 
Ly. 
12. . Require higher health and physical qualifica- 
tions. 
. Raise the minimum entrance age to at least 20 
or 21. 
Secure higher type of teachers by deliberately 
selecting teachers of higher mentality. 
. Refuse to hire those who are using teaching as 
a stepping stone or perch. 
. Raise the standard and require uniform national 
certificates. 
. Raise the beginning and the ultimate salary. 
Guarantee protection against old age. 
Guarantee tenure within reasonable limits. 
Establish systematic vocational guidance for 
prospective teachers in order to attract the most 
capable. 
Require a longer probation, or trial period, in 
order to weed out the unfit and temporary em- 
ployees. 
Advertise the desirable and attractive features 
of school work in order to build up in the 
minds of high school and college students an 
appreciation of life-career opportunities in 
education. 
Give others a better impression of the profes- 
sion by boosting it constantly yourself. Too 
many teachers knock their profession. Out- 
siders will not think more highly of it than 
those who are in it. In other words, have more 
faith in, and respect for your own profession.

13. Offer maintenance scholarship in training 
schools for those who are decidedly superior but 
otherwise cannot afford to attend. 
The Outlook for November 24, 1920, in an article 
entitled ‘‘The Crumbling Second Line of Defense’’ 
offers ten remedies for the shortage of teachers: (1) 
increase of salary; (2) freedom of schools from the 
influence of politics; (3) assistance to teachers in find- 
ing attractive homes; (4) consolidation of schools; (5) 
amore regular attendance of pupils through the opera- 
tion of compulsory laws; (6) more democracy in the 
school; (7) competent superintendents and principals; 
(8) a reasonable teaching load; (9) a higher prestige 
for the teacher; and (10) an adequate pension system. 
Many of these problems are discussed more in detail 
in subsequent chapters of this book. The following 
suggestions have been made particularly with refer- 
ence to recruiting normal school students. 
How to recruit normal school students.—Morgan, in 
1920, summarized various suggestions for increasing 
the attendance at normal schools. Twenty sugges- 
tions ranked by 62 administrative officers of normal 
schools follow in their order of importance: 
Assist in convincing the public that the country will 
go to ruin without competent teachers and that to get 
good teachers they must be well paid, satisfactorily 
housed, and properly respected. 
Secure salaries for faculty members sufficiently 
large to get a better faculty than colleges and uni- 
versities. 
Throw a heavy burden on county, city, and 
town superintendents by making them see that if  
-P-A-G-E-61
  PROBLEMS IN RECRUITING THE TEACHING PROFESSION 43 
they are to get trained teachers from normal schools 
they must send high-school graduates to the normal 
schools. : 
Secure larger appropriations for buildings, equip- 
ment and library. 
Establish a four year curriculum leading to a 
bachelor’s degree, to train high-school teachers and at 
least a two or three year curriculum leading to a 
diploma to train grade teachers. 
Secure a faculty in which at least one-third of its 
members are good public speakers and are prepared 
to appeal to all of the interests which patronize the 
school. 
Make all courses for high-school graduates of col- 
lege grade and emphasize on graduation the longer 
curriculums. 
Seek a certificating law that will compel men and 
women who teach to attend normal schools and like- 
wise to graduate if they are to teach more than two 
or three years. 
Seek a certificating law that will give proper reward 
for and proper distinction between teachers with vari- 
ous amounts of professional training. 
Secure men for at least one-half of the faculty. 
Secure at least one specialist on the faculty whose 
principal duty shall be the encouragement and direc- 
tion of the social life of the student body. 
Secure just recognition by universities and colleges 
for all work offered by normal schools. 
All normal schools should be reorganized as teach- 
ers’ colleges and made codrdinate with other colleges 
in the state university but located as at present
-P-A-G-E-62
  44 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
throughout the state and not alone on the university 
campus, 
Very definite forms of extension work should be 
established throughout the normal school district for 
which credit may be given as a start towards a normal 
school diploma. 
Secure large appropriations by the National Gov- 
ernment for teacher training. 
Secure a coach or physical director and pay him 
as much as any other head of a department with stress 
on athletics. Insist on a good gymnasium. 
Offer as large election as possible by establishing 
many different curriculums rather than a large elec- 
tion in one very general curriculum. 
Give the name ‘‘Teachers’ College’’ to the normal 
school and install at least one strong four year 
curriculum. 
Establish a kind of first aid or supervisory depart- 
ment to help former graduates and students out of 
their difficulties when they secure positions and begin 
teaching for the first time. 
Have one member of the faculty with a rank of 
professor who shall have as his main duty the stimu- 
lation and direction of all forms of public speaking 
within the school and such contests of this sort, as 
may seem advisable, with other schools. 
Besides the twenty suggestions above stated, others 
were added to the list by various normal school presi- 
dents. Some of these are: 
Have representatives of the faculty visit high 
schools in the district and discuss with members of  
-P-A-G-E-63
    PROBLEMS IN RECRUITING THE TEACHING PROFESSION 45 
senior classes the advantages of normal school attend- 
ance. 
Send attractive illustrated catalogs and other 
printed material to prospective students. 
Urge students already enrolled to hand in names of 
prospective students; send literature to, and write 
letters to all prospective students whose names have 
been submitted. 
Conduct a vigorous salary campaign in the entire 
state. 
Advertise in papers of the district, setting forth the 
advantages of normal school attendance. 
The fundamental thing right now is adequate sal- 
aries—respectable salaries. 
Make attendance at normal school a first requisite to 
certification. The standards should be as high as in 
medicine. 
Secure a faculty in close sympathy with students 
and community and able to make them feel this. 
Establish dormitory or similar housing system to 
provide for comfort and social advantages of students. 
Establish subsidies for teachers in training. 
Secure better salaries and prospects for advance- 
ment and social standing. 
Secure the passage of a law compelling all boards 
to employ teachers with not less than two years’ train- 
ing above high school. 
Recruiting through vocational guidance-—Undoubt- 
edly there is much misinformation abroad in the land 
about teaching. So imperative is the need of dissi- 
pating this misinformation and of recruiting the best
-P-A-G-E-64
  46 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
prospects, that courses in vocational guidance in high 
schools and colleges should be established and when 
established should include specific information of a 
positive and constructive character concerning educa- 
tion. The faculties of the 14,000 high schools and 500 
normal schools, colleges, and universities in the United 
States can and should exert a greater influence by such 
means as the following: 
Seek personal interviews with selected pupils and 
their parents. 
Have frequent talks to the student body on the 
pleasant and favorable side of teaching. 
Collect data concerning the wages and training of 
teachers and submit the same to pupils. 
Promote ideals of public service and show how 
teaching ranks well with other forms of public service. 
Emphasize the personal satisfaction that comes 
through service. 
Emphasize the lives and accomplishments of great 
outstanding personages in education past and present. 
Portray the different levels in education and show 
how easy it is to advance from one level to another. 
Give students an idea of the body of rapidly grow- 
ing scientific knowledge in the field of education. 
Give them a vision of the unsolved problems ahead 
that challenge their interest. 
Give a course on public education as a career, em- 
phasizing all of the points given above and others that 
occur to you. 
Above all, by conduct show that teaching is a real 
profession worthy of the services of the best men and 
women in the country.
-P-A-G-E-65
  PROBLEMS IN RECRUITING THE TEACHING PROFESSION 47 
Recruiting and salaries—There is some evidence to 
support the statement that high standards make high 
salaries and high salaries keep the ranks filled. It is 
true in other vocations and there is no reason why the 
same economic principle should not apply in education. 
At least, all teachers hope and believe in this principle. 
In order to recruit and hold competent and desirable 
people as teachers, five principles must, in the opinion 
of the Salary Committee of the National Education 
Association, be observed in formulating salary sched- 
ules. 
“Salary schedules should establish minimum sal- 
aries that will provide a desirable standard of living.’’ 
The minimum should be high enough to attract the best 
equipped young people. 
“Salary schedules should assure a reasonable rate 
of progress from the established minimum salary to 
the maximum provided in the schedule.’’? It is sug- 
gested that annual increase should be approximately 
ten per cent. 
“The maximum salaries provided in salary sched- 
ules should be such as to promise a career in teach- 
ing.’”? By making the maximum high enough ambitious 
and capable young men and women will look upon 
teaching as a career and teaching will be removed from 
the ‘‘stepping stone’’ class of occupations. : 
“Salary schedules should provide for flexibility i in 
their operation.’’? This, it is argued, is necessary in 
order for a school system to hold its best and most 
valuable teachers who, if held to the dead level of a 
schedule, will be tempted to leave in search of a 
superior wage elsewhere. Hxtra merit deserves extra
-P-A-G-E-66
  48 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
recognition. This principle is theoretically sound but 
its application calls for extraordinary skill. 
“Salary schedules should be adjusted to cost of 
living and to living conditions.’? In other words, each 
locality has its own problems and each economic period 
of depression or expansion involves changes in maxima 
and minima. No one knows what the future will bring 
forth. 
All of these and many other related problems are 
discussed more fully in Chapter XIV, ‘‘Factors De- 
termining the Salaries of Teachers,’’? to which the 
reader is referred as space does not permit the repe- 
tition of the discussion at this point. 
Smith thinks that the teaching personnel is com- 
posed of ‘‘too many floaters who invest little idealism 
in their work and get little inspiration from it. As 
long as teaching is allowed to be exploited by women 
to decorate the portals of matrimony with superfluous 
finery and by men to tide over a period of vocational 
indecision or to get ready cash with which to pay for 
a more respectable professional education, it will be 
difficult for teachers to convince a lethargic public of 
their professional zeal and community interest... . 
So long as a large majority of women begin teaching 
with the idea of temporary service, the personnel of 
elementary teaching must remain fluctuating and peri- 
patetic. .. . So long as any drifting youth or unset- 
tled maid with a little education is allowed to teach, 
and so long as initial salaries are comparatively high 
and increases for experience and advanced training 
are slight, the instability of the teaching personnel 
will continue.’’
-P-A-G-E-67
    PROBLEMS IN RECRUITING THE TEACHING PROFESSION 49 
Main points of the chapter.—1. An adequate apprecia- 
tion of the problem of recruiting the teaching profes- 
sion in the United States depends upon the public’s 
realizing that a shortage of teachers means a shortage 
of well-trained and highly competent teachers. 
2. Very little interest is shown, on the part of the 
public, in the qualifications of teachers and it is im- 
possible to obtain exact figures describing the training 
and qualifications of the teaching personnel. 
3. Incompetent teachers are a poor investment. 
They increase the amount of retardation and assist 
in causing the nation to remain a nation of sixth 
graders. . 
4. Recruiting teachers is both a local and national 
problem of the first magnitude. 
5. It is estimated that 200,000 teachers are needed 
a year for ten years. 
6. However, more careful statistics should be com- 
piled covering the national needs. Definite objectives 
should be established in teacher training covering both 
the quantity and quality of teachers needed. 
7. The shortage in well-trained and competent 
teachers is caused by a great many factors, chief 
among which are the low political and economic status 
of teaching established by tradition and public 
indifference. 
8. Systematic attention should be given to ways 
and means of making teaching as a profession more 
attractive. 
9. Positive common sense methods should be used 
in recruiting students for normal schools and teachers’ 
colleges. 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
    
50 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
10. Vocational guidance courses in high schools and 
colleges should be established to tell the truth about 
the advantages of public school teaching and to attract 
the best graduates. 
11. High standards tend to make high salaries and 
high salaries keep the ranks filled. 
PROBLEMS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
During the last fifteen years the writer has almost daily 
been asked to counsel with prospective or beginning teachers 
concerning opportunities in education. The following prob- 
lems are offered as examples of opportunities for personnel 
guidance. 
1. Miss S. , a few days ago, came into the office and, 
after stating that she was about to graduate from high school, 
asked for an application blank and applied for a position. 
She stated that she was 19 years old. When asked how 
long she expected to teach she said: ‘‘Only as long as I have 
to.’’ She then complained that she thought she would like 
to teach and was sure that she could do so successfully. 
However, she had heard a great many stories about boards 
of education, superintendents of schools, principals, and 
supervisors which had led her to believe that the classroom 
teacher was only a cog in the machine. She, therefore, said 
she did not expect to stay in the teaching field any longer 
than she had to. She hoped to go on to college if she did 
not marry and then go into secretarial or social work. She 
did not see very much in classroom teaching as a profession. 
She needed counsel. What should the superintendent do 
and say? 
2. Miss R——, a clerk in a down-town office, applies for 
a position as a teacher. The superintendent learns that she 
is only a high-school graduate, 22 years old, with seven 
months’ business college training. He is very well impressed 
with her personality, intelligence, and character and advises 
her to attend normal school. She says she would like to go 
if she could possibly find a way. The superintendent feels 
that she will make an excellent teacher. What suggestions  
-P-A-G-E-69
PROBLEMS IN RECRUITING THE TEACHING PROFESSION 51 
might he make and what might he do to recruit so desirable 
a person to the profession? 
3. The high school principal receives a letter from the 
State Superintendent asking him to prepare a special address 
urging the best of the young men and women in high school 
to prepare for teaching. The principal decides to do so. 
What should he say? 
4. Mr. B is about to graduate from college. He is a 
fine young man with excellent abilities, but he doesn’t see 
anything for him in the educational field. His father comes 
to the superintendent and states that he is sure the boy’s 
nature will ultimately find its greatest satisfaction in public 
service. He wants him to try education. The superinten- 
dent grants the interview. What should he say to, and da 
for the young man? 
5. You are asked to write a letter to high school boys 
and girls urging upon them the value of considering teach- 
ing as a life career. What would you write? 
6. The superintendent feels that it would be timely to 
address his teaching staff on the subject of ‘‘Opportunities 
for Advancement in Education.’’ What should he say? 
7. A grade-school teacher has ambitions to become a prin- 
cipal. Outline a course of reading and visitation that will 
assist her while still a teacher to gain a knowledge of the 
duties and responsibilities of the office of principalship. 
8. A parent wants you to advise her daughter or son con- 
cerning education as a career. You are invited to dinner. 
What would you say to the family? 
9. The high-school principal decides to encourage boys and 
girls to enter the normal school. He feels that he must appeal 
to them both professionally and financially. Gather figures 
for him showing that it pays one to be well prepared for 
teaching. 
10. Compare teaching with other trades and professions 
open to women. 
11. Collect a list of references on teaching as a profession 
that would be suitable to use in high-school classes. 
12. Compare the position of the classroom teacher in the 
elementary schools of the United States in 1914 with the 
position in 1924. In what respects is the profession gaining 
or losing?

  CHAPTER IV 
PERSONNEL PROBLEMS IN TEACHER-TRAINING 
Importance of training——Many personnel problems 
in education have to do with the initial and the subse- 
quent training of teachers. Questions like the follow- 
ing are continually arising. How much initial training 
does a given position, or teacher-in-her-work unit, re- 
quire? What kind of training, that is, how much broad 
general knowledge, special knowledge, and profes- 
sional knowledge, should be required for entrance to 
a given position? Where should such training and 
knowledge be received? How much subsequent train- 
ing in service does the position warrant? Should 
training in service be required of all teachers regard- 
less of the amount and character of their initial train- 
ing? How shall such training be organized and 
administered? What kinds and types of training in 
service are most effective? 
The professional standards that should be required 
of a teacher for entrance to a school system and prob- 
lems that arise in establishing and maintaining such 
standards will be discussed in this chapter, reserving 
to Chapter V the discussion of problems that arise 
in training teachers in service. — 
~ Three ways of learning to teachThere are three 
ways of learning to teach. One may learn many things 
53 oF

  54 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
about teaching in a normal school or teachers’ college. 
Such institutions are vocational schools specifically 
designed to teach teachers to teach. In teacher-train- 
ing institutions, candidates learn something of method 
and subject matter combined with more or less obser- 
vation and practice teaching. Learning to teach by 
this method is somewhat theoretical and incomplete 
but, nevertheless, fairly successful. 
In the second place, one may learn to teach by 
teaching. Thousands of teachers have learned all they 
know about teaching by getting a position and prac- 
ticing at the expense of the public and, especially, at 
the expense of the children. In fact, more than half 
of our public school teachers today have not been 
graduated from a normal school and thousands have 
never even attended. 
The third method of learning to teach may be called 
the work-study or study-work method. It is a com- 
bination of the first and second methods. Learning 
to do is combined with learning by doing. Wherever 
possible, normal schools and teachers’ colleges attempt 
to train teachers by this method. All progressive and 
growing teachers use this method of learning. They 
teach and at the time study ways and materials of 
instruction. 
No one method alone turns out a finished product. 
Learning to teach is an endless art and science. When 
one graduates from a normal school one is, indeed, just 
eommencing. ‘Trial-and-error learning on the job is 
painful and inefficient both from the teacher’s view- 
point and from the viewpoint of the children. Further- 
more, ‘‘teaching is a calling which demands continual
-P-A-G-E-73
  PERSONNEL PROBLEMS IN TEACHER-TRAINING 55 
growth on the part of those engaged in it. The ad- 
vance of our schools is so rapid that teachers who do 
not continue to increase their capacity for service in 
time cease to be of large usefulness to the system. To 
insure this continual growth calls for continual per- 
sonal training, and not only should a certain amount 
of such training be expected of and required of teach- 
ers, but certain definite premiums should be placed on 
the efforts of teachers who voluntarily do more than 
is required. 
“Personal growth, outside of that connected with 
the mere technique of instruction, seems to be exceed- 
ingly painful to the ordinary teacher. The normal- 
school graduate, who might be expected to have a 
desire to continue study, often feels that her entire 
preparation has been made. In school systems where 
the home-product idea of appointment prevails, it is 
often hard to induce teachers to undertake independent 
reading or study. Yet the remarkably rapid progress 
of educational theory and practice in this country 
cannot but mean that those who will not keep growing 
soon become relatively inefficient public servants.’’ 1 
Typical problem.—Recently the writer’s attention 
was called to a personnel problem that arose in a 
neighboring city that illustrates some of the difficulties 
confronting school officers of today who attempt to 
raise the standard of preparation required of all teach- 
ers in the system over which they preside. 
M—. is a city employing 42 elementary and 18 high 
school teachers. The new superintendent found 12 
of the elementary school teachers who in 10 to 20 years 
a *Cubberley, E. P. Public School Administration, pp. 231-2.
-P-A-G-E-74
  
  56 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
of experience in that city had done practically nothing 
to improve their academic and professional qualifica- 
tions. These teachers were among the highest paid 
elementary teachers in the system. They were home 
talent with average to good abilities. They had city 
certificates granted years ago when academic and pro- 
fessional standards were low and most of them had 
few credits beyond high school. The city certificates 
were renewed each year by examination or by securing 
two credits by correspondence from one of the state 
normal schools. 
The other elementary school teachers were more re- 
cently recruited and were normal school graduates or 
better. They complained that their salaries were 
lower, although they had been away to school and 
spent considerable time and money in securing their 
training. There was a danger of a division in the 
teaching staff over this situation. Long experience 
was rewarded. Long training was unrewarded. 
After studying the situation for a year, the super- 
intendent made the following suggestions to the board. 
He suggested (1) that all persons with 2 years of 
training beyond high school who have attended sum- 
mer school 2 out of 3 years including the current year, 
should be given an increase; (2) those who did not 
have a life certificate and who had not attended sum- 
mer school during the past three years should be 
required to do so this year with no increase in salary. 
The board adopted the suggestions but changed the 
words ‘‘required to attend’’ to ‘‘requested to attend.’’ 
Five of the twelve elementary teachers did not comply 
with the request. Were the superintendent’s sugges-
-P-A-G-E-75
  PERSONNEL PROBLEMS IN TEACHER-TRAINING 57 
tions the ones that should have been made under the 
circumstances? Should the five teachers have been 
dropped? Should they have been reémployed? If so, 
on what terms and conditions? 
Amount of initial training—lHEvery teacher needs 
(1) a broad general knowledge and culture; (2) an 
intensive special knowledge of at least one (prefer- 
ably two or three) fields of subject matter, and (3) 
sufficient professional knowledge to make her an at- 
tractive and effective teacher. Above all ‘‘The great 
thing about a teacher of youth is not at all how much 
he knows of the science of education, the laws of learn- 
ing, the administration of a school, or of the particular 
subject which he teaches. These are important, of 
course. But the most important thing is his radia- 
tive power as an illuminant along the high ways which 
his pupils have to travel. One could weep, one must 
weep, to observe how, in place of this, something 
manufactured is substituted. . . . Operations in nor- 
mal schools or teachers’ colleges will not change the 
species to which a person belongs—and the grave 
and overshadowing consideration about a teacher is 
whether he or she belongs to the teaching species, or 
is only trying to imitate the habits of that species and 
thereby draw a salary.’’? 
raining will not change the native capacity of a 
teacher, but it will stimulate and teach her to use all 
of her capacities to the fullest degree. The amount 
of required initial training should be as much as it is 
possible to demand. It can scarcely be too much. 
Each school system should set up a standard minimum 
?Yeomans, Edward. Shackled Youth, pp. 26-28.
-P-A-G-E-76
  58 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
requirement for all new teachers. The incoming teach- 
ers should be purposely selected in order to leaven the 
teaching staff. The constant introduction of such a 
stream of new teachers brings new ideas, new vigor, 
new enthusiasms, new vision, and new standards of 
educational and professional preparation to those al- 
ready in the system. 
Setting a goal—It is a good policy first to survey 
the training and preparation of the present teaching 
corps in a given school system. Then compare the 
local situation with that prevailing in ten or twenty 
adjacent systems of approximately the same size and 
wealth. Next, figure out a goal to be reached in, say, 
five years. Finally have the board of education adopt 
this objective as a working policy. After the estab- 
lishment of a policy the personnel problems can be 
dealt with as they arise. Always be fair and consider- 
ate of those who have served the schools long and 
faithfully. Do not be unreasonable in requiring them 
immediately to adjust themselves to new academic and 
professional standards. Give them time to meet the 
new demands, and provide them with every possible 
help in doing so. 
A reasonably minimum standard for teachers in 
kindergarten and grades one to six, whether in rural, 
village, town, or city schools, the same to be obtained 
within five to ten years from the date of adoption, 
would be graduation from a two-year normal school 
course after graduation from a four-year high school. 
This standard is already adopted in many cities and 
partially if not completely attained. Graduation from
-P-A-G-E-77
  PERSONNEL PROBLEMS IN TEACHER-TRAINING 59 
a four-year normal school or teachers’ college course 
would be still better and is now the goal in a few cities. 
In time, the cry may be ‘‘every teacher at least a col- 
lege graduate.’’ The standard for high school teach- 
ing is already graduation from college. Often from 
one-half to one full year of graduate work is also re- 
quired of high school teachers. The rapid growth of 
junior high schools is resulting in the gradual intro- 
duction of college trained teachers in the seventh and 
eighth grades. 
How much training do teachers now have?—Burgess 
reported the results of a careful inquiry into the 
amount of academic training of teachers in 14 states 
for the year 1918. The data are presented in Table I. 
Massachusetts leads the list with 17.5 per cent of her 
teachers college graduates and: 67.7 per cent normal 
school graduates. Five eastern states (in order, 
Mass., R. I., N. J., Conn., and N. H.,) make by far the 
best records. Then follow five western and north 
central states. The two Virginias with North Dakota 
and Kansas are in the bottom positions. The per cent 
of college graduates runs from 21.3 in New Hamp- 
shire to 7.5 in Virginia. The range of the normal 
school figures is from 70 per cent in Rhode Island to 
12 per cent in Kansas. 
These figures are for the year 1918. The figures 
in the middle column of Table II are for the year 
1922-23. In Table II the figures for the 14 states for 
1922 are compared with those of 1918. Has four years 
increased or decreased the per cent of normal gradu- 
ates?

Some one may ask ‘‘how reliable are these data?’’ 
Surely Connecticut did not increase 18 per cent and 
West Virginia lose 12 per cent in four years! Per- 
haps different methods of reporting, collecting, and 
tabulating these data account for the difference. If 
so, it is very evident that a uniform, permanent, and 
continuous census of teachers and their qualifications 
should be compiled for each state each year.

A unit for measuring the amount of training.—It 
is highly desirable to have a single index number by 
which to express the amount of teacher preparation in 
a city or state. Burgess* suggests the following 
method of computing an index number for this pur- 
pose. Use the average number of years per teacher 
of complete training beyond high school—the average 
may be obtained by multiplying the number of college 
graduates by four and the number of normal school 
graduates by two, and then dividing the sum of these 
two products by the total number of teachers. The 
column at the right in Table I gives the index number 
for the 14 states covered in Burgess’ study. Super-- 
intendents will find this method valuable in measuring

the amount of progress made in teacher preparation 
from year to year in the school system over which

For example, the school system of Rockford, Illi-

    PERSONNEL PROBLEMS IN TEACHER-TRAINING 63 
The 454 teachers had to their credit a total of 1005 
years of training, making an average for each teacher, 
(i.e., the Rockford teacher preparation index) of 2.21 + 
years of training. By comparing the training of the 
teaching staff of Rockford today with the index of 
1921, the amount of progress may be determined and 
expressed conveniently in a single number. When 
similar figures are computed for many school systems 
over an extended period of years a more accurate idea 
may be attained of the amount of progress being made 
in increasing the preparation of teachers from year to 
year and in different parts of the country. 
Again, it may be desirable to compute the index of 
preparation separately for different groups of teach- 
ers. The following are typical:

Training schools for teachers.—Trained teachers are 
scarce simply because training schools are inade- 
quately supported. The first state normal school in 
America, Lexington, Massachusetts, was not opened 
until 1839. Only 10 states established public normal 
schools before 1860. Massachusetts alone established 
more than one school before 1860. Five states (Ohio, 
1900; Kentucky, 1906; Alabama, 1907; Tennessee, 
1909; Mississippi, 1910); established their first state 
normal schools in the twentieth century. In fact, we 
owe the present level of academic training possessed 
by teachers largely to the rapid growth of high-school 
education during the last twenty-five years. 
Training schools for teachers now embrace a great
-P-A-G-E-83
PERSONNEL PROBLEMS IN TEACHER-TRAINING 65 
variety of institutions, among which are the follow- 
ing: state normal schools and teachers’ colleges, pri- 
vate normal schools and teachers’ colleges, city train- 
ing schools and colleges, educational departments in 
colleges and universities, county normal schools, and 
high-school teacher training departments. In addi- 
tion to the above the following agencies are more or 
less effective in stimulating teachers to further study: 
Teachers’ continuation (extension and correspond- 
ence courses, teachers’ institutes, teachers’ associa- 
tions and meetings, teachers’ reading circles, the cer- 
tification requirements and the recognition of training 
in salary schedules. 
General versus special training.—Not only is there an 
alarming shortage of trained teachers but also there 
is considerable criticism of existing methods of train- 
ing teachers. Division of labor has taken place in 
teaching as in other fields of work. The teacher has 
become a specialist. Opportunities in teaching have 
increased in number and kind. Teachers themselves 
differ in capacities and interests. Not every teacher 
is suited to teach in the kindergarten or first grade, 
the junior high school or senior high school. The 
public school of today is by no means the simple insti- 
tution of fifty or even twenty-five years ago. In those 
days a room teacher taught everything and in almost 
any grade. General training was all that was neces- 
sary. The general teacher, that is, the teacher of all 
grades and subjects is being supplanted by the 
specialist. 
The new conception of the worker-in-his-work unit 
or, in educational terms, the teacher-in-her-work unit
-P-A-G-E-84
  66 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
was unheard of a decade ago. Job analysis and job 
specifications are yet little known terms in teacher 
training institutions. New teaching positions are 
being constantly created for which no special institu- 
tional training has been provided. Demand is, the 
forerunner of supply in education as in other occupa- 
tions. It is difficult if not impossible to get just the 
right teacher for a given position. All this emphasizes 
the need of specific training courses based upon accu- 
rate job analysis in education. Teachers must be 
trained in accordance with their best capacities and 
best interests. They should no longer be trained to 
teach anything anywhere. 
Specific training for specific tasks.—The general prin- 
ciple of specific training for specific types of teaching 
service has already been recognized both in theory and 
in practice. Present practice distinguishes rather 
sharply between the preparation of high-school teach- 
ers and the preparation of elementary teachers. It 
also distinguishes to some extent among the subjects 
or subject groups in the preparation of high-school 
teachers. In the preparation of elementary teachers, 
specific training is usually provided for kindergarten, 
primary work, and the so-called ‘‘special subjects’’— 
agriculture, drawing, household arts, industrial arts, 
music, and physical education. In a growing number 
of instances specific training is being offered for rural 
school teachers. 
However, the principle of specific training for spe- 
cific types of teaching has not been applied to any 
great extent beyond the first and second grades and 
practically not at all for administrative and super-
-P-A-G-E-85
  PERSONNEL PROBLEMS IN TEACHER-TRAINING 67 
visory positions. In a few instances feeble attempts 
have been made to prepare junior high school teachers. 
But for the most part the middle and upper grades 
still form a single field. 
“Tf present practice correctly reflects underlying 
theory, it is apparently believed that the professional 
preparation of all candidates for elementary teaching 
beyond the primary grades is adequately accomplished 
by a single undifferentiated curriculum. This point 
of view has undoubtedly been determined largely by 
factors that are primarily administrative in their 
character. The immature and inexperienced teachers 
entering graded school systems have been assigned 
first to the middle grades, particularly to the third and 
fourth. Those who are successful here, and who re- 
main in the system, have been fairly certain of ‘‘pro- 
motion’? to the first grade or to the upper grades. The 
specialization of preparation for primary work has 
modified this situation in some measure, although 
teachers who have not had this specialized preparation 
are still frequently transferred from the intermediate 
to the primary grades. In general, however, the mid- 
dle grades have come to be looked upon as the training 
ground of the novice, and in consequence any proposal 
to differentiate as between intermediate grade teach- 
ers and upper grade teachers in the construction of 
normal school curricula runs sharply counter to an 
administrative practice that has developed to a point 
where it is virtually taken for granted.’’® 
Why longer training for high-school teachers?—Is

high-school teaching more ‘‘advanced’’? Do not un- 
trained teachers in the grades waste the child’s time? 
Would not more highly trained teachers in the grades 
more fully develop the interest and capacities of 
school children? May it not be justly contended that 
there is no longer any teaching position in the public 
schools for which advanced preparation is not neces- 
sary? Surely it is erroneous to assume that only high 
school teachers need such preparation. 
Tradition alone is responsible for the false distine- 
tion between the amount of training required for ele- 
mentary and high-school teachers. Enlightened 
democracy demands the well-trained teachers in the 
grades below the high school. The new conception is 
twelve years of public education in which distinctions 
of training, experience, and salary among teaching 
positions disappear. ‘‘Proper training for teaching 
the third grade should be as prolonged and as serious 
as training for teaching the tenth or twelfth grades, 
and should be equally well rewarded. To pass child- 
hood through a graded quality of instruction in order 
finally to place those who survive in charge of real 
teachers only at the top is a blunder that explains 
more of the dire results noticeable in our schools than 
we dare acknowledge.’’ ® 
Main points of the chapter—1. Many personnel prob- 
lems in education have to do with the initial and sub- 
sequent training of teachers. 
2. There are three ways of learning to teach: (1) 
in school, (2) on the job, and (3) by combining work 
and study. 
*Learned, W. S. and Bagley, W. D. Ibid., p. 9.
-P-A-G-E-87
  PERSONNEL PROBLEMS IN TEACHER-TRAINING 69 
8. Teaching is a calling which demands continual 
growth on the part of those engaged in it. 
4, Every teacher needs broad general knowledge, 
special knowledge, and professional knowledge. 
5. A goal should be adopted by every board of edu- 
cation raising the initial training requirements for new 
teachers. 
6. Every teacher in grades one to six should be re- 
quired to be a graduate from a normal school; ulti- 
mately she should possess the same qualifications as 
those required by high-school teachers. 
7. According to Burgess, Massachusetts ranks first 
and Kansas last with respect to the percentage of col- 
lege and normal-school trained teachers. 
8. A uniform, permanent, and continuous census 
of teachers and their qualifications should be compiled 
for each state each year. 
9. In the training of teachers greater attention 
should be given to specific training for specific types 
of teaching. 
10. There is no longer any teaching position in our 
public schools for which advanced preparation may be 
justly and profitably denied in favor of any other. 
PROBLEMS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
1. Outline a policy for adoption by a board of education 
raising the qualifications for teachers during the next decade. 
2. What reasons can you enumerate for and against equal 
training for grade and high-school teachers? 
8. Why should higher academic training be required today 
than twenty-five years ago? 
4. Read and study the article by Burgess (see bibliog-

raphy) and compute the teacher training index for a nearby 
city. 
5. Enumerate the arguments for and against specific train- 
ing for specific teaching in grades one to six. 
6. Should a teacher’s certificate designate the subjects or 
grades in which the holder is qualified to teach? Why? 
7. How long should a teacher continue to teach the same 
grade? Why? 
8. To what extent is professional knowledge and skill an 
asset in teaching? 
9. Normal-school graduates frequently complain that many 
required subjects in their training course are not practical. 
What do they mean by practical? Is there any justice in 
their claim? 
10. Which is most over-rated in measuring the success of 
a teacher, experience or training? Why? 
11. Give five reasons why every teacher should be a scholar. 
12. To what extent in your own case is the following state- 
ment true? ‘‘A teacher teaches as she is taught rather than 
as she is taught to teach.”’ 
13. A stubborn board member argues that ‘‘teachers are 
born and not made.’’ Prepare an answer to this statement 
defending the training of teachers and the proper payment 
of trained teachers. 
14. Make a scale enumerating five things that an ‘‘A’’ 
teacher does; 5 things that a ‘‘B’’ teacher does; 5 things 
that a ‘‘C’’ teacher does. 
15. What is meant by ‘‘accurate job analysis’’? Show its 
importance in the training of teachers. 
16. Are normal school graduates ‘‘finished teachers’’ when 
they begin to teach? Why? 
17. Other things being equal, which would you hire for a 
given position: an experienced but untrained teacher, or an 
inexperienced but highly trained teacher? Why? 
18. Miss Smith says: ‘‘I owe my skill as a teacher to the 
patient, loving supervision which I received after graduating 
from normal school.’? To what extent is Miss Smith’s ex- 
perience typical?

  CHAPTER V 
PROBLEMS IN TRAINING TEACHERS IN SERVICE 
Problem.—The Teacher’s Club of H——., Texas, at 
its regular meeting appointed a committee ‘‘to investi- 
gate and to report at some future meeting of the club 
what other cities were doing in the way of paying 
teachers an extra premium or bonus for attendance at 
summer schools, and for university extension and 
correspondence courses.’? Four months later the 
committee brought in a report which read in substance 
as follows: 
We find that various plans of granting credit have 
been adopted by school boards as a means of encour- 
aging professional improvement among _ teachers. 
Some boards recognize leaves of absence for study or 
travel. A few permit sabbatical leaves either with or 
without pay. Others pay teachers extra who attend 
summer schools, or who take extension and corre- 
spondence courses. Still others recognize travel; 
reading of professional magazines and books; attend- 
ing lectures, concerts, professional gatherings, teach- 
ers’ institutes, and the development of some worth 
while educational project. 
Extra pay for school attendance.—One of the most 
frequently used means of stimulating teachers to fur- 
ther growth is to offer extra pay for school attendance. 
72
-P-A-G-E-91
  PROBLEMS IN TRAINING TEACHERS IN SERVICE 73 
In a few instances expenses are partially paid, but 
usually either a cash bonus is granted or a certain 
amount is added to the person’s salary. In a few 
places a person is moved forward on the salary sched- 
ule in addition to the normal advance. 
The following extracts from school board regula- 
tions illustrate various methods in use: 
Canandaigua, N. Y. (Regulations, 1920-21).—Double in- 
crement granted the year following attendance at summer 
school. Increment doubled for one summer session in each 
five-year period beginning with 1920. (Does not apply to 
probationary or three years of service teachers.) 
Elkins, W. Va. (1920).—Six dollars per month the year 
following attendance at summer school in approved normal 
school, college, or university, with certificate showing that at 
least three subjects have been studied for a term of six weeks, 
and after one year’s experience in Elkins. 
Elyria, Ohio (1920-21).—Fifty dollars in addition to regu- 
lar increase on salary schedule following attendance at ap- 
proved summer school or summer session of a college or uni- 
versity, provided salary does not reach beyond maximum. 
(Applies to grade teachers.) 
Hackensack, N. J. (1920).—Any teacher who completes 
satisfactorily an approved course of professional study 
amounting to at least one unit may receive, in addition to the 
normal increment in salary, an additional increase of $50 
the year following the completion of the course. 
Janesville, Wis. (1919) —Annual increment of $50 for six 
weeks’ attendance at summer school. Not more than two 
increments allowed. 
Kenosha, Wis. (1920).—Upon satisfactory showing, teacher 
will be placed in salary schedule two steps higher than pre- 
vious year following attendance at summer school. 
Mishawaka, Ind. (1920).—One dollar and fifty cents given 
for six weeks’ attendance at summer school, and $2.50 for a 
twelve weeks’ term, on monthly salary of teacher, provided 
that this addition does not exceed maximum of her class 
except as noted in following: Any teacher who receives the
-P-A-G-E-92
74 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
regular increase, and has reached the lower maximum of her 
class, may receive credit above the lower maximum for six 
weeks of summer school each summer, or for twelve weeks 
every other summer. 
Vancouver, Wash. (1921).—Teachers who earn usual 
credits in approved summer school shall receive $60 addi- 
tional compensation each year for two years, or for four 
years if two successive summer schools are attended. 
Rochester, N. Y—Upon the recommendation of the super- 
intendent and the approval of the board of education the 
following recognition shall be given to all regularly appointed 
teachers, principals, and supervisors who pursue courses in 
summer schools: 
First. That for the single year following such work the 
sum of $50 shall be added to the salary of any teacher, prin- 
cipal, or supervisor who pursues courses in institutions out- 
side of the city of Rochester. 
Second. That for the single year following such work a 
sum equal to the tuition, but in no case to exceed $25, shall 
be added to the salary of any teacher, principal, or super- 
visor who pursues courses in an institution within the city. 
In either case such allowance shall be subject to the fol- 
lowing conditions: 
The institution and the courses therein are to be approved 
by the superintendent of schools; shall be pursued for a 
period of at least four weeks; must bear directly on the work 
which the teacher, principal, or supervisor is doing; shall 
not be granted for more than two years in succession; shall 
be contingent upon adequate funds being provided for the 
department of public instruction. 
An additional article has been passed by the board of 
education since the publication of the rules and regulations, 
to the effect that any regularly appointed teacher in the 
public-school system may take two courses in the University 
of Rochester during each semester, and such courses will be 
paid by the board of education. Each year there are several 
hundred teachers taking advantage of extension work in the 
University of Rochester. 
Roanoke, Va, (1921).—Teachers who have completed one 
year’s training above a two-year normal course will receive 
an additional $200 per year above the basic schedule. Four
-P-A-G-E-93
  PROBLEMS IN TRAINING TEACHERS IN SERVICE 15 
summer sessions of six weeks each of accredited work, or 
two summer sessions of twelve weeks each of accredited work, 
will be counted as equal to one year’s training. 
The Ann Arbor plan.—The detail of the plan used in 
Ann Arbor, Michigan, illustrates many of the checks 
and measures that develop in the administration of 
pay for credits gained while in service. 
Any teacher who has served the public schools of 
Ann Arbor satisfactorily for one school year or more 
may secure an increase in his regular salary of one 
hundred dollars per year for a period of three years 
by complying with either of the following plans for 
the promotion of efficiency, provided that notice shall 
be given to the superintendent of the teacher’s inten- 
tion to qualify under either plan not later than June 
25 preceding the school year when the first benefit is 
to be earned. 
PLAN I 
1. The conditions to be met shall be: (a) The secur- 
ing of not less than six hours’ credit in an educational 
institution and in lines of study approved by the 
superintendent; (b) attendance at a national educa- 
tion meeting approved by the superintendent and a 
meeting of the Michigan State Teachers’ Association; 
(c) the reading regularly of a general educational 
magazine and a periodical devoted to the teacher’s 
special field; (d) reading of two educational books, ap- 
proved by the superintendent; (e) reports, satisfac- 
tory to the superintendent, on (b), (c), and (d). 
2. Condition (a) must be met before August 25 pre- 
ceding the year when the first benefit is to be received
-P-A-G-E-94
    76 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
under it. The satisfying of this condition shall entitle 
the teacher to an award of one hundred dollars per 
year for two years, provided conditions (¢), (d) and 
(e) are met as indicated below. 
3. Condition (b) may be satisfied either before or 
after condition (a) is met. It shall entitle the teacher 
to an award of one hundred dollars for one year. The 
report shall be due August 1, preceding the year when 
the award is to be received, except that for 1920 a re- 
port on the meeting of the Michigan State Teachers’ 
Association may be made not later than December 1st. 
4. Conditions (ce) and (d) and condition (e), as it 
applies to (c) and (d), must be met, in conjunction 
with either (a) or (b) according to plans approved 
by the superintendent, not later than October 1st of 
each year of the period. Failure to submit reports, as 
required by the superintendent, shall be considered 
sufficient ground for suspending the award for the fol- 
lowing year. 
5. In lieu of condition (d) the superintendent may, 
at his discretion, assign to the teacher each year a 
problem or special topic for investigation and report. 
Expianatory.—Awards for meeting conditions (a) 
and (b) will be made only once in three years. 
PLAN II 
1. The conditions to be met shall be: (a) Six 
weeks’ Kuropean or equivalent travel, previously ap- 
proved by the superintendent; (b) a report, satisfac- 
tory to the superintendent, to be rendered not later 
than September 1 preceding the school year when the

first award is to be made under this plan; (c) the read- 
ing regularly of a general educational magazine and 
a periodical devoted to the teacher’s special field; (d) 
reading of two educational books, or other books, ap- 
proved by the superintendent; (e) reports, satisfac- 
tory to the superintendent, on (c) and (d). 
2. The satisfying of this condition shall entitle the 
teacher to an award of one hundred dollars per year 
for three years. 
8. Conditions (c), (d), and (e) are to be met each 
year of the triennial period. Failure to submit re- 
ports in accordance with this condition by August 1 
shall be considered sufficient ground for suspending 
the award for the following year. 
4. In lieu of condition (d) the superintendent may, 
at his discretion, assign to the teacher each year a 
problem or special topic for investigation and report. 
Leave of absence with credit——Another plan coming 
into favor is that of granting leave of absence, with 
eredit, for study or travel. The usual time of service 
before leave of absence on full or part pay may be 
granted is seven years; that is, the eighth year might 
be used. The teacher is generally obligated to remain 
for two or three years in service after her return. 
Three years is the usual requirement, or a propor- 
tional return of the money granted while on leave must 
be returned. Exceptions, however, may be made in 
some instances, such as illness, death in family, éte., in 
which cases the return of the money may not be de- 
manded. Remuneration during absence is generally 
one-half the regular salary. 
Boston, Mass. Boston about the year 1912, worked

78 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
out a plan which has since been embodied in the rules 
and regulations of the school board, covering leaves 
of absence for study or travel during which time teach- 
ers receive one-half the usual salary. The rules of the 
board read as follows: 
Section 307. 1. The superintendent may grant, subject 
to the approval of the board, leaves of absence to teachers 
and members of the supervising staff, except the super- 
vising nurse, school nurses, medical inspector, and school 
physicians, for study and travel or for rest, for a period 
not exceeding one year. Teachers and members of the 
supervising staff become eligible for a leave of absence for 
study and travel after the completion of 7 years of service, 
and for leave of absence for rest after 20 years of service 
in the schools of the city of Boston, part of which service 
may have been rendered in the parental school. They may 
be granted leave of absence for study and travel for not more 
than 1 year in any 8 consecutive years, and for rest for not 
more than 1 year in any 21 consecutive years. Before such 
leave may be granted, they shall file with the superintendent 
an application upon a form prescribed by him, stating the 
definite purpose for which the leave of absence is desired. 
2. Teachers and members of the supervising staff to whom 
leave of absence for study and travel may be granted shall 
regularly report in writing to the superintendent, in such 
form as he may determine, the manner in which the leave of 
absence is employed; and for failure to comply with any re- 
quirement of this section, or to pursue in a satisfactory man- 
ner the purpose for which leave of absence was granted, he 
may terminate such leave of absence at any time. 
3. Teachers and members of the supervising staff to whom 
leave of absence is granted under the provisions of this section 
shall file with the superintendent an agreement in writing, 
binding them to remain in the service of the board for three 
years after the expiration of such leave of absence, or, in 
case of resignation within said three years, to refund to the 
board such proportion of the amount paid them for the time 
included in the leave of absence as the unexpired portion of 
said three years may bear to the entire three years. The pro-
-P-A-G-E-97
PROBLEMS IN TRAINING TEACHERS IN SERVICE 79 
  visions of this agreement shall not apply to resignation on 
account of ill health, with the consent of the board, nor to 
resignation at the request of the board. 
4. The provisions of this section shall not apply to teachers 
in continuation schools or day industrial schools. 
Other cities have since adopted similar plans with 
variations to suit the local situation. The following 
are illustrative: 
Cambridge, Mass. (1918).—One year’s absence in 11 
with half pay. 
Newark, N. J. (1920).—One year’s absence in 11 
with half pay. 
New Rochelle, N. Y. (1919).—One year’s absence in 
8 with half pay. 
Newton, Mass. (1921).—One year’s absence in 8 with 
half pay. 
Richmond, Va. (1919).—41% months’ absence after 3 
years’ service with half pay. 
Rochester, N. Y. (1918).—One year’s absence in 8 
with half pay. The rules and regulations governing 
leave of absence for study or travel are as follows: 
1. Any teacher or principal who shall have served the city 
of Rochester for seven years may, on recommendation of the 
superintendent and with the approval of the board of educa- 
tion, be granted leave of absence for study or travel on the 
following conditions. 
First. Applicants must state the definite purpose for which 
such leave of absence is desired. 
Second. Reports must be made to the superintendent dur- 
ing such absence, and if such reports are unsatisfactory such 
leave may be terminated by the board at any time. 
Third. Applicants must file with the board a written agree- 
ment to remain in the service of the board for three years 
after the expiration of such leave, or in case of resignation 
within three years, to refund to the city such proportion of  
-P-A-G-E-98
80 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
the salary paid during the leave of absence as the unexpired 
portion of three. years shall bear to said period. No refund 
shall be required, however, in the event of resignation on ac- 
count of ill health with the consent of the board, or resignation 
at the request of the board. In case a woman teacher to 
whom a leave of absence has been granted marries before 
the expiration of this three-year period, she shall refund to 
the city such proportion of the salary paid during the leave 
of absence as the unexpired portion of three years shall bear 
to such period. 
Fourth. Such leave shall not be granted for less than one 
full semester, nor shall it exceed one year in duration. It 
shall not be granted more than once in eight consecutive years. 
Fifth. Salary during such leave shall be one-half the appli- 
cant’s regular salary, but in no event shall it exceed $1,000. 
Sixth. Not more than 15 applications for leave of absence 
shall be granted to take effect during the school year. In case 
the number of applications shall exceed 15, selection shall be 
made in accordance with the following principles: 
(a) Length of service, preference being given to those 
longest in the service. 
(b) Distribution by schools, care being taken that the 
number from any one school shall not be comparatively ex- 
cessive. 
(ec) Nature of service, provision being made that the ben- 
efits of such leave of absence shall be distributed as fairly 
as possible among all grade, high school, and supervisory posi- 
tions. 
2. Applications for such leave of absence for any school 
year shall be acted on by the board of education at its first 
regular meeting in January of the preceding year. 
Credit for travel—An increasing number of city 
school systems are recognizing the value of educa- 
tional travel in improving teachers in service. Such 
travel may be done during the summer vacation in 
lieu of attending summer school, or a leave of absence 
may be granted for the specific purpose of traveling 
during the regular school year. The greatest diffi-
-P-A-G-E-99
  PROBLEMS IN TRAINING TEACHERS IN SERVICE 81 
culty arises in properly appraising the educational 
value of travel. Should a teacher be paid for resting? 
for traveling? for studying? Are the three things in 
any sense equivalent? Undoubtedly there are cases 
of over-work for which resting may be the only reason- 
able recommendation. Traveling usually costs more 
money than resting simply because one rests in many 
different places other than the usual habitat. It is 
difficult to measure the educational value of anything. 
Until more definite personnel research is conducted we 
shall need to continue to guess at the educational value 
of travel. It does seem reasonable to reward a teacher, 
who spends an equivalent amount of time and money 
in educational travel, the same as she would be re- 
warded for studying in an accredited institution. 
However, it should be noted that few colleges or uni- 
versities will grant any college or graduate credit for 
so-called educational travel except when specifically 
directed by the faculty of the institution and even then 
in very rare instances. 
Credit for projects and contributions.—Another 
method of stimulating teachers to their best efforts 
and encouraging their codperation is to reward them 
in some way for suggestions on improving the service. 
A recent Detroit bulletin describes the plan in opera- 
tion in that city. 
Detroit has a large and growing force of keen, well 
trained and experienced teachers. Many of these 
teachers are making valuable contributions to class- 
The following places allow some credit for educational travel. The 
amount and conditions are not specified: Highland Park, Mich.; June- 
tion City, Kansas; Lawrence, Kansas; Manitowoc, Wis.; Kenosha, 
Wis.; San Diego, Cal.; and Wyandotte, Mich.

room organization and management and to the tech- 
nique of teaching, but because of the very largeness 
of the system many ideas and plans useful to the city 
as a whole are lost. Following is a plan for system- 
atically collecting and conserving for the entire group 
the best of these ideas. For those teachers who make 
such contributions suitable recognition is provided. 
The plan as outlined below is open to every teacher. 
1. The plan as here outlined includes experiments 
and suggestions for the improvement of instruction: 
(a) Variations in instructional records and forms. 
(b) Changes in the course of study. 
(c) Suggestions for better classroom organiza- 
tion and management. 
(d) Improved methods of teaching. 
(e) Experimental investigations. 
(f) Child welfare. 
2. Teachers having such suggestions and modifica- 
tions to submit should state in not more than three 
hundred words 
(a) Exactly what the experimental piece of work 
or suggestion is. 
(b) When the work was started and when it will 
end. 
(c) Why the results are specially worth while, and 
(d) How the results might be used throughout the 
school system. 
This statement should be accompanied by such 
printed and mimeographed materials and data as are 
available. The statement must carry the approval of 
the principal of the school concerned. 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
  PROBLEMS IN TRAINING TEACHERS IN SERVICE 83 
3. Upon receipt by the Department of Supervision 
of a statement that an experiment is being conducted, 
the teacher will be visited by the supervisor concerned. 
Supervisors will be glad to discuss the work in prog- 
ress and give such assistance as is possible. 
4. Each piece of work will be rated A, B, or C. A 
“CG”? contribution is one worthy of mention, but not 
recommended for tryout in the system. A ‘‘B’’ con- 
tribution is an average piece of work which should be 
used as a basis of more extensive trial or experimenta- 
tion. An ‘‘A’’ contribution is an exceptional piece of 
work which can be put into immediate effect through- 
out the schools. 
5. Only original pieces of work (pieces of work new 
to the system) will be accredited. Original pieces of 
work will be interpreted to mean those not covered 
by previous reports from teachers, or by written 
materials from the supervisory and administrative 
groups, or by publications of the Detroit board of 
education. 
6. Each acceptable piece of work will be recorded 
upon the teacher’s efficiency rating card as evidence 
of professional leadership and ability. 
7. When materials have been accepted for city-wide 
use, the contributing teacher may, if she so desires, 
present in person the materials to district principal or 
principals. 
8. For those teachers who care to avail themselves 
of the opportunity credit will be given by Detroit 
Teachers College. In order that suitable conferences 
and readings may be planned, teachers desiring such

credit must make the request in writing to Teachers 
College. Credit can be given only under such condi- 
tions. 
9. Direct correspondence to the Department of 
Supervision, Board of Education. 
The function of teachers’ institutes——One of the best 
known and used means of training teachers in service 
is the annual or semi-annual institute. Institutes are 
still held annually in practically every county in most 
states of the Union. The sessions are usually from 
one to five days in length, and attendance is com- 
pulsory with full pay. 
The original purposes were (1) to teach academic 
subject matter to poorly prepared teachers; (2) to 
assist candidates to secure certificates; (3) to 
teach professional subjects, and (4) to inspire teach- 
ers to greater personal growth and professional 
service. 
Institutes were originally training schools. Grad- 
ually as normal schools and high schools grew in popu- 
larity the purpose of the institute changed. Training 
in the common branches and for certificates has wholly 
disappeared from the program of institutes in many 
states. The institute has become a professional meet- 
ing. More attention is given to current educational 
problems and tendencies. Sociological as well as 
psychological and pedagogical subjects are discussed. 
The teacher’s horizon has widened. Normal school 
and college graduates do not attend institutes willingly 
unless the programs are made especially attractive to 
trained teachers. County institutes, therefore, are 
largely attended by rural school teachers and by inex-    
-P-A-G-E-103
  PROBLEMS IN TRAINING TEACHERS IN SERVICE 85 
perienced teachers who are preparing to teach rural 
schools.” 
Current criticism of institutes——The criticism of the 
county institute is so persistent that it cannot be 
ignored. In fact, the question persists of whether or 
not we have outgrown the institute. We have already 
noted that city, elementary, and high-school teachers 
are frequently exempt from attendance or are 
prompted to organize a separate institute. The fol- 
lowing criticisms have been collected from various 
sources. Some of them are just and others may be 
unjust but they are all worthy of consideration. 
The institute goes over the same ground year after 
year. It becomes monotonous and breeds indifference. 
It offers no program for a period of years. No defi- 
nite objectives are followed. 
The institute gives but little opportunity for the 
teacher to participate. The teachers sit in a more or 
less receptive mood. They are not given anything to 
do except to listen and to take notes. This complaint 
is sometimes followed by more serious charges to the 
effect that the institute is autocratically organized, that 
it is undemocratic, and that it is unpedagogical. 
2 Facts warranting this statement may be cited. The annual report 
of the state superintendent in public instruction of Wisconsin in 1908 
shows that 90 per cent of those who attended institutes the preceding 
year were county teachers. Superintendent Oary lamented the fact that 
normal graduates do not attend with greater frequency and regularity. 
The annual report for the state of Kansas for 1908 reveals a similar 
condition. Over 88 per cent of those attending were either teaching 
in rural schools or were aspiring to do so. The teachers in Kansas 
were a little over 20 years of age, on the average, and only approxi- 
mately 25 per cent were high school graduates. The state superinten- 
dent at Kansas for the year 1908, in discussing these figures said: 
**Clearly the course of study and the work in the institute should be 
made chiefly to fit the needs of those who are inexperienced and who 
are to teach in the rural school.’’ 
   
-P-A-G-E-104
  86 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
Its organization and procedure is out of date. This 
is due to the fact that the organization and procedure 
follows the plans of 50 to 75 years ago, and has not 
been adjusted to the spirit of the present day. 
Much valuable time is wasted by speakers who use 
cheap clap-trap funny stories and entertaining 
devices. 
The institute involves a cost to the teachers and to 
the districts out of proportion to the results obtained. 
If anyone has doubt about this criticism they may well 
compute the cost for a single county. 
Compulsory attendance at institutes, which seems 
to be necessary in order to hold institutes at all, breeds 
semi-resentful attitudes and develops in the minds of 
the teachers the feeling that they are autocratically 
supervised. This is a minor criticism and would 
almost entirely disappear if the institute programs 
were in themselves made more worth while. 
The institute is frequently used as a tool to fur- 
ther the political interests of those in power or those 
who aspire to power. Nearly everyone will criticize 
instances where the institutes have been abused in this. 
manner but these criticisms can be directed against 
all kinds of teachers’ meetings and training schools. 
It is, therefore, not to be considered as of any weight. 
Suggestions for the improvement of county institutes. 
—The following suggestions for improving institutes 
have been tried in a number of places and proved of 
value. These apply to both county and city school 
systems. The organizers of the institute should keep 
the following objectives in mind: (1) unified educa- 
tional ideals; (2) adjustment of the teacher to her
-P-A-G-E-105
  PROBLEMS IN TRAINING TEACHERS IN SERVICE 87 
community; (3) organization of the basic curriculum; 
(4) specific help on specific problems; (5) new educa- 
tional ideas and ideals; and (6) to bring parents and 
teachers and school officers together in a more pro- 
ficient partnership in order to solve the educational 
problems of the community. 
A program committee representative of all the 
teachers of the county should be organized and this 
committee should closely codperate with the county 
superintendent in the selection and the arrangement 
of the program. This committee may well be rather 
large. While it would take a little more time on the 
part of the county superintendent to build a program 
in this manner, he will find that it will develop co- 
operation and promote a feeling of responsibility for 
the success of the institute. 
The program should provide a definite course of lec- 
turers through a period of at least two or three years. 
It would be well for this committee to take, each year, 
some simple theme and to build its programs about 
that theme. 
The faculty of the institute should be chosen with 
the greatest care. Chief thought should be given to 
selecting instructors of superior merit for the topics 
under discussion. 
The committee should see that the program is not 
crowded and that local announcements and interests 
are practically excluded. Frequently over-crowded 
programs become extremely tedious and profitless. All 
of these can be avoided if the organizing committee 
will eliminate the unnecessary local interests that de- 
sire to appear. 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
    88 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
The program committee should arrange for short 
institutes, at maximum, one or two days in length, 
never more than this if possible. This short institute 
should be held frequently and locally possible once 
every six weeks. 
More opportunity should be given for demonstration. 
teaching and an analysis, criticism, and interpretation 
of the demonstration. Next to learning by doing, 
teachers learn by seeing. ; 
Overcoming the objections to training in service.— 
Perhaps we should first eliminate as unfit all teachers 
who think they need no improvement or outside train- 
ing on the job. The teacher who is never willing to 
try out a new method or experiment in her school or 
class will soon be an antiquated teacher clinging only 
to the ruts of her profession. On the other hand, 
training of teachers in service cannot be required, in 
the same amount and kind, of all teachers alike. Teach- 
ers differ widely in native ability, training, special in- 
terests, and ambitions. No doubt the condition of a 
teacher’s health, and whether or not some person or 
persons are dependent upon her for financial support, 
determines somewhat the kind and amount of training 
she is able to secure while in service. In planning and 
organizing such training the personnel supervisors 
must take the factors of individual differences into 
consideration. 
A teacher may justly object to attending a two-day 
institute which contains but one short lecture on her 
given field. Even an extension course given by a 
nearby college may be a ‘‘poor presentation of poor 
material,’’ or one teacher may get ideas for the dis-
-P-A-G-E-107
  PROBLEMS IN TRAINING TEACHERS IN SERVICE 89 
ciplining in the upper grades which she needs, while 
the primary teacher profits not at all. Obviously, 
wherever possible, personnel supervisors should not 
require all teachers to take the same course, or attend 
the same meetings. 
It is sometimes difficult to make training voluntary 
on the part of the very good teacher who resents any 
suggestion that she might acquire more knowledge. 
Perhaps her education has been rather narrow and 
there may be many new fields of information which 
would broaden her vision and make her a real leader 
in her group of teachers. 
Fortunately most teachers codperate enthusiasti- 
cally with any training requirements made by state law, 
by county standards, or by local boards and personnel 
supervisors, when the same are based on good com- 
mon sense. Many objections may be tactfully over- 
come by supervisors who bring them in contact with 
expert teachers, good lectures, new demonstrations and 
experiments which inspire and interest. 
. The young open-minded teacher, her first year out 
of normal school, may ‘be required to take part in 
reading-circle work as well as to attend all institute 
lectures, while the very good teacher of excellent train- 
ing and long experience should not be expected to fol- 
low such courses. If the latter teacher is ambitious 
she may wish to attend a university summer school 
which will aid in fitting her for supervisory or admin- 
istrative work. 
If teachers themselves are given representation on 
the board or council which selects the out-of-town 
speakers for required meetings, institutes, and exten-
-P-A-G-E-108
  90 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
sion courses, and which selects professional magazines 
and books for the reading circle, a more perfect co- 
operation may be effected. Supervisors who keep in 
mind individual differences, who work with the utmost 
tact, and who have pleasing personalities are distinct 
aids to the personnel office in eliminating objections to 
training in service. 
Other agencies.—Russell grouped the various agen- 
cies now used in American cities to training teachers 
in service under five headings: (1) extension agen- 
cies; (2) teachers’ meetings; (3) devices; (4) profes- 
sional supervision, and (5) work with new teachers. 
Those not already discussed will be dealt with in sub- 
sequent chapters. 
A suggestive plan of improvement.—It has been sug- 
gested that teachers in city school systems be divided 
into four major groups: (1) the novices; (2) the jour- 
neyman teachers; (3) the graduate teachers, and (4) 
the master teachers. Teachers should be encouraged 
to pass from one group to the next higher as rapidly 
as their capacities, interests, and opportunities permit. 
The novice-——The novice has had no experience in 
teaching but has had two years of standard pre-service 
education beyond graduation from the high school. 
She is a beginner and as such is on probation for one 
or two years. She needs the maximum amount of 
personnel and instructional supervision. Her tenure 
is temporary. She must make good, stand still until 
she does, or get out and make way for others. 
The journeyman teacher.—After one or two success- 
ful probationary years the novice becomes a regular 
appointee. She is still on trial and a long way from 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
  PROBLEMS IN TRAINING TEACHERS IN SERVICE 91 
mastership. She is a journeyman teacher. During 
this period which lasts from five to seven years, she 
should be constantly improving in skills and in mas- 
tery of subject-matter. She should be encouraged if 
not required to take advanced studies in summer 
schools, by extension and correspondence courses, and 
other available means of training in service. Her 
tenure, like that of a novice, is from year to year and 
the salary increases are granted by yearly increments. 
She is also paid for each unit of training, say one- 
third or one-half year units, which she earns while a 
journeyman. In this manner she slowly but surely 
improves her mastery of subject-matter during the 
same time that her skills are being increased. Again, 
every possible means must be utilized to keep her 
growing and advancing from year to year in accord- 
ance with her best interests, capacities, and the oppor- 
tunities that are open to her. 
The graduate teacher.—By the end of from five to 
seven years she passes into a higher group and be- 
comes known as a graduate teacher. She has acquired 
four years of training beyond high school and is now 
as well qualified as the beginning high-school teacher. 
She has reached the maximum of the journeyman 
salary scale. However, she should be encouraged to 
continue her growth. Her tenure should be made in- 
definite and at the same time she should be relieved of 
the supervision which she experienced as a journey- 
man teacher, although she should have access to it 
when it is needed or desired. 
The master teacher——The master teacher who has 
attained her mastership by the process outlined above
-P-A-G-E-110
  92 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
is an expert. She is indeed a professional unit. She 
continues her study and becomes a specialist. She 
should receive a substantial increase in salary over 
that of the graduate teacher. She may be a master 
teacher of children in any grade or subject from the 
kindergarten through the high school. Regardless of 
grade or subject she is paid because she is a master 
teacher of children. Her presence in a school system 
is an inspiration to the graduate and journeymen 
teachers and to the novices. She is a living demon- 
stration to them of the rewards that may come to those 
who make classroom teaching a life-career and profes- 
sion. She in turn may become a supervisor, a master 
training teacher, a subject-matter specialist, an experi- 
mental specialist, a master teacher or supervisor of 
special types of children, or an administrative officer, 
who by her wise and sympathetic counsel, directs the 
personnel and instructional supervision of others. 
Main points of the chapter.—1. Many teachers are 
interested in ways and means of improving their train- 
ing in service. 
2. One of the most frequently used means is to offer 
extra pay for school attendance. Many school boards 
now recognize such expenditures as a legitimate part 
of their school budget. The plans used in Rochester 
and Ann Arbor are especially commendable. 
3. Another plan growing in favor is to grant leave 
of absence for rest, study, or travel with credit, with 
or without pay, to teachers who have been from seven 
to ten years in the service. The plans used in Boston 
and Rochester are particularly good. 
4. Credit for educational travel is also granted in
-P-A-G-E-111
  PROBLEMS IN TRAINING TEACHERS IN SERVICE 93 
a number of places. However, considerable difficulty 
arises in properly appraising the educational value of 
travel. This fact makes it a less recognized method 
of training teachers in service. 
5. Another method is to reward teachers in some 
way for suggestions and new ideas, the adoption 
of which will improve the local schools. Detroit uses 
this method successfully. 
6. The efficiency of the teachers’ institutes for other 
than rural teachers has decreased in direct ratio with 
the increased preparation and specialization of city 
school teachers. Institutes are becoming more and 
more professional meetings for teachers. 
7. Teachers who continue to feel that they need no 
training in service should be eliminated. Every means 
should be used to break down superficial objections to 
training, and to build up a professional attitude. 
8. A suggested plan of improving teachers in serv- 
ice divides teachers into four major groups: (1) the 
novices, (2) the journeymen teachers, (3) the gradu- 
ate teachers, and (4) the master teachers. Rewards 
in teaching should be so arranged as to encourage 
teachers to pass from novice to mastership, thus de- 
veloping their best capacities and interests and making 
them both happy and professional. 
PROBLEMS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
1. The board of education at F. requests the superin- 
tendent to formulate a plan by means of which the prepara- 
tion of teachers in the local school system will be increased 
without sacrificing efficient teachers. Assuming that you are 
the superintendent, how would you proceed?  
-P-A-G-E-112
94 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
2. The superintendent believes in establishing a local train- 
ing school for teachers already in the service and prospective 
teachers living in the community. Some members of the 
board object to this as an unnecessary expense. The nearest 
normal school is seventy miles distant. There are eighty 
teachers in the system. Is the superintendent’s position jus- 
tified? Why? 
8. A junior high school program has been adopted and 
within one year will be inaugurated in the new building. 
The superintendent will need forty teachers. About half 
of this number will be available from the present staff of 
the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades. None of these 
teachers have had experience in junior high school work and 
organization. What methods may be adopted to assure a 
highly qualified staff? 
4. The board of education in the city of D—— believes in 
rewarding teachers for summer school attendance. A mem- 
ber makes a motion, ‘‘that a bonus of fifty dollars be given 
a teacher for having attended a summer school.’’ How 
should this motion be interpreted by the superintendent? 
How should he amend or reformulate the motion? 
5. A bequest, the annual income from which amounts to 
approximately six hundred dollars a year, has been left to 
the local school board as a scholarship fund to be devoted to 
advancing the academic and professional training of teachers 
in the local school system. In what manner would you 
recommend its expenditure? 
6. What is usually meant by a bonus? By a subsidy? By 
credit toward salary increase? (See Russell, pp. 26-29.) 
7. Enumerate the general purposes of teachers’ meetings. 
How may such meetings be made most effective? 
8. Enumerate and evaluate the different devices cited by 
Russell (see bibliography) for improving teachers in service. 
What is the meaning of the word device as used here? 
9. What is meant by educational travel? How much and 
what kind of travel should constitute the equivalent of one 
semester hour of college or university credit? 
10. What are the best methods of breaking in (a) a new 
inexperienced teacher? (b) a new experienced teacher? 
11. Criticize the following statements: ‘‘The graduate of 
a teacher training institution is not a finished product.’’ ‘‘In-

training program of state teacher training institutions.’’

  CHAPTER VI 
PROBLEMS OF CERTIFICATION 
Personnel problems in education may, and often do, 
arise over the question of certification. There was a 
time when teachers were not required to have either a 
license or a certificate. But early in the history of 
education in the United States it became necessary for 
a number of reasons to set up requirements. Today 
comprehensive and complex schemes of teacher certifi- 
cation have been established in every state in the 
Union. These laws and the interpretations of these 
laws by courts, educational officers and boards are be- 
ing continually modified and improved. It is now ille- 
gal anywhere in the United States to pay public funds 
for the services of a teacher unless he or she possesses 
a certificate, no matter what other personal qualifica- 
tions the person may possess. 
Illustrative problem.—Of the many cases that have 
come before the courts involving this principle the case 
of Goose River Bank vs. Willow Lake Township in 
North Dakota, occurring in 1890, is typical and the 
decision rendered by the Supreme Court of that state 
indicates clearly the legal status of such cases. In this 
ease a teacher had taught the Willow Lake school and 
had been issued two warrants in payment of salary by 
the board of directors. She cashed the warrants at the 
96
-P-A-G-E-115
  PROBLEMS OF CERTIFICATION 97 
Goose River Bank. The township treasurer refused 
to pay the warrants when they were presented by the 
bank. The bank brought suit to recover from the 
township but was not granted a judgment. The court 
held that the warrants were void, having been issued 
to a teacher who held no certificate. The court said 
in part, ‘‘There is no force in the position that the 
defendant having received the benefit of the teacher’s 
service, is liable. Such a doctrine would defeat the 
policy of the law, which is to give the people of the 
state the benefit of trained and competent teachers. 
. . . If the defendant could be made liable by the mere 
receipt of the benefit of the service rendered, the law 
would be in effect repealed, and ... the protection 
would be destroyed.’’ Similar cases in Illinois and 
elsewhere have been similarly interpreted until today 
it is a generally accepted principle that a teacher must 
have a certificate before she can legally draw public 
funds. Undoubtedly there are both conscious and un- 
conscious violations of this principle but there is a 
legal risk involved that both the teacher and the board 
should hesitate to assume. 
Ten fundamental principles in certification.—There 
are ten general principles upon which a state-wide sys- 
tem of teacher certification should be based. These 
are: 
1. The authority to issue teachers’ certificates 
should be removed so far as possible from undue per- 
sonal, charitable, political, local, social, or religious 
influences. 
2. The authority to grant certificates should be cen- 
tralized rather than divided. 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
    98 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
8. Ultimately, the first certificate granted to a 
teacher should be based solely upon the recommenda- 
tion of the faculty of a teacher-training institution. 
4. For the present, greater stress should be placed 
upon the amount and kind of training received by the 
applicant, and less and less stress upon the marks re- 
ceived in an examination. 
5. Certificates should be issued on the promotional 
basis. As a teacher’s training, experience, and merit 
increases, she should be able to pass from a lower to 
a higher certificate. 
6. The number and names of certificates should be 
reduced to the minimum. 
7. The terminology of the certificate should, so far 
as possible, describe the attainments and the rights of 
the holder. 
8. The period of validity of all kinds of certificates 
should be limited and extensions and renewals should 
be based upon evidence of continued or additional pro- 
fessional attainment. 
9. A satisfactory statement concerning the health 
of the candidate should be required before a certificate 
is granted or renewed. 
10. Ona state’s plan for teacher certification, a goal 
should be set which is to be attained in a given period 
of years. Usually a period of ten years is sufficient. 
The method of attaining the goal should be so ar- 
ranged as to be fair to the great majority of those now 
teaching. 
Each of these ten principles will be discussed in the 
order given above. 
Making the authority impersonal.—The theory of the
-P-A-G-E-117
PROBLEMS OF CERTIFICATION 99 
  law is that the teacher is the agent of society, employed 
to accomplish the purposes of society in the matter of 
educating children. The authority to teach is imper- 
sonal. In no way should schools be made ‘‘local family 
affairs, or used for local, charitable, political, social, 
or religious purposes. Society has its own life to lead, 
its own ideals and purposes to foster and protect. The 
state establishes laws and regulations covering sub- 
jects of instruction, length of the school year, the ages 
during which children are compelled to attend school, 
the right to free textbooks, and many other important 
items enforcing the rights and privileges of public edu- 
cation. It is, therefore, equally justified in establish- 
ing educational and professional requirements for 
teaching.’’ 
Failure of earlier methods.——One of the earliest 
methods of certificating teachers was by means of 
either oral or written examinations given by laymen 
on the school committee or board, or by a specially as- 
signed local examining board. This method persisted 
from the Middle Ages to the later half of the nineteenth 
century. It was used as late as 1898 in Rhode Island. 
It would seem obvious that so costly and important a 
work as teaching should not be thrown open, without 
qualifications, to anyone. Yet, in America, so close 
have the schools been to the people, that until the 
last half century, it was almost impossible to make 
much progress in the matter of county and state 
certification. 
A teacher’s examination given by laymen is of little 
value. To most laymen, the teacher’s friends or her 
personality and attractive appearance outweigh her 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
  100 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
real academic and professional preparation. Cubber- 
ley describes and condemns this early method of cer- 
tificating teachers in the following terms: ‘‘On their 
personal side, the members of the teachers’ committee 
of the school board, as well as other board members, 
were visited by the different applicants and impor- 
tuned by their friends; the personality and special 
needs of the applicant were given due consideration, 
and consciously or unconsciously, their personal 
friendships, church relationships, or party affiliations 
of male relatives played their part in determining 
who were selected by the board. The teachers’ com- 
mittee finally made its selections, formally reported 
the list to the full board for approval, and the board 
either adopted, or modified and then adopted, their 
report. The schools being regarded in large part as a 
local undertaking and the theory that anyone could 
teach who could govern being the chief pedagogical 
belief of the time, it followed that outsiders were sel- 
dom selected and that the bright and attractive gradu- 
ate of the last class in the local school system, the 
daughter of the estimable citizen, the young lady who 
needed to help her widowed mother, or the widow or 
the deserted wife of a former local resident were the 
natural persons selected to share the public bounty and 
to teach the children of the community in the school. 
Where the schools had been taken possession of by 
the local politicians, some local boss, instead, had to 
be seen and he dictated all the appointments made by 
the board.’’ 
Common educational standards; uniform and stead- 
ily increasing requirements; and interchange of cer-  
-P-A-G-E-119
  PROBLEMS OF CERTIFICATION 101 
tificates between communities, counties, and states are 
practically impossible under a local examination by 
school boards. It is a primitive method of certifica- 
tion suited to the primitive needs of the past. The 
unsatisfactory and confusing results obtained under 
it have caused it to be abandoned by almost all the 
states in the union in favor of broader and more 
general state requirements. 
Centralizing the authority—CGradually the power to 
issue teachers’ certificates has been taken away from 
local bodies and vested in county, city, state, and in- 
stitutional authorities. 
The county plan represents a narrow and local view 
of public education with consequent low standards. 
It is gradually being discarded in favor of a state and 
institutional plan. There are certain large cities at 
present which are allowed, under the direction of the 
state department of education, to examine applicants 
and issue certificates, either upon successfully pass- 
ing the examination or upon certified credits from the 
city normal school or other standard institutions. Chi- 
cago is a city with this power. The requirements and 
standards in such city systems are usually high and 
specialization is developed to a much greater degree 
than in the state system. Some of the cities require 
more specific and specialized training for the city cer- 
tificates than is actually required by the state 
department. 
The certification of teachers in a large majority of 
the states today is directly under the control of the 
state board of education or the state superintendent 
of public instruction or both. Certificates issued by 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  102 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
state authorities are, as a rule, valid in any part of 
the state and are usually recognized by other states 
requiring like standards. The examination questions 
are prepared by the state department and, although 
the examinations are given locally through the county 
superintendent’s office, the papers are graded by the 
state department and the certificates issued only under 
the authority of the state department. This method 
maintains uniformity in issuing certificates. It is less 
personal and therefore more professional. It tends 
to promote higher standards by requiring uniform 
qualifications for the several grades of certificates 
granted. 
The tendency toward the centralization of certificat- 
ing power from 1898 to 1919 is clearly shown in 
Table III. 
Certification by institutions.—All states now recog- 
“nize, in some form, the qualification and training of 
teachers received at standard schools in the state, or 
other states, and issue certificates usually without ex- 
amination, based upon the recommendation of: the 
faculties of these institutions. These certificates are 
likewise valid in all parts of the state and are ex- 
changeable in other states with approximately the 
same requirements. The drift is in this direction. 
Thus, we see the trend in the certification of teachers 
is away from laymen and town officials to county, then 
state, and finally to the faculties of institutions espe- 
cially designed for the training of teachers. While 
these methods are still somewhat intermixed in most 
of the states of the union, rapid progress is being made 
in the matter of clarifying our thinking on this vital

problem. The normal school and college diploma, 
showing better educational and professional prepara- 
tion, are less subject to abuse. By means of institu- 
tional certification it is thought that teachers are pre- 
pared before entering the profession and many unfit 
persons are discouraged. 
More emphasis on training, less on examinations.— 
Teachers should be required to know more than they 
are expected to teach. The amount of common knowl- 
edge which we as a people have is increasing so rap- 
idly, our school curriculum is being enriched so fast,  
-P-A-G-E-122
  104 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
and the general level of national culture is becoming 
so high that a teacher with a meager intellectual equip- 
ment should have no place in our educational system. 
While it is essential that barriers to competency should 
be as few in number as possible, and reasonable in 
kind, practice seems to indicate that educational pre- 
requisites should be universally required. 
There is great need of our decreasing the emphasis 
which is now placed on the written test. The ‘‘raw 
recruit’’ should first be made to go to school. The 
tendency to require greater academic and professional 
attainments is clearly shown in Table IV. 
Measuring the amount of training.—The scholar- 
ship requirements set forth in the provisions under 
which certificates are granted are measured in terms 
of graduation from, or courses taken in, educational 
institutions of secondary or higher grade, or by means 
of an examination in prescribed subjects. Certificates 
granted on such requirements may be roughly classi- 
fied as follows: (1) Those based on graduation from 
standard college or university with or without the in- 
clusion of professional courses. (2) Those based pri- 
marily on graduation from a two-year course of college 
grade, generally given in normal schools. (3) Those 
based on graduation from a four-year high school, 
generally including professional courses given in con- 
nection with the regular work. (4) Those based 
primarily on scholarship attainments shown by exami- 
nation. The grades required on examination are not 
necessarily obtained at one time, but in some cases 
may be obtained in successive examinations, or the

possession of a prior certificate of lower grade may 
be substituted for a portion of the examination. 
The true value of a certificate-——The value of a cer- 
tificate is measured best by the amount of scholarship 
and successful experience to which it testifies. The 
extent of its validity, its duration, and similar provi- 
sions are minor considerations in comparison to its 
value as an estimate of ability to teach and to govern a 
school. There is a tendency toward higher scholar- 
   
-P-A-G-E-124
106 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
ship requirements which may be observed in several 
ways. When a new form of certificate is established, 
the qualifications demanded are usually higher and 
more specialized than formerly required. Kindergar- 
ten, primary, and special subject certificates in most 
cases require high school and normal school or college 
graduation or the equivalent, including preparation 
for the special kind of work or subject for which they 
are issued. Certificates for administrative and super- 
visory positions practically all require the comple- 
tion of four years of college or normal school training 
and in many cases an additional year of graduate 
work, including specialized study in administration 
and supervision. 
A study of the scholarship requirements shows also 
the prevalence of a tendency to consider graduation 
from a course two years above the high school as about 
the standard for teachers of elementary grades and 
completion of a four-year college course as a stand- 
ard for high-school teachers. Examinations, though 
of course quite inadequate, tend toward showing quali- 
fications equivalent to these. The various prerequisites 
for entrance to examinations are intended to insure 
the minimum amount of scholarship considered neces- 
sary for teachers. California has probably established 
better standards than any other state in the union in 
the amount of academic and professional training re- 
quired. Normal training equivalent to two years above 
a four-year high school for elementary teachers, and 
college graduation including one year of graduate work 
for high-school teachers are the California standards. 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
  PROBLEMS OF CERTIFICATION 107 
The Delaware law requires that the lowest certificate 
granted on examination is to be discontinued after 
1930; the next lowest, which requires high-school 
graduation and six weeks of professional training, is 
to be discontinued in 1935. The lowest certificate rec- 
ognized thereafter requires graduation from a two- 
year normal school in addition to the completion of a 
four-year high school. 
Issuing certificates on a promotional basis.—The low- 
est certificate is intended to be a trial certificate. It is 
usually not renewable. The highly trained and suc- 
cessful teacher should be freed from the necessity of 
continued re-examination so long as he (or she) con- 
tinues to teach in a satisfactory manner. But he should 
be limited in movement and availability for the best 
positions unless he obtains a high grade of certificate. 
Evidence of professional success and professional 
growth should be required for each higher certificate. 
Teachers with broader education and culture are 
sorely needed. The teaching profession can best pro- 
tect itself against low professional standards by in- 
sisting that certificates be progressive or promotional 
in nature. It should be impossible for the immature, 
poorly prepared, or misfit teacher to continue in the 
profession without making up her deficiencies. The 
teacher who cannot rise above the lower levels should 
not be certificated for higher levels. This principle 
is feebly recognized in most certificating plans, but in 
practice is as yet, practically unobserved. In too many 
of our states, a teacher’s certificate of any grade is 
good to teach in any part of the school system pro-
-P-A-G-E-126
  108 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
vided the teacher can find employment. Community 
sentiment has frequently set up higher requirements 
than the requirement in law. 
The number and the names of certificates should be 
reduced to the minimum.—At present, the number and 
the name of certificates are influenced by, or depend- 
ent upon: (1) the extent of territory covered; as state 
certificate, county certificate, local certificate; (2) the 
kind of school in which certificate is valid; as ele- 
mentary, high-school, kindergarten, and primary; (3) 
subjects for which issued; as special certificate in home 
economics, in music, ete.; (4) the time for which valid; 
as life, 36 months, permanent, provisional, and (5) a 
combination of two or more of these. 
Each state has elected the terms by which to desig- 
nate the certificates issued. There is no homogeneity 
among the states, either in the names used or in their 
significance; nor are any principles followed which 
control the naming of certificates. Acquaintance with 
the names and provisions of certificates in one state 
is of little assistance in interpreting those of other 
states. A first-grade certificate in one state may be 
the equivalent of a college diploma or life license in 
another so far as qualifications demanded for, or valid- 
ity of the certificate granted is concerned. This lack 
of uniform nomenclature for all states or the adoption 
of governing principles controlling the naming of cer- 
tificates, possibly accounts for the difficulty in securing 
a more general and a fairer system of exchange or 
recognition of certificates among states. 
There were about the same number of certificates 
issued in the United States in 1919 as in 1911. This 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
  PROBLEMS OF CERTIFICATION 109 
would indicate that some states have simplified their 
systems and decreased the number and kind of cer- 
tificates issued. Vermont, for example, in 1911 issued 
11 different kinds of certificates, and in 1919 only 3, 
both exclusive of permits. On the other hand, the prac- 
tice of differentiating certificates as among teachers, 
principals, superintendents, and instructors or super- 
visors of special subjects has increased, and the number 
of certificates of this nature is correspondingly larger. 
Requiring a health certificate—The health of the 
teacher cannot be overlooked. Under present prac- 
tices, health is not regarded as a prerequisite to certifi- 
cation. Possibly it cannot be insisted upon. It would 
be easy for most teachers to file a statement concerning 
their health before a certificate is granted. If, as some 
have contended, teaching has its own trade ailments 
and diseases, those susceptible to such ailments and 
diseases should be forewarned. Certainly, the chil- 
dren should be protected against exposure to con- 
tagion in the classroom, and against the disturbing 
effects of jangling nerves. 
Setting a ten-year goal.—In a state’s plan for teacher 
certification, a goal should be set which is to be at- 
tained in a definite period of years. Usually a period 
of ten years is sufficient. The method of attaining a 
goal should be so arranged as to be fair to the great 
majority of teachers now teaching and to the others 
who will enter the profession later. Throughout the 
United States, the insistent demand for better trained 
teachers is resulting in the establishment and the at-. 
tainment of the following goals: 
(1) For all elementary schools (Kindergarten and 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
    110 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
grades 1 to 6 inclusive) the teachers shall be required 
as soon as possible to have not less than two years of 
normal school training or its equivalent based upon 
graduation from an accredited four-year high school. 
Certificates should be based upon institutional train- 
ing rather than upon examination. Ultimately elemen- 
tary school teachers should be as well prepared as 
high-school teachers. 
(2) For all upper grades, intermediate or junior 
high schools and senior high schools (grades 7 to 12 
inclusive) the teachers shall be required, as soon as 
possible, to have not less than four years of normal 
school, college or university training, which should 
include professional courses in secondary education, 
based upon graduation from an accredited four-year 
high school. 
(3) For all supervisors, principals and other ad- 
mimstrative officers there should be required not less 
than from one to three years’ training beyond the 
training required of the teachers under them, which 
training should include problems in organization, su- 
pervision, and administration. 
If such a goal is set, how shall it be attained? The 
following is a suggestive certification program for a 
period of ten years. This plan was proposed in the 
Oklahoma School Survey but has not been legalized. 
Certification programs similar to this have been recom- 
mended in other state-wide surveys. Such a program 
covers only the requirements for the lowest grade 
elementary school certificate. A similar plan should 
be worked out for higher grade certificates.

DISCUSSION 
1. A music supervisor is disliked by a faction in the town 
who say she has no right to teach because she holds no special 
certificate for teaching music. 
M.   This is true although Miss 
is the graduate of a state university and has had 
adequate private training in all music branches to qualify 
her. What investigations should a superintendent make be- 
fore he renews a temporary certificate in such a case? If 
the law does not permit a certificate renewal, what course is 
open? Should music and other special teachers be exempt 
from the requirements of general certificates? 
2. Miss G. , a teacher of Home Economics, is teaching 
without a certificate after but one year’s professional train-  
-P-A-G-E-130
  112 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
ing. She is notified that she will have to take the next regular 
examinations and pass for a first-grade certificate in order to 
continue teaching. She fails in the examinations. A visit- 
ing superintendent offers her a position in a nearby state 
without questioning her certificate. She teaches for two years 
without being required to have a certificate. At that time a 
school survey shows that a number of teachers lack certifi- 
cates, this teacher among others. In the meantime she has 
proved herself a competent and successful teacher of Home 
Economics. What should be the superintendent’s attitude 
toward such a teacher? How may he save her to the pro- 
fession ? 
3. For many years it was the custom to hire in the city 
of R—— only college graduates properly certificated for ath- 
letic directors. This was required by the state high school 
board of athletic control. The president and a few other 
members of the board decided to run the local schools as 
they pleased. They hired a high-school graduate, the pro- 
prietor of a local sport-goods store, and assigned him to coach 
the football team. The county superintendent on request of 
the president of the local board issued a temporary certifi- 
cate. After three months this certificate was illegally re- 
newed. The state athletic board held a hearing and on the 
evidence barred the local high school from the state asso- 
ciation. Public opinion was aroused. The president resigned 
from the school board. The board realized its mistake. The 
coach was let out and the necessary steps were taken for 
the hiring of a new athletic director with proper qualifica- 
tions. The reinstatement in the state athletic association 
followed. What principles of certification were violated? 
4. A teacher without a certificate contends that she is a 
better teacher than four-fifths of those who have certificates. 
You know from your observation that her contention is cor- 
rect. You have the power to issue a temporary one-year 
certificate but you hesitate to do it in her case as it will 
establish a precedent. What principle might you cite to 
defend yourself in this case? 
5. Most of the principals in the grade schools of R—— 
have life certificates secured twenty years ago. The required 
training has since been increased to normal school gradua- 
tion. The superintendent insists that the principals should
-P-A-G-E-131
PROBLEMS OF CERTIFICATION 113 
  comply with the new requirements. To what extent should 
the certification laws of the state be retroactive? 
6. Miss L——, foreign born of foreign parents, is a hard- 
working, conscientious teacher. She finally manages to 
graduate from the state normal school. She has a marked 
foreign accent. She contends that having been allowed to 
graduate, the state should secure her a position. She is tried 
out in F: , but not given a permanent appointment. She 
insists that she should have a permanent position. The super- 
intendent explains to her that the possession of a certificate 
is no guarantee of employment and no obligation on anyone’s 
part to employ her. What assistance or advice might the 
superintendent give her? What other positions might she 
well fill and still capitalize her normal school training?

  CHAPTER VII 
PROBLEMS IN SELECTING TEACHERS 
Teachers seeking positions—The mobility of the 
teaching profession is rather alarming. Not only must 
beginners find places in which their interests and ca- 
pacities find the fullest expression, but also many of 
the experienced teachers are restless. They are con- 
stantly shifting from place to place, partly from 
necessity but largely in search of change, broader ex- 
perience, advancement, and more salary. ‘‘Fluidity’’ 
or mobility characterize the teaching profession to a 
much greater extent than any of the other learned 
professions. 
Throughout the year, personal and written applica- 
tions are constantly being received by school officers, 
many times outnumbering the vacancies in the local 
school system. Such applications must be given cour- 
teous attention and treatment. 
Positions seeking teachers.—Furthermore, occasion- 
ally during the year and invariably at the end of the 
year, new teachers must be found for old positions left 
vacant by resignations or dismissals and for new posi- 
tions created by increased enrollments, increased effi- 
ciency, and expansions in the program of studies. 
Necessity for a personnel office—Consequently, 
school officials must maintain an employment or per- 
sonnel office. In school systems employing only a few

  116 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
new teachers each year the personnel office may be 
earried, as was Lincoln’s post office, ‘‘in his hat.’’ But 
in large school systems the number of new teachers 
required each year may run into the hundreds and, in 
a few instances, even into the thousands. 
Most school officers consider that the sole purpose 
of a personnel department is the selection and place- 
ment of new teachers. While selection is of primary 
importance and the success of other aspects of per- 
sonnel administration depends in large measure upon 
the efficiency with which selection is made, it is only 
half the battle. ‘‘The task of the personnel manager 
is only begun when the worker has been selected and 
put on the job. The need then arises for so cultivat- 
ing and developing the worker through leadership, in- 
centive, training, and other avenues of influence as to 
develop further and further his effectiveness in his 
work and consequently to increase his own sense of — 
achievement and his own happiness,’’ is the comment 
of W. D. Scott. 
Significance of selection.—The best means of improv- 
ing a school system is to improve the teachers. One 
of the most effective means of improving the teaching 
corps is by wise selection. The greatest source of 
waste in education results from faulty adjustment be- 
tween the teacher and her work, largely due to wrong 
selection and placement. It is an axiom that the 
teacher will find the greatest satisfaction in her work 
when she is lost in it, and she is never lost in it unless 
she is very much interested in it, qualified for it, and 
appreciated by those in authority. Misfits not only 
cost money and time, but make both themselves and
-P-A-G-E-135
    
PROBLEMS IN SELECTING TEACHERS 117 
others unhappy. To reduce waste in education and 
to increase human happiness it is necessary to study 
carefully each individual applicant with reference to 
her best capacities and interests and to place her in 
a position where those capacities and interests can 
best find expression. 
Who should do the selecting?—There is but one an- 
swer to this question, namely—the best qualified per- 
son. The proper selection of teachers is undoubtedly 
the chief means of building up an efficient system of 
schools. A layman doesn’t know teaching and usually 
will not exercise unbiased judgment in selecting teach- 
ers. He is often moved by trivial, personal, political, 
social, charitable, religious, or other influences. One 
of the chief reasons for the low efficiency of American 
public schools is due to the fact that in the past lay- 
men, ignorant of what constitutes teaching skill, have 
selected most of the teachers. Fortunately, that day 
is passing. The public is demanding better teachers, 
and boards .of education are delegating the right of 
selection to expert officials. {The superintendent of 
schools and his co-workers should select the ‘‘new’’ 
teachers. The person who has to work with the teacher 
should always be consulted before the selection is made. 
No principal or supervisor should be deprived of the 
right of passing judgment on new teachers that they 
must direct. 
Superintendents should not be afraid to assume the 
power of selecting and appointing teachers. The 
chances are, that crude as their methods and results 
may be, they are much more efficient than those used 
by most board members. Until the superintendent is  
-P-A-G-E-136
  
  118 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
recognized and given full power in the matter of hir- 
ing and firing teachers, as are managers of business 
plants and factories, inefficiency will continue. The 
city superintendent’s position is comparable to that 
of a city or factory manager. The more power and 
authority centralized in one man’s hands, the greater 
the chance of getting the job well done. As we learn 
to trust experts, responsibility will be centralized and 
efficiency increased. 
What should be the motive in selecting teachers?— 
A teacher should never seek a position for which she 
knows she is not qualified. Nor should she use per- 
sonal, political, social, religious, or other partisan in- 
fluences in seeking the position, or knowingly allow 
others to use such influence in her behalf. No school 
official should, in selecting teachers, be compelled by 
social influences of any nature to select teachers who 
are not qualified. In Los Angeles, the system of select- 
ing teachers is based solely upon merit as determined 
by the competitive examination. The rules of the board 
of education read: ‘‘The system of selecting teachers 
is based solely upon merit as determined by the com- 
petitive examination. The employment of any sort 
of personal, political or social influence to secure ap- 
pointments to the teaching force, or the urging of any 
consideration other than fitness for the work of teach- 
ing, as a ground for such appointments, is held to be 
an act of unprofessional conduct and is strictly for- 
bidden.’’ (Special regulation of the Board of Hduca- 
tion.) This is the standard in operation in the business 
world. Business methods should be more fully applied 
to public education.
-P-A-G-E-137
PROBLEMS IN SELECTING TEACHERS * 119 
  The occupational description—Before attempting to 
fill a position one should have clearly in mind the kind 
of work that is to be performed and the type of per- 
son needed for its performance. The tendency to rely 
upon memory is altogether too prevalent. Memory 
may serve fairly well where only one or two positions 
are to be filled. Even in such cases an occupational 
description is preferable. How often have we ob- 
served superintendents and supervisors fumbling 
through applications, references, and interviews vainly 
attempting to select teachers for positions about which 
they know little or nothing. 
In a sense the best person to fill a position is one 
who has worked at that particular job and studies it 
impersonally. The next best is the principal or super- 
visor who has studied the position from many differ- 
ent angles and especially from the comparative view- 
point that comes to one who has several similar posi- 
tions under his or her supervision. Where the 
superintendent has a large number of positions to keep 
in mind he would be foolish, indeed, to expect to keep 
all of them in his memory. An occupational descrip- 
tion is needed for at least each type of work. Fortu- 
nately, while the teaching personnel may run into the 
hundreds, the actual number of different types of posi- 
tions in teaching is considerably less. 
An occupational description of supervisory positions. 
‘What do supervisors do? From time to time this 
question must be answered, not only in filling positions 
but also in satisfying teachers, board members, and 
others who may question the necessity of such officers. 
The following occupational description used in Detroit

The function of an occupational description—A dis- 
tinction should be made between an occupational de- 
scription and a work sheet. A work sheet is a program 
for a room plus other routine details like lesson plans, 
courses of study, assignments, and other specific direc- 
tions to show the new teacher just how to begin her 
first day’s or week’s program. The function and need 
of a careful occupational description is well illustrated 
by a situation which recently arose in the writer’s ex- 
perience. He was called upon to fill, within two weeks, 
eighteen positions in the school system over which he 
presided. These vacancies were created by resigna- 
tions, for one reason or another, in a staff of approxi- 
mately seven hundred. On page 123 is a copy of the 
requisition blank made out two weeks in advance. 
With one of these positions the superintendent was 
intimately familiar, having at one time taught history 
in the seventh and eighth grades. With the remaining 
seventeen positions, he was familiar only through the 
experience that comes from observation and supervi- 
sion over a period of years. He had not, up to this 
time, formulated an occupational description before at- 
tempting to fill a vacancy. He was convinced that such 
a description would be a distinct aid in selecting a new 
teacher and proceeded in the following manner to ana- 
lyze each vacancy.

He asked the assistant superintendent, the super- 
visor of the particular grade, the principal of the 
building, and a teacher in a similar position each to 
write an occupational description of the position in 
question. They were to keep in mind the following 
things: (1) the duties of the position, (2) the charac- 
ter of the work, (3) the amount of the work, (4) the 
number and type of pupils, (5) the hours of work, (6) 
the minimum educational qualifications, (7) the addi- 
tional qualifications such as education, special train-
-P-A-G-E-142
  124 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
ing, and technical skill, (8) the pre-service experience 
needed, (9) the working conditions, (10) the physical 
requirements, and (11) the special personal qualities 
that seem desirable. They were also asked to add any 
other items of information that in their judgment 
might prove helpful. 
From the four different analyses a composite occu- 
pational description for each type of position was for- 
mulated. The occupational description of a 6-A posi- 
tion in a platoon school was as follows: 
Duties and character of the work.—This 6-A position 
is a home room and has been filled for the past six 
weeks by a substitute. Platoons No. 13 and No. 14 are 
composed of 79 pupils, 42 and 37 respectively. The 
teacher teaches six periods of 45 minutes each every 
school day. She has one 45-minute period free each 
morning and afternoon. She must be in the school 
house between the hours of 8:15 and 11: 30, and 12: 45 
to 4:00 o’clock daily. The teacher teaches two read- 
ing classes, one arithmetic class, one spelling and writ- 
ing class and supervises two study periods. A part of 
each study period is devoted to some phase of written 
English and the rest of the time is devoted to study 
helps in any of the other subjects as outlined by the 
different special teachers. 
Minimum qualifications—A teacher who is appointed 
to fill this position should hold a life certificate. She 
should have had at least one year’s successful teaching 
in a sixth grade. Her recommendations should show 
that she knows the subject matter, writes and speaks 
good English, that she understands and is able to direct 
the activities of sixth grade children in an educative
-P-A-G-E-143
    PROBLEMS IN SELECTING TEACHERS 125 
way, and that she is willing to codperate with pupils, 
fellow teachers, and other school officers. 
Working conditions.—This 6-A room is a half base- 
ment room adjoining the boys’ toilet which sometimes 
is not as pleasant as many rooms. There are 45 seats 
and desks fastened to the floor. The windows are high 
and on dark days are hardly sufficient to light the room. 
Some teachers complain of dampness. 
Physical requirements—The teacher who is em- 
ployed for this position should not be a nervous type. 
She should not be affected by the fact that the room 
must sometimes be artificially lighted and perhaps a 
little damp. She should be an encouraging sort of per- 
son who makes good in spite of her surroundings 
instead of because of them. 
Two sources of supply.—There are inside and out- 
side sources of supply. By inside we mean the per- 
sonnel already within the organization. While inside 
sources are numerically much more restricted, they 
are of greater value and should always be exhausted 
before resorting to outside sources. Promotion from 
within is sound in education as in business and 
industry. 
The inside supply—School principals, department 
heads, supervisors, and superintendents are human 
and naturally like to keep their personnel intact. They 
do not want to be robbed either to benefit the individ- 
ual or some other department. When threatened with 
a change in personnel, they are apt to complain, 
‘“What’s the use of developing a strong personnel if 
from time to time my superiors are going to rob me 
of my best people?’’ ‘‘Why do they make my depart-
-P-A-G-E-144
  126 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
ment a training school for the rest of the organiza- 
tion?’’ Such complaints are but natural. No school 
officer likes to break in new teachers. 
However, everyone, unless they have stopped grow- 
ing, looks forward to advancement. Most teachers 
want opportunities for further growth. To grow is 
human and should not be denied. The success and well- 
being of the organization should not be purchased at 
the expense of the individual. Individuals should not 
be required to ‘‘remain stationary’’ simply because 
their superior officer’s organization may be tempo- 
rarily inconvenienced. School officers who take the 
“remain stationary’’ attitude fail to appreciate that 
such a policy inevitably leads to stagnation and lack of 
enterprise on the part of the teachers and that a con- 
stant flow upward, even if upward means at times out 
of the subject, grade, building, or department, is the 
best thing in the world for morale and efficiency. Usu- 
ally when this point of view is made clear, the objec- 
tions to promotions from within are withdrawn. 
School officers may very materially improve their 
methods of training teachers in service by adopting 
a conscious policy of promotion from within, and by 
clearly demonstrating the advantages of such a policy 
to both the individuals and the departments concerned. 
In order that teachers from within the staff may be 
selected and promoted intelligently, the personnel de- 
partment must know the capacities, interests, and 
achievements of each member of the teaching corps. 
A qualification blank may be used for this purpose. On 
this blank a record should be kept for every teacher 
in the system showing: (1) the application blank origi-
-P-A-G-E-145
  PROBLEMS IN SELECTING TEACHERS 127 
nally submitted, (2) the references from former em- 
ployers, (3) the record of her principal’s and super- 
visor’s estimates, (4) the record of her training in 
service, (5) the record of her special contribution to 
the system, that is, her interest and devotion to teach- 
ing, (6) her performance and achievement records, 
both for the teacher herself and for the pupils who are 
from time to time under her supervision, (7) her in- 
telligence scores and ratings, (8) her physical fitness, 
(9) her intellectual, moral, and social qualities, and 
(10) all other information that may assist school offi- 
cers in evaluating her for promotion. 
The outside sources of supply——One may go in 
search of teachers or wait for the applicants to apply 
at the office either in person or by letter. The first 
rethod is called ‘‘scouting.’’? A growing number of 
school men are refusing to hire teachers whom they 
have never seen teach. Scouting for teachers in nearby 
towns and cities takes considerable time but is an ex- . 
cellent method of recruiting a high-class experienced 
teaching staff. 
Scouting in normal schools, colleges, and teachers’ 
agencies is also constantly practiced. On such trips 
one is seldom able to see the teacher in action and, 
therefore, must rely on the judgment of critic teachers 
and those in charge of the appointment bureaus. 
The second method is to wait at home and either 
receive the applications that come in or write and tele- 
phone the outside agencies asking for applicants in 
case the number or quality of those received at the 
office is unsatisfactory. Occasionally, it is possible to 
pick up locally unemployed ex-service teachers who
-P-A-G-E-146
  128 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
have been married or who, for other reasons, have 
stopped teaching for a time and now desire to resume 
their former occupations. All of these sources are and 
should be used. 
What should one know about an applicant?—Most 
superintendents, if they spoke frankly, would acknowl- 
edge their own uncertainty and inability in the matter 
of selecting applicants. Indisputable proof of success 
is almost impossible to find, especially among young, 
untried teachers. While no information about a 
teacher may be considered irrelevant, in the very 
nature of things, a complete ‘‘teachergraph’’ is 
impossible. 
Many very successful school officers have no con- 
scious method of selecting teachers. They do it by 
‘‘intuition.’? There is no evidence that those who 
collect exhaustive accounts of the qualifications of can- 
didates are any more successful in their selections than 
those who scrutinize carefully a few outstanding essen- 
tials. The use of an occupational description helps 
define the job. A qualification card for each applicant 
will show something of the applicant’s fitness. 
The essential qualities—Clapp, White, Dutton, and 
Ruediger and Strayer obtained the opinions of a num- 
ber of superintendents and principals as to the ten 
most essential characteristics of a good teacher. On 
the next page is a list of qualities arranged in their or- 
der of importance from the most essential to the least. 
These terms are vague and indefinite. Ruediger and 
Strayer show that there is the highest correlation be- 
tween ‘‘the ability to keep school’’ and success, and 
the lowest correlation between ‘‘health’’ and success.

There is a median correlation between the amount of 
experience and success. Boyce thinks that personal 
appearance is of far greater importance in a grade 
teacher than in a high-school teacher. Just why he 
thinks so is not clear. Haisley finds that teachers with 
iow I. Q.’s are seldom successful unless they possess 
certain compensating traits. On the other hand, he 
found little difference in the success of those with 
medium or high I. Q.’s. Successful high-school teach- 
ers possessed a higher I. Q., on the average, than 
successful elementary teachers, probably because of 
the greater difficulty of the subject matter. Knight 
had associates and superiors of teachers rank the 
teachers under them as to success. Then he studied 
various qualities to see if there were any relations. 
He found no quality correlating with handwriting. 
However, some people still hesitate to hire a teacher 
who submits a typewritten application or whose hand- 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
    130 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
writing is poor. Knight found no correlation with age; 
only very slight with experience; none with profes- 
sional improvement; slight with I. Q. and none with 
normal school marks. . With these results he decided 
that there was no objective basis for selecting teachers 
and set about devising one. The result was the Knight- 
Franzen Professional Test for Elementary School 
Teachers which is being completed and refined at the 
University of Iowa. The authors hold that a high score 
on this test necessitates just the type of skill and in- 
formation required of an elementary teacher. The test 
is described in Chapter XV of this book. 
Application and reference blanks.—Almack tried to 
answer the question by studying application and refer- 
ence blanks. In analyzing application blanks, he 
tabulated in their order of frequency the items of infor- 
mation sought in 156 different blanks. The list in- 
cluded 70 different items from application blanks and 
55 different items from reference blanks. The 25 items 
most frequently called for are as given in Table VI. 
Of the 70 qualities enumerated, small cities lead with 
46, agencies 45, appointment bureaus 45, large cities 30, 
and states and counties 25. There was general agree- 
ment on only 18 points, and only 14 are deemed of 
such importance as to receive a majority vote of the 
156. Over 50% of the questions were asked fewer than 
10 times, and 12 were asked only once. Only about 
20% of the characteristics listed seemed to be essential, 
judging from the frequency that they are called for on 
these blanks. Of the 56 different characteristics on the 
reference blanks, only 8 were required by a majority.

  plication and reference blanks, Almack announced a 
few principles of selection. (1) The minimum essen- 
tials should be included. (2) The obvious may be 
omitted. (3) Where information may be obtained from 
the applicant, it should be done. (4) Questions to 
applicants should be confined to matters of fact, not 
of opinion. (5) Efforts should be made to determine
-P-A-G-E-150
    132 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
the fitness of the candidate for a specific position, not 
simply for school work. 
He classified the factors which enter into considera- 
tion in selecting teachers as (a) absolute, (b) measur- 
able, and (c) opinion. He closed his study with the 
following conclusions: 
1. A great deal of obvious extraneous and irrelevant 
information is gathered by school superintendents re- 
garding the qualifications of applicants for teaching 
positions at the expense of both the superintendent 
and the applicant. 
2. Such a mass of ill-sorted matter renders scientific 
evaluation impossible or exceedingly difficult. 
3. A survey of application and reference forms 
shows that but few salient points in teacher selection 
exist. 
4. These should be selected as criteria for a basis of 
judging the fitness of applicants for specific positions. 
5. So far as possible these should be rated in an 
objective manner. 
6. Teacher training institutions are not preparing 
teachers along lines of many of the requisites on which 
their desirability and success depend. 
The use of intelligence tests.—It would seem as if 
intelligence tests could be used to advantage in select- 
ing teachers. They were used to great advantage in 
selecting officers of the army during the World War. 
Surely, the great army of approximately seven hun- 
dred thousand public school teachers who have in trust 
the children of the nation should be as scientifically 
and wisely selected as those who in a great crisis de- 
fend the nation against aggression. It is not strange,  
-P-A-G-E-151
  ® 
PROBLEMS IN SELECTING TEACHERS 133 
  therefore, that various attempts are being made to 
apply intelligence tests in recruiting the teaching staff. 
What kind of natural ability is required for success 
in teaching? Where can we find enough of it to supply 
the present lack and future needs? The teacher’s 
work, minute by minute, is the business end of any 
educational proposition. How can teaching quality be 
improved? Many hustling and progressive beginners 
slow up. They get stale and, professionally, ‘‘sour.’’ 
Relieved of sharp necessity for improvement, many 
slip back to a standard barely high enough to hold the 
job. Clearly, in the vocational guidance, selection, and 
placement of teachers there is needed a much better 
conception of the personality and intelligence that suc- 
cess in teaching demands. 
The general intelligence of teachers.—A knowledge 
of. the teacher’s general intelligence is easily obtain- 
able, and, according to the meager studies thus far 
available, apparently valuable up to a certain point. 
Certainly, we ought to protect children against the 
necessity of sitting under teachers of low intelligence. 
The fact that some persons of low intelligence get into 
the profession cannot be disputed. 
Bliss points out that in one high school ‘‘the average 
intelligence quotient for the whole senior class was 
102; for those who elected teaching it was 98; for those 
who elected medicine and engineering it was 121.’? He 
then very properly raises the question, ‘‘Is there not a 
line below which not enough mental ability exists to 
make the individual at all promising in spite of other 
desirable qualities?’’ In order to test this assump- 
tion, Bliss gave the Terman Group Test for mental 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
134 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
  ability in 42 county normal schools in Ohio one year, 
and 49 schools the next year. The distribution of 
scores showed that ‘‘persons of all grades of ability 
were entering the teaching profession, and there 
seemed no ground for assuming that any strongly 
modifying selective process had been at work.’? The 
distribution of scores was as follows: 
  Year 
1921-22 
7 per cent of students 92 
20 per cent of students... 112 
25 per cent of students... 119 
50 per cent of students... 141 
75 per cent of students... 162 
80 per cent of students 167 
Following this testing program the 7 percentile was 
taken as the threshold point. That is, students whose 
general intelligence score was 92 or below on this 
test were singled out for elimination. ‘‘The seven 
percentile mark was chosen because that point is com- 
monly accepted as cutting off the distinctly question- 
able portion of any distribution not too highly 
selected.’’ 
Out of 1,305 students tested, 55 or slightly over four 
per cent were advised to take up other lines of work 
rather than continue preparing for teaching. The re- 
ports show that 44 withdrew following this advice. 
Bliss further attempted to determine how much abil- 
ity a teacher needs in order to succeed by asking county 
superintendents to rank in all 77 teachers equally 
chosen as to number from the high I. Q.’s, median 
I. Q.’s, and low I. Q.’s, of the previous year’s class.
-P-A-G-E-153
  
  PROBLEMS IN SELECTING TEACHERS 135 
Superintendents were asked to rate the success of these 
77 teachers in terms of 1, 2, 3,4, and 5. The distribu- 
tion of the 77 cases according to mental ability and 
according to success in teaching was as follows: 
1 2 3 4 5 
Mental ability (5.6: 21 2 32 + 24 
Teaching success ........... 4 24 33) 13 3 
The figures 1, 2, 8, 4, and 5 signify superior, excel- 
lent, good, fair, and poor, respectively. The results of 
this and other tests led Bliss to the following conclu- 
sions: ‘‘It is apparent from this study that our best 
prospects for success are to be found in individuals of 
above-average mental ability. Therefore, while keep- 
ing in mind that we cannot find enough superior people 
to fill the profession, we can constantly strive to get 
more and more of this better type. We need not gain- 
say the merit of the teacher of average ability who 
possesses to a marked degree many wonderful qualities 
that enter into the successful teacher’s make-up. But 
we are sure to be wrong if we minimize mental ability, 
if we expect other qualities to offset its lack, and if we 
do not stand for the application of some selective proc- 
ess by teacher-training institutions. This limited in- 
vestigation shows that one can expect teaching success 
to keep reasonable pace with mental ability.’’ 
The competitive examination—A number of large 
cities require a competitive examination of all appli- 
eants regardless of credentials or experience. Usually 
arrangements cannot be made to take the oral or the 
written examination at any other time or place than 
that specified by the superintendent. No one is ad-  
-P-A-G-E-154
    136 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
mitted to the examination except by the superintendent 
and a personal interview is always required. 
The purpose of the examination is to determine the 
relative merits of the applicants and to rank them in 
their order of merit as shown (1) by the written ex- 
amination, (2) by the applicants’ references, (3) by the 
oral examination, and (4) by all other information 
gained from any source. In Los Angeles, for example, 
“The written examination is designed to discover the 
intelligence of the teacher and his ability to compre- 
hend and present educational problems and situations 
as well as his attitude toward them. It is in two parts 
and is not concerned primarily with subjects of instruc- 
tion. Part 1 consists of a short, simple standardized 
test. Part 2 calls for the discussion of a subject. A 
list of topics is submitted from which the applicant may 
choose a subject for a thesis. These topics touch upon 
the theory and practice of education, methods of in- 
struction, special aims and methods of teaching the 
different subjects, classroom management, school hy- 
giene, educational psychology, the history and philoso- 
phy of education and the relations of the school to other 
social institutions and to life. 
In the written examination the papers are designated 
by number and in no case may the applicant write his 
name upon his paper. The object of this is to insure 
impersonal judgment on the part of those grading the 
papers.’’ 
The eligible list—The eligible list is made up of 
those who have complied with all requirements and 
have received in the competitive examination a mark 
of 85% or more. (Those receiving less than 85% are  
-P-A-G-E-155
    PROBLEMS IN SELECTING TEACHERS 137 
regarded as failing; such candidates may be admitted 
to any succeeding examination, but in case of succes- 
sive failures may not present themselves for the test 
more than three times.) The order of names on the 
eligible list is in the order of merit as indicated by 
the general average of all marks received by the 
candidate. 
Names of candidates remain on the eligible list for 
one year only from the date of examination except that 
the names of all having a standing of 91% to 94% are 
retained for two years, and those with a standing of 
95% or over, for the period of three years. The list 
is revised after each examination and candidates’ 
names ranked in the order of their excellence. 
A place on the eligible list does not assure the appli- 
cant of an appointment as his name may not be reached 
or existing vacancies may be of a character which the 
applicant cannot fill. 
All appointments to the teaching staff are made in 
the order in which the names appear on the eligible 
list, subject to civil service rules, except that in the 
high school department any one of the ten highest on 
the list may be chosen. 
When the eligible list is exhausted, or when there is 
no one on that list who can perform the duties required, 
a preliminary interview of candidates by superintend- 
ents may be made subject to the next ensuing regular 
oral and written examination, which complete exami- 
nation all emergeney appointees are required to take. 
All teachers enter the Los Angeles city schools as 
substitutes ; they beeome probationary teachers as soon 
as openings occur. After two full years of satisfactory
-P-A-G-E-156
    138 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
work as probationary teachers, they may be promoted 
to the regular staff. 
There is no substitute for the personal interview.— 
The information contained on the application, refer- 
ence, and qualification blanks, together with the intelli- 
gence scores are valuable in order to weed out those 
who are, and those who are not, especially qualified 
for the position in question. Those who are weeded 
out lack the capacities and interests required by the 
work or they possess other qualifications which would 
make them more valuable elsewhere. 
In the preliminary sorting and interviews, only gen- 
eral qualifications are considered, such as, the teacher’s 
training and experience, her age, health, mental and 
physical vigor, and her personality so far as it can be 
observed from her photograph and the blanks sub- 
mitted. Those who survive the first sorting process 
should be re-interviewed in order that the school officer 
may choose the best from among them. 
At this point, selection begins to be more difficult. 
Consideration must be given not so much to general 
qualifications as to the other finer points of personality 
and technical skill. The interview should proceed in 
an easy yet decisive and businesslike manner. The in- 
terviewer should have in mind, or in front of him, the 
occupational description and the application, refer- 
ence, and qualification blanks properly filled out. He 
may check over with the applicant some of the items 
of information in order to review the case and at the 
same time get a line on the applicant. 
He should satisfy himself on questions like the fol-  
-P-A-G-E-157
  PROBLEMS IN SELECTING TEACHERS 139 
lowing: Is she a negative, neutral, or positive type of 
person? Is she frank and sincere or the opposite? Is 
she queer or freakish in any outstanding way either 
physically or mentally? Is she calmly and intelligently 
sympathetic? Has she good sense? Keen insight? 
Quick decision? Is she mentally alert, slow or slug- 
gish? Is she self-reliant and self-directing? Is she 
self-sacrificing? Is she cheerful? Is she well-bred in 
manners, English, conversation, voice, dress, and per- 
sonal appearance. Will she avoid or enjoy factional 
strife? Will she avoid listening to or peddling trouble? 
Does she bear a false tongue? Will she talk about the 
former teacher, peculiar pupils or parents or associ- 
ates? Will she avoid friendships pushed upon her? 
Above all, will she attend to her own business, organ- 
ize, administer, discipline, and teach her room or sub- 
ject effectively? 
As soon as the interviewer has decided in his mind 
that the applicant is personally desirable, he should 
proceed to check her technical knowledge, skill, ideals, 
and craftsmanship. This may be done by asking her 
to tell what she thinks a teacher for the particular 
position under consideration should know and do. 
Read the occupational description to her and note her 
reaction. Ask a few technical questions and note the 
speed and sureness of the responses. 
It is usually best for the interviewer to be somewhat 
negative throughout the interview in order to keep 
from raising false hopes in the mind of the applicant. 
If there is no hope for the applicant she should be 
made to feel it as early in the interview as possible
-P-A-G-E-158
  
  140 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
in order that she may withdraw or be withdrawn as 
gracefully as possible. It is quite unfair to leave the 
applicant in doubt except for politic purposes on cer- 
tain occasions. Sooner or later the decision must be 
given. Keep your own counsel until you are sure of 
your verdict. Finally, convey your decision kindly 
and courteously but with an air of finality that leaves 
no doubt as to your position. 
‘ Main points of the chapter.—1l. Teachers seek posi- 
tions and positions seek teachers. This necessitates 
the maintenance of an employment or personnel office, 
the size of which depends on the size of the school 
system. 
2. But personnel work is only half done when selec- 
tion is over. The teacher must be cultivated and de- 
\ veloped not only to increase her efficiency but also to 
increase her happiness. 
8. Selection should be made by professional experts 
n consultation with supervisors and principals. 
4, Only one motive should operate in the selection 
/of teachers, namely who is the best available person 
for the money? 
5. An occupational description for each type of work 
should be in the hands of the school officer before he 
attempts to fill a position. Such a description is not 
a work sheet or job-analysis but a general outline of 
the character of the position and the type of teacher 
needed. An excellent example of such a description 
is the one used in Detroit to show what supervisors 
do. 
6. The need of an occupational description is illus- 
trated in the writer’s experience in filling 18 positions

in two weeks, only one of which he was familiar with 
from experience. 
7. Two general sources of supply are available: (1) 
inside sources and (2) outside sources. 
8. The individual must not be sacrificed for the 
organization. Promotions from within are excellent 
for morale and efficiency if properly handled. 
9. In order to promote from within, a qualification 
card must be kept up to date for every person in the 
organization. 
10. The outside sources may be reached by scouting 
or by waiting for applicants to come to the office or to 
apply by letter. 
11. The general qualities that all applicants should 
possess are personality, sympathy, sincerity, optimism, 
initiative, teaching skill, address, morality, ete. No 
one list can be compiled because these terms are too 
general in meaning. 
12. Scientific attempts to discover the qualities that 
make for success are meager in their results. 
13. Applicants should be selected for specific posi- 
tions rather than for positions in general. Objective 
rating of applicants is desirable though difficult to 
obtain. 
14. Application and reference blanks are very gen- 
eral in the information requested. Obvious, extrane- 
ous, and irrelevant information is gathered. 
15. The use of intelligence tests in selecting teachers 
is only partially successful. However, the best pros- 
pects for success are to be found in individuals of 
above-average ability. 
16. Competitive examinations are occasionally used
-P-A-G-E-160
142 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
to sort out candidates and to arrange them in their 
order of merit. 
17. There is no substitute for the personal interview. 
The application, reference, and qualification blanks 
should be checked during the interview and the appli- 
cant should know your decision as soon as possible. 
PROBLEMS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
1. The superintendent has a vacancy for which two ecan- 
didates are, so far as he is able to judge, equally qualified. 
One is a home teacher, the other is an out-of-town teacher. 
How should he decide? Why? 
2. Formulate a set of rules defining, for the board of 
education, the ideal division of powers that should exist be- 
tween the board and the superintendent in the matter of 
selecting teachers. } 
8. The high-school principal complains that he has no 
voice in the selection of his teachers and, therefore, he does 
not feel that he should be called upon to say whether or not 
they should be retained. What is right in his position? 
What is wrong? 
4. To what extent should a superintendent attempt to 
keep a balanced staff with respect to religious denominations? 
Why? 
5. Visit a grade room and write an occupational descrip- 
tion of the worker-in-her-work unit that you would be willing 
to follow in filling a vacancy in that room if it should occur. 
6. To what extent should state departments of public 
instruction and state teachers’ associations maintain teachers’ 
agencies? Why? 
7. What are the dangers in the policy of promotion from 
within? 
8. Write out a sample application and a sample reference 
blank that you would be willing to recommend for adoption 
to a board of education in a city of 5,000. Do the same for 
a city of 25,000, and a city of 100,000. 
9. Formulate a set of general questions you would ask 
candidates for positions in grades one to six. 
   
-P-A-G-E-161
  
  PROBLEMS IN SELECTING TEACHERS 143 
10. Make a special study of all the literature pertaining 
to intelligence tests for purposes of selecting teachers. Sum- 
marize your conclusions. 
11. Write out the procedure that you propose to follow 
establishing a civil service list by competitive examination. 
12. Enumerate some of the best methods of (a) closing 
an interview, and of (b) letting a candidate know her appli- 
cation is unsuccessful. 
13. Following is an extract from a personnel survey of a 
paper mill industry, taken from Scott and Clothier, Personnel 
Management, page 609. As you read the extract substitute 
words that would apply to the teaching profession and note 
the parallel application. 
“<There is a belief in the paper industry, that paper making 
is more nearly an art than a science. While this may be true 
in part, we cannot subscribe to the corollary which seems to 
go with this belief: ‘that paper making cannot be taught but 
must be acquired by long association and a sort of organic 
absorption.’ We think the present methods of training can 
be improved in four ways: It can more effectively select 
the men for training. The time spent on successive steps of 
progress can be shortened. The time spent by the supervisory 
force which does the training can be economized. The prog- 
ress of an individual can be known and the completeness of 
his mastery accurately determined.’’

  CHAPTER VIII 
APPOINTING AND INTRODUCING THE TEACHER TO HER WORK 
Problems following selection.—Selection is never 
completed until the teacher is actually appointed, given 
a contract, assigned a position, located in a suitable 
home, and introduced to her work and her immediate 
associates. 
How teachers are appointed—Ballou has made the 
most recent and complete analysis of the methods now 
used in appointing teachers. He studied the practices 
of 73 communities including nearly fifty per cent of all 
the teachers employed in cities. He divided cities into 
three classes, C, B, and A, with reference to their 
method of appointing teachers. 
“C” class methods.—He puts cities in the C class in 
which it is the prevailing practice not to allow the 
superintendent to participate in the appointment of 
teachers. This means that the superintendent is prac- 
tically helpless in the matter of selecting and appoint- 
ing the teaching staff. There are, according to Ballou, 
three different practices in C class cities. 
‘In one city, the board itself makes the appointment. 
Nashville, Tennessee, is the only city in the 73 studied 
where this practice still prevails. 
In the second type of C class cities a committee of 
the board recommends and the board itself appoints. 
145
-P-A-G-E-164
146 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
    This practice is followed in Fall River, Massachusetts; 
Charlotte, North Carolina; and Charleston, South 
Carolina. 
In the third type of C class cities a committee of the 
board makes the appointment subject to the approval 
of the board. Wheeling, West Virginia, is the only 
example. In Wheeling the board consists of 21 mem- 
bers elected by the people from sub-districts. There 
is a standing teachers’ committee of the board for each 
district. This committee appoints the teachers. 
All these methods are extremely poor and dangerous. 
Laymen select and appoint teachers and while no doubt 
the superintendent is frequently considered he has no 
power to stop the operation of local, personal, politi- 
cal, social, religious, and charitable influences. Meth- 
ods of this kind should be abandoned everywhere and 
as soon as possible. 
“B” class methods.—A better method of selecting 
and appointing teachers is practiced in the great ma- 
jority of cities. The superintendent, as the profes- 
sional expert, acts for the board and takes the initial 
step in making the selection and recommendation. His 
recommendations are transmitted to the board, or to a 
committee of the board and the board completes the 
appointment. This is not the best method but is a 
decided advance over the practices described above. 
There are three types of practices in B class cities. 
In one group of cities, the superintendent nominates 
teachers direct to the board. It is his duty to make 
such recommendations. The duty is assigned to the 
superintendent by custom or precedent or, as in Pitts- 
burgh, by a rule of the board which reads like this:
-P-A-G-E-165
  APPOINTING AND INTRODUCING THE TEACHER 147 
“No teacher shall receive an appointment in the schools 
of Pittsburgh who is not recommended to the board by 
the superintendent of schools.’? This practice prevails 
in many cities. 
In another group of cities, the superintendent nomi- 
nates the candidates to a committee of the board. If 
the committee approves, the board makes the appoint- 
ment. This is by far the most common method of 
appointment. It is used in 38 of the 73 cities studied 
by Ballou. The peculiarity of this practice is that the 
superintendent and the committee must act jointly. 
The rule in Chicago is typical: ‘‘The superintendent 
shall make nominations in writing for all vacant posi- 
tions in the educational department to the committee 
on school management, which shall report to the board 
for approval.’’ The practice in Grand Rapids is a 
little different: ‘‘The educational committee shall 
have general supervision of the schools and together 
with the superintendent shall (a) examine all candi- 
dates for teaching, (b) nominate teachers and (¢) rec- 
ommend salaries to be paid.’’ 
In the third group of cities of the B class the super- 
intendent takes the initial step and a committee of 
the board makes the appointment subject to approval 
by the board. This practice differs from the one above 
described inasmuch as the committee makes the ap- 
pointment instead of the board. A few cities follow 
this method. 
“A” class methods.—In a few cities a very superior 
method of selecting and appointing teachers has de- 
veloped. Here, personal, political, and all other factors 
play no part. The superintendent makes the selection
-P-A-G-E-166
  148 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
and the appointment directly and the board approves. 
Boston and Toledo are examples of this practice. In 
this type there is no committee action. In Boston the 
rule wisely requires that subordinate administrative 
officers are to be consulted in making the selections. 
In another group of cities the superintendent makes 
the appointment, a committee approves it, and the 
board confirms it. The only difference between this 
and the last named method is that here the committee 
approves the recommendations and the board confirms 
the action of the committee. This practice is followed 
in Cleveland, Dayton, Burlington, Columbus, and Cin- 
cinnati. 
Finally, the very best practice to be found anywhere 
is found in New Haven, Indianapolis, and a few other 
cities in which the superintendent makes the appoint- 
ment subject only to rejection by the board. Under 
this method appointments do not require the approval 
of the board. If the board does not reject, the appoint- 
ment stands. Surely, the superintendent should have 
the same powers of selection and appointment as man- 
agers of business and industrial establishments. 
The teacher’s contract.—A teacher’s contract, like all 
other labor contracts, is somewhat one-sided. The 
teacher may coerce the board but the board cannot 
coerce the teacher, simply because a person cannot be 
compelled to work against his will. The teacher’s con- 
tract is as much a moral as a legal obligation. 
The best rule is to see that the contract complies with 
the state laws. Then add other features if they are 
deemed essential, such as length of notice either party 
shall observe before the termination of the contract,
-P-A-G-E-167
  
  APPOINTING AND INTRODUCING THE TEACHER 149 
causes for the termination, and the like. In Chapter 
XXII, ‘‘The Legal and Social Status of the Teacher,’’ 
the problem of the contract is dealt with more fully. 
Assigning the teacher a position.—Most teachers’ con- 
tracts reserve the right on the part of the board to 
assign or reassign the teacher at will anywhere in the 
system. This is necessary as the school load shifts 
from time to time. On the absence of such a reserva- 
tion the board would find itself over-loaded at one point 
and under-loaded at other points. Fortunately, this 
reservation is rarely abused. However, greater atten- 
tion to the individual capacities and interests of teach- 
ers, while making assignments, would promote esprit 
de corps. 
In assigning the teacher, the first step of selection is 
complete. The second step is to familiarize her with 
the school system so that this particular teacher-in- 
her-work unit will fit the other units. She should be 
properly introduced to the system and to the particular 
unit to which she is assigned. No doubt a little infor- 
mation has been imparted to the applicant prior to her 
appointment, concerning the history, the traditions, and 
the methods prevalent in that particular school sys- 
tem. But the task of introducing the teacher to her 
work is unfinished until the appointee has her con- 
fidence established and is interested in helping to main- 
tain the ideals and standards held up to her. 
Finding her a home.—The housing problem is one of | 
the most baffling problems that school men face. It is 
especially acute in rural, village, and small towns where 
there is and can be little privacy for a public school 
servant. It is growing more and more acute in large
-P-A-G-E-168
  150 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
cities. The gap between the appointment and the work 
itself has not been bridged until the teacher is estab- 
lished in the right sort of living quarters. Some may 
hold that living conditions are not an item of concern 
for the personnel office. True, it has been neglected 
and it seems to be nobody’s job to see that new teach- 
ers are housed comfortably. But more and more we 
are coming to realize that the living conditions and 
outside moral and social environment have much to do 
with the success or failure of any worker. 
Living conditions present many problems such as (1) 
the problem of the young unmarried teacher living in 
the local hotel and unconsciously laying herself open 
to criticism, (2) the problem of living in the same 
household with school pupils, (3) the problem of liv- 
ing in the same household with a member of the local 
board of education, (4) the problem of living in an 
adjoining town, making it necessary to commute a 
long distance and, (5) the problem of the married 
teacher who must often house his or her family in 
two or three rooms where no real home life or quiet 
place to read or study is possible. 
Certainly all school officers should place themselves 
squarely behind the teacher in her attempt to secure 
adequate living quarters. Teachers’ homes are needed, 
not only in the country where teacherages are begin- 
ning to appear, but in cities where rents are exorbi- 
tant. An entire chapter might well be devoted to this 
question but limited space forbids. Help locate the 
new teacher in a good home. Take an interest in her 
comfort. It is real personnel work of the highest 
value.
-P-A-G-E-169
  APPOINTING AND INTRODUCING THE TEACHER 151 
Introducing the appointee to her work.—The outer- 
office contacts are exceedingly important in helping 
the appointee to become familiar with her work. For 
example, after the superintendent’s ‘‘you are ap- 
pointed’”’ talk, covering the date of the opening of 
school, an explanation of salary schedule, a general 
outline of the traditions, standards and methods of the 
schools in general, and the rules of the board, the 
superintendent should introduce her to the supervisor. 
The supervisor will explain to her more in detail 
just what the work is. Perhaps she will give the ap- 
pointee an outline of the work for the first month, a 
sample of a day’s program, a course of study, and 
other helpful materials and suggestions. 
The supervisor will, if possible, introduce her to 
the principal and one or two associates. From the 
principal she will learn something of the disciplinary 
standards observed in the building, the rules and regu- 
lations of the school, hall, yard, and lunch room duties, 
and other extra-classroom activities. 
A cordial codperative relationship is thus estab- 
lished from the head of the school system to the class- 
room unit itself. But the most beneficial contact of 
_ all for inspiring confidence is the personal conference 
' with another teacher who is successful and sym- 
pathetic. 
Such interviews should, if possible, be arranged for 
the Friday or Saturday prior to the opening of school. 
The new teacher is then ready for her first day, armed 
with real aids, good-will, accurate material and infor- 
mation, and her job well defined. She is inspired by 
the high standards held out to her and bubbling over
-P-A-G-E-170
  152 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
with enthusiasm for her new job. With such a mental 
attitude at the start, her chances for success are much 
greater than are the teacher’s chances who is put down 
in a strange new teaching situation with no aid or 
introduction to her work. 
The “sponsor” system.—The ‘‘sponsor’’ system em- 
ployed by many business firms, notably large depart- 
ment stores, might well be applied to schools. One or 
more teachers in a given building are selected as 
‘sponsors’? to new incoming teachers. They are 
chosen carefully because of superior courtesy, tact, 
loyalty, and real enthusiasm for their profession. 
They act as guides and counselors to all new teachers, 
—assist in finding room and board and make them- 
selves generally helpful during the first weeks when 
perplexing difficulties are sure to creep in which need 
only a word of explanation. The strictly new teacher, 
that is the beginner or novice, needs this sponsoring. 
She is uneasy, somewhat confused, over-sensitive and 
the first days of work may be filled with much doubt 
and depression. A sympathetic personal contact dur- 
ing this critical period, a cheerful word the morning 
of the first day, an escort to the lunch room, introduc- 
tions to her fellow teachers, an offer to answer any 
small problem which she is reluctant to carry to the 
principal, and very soon the new teacher becomes 
acquainted and is happily established in her new work. 
Follow-up work.—The personal contact between the 
superintendent and the classroom teacher must be 
kept in constant repair. The teacher changes and 
grows constantly from her first day of teaching. To 
make the change and growth in the right direction re-
-P-A-G-E-171
  APPOINTING AND INTRODUCING THE TEACHER 153 
quires the utmost care, tutoring and fostering of the 
right tendencies and interests on the part of the per- 
sonnel department. The only way for the personnel 
officers (supervisors, principals, etc,) to keep informed 
as to the capacities and growth of the individual 
teacher is by personal observation and interviews. 
The positive versus the negative mental state——No 
doubt some happily minded person endowed by na- 
ture with a mental state of optimism could easily go 
through the first weeks of a difficult teaching position 
left entirely upon her own resources with no outside 
aids. But such a case is the exception rather than 
the rule. Most new teachers, if left alone and not 
shown any courtesy or interest during this critical 
period, become unhappy. They develop a negative 
mental state. The mole hill of perplexity becomes a 
mountain of serious trouble. So seriously are some 
minor incidents taken that often such a teacher will 
appear in the superintendent’s office at the end of her 
second week with her resignation all written out. 
‘When perhaps all that was needed was just a word 
of reassurance at the right time and place, a sponsor 
or friendly teacher’s encouragement and the negative 
state of mind might have quickly reverted to the con- 
fident, happy positive state. 
The follow-up interview.—The follow-up interview is 
taken for granted or requested of all new teachers. 
Some members of the personnel staff of assistants or 
supervisors prepare for such interviews at the end 
of the first or second week of work. The purpose is 
manifold. There may be adjustments to make as to 
daily program, supplies, number of children handled, 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  154 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
and subject matter. The interviewer should ascertain 
the mental state of the teacher, explain away any fears 
or imaginary troubles and help remove them when 
they are real. The school system’s morale is continu- 
ously repaired by such interviews. The teacher who 
comes to the interview discouraged and unhappy 
should be made to depart with renewed interest, more 
confidence, happy and encouraged. 
The follow-up work of a corps of expert, sym- 
pathetic, and tactful personnel supervisors should lead 
to more general efficiency and, therefore, to greater 
economy of the taxpayer’s money. It should reduce 
the worry and misunderstanding between the teacher 
and her co-workers. It should lead to a more perfect 
coordination of the classroom teacher with the larger 
and broader policies of the school system. It should 
lead to a desire on the part of the teacher for research 
and the highest possible standard in scholarship and 
training. 
Main points of the chapter.—1. Selection is never 
completed until the teacher is appointed, given a con- 
tract, assigned a position, located in a suitable home, 
and properly introduced to her work and her 
associates. 
2. Ballou says there are nine methods of appointing 
teachers. Of the nine methods 3 are C class, 3 B class, 
and 3 A class. The last three are preferable and 
everywhere the superintendent should select and ap- 
point teachers subject only to rejection by the board. 
C. The superintendent does not participate in the 
appointment. 
1. The board itself makes the appointment.
-P-A-G-E-173
APPOINTING AND INTRODUCING THE TEACHER 155 
  2. The committee of the board recommends and the 
board itself appoints. 
3. The committee of the board makes the appoint- 
ment subject to the approval of the board. 
B. The superintendent takes the initial step in mak- 
ing the appointment, and the board, or a committee of 
the board, complete the appointment. 
4. The superintendent nominates and the board 
appoints. 
5. The superintendent nominates the candidates, 
the committee of the board makes the appointment. 
6. The superintendent takes the initial step, a com- 
mittee of the board makes the appointment, subject to 
approval by the board. 
A. The superintendent makes the appointment, and 
a committee of the board and the board confirm it, or 
the board alone approves it, or the appointment is 
effective without confirmation. 
7. The superintendent makes the appointment and 
the board approves it. 
8. The superintendent makes the appointment, a 
committee of the board approves it, and the board con- 
firms it. 
9. The superintendent makes the appointment, sub- 
ject only to rejection by the board. 
3. The teacher’s contract is, like other contracts, 
one-sided. One cannot be compelled to work against 
her will. It is a moral as well as a legal obligation. 
4. The board is justified in reserving the right to 
assign and reassign teachers as the school load shifts. 
But greater attention should be given to making as- 
   
-P-A-G-E-174
  156 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
signments in accordance with the capacities and inter- 
ests of the individuals concerned. 
5. School officers as well as the public should do 
all in their power to promote good housing conditions 
for teachers. 
6. The new appointee should be carefully and 
thoughtfully introduced to her work by the superin- 
tendent, the supervisor, the principal, and even by a 
sponsor especially appointed for each individual. 
7. Follow-up work and interviews are necessary at 
frequent intervals in order to make the new appointee 
feel at home and a real member of the organization. 
PROBLEMS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
_ 1. Superintendent H was given authority to hire all 
of the teachers in the town of S. When he left in the 
spring he still had one teacher to hire and he was instructed 
to do that during the summer. In July he hired Miss X—— 
to fill the vacancy and was about to send her a contract when 
the secretary of the board at S wrote to him saying that 
he had rehired Mrs. W- , a very successful teacher who 
had been in the system the year before but who had decided 
not to teach again. Two teachers were waiting to sign con- 
tracts for the same position. Mrs. W- was a known suc- 
cess and Miss X had been very successful in other schools. 
Which teacher should have been employed? How should a 
board and superintendent prevent such occasions from aris- 
ing? What could Superintendent H. do under such cir-   
  
  
  
  
  
  
  cumstances ? 
2. Miss B. was employed as a fourth grade teacher 
in x After being there for a month, Superintendent   
L—— received a warning from his board to the effect that 
he should speak to Miss B about her conduct. The 
charges against her were as follows: bobbing her hair, dress- 
ing like a flapper, attending dances on Saturday nights, and 
neglecting church service. Superintendent L—— replied  
-P-A-G-E-175
  APPOINTING AND INTRODUCING THE TEACHER 157 
that Miss B—— should not be condemned and that so long 
as she was giving efficient service and did not commit indis- 
cretions, she had a right to bob her hair, to dance, dress 
as she pleased, and not to attend service. The board held 
its peace for a while. Miss B , however, continued the 
above practices. The board decided to speak to Miss B——. 
They invited her to a meeting at which they told her that 
she either had to stop her practices or they would dismiss her. 
Miss B. was indignant. She said she would go on doing 
as she was doing, that she was within her rights, and if the 
board did not like it and chose to dismiss her she would 
collect her salary for the school year. Was the teacher right 
or wrong? Did the superintendent take the right attitude? 
8. Draft rules and regulations that you would advise a 
board of education to adopt with reference to appointing 
teachers. 
4. Make a special study of the teacherage movement espe- 
cially stressing means for its advancement. 
5. Draw up a model teacher’s contract for your city or 
state. 
6. Outline a plan that will provide for the housing of new 
teachers with the least trouble and the greatest success. 
7. How would you suggest handling the ‘‘wire-pulling”’ 
teacher? The ‘‘busy-body’’ teacher? 
8. Lay out a program of interviews that will assist in 
introducing the new teacher to her work. Do this for (1) a 
manual training teacher, (2) a primary teacher, and (3) a 
new principal. 
9. Discuss pro and con the following statement from Yeo- 
man’s Shackled Youth. ‘‘When it comes to finding teachers 
for different subjects, there is a certain area within which 
you can capture real teachers if you have a clear idea of 
their habits, and can therefore recognize one when you see 
him. Against a background of school-routine these rare 
spirits are often indistinguishable, except to a hunter of dis- 
crimination. 
““Many a teacher-hunter goes out with a net like the 
Roman reticularius, which he throws over something that 
looks inviting, without considering, without having the ex- 
perience or the understanding to warn him, that for one 
real teacher there are ten imitations, and that these imita-   
 
-P-A-G-E-176
    158 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
tions are either terrible things to get entangled with and 
may easily ‘bite you first,’ as the saying is, or else are too 
thin and watery, and in both cases, therefore, useless as nutri- 
ment in his school.’’ 
10. Miss B. from out of town is assigned to teach in 
the third grade in the Nelson school, a conservative American 
district. It is her first experience. At the end of the third 
day she came to the office of the superintendent and offered 
her resignation complaining that she was a misfit and very 
unhappy. The superintendent realized that she was home- 
sick. It was the first time she had been on her own, that is, 
earning her own living in a strange town. He saw at once 
that she was undoubtedly a capable and desirable appointee. 
The superintendent reassigned her to the third grade in an 
Italian quarter where her missionary inclinations found 
ample means for expression. It was one of the hardest dis- 
ciplinary situations in the school system. She was immedi- 
ately happy and very successful. Why? 
11. Miss F—— accepts a position for which she is poorly 
equipped. She had specialized in physical education but is 
attempting to teach a sixth grade home room. In her anxiety 
for a position she overstated her qualifications. At the end 
of the third week’ the supervisor reports her a total failure. 
Who is to blame for this situation and what is the best 
remedy? 
12. Miss M- is appointed to a fourth grade position in 
the Highland school. She is properly qualified and has two 
years of successful experience to her credit. It soon develops 
that she is queer. She will have nothing to do with her asso- 
ciates. She is non-social. Some of the others realize it and 
try to be friendly but their advances are apparently resented. 
Her classroom work is fair to good, but supervisors and 
principals complain that she pays no attention to their sug- 
gestions or lesson plans. The superintendent studies her 
carefully and comes to the conclusion that she is a decided 
“‘intro-vert.’? She is transferred to three different positions 
during the year but with no success. She is not reappointed. 
‘Was she given a square deal?

  CHAPTER IX 
PERSONNEL PROBLEMS IN HANDLING HOME TALENT 
Definition of home talent—By home talent is meant 
the teachers -who are teaching in their home town. 
Usually they are graduates of the local high school, 
and in some cities, of the local training school. They 
may not have been born in the city but they were edu- 
cated there and it is now the permanent home of their 
families. 
In the earlier days when the demands made upon 
the schools were comparatively simple and there were 
but few trained teachers anywhere, the local school 
was regarded as a local undertaking to be filled by 
home talent. It followed that outsiders were seldom, 
if ever, selected especially in the grade schools unless 
there were no local applicants or in exceptional cases 
when the selection from outside was the best means of 
compromising community difficulties. As Cubberley 
says: ‘‘The bright and attractive graduate of the last 
class in the local high school; the daughter of the es- 
timable citizen; the young lady who needed to help her 
widowed mother were the natural persons elected to 
share the public bounty and to teach the children of 
the community.’’ This is the old spoils system of 
distributing jobs. Only local girls were favored. The 
160
-P-A-G-E-179
  PERSONNEL PROBLEMS IN HANDLING HOME TALENT 161 
theory was ‘‘to the taxpayers belong the jobs.’? This 
theory persists as every superintendent can testify. 
It must be combated in the interests of better stand- 
ards if the schools are to perform properly their 
rightful function. In many communities home teach- 
ers as a group probably present more problems in the 
personnel management of the teaching staff than any 
other group. Therefore, careful consideration should 
be given to the merits of both sides of the question of 
their employment. 
The number of home teachers.—The number of home 
teachers in school systems is rather surprising. 
School systems in cities of 25,000 population and over, 
whose elementary schools do not contain approxi- 
mately 75 per cent of home teachers, are the exception. 
The percentage is less in high schools, ranging between 
40 and 55 per cent. In a survey of the schools of St. 
Louis, it was found that 78 per cent of the teachers had 
received their high-school work in St. Louis, and 61 
per cent were born in that city. In the Cleveland sur- 
vey it was found that 85 per cent of the grade-school 
teachers, 35 per cent of the high-school teachers, and 
84 per cent of the elementary school principals were 
home products. There are no data available for the 
nation as a whole. The figures here given are a fair 
sampling of the situation existing in large cities. 
Many boards have a rule to the effect that home 
teachers are preferred. Few boards have ruled 
against them. In some places it is still practically 
impossible for an outside teacher to secure a position 
even though admittedly more competent and better 
qualified than any local applicant. The usual argu-
-P-A-G-E-180
  
  162 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
ments for and against the employment of home talent 
follow. 
Arguments in favor of the employment of home talent. 
—1. Owing to the better living conditions at home, 
the home teachers are able to maintain a higher aver- 
age of condition of health than that of the non-resident 
teachers. 
2. Some schools owe their superior standing 
through a period of years to the willingness of certain 
home teachers to remain in their home town in the face 
of better offers to teach elsewhere. 
8. Many non-resident teachers are saved from 
costly blunders through the intimate knowledge of the 
peculiarities of certain families furnished to them by 
a home teacher. 
4, Home teachers from the circles of the leading 
families or from foreign elements may bring to the 
school the active support of local groups. 
5. A home teacher frequently furnishes the only 
element of permanency in the endless ‘‘procession’’ of 
teachers. 
6. A home teacher may furnish the tie between the 
non-resident teachers and the better social life of the 
community. 
7. A home teacher is ready to begin work the first 
day after vacation and is not likely to ask to leave a 
day or two before the vacation period. Week-end 
absences are also not often required by a home 
teacher. 
8. A home teacher can properly estimate the local 
celebrities, such as the club woman with the educa-
-P-A-G-E-181
  PERSONNEL PROBLEMS IN HANDLING HOME TALENT 163 
tional hobby; the mother with the talented but mis- 
understood child; the business man with practical 
ideas of education, and the churchman with notions as 
to the correct social life of a teacher. A home teacher 
can save her non-resident teacher friends a consider- 
able amount of worry through her understanding of 
these persons. 
9. To the above arguments there should be added 
the economic fact that home teachers can be and are 
quite generally employed at less salary. Boards of 
education are not entirely to blame for this. The local 
pressures for the employment of local talent are enor- 
mous. Home teachers are too frequently willing to 
work for less, especially young teachers whose teach- 
ing expectancy is very limited and old teachers anx- 
ious for a competency in their declining years. 
10. Another economic but invalid argument is the 
‘‘public bounty’’ argument that tax paid positions 
should go to needy citizens regardless of qualifications. 
Arguments against the employment of home talent.— 
The usual arguments against home talent are as 
follows: 
1. Frequently, teaching at home means that the 
teacher has a double burden,—home duties as well as 
school duties. Usually home, health, or school suffers. 
2. A teacher is judged more generously and justly 
away from her home town than in it. The friends of 
the family may be over generous toward her. Those 
who dislike her or her family are likely to criticize 
her unjustly. At home she is Lizzie Brown: among 
strangers she is Miss Brown. 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  164 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
3. There are some families who have peculiarities, 
and whose daughters in teaching need to associate 
with strangers in order to have ‘‘the corners rubbed 
off.’? 
4, It is difficult for board and superintendent to 
form an unbiased judgment concerning home candi- 
dates. Sympathy, friendship, business relations, all 
influence where they should not. Those decided 
against always feel that an injustice is done them. So 
do their friends. The school authorities are accused 
of unfairness and dislike for the local schools is 
formed. 
5. If a teacher chances to be a misfit through in- 
competence, ill health, or local friction, it is difficult 
to remove her without a great deal of hard feeling. 
Many school districts have been split into factions 
over such questions, and years have been required to 
straighten things out. In the meantime the schools 
have suffered. It is likewise very much more embar- 
rassing to the teacher, on account of the local gossip, 
to be dismissed at home than elsewhere. In another 
town it is little thought of and the teacher is saved 
the embarrassment of failure. 
6. A teacher away from home realizes that she is 
among strangers and cannot hope to retain her posi- 
tion except by efficient work. Hence she strives for 
efficiency as her only means of safety. At home she 
may be tempted to resort to other means so that she 
will have the required pull to hold her position, though 
she may be incompetent. 
7. Home talent is very apt to be poorer talent sim- 
ply because other factors than merit operate to secure
-P-A-G-E-183
  PERSONNEL PROBLEMS IN HANDLING HOME TALENT 165 
and hold home teachers in their places. The question 
of qualifications may be, and often is, subordinated to 
the question of supporting a home product merely be- 
cause it is a home product. This evil is especially 
widespread in rural and small communities. Boards 
are apt to argue that it does not require much educa- 
tion to teach little children. 
8. Poor home talent in places of influence such as 
principal, supervisor, or superintendent may saddle 
mediocrity on the whole teaching staff. 
Illustration of layman’s attitude——Laymen quite nat- 
urally fail to realize the technical requirements of 
teaching. Recently the writer was asked to interview 
the mother of a child who had an intelligence quotient 
of 43 and was undoubtedly feeble-minded. (A normal- 
minded child should have an intelligence quotient of 
from 90 to 110.) The writer pointed out to the mother 
that the child could probably never graduate from the 
elementary school. The child was sixteen years old. 
He suggested that the school system could do more 
for the child if she was placed in a special room. The 
mother naively remarked that she realized the child 
could probably never succeed to any great extent in 
business pursuits but she thought that she might suc- 
ceed as a teacher! Another instance also illustrates 
the prevalent conception of how little ability is re- 
quired of a teacher. A farmer with whom the writer 
recently conferred expressed a somewhat similar opin- 
ion. We were talking about his son who had taken the 
civil service examinations for mail clerk four different 
times and at each time utterly failed. When asked 
what his son would probably do, he replied: ‘‘Oh, I
-P-A-G-E-184
  166 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
think he will probably take a teacher’s position and 
teach!’’ As long as the layman persists in holding 
such views of teaching, the profession will continue at 
a low level. The results of such favoritism and low 
ideals is that the teaching positions are filled by in- 
efficient teachers, low standards of certification pre- 
vail, low standards of professional preparation per- 
sist, and teachers do not improve in service as rapidly 
as they should. 
Inbreeding.— It would seem to be an important part 
of the life training and life experience of a young per- 
son to go away from home to get new ideas from 
others, to be influenced in new ways, to come in contact 
with different people, and to gain new points of view. 
In no line of professional work is this more important 
than in teaching. A teacher away from home realizes 
that she is among strangers. She is put on her mettle. 
Anyone who has been out ‘‘on her own’’ realizes the 
value of such an experience. 
Jessup, in the Cleveland survey, condemns the pol- 
icy of employing such a large percentage of home girls. 
Dickson in the Bridgeport survey says, ‘‘There can 
be no greater misfortune to any school system than 
to have a steady inflow of home talent.’’ The superin- 
tendent of schools in Newark, New Jersey, says: ‘‘I 
have always regarded the rule, adopted by the board 
many years ago, that preference of appointments be 
given local teachers, as not in the best interests of the 
school system.’’ He continues: ‘‘Hducation in the 
United States has made its greatest strides where the 
free interchange of teachers has been encouraged by 
a liberal and enlightened policy on the part of the
-P-A-G-E-185
  PERSONNEL PROBLEMS IN HANDLING HOME TALENT 167 
board of education. Inbreeding has been the blight of 
many school systems of this country.’’ 
The school officials have enough to do in training the 
new teachers and those already in the system without 
having the task made unnecessarily difficult by the 
addition of local teachers who have insufficient ability, 
preparation, and experience. Communities are fre- 
quently torn asunder by the perfectly legitimate at- 
tempt of the board of education to rid the system of an 
incompetent home teacher. 
How to reduce the difficulties ——The difficulties pre- 
sented by the home teacher problem are very real and 
common. They cannot all be eliminated because they 
are human difficulties, and human nature cannot be 
entirely ignored. The feeling is quite generally estab- 
lished in the minds of many parents that because they 
pay taxes the schools owe their daughters positions. 
The question of competency is a difficult one. If the 
teacher is not properly trained they argue that train- 
ing doesn’t make a teacher. If she is properly trained 
they argue that the amount of money expended in 
training justifies a trial. The superintendent, who 
should be concerned only with the question of getting 
the best with the money available, may find that unless 
he accedes to these pressures his nominations will be 
set aside and others substituted by the board itself. 
All superintendents have been in this position. What 
can be done in a practical way to meet this problem? 
First, the superintendent should sell to his board 
the idea of as high standards of training as possible. 
Two years of training beyond high school should be 
everywhere required. This will eliminate many candi-  
-P-A-G-E-186
    168 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
dates of the job-holding type. In high school, the 
standards set by universities for such positions should 
be rigidly maintained. 
Second, a competitive examination described in the 
previous chapter is a splendid device for putting in- 
siders and outsiders on a par. In fact, this is the real 
purpose that brought the competitive examination into 
practice. 
Third, a superintendent should never oppose the 
employment of competent, trained, and qualified home 
teachers. They have the same rights as all others. 
He may honestly and wisely favor them when it is an 
even break between a home applicant and an outside 
applicant. 
Fourth, he may, in case the percentage. of home 
teachers is too high and inbreeding is lowering the 
efficiency, ask the board to pass a rule limiting the 
future employment of home teachers to one-fourth, 
one-third, or possibly one-half of the total number of 
teachers hired. 
Fifth, he may in order to save the board from em- 
barrassment ask them to pass a rule forbidding the 
employment of all candidates who are related to mem- 
bers of the board, the superintendent, and supervisory 
staff. 
Sixth, he may ask the board to require of all the 
candidates one or more years of successful experience 
elsewhere as a prerequisite for local positions. 
Seventh, he may ask the board to pass a resolution 
similar to the rule in operation in Los Angeles which 
reads: ‘‘The employment of any sort of personal, 
political, or social influence to secure appointments to
-P-A-G-E-187
  PERSONNEL PROBLEMS IN HANDLING HOME TALENT 169 
the teaching force, or the urging of any consideration 
other than fitness for the work of teaching, as a ground 
for such appointments, is held to be an act of unpro- 
fessional conduct and is strictly forbidden.’’ 
Main points of the chapter—1. By home teachers is 
meant teachers who are educated in the local schools 
and whose permanent homes are in the town where 
they are teaching. 
2. Home teachers constitute two-thirds to three- 
fourths of all the elementary and approximately from 
one-third to one-half of all the high-school teachers 
employed in most communities. 
8. The proponents for the employment of home 
talent rarely insist on excluding others but very gen- 
erally insist on giving home talent the preference when 
the competency is equal or even a little less than equal 
to outside talent. 
4. The layman looks upon the problem chiefly from 
an economic, social, or political viewpoint. This is 
wrong. The educational interests of children should 
be the sole controlling factor. Competency and not 
cost, or charity, or policy should control. 
5. The arguments against the employment of home 
talent are summarized in the word ‘‘inbreeding.’’ 
There is a wide-spread feeling borne out by experience 
that too much inbreeding lowers the level of efficiency. 
From the teacher’s standpoint, she has a better chance 
for success and efficiency away from home as she is 
put on her own and knows that she must win through 
merit alone. 
6. The schools are a local, state, and national enter- 
prise and exist solely for the education of the child.
-P-A-G-E-188
    170 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
Only the most competent and best educated teachers 
should be provided. The most competent and best 
educated teachers can be procured only when the ques- 
tion of where a teacher comes from is treated as irrele- 
vant. Home girls have no prior claim to the teach- 
ing positions in their community, and though they 
desire to teach in the home schools, they should be 
required to be qualified in every respect with the best 
of applicants from elsewhere. 
7. The difficulties that arise in handling the home 
talent problem may be reduced by the adoption of such 
policies as the following: (1) High standards of prep- 
aration; (2) competitive examination; (3) no preju- 
dice against home talent as such; (4) a rule limiting 
the proportion of home talent to the total; (5) the 
elimination of all relatives; (6) a rule requiring one 
or more years of experience elsewhere, and (7) a rule 
against wire-pulling. 
PROBLEMS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
1. In the town of C Miss Y- has been employed 
as a teacher in the seventh grade for a number of years. She 
is a fairly good teacher and was educated and raised in the 
town. Her father has been president of the local board 
of education for many years. Miss Y. , however, is 
failing in health, fainting quite often in the classroom and 
alarming the children. As a result many letters are written 
by the parents and sent to the superintendent concerning this 
matter. They urge her dismissal. She will not resign, and 
although her condition is known to all the board members, 
they are not inclined to vote against the president. How 
could such a situation be handled in the interest of the chil- 
dren? 
2. In the town of X—— the board has been in the habit     
 
-P-A-G-E-189
  PERSONNEL PROBLEMS IN HANDLING HOME TALENT 171 
of letting the superintendent do all the hiring of teachers. 
Last year he let a ‘‘home girl’’ go. She had been in the 
system 16 years, was a poor average teacher, and had not 
attended summer school or college in the last 12 years or 
shown other signs of growth. She raised a rumpus in the 
town. The question of her reélection was made an issue in 
the next election of board members. The men who favored 
rehiring the teacher were elected. The superintendent has a 
three-year contract. The school board reinstates the teacher. 
Should the superintendent resign, or should he accept the 
decision of the board as final and remain? 
3. Mrs. S. L. D., in twenty-two years of experience in her 
home town and with scarcely any preparation beyond high 
school, has been able to advance herself by wire-pulling 
from a grade-school position to a teacher of English in the 
high school at the maximum salary. Superintendent L 
inherits the case after twenty years of such favoritism. He 
refuses to recommend additional increases or promotions 
until she has complied with the standards for training ob- 
served by other teachers. Despite the superintendent’s 
recommendations she is boosted beyond the limit set by the 
salary schedule and given a special position as librarian 
for which she has had no preparation whatsoever. What 
should the superintendent do? 
4. The board of education at M. are forced to econo- 
mize. They discharge all out-of-town teachers and fill their 
places with ‘‘home talent’’ at two hundred dollars less per 
head. Is this possible? Is it right? 
5. Under what circumstances is it desirable to reinstate a 
teacher who has once been dismissed ? 
6. Two teachers are equally qualified for a given position. 
Both are ‘‘home girls.’’? One is the daughter of a large tax- 
payer in the district who has considerable influence. The 
other is the daughter of a day laborer who pays little or no 
taxes. To which one would you offer the position? Why? 
7. Two teachers go to the principal and complain that 
the lax disciplinary standards of Miss R. are causing 
trouble. They say Miss R—— is hopeless and allows so 
much freedom that it is affecting the entire floor. Miss R—— 
is a home girl and feels well intrenched. The principal 
agrees with the two teachers. He does not recommend Miss   
  
   
-P-A-G-E-190
172 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
  R—— for reappointment. The board observes his recom- 
mendation but feels that he is hopelessly prejudiced against 
home teachers. The principal has no such prejudice. How 
may he convince the board of his sincerity? 
8. The board of education at B passes a rule that all 
teachers shall live or board in the town. They cannot com- 
mute to and from towns in the vicinity. Hard surfaced roads 
run in every direction and there are convenient street car, 
bus, and train connections. The board holds that teachers 
should spend their money where it is earned. They also 
contend that commuting makes it less possible for the teachers 
to become a part of the community in which they teach and 
to participate in the extra-curricular activities of the school 
system. Is the board’s position tenable?

  CHAPTER X 
THE PROBLEM OF THE MARRIED WOMAN TEACHER 
The problem stated—A woman teacher’s marriage is 
equivalent to resignation in the majority of American 
school districts. Where there are no formal regula- 
tions the policy is often pursued of refusing to reap- 
point. Few school boards place married women on a 
par with the unmarried except when they are widowed, 
deserted, divorced, unencumbered with family duties, 
or need to make their own living. 
Typical rules against married women.—In some com- 
munities there is an unwritten rule against the employ- 
ment of married women. The board of education or 
officers of the board have had an unfortunate experi- 
ence with some married employee in the past, or else 
they believe that the public bounty rightfully belongs 
to those who are single and self-supporting. In other 
places the board boldly declares its policy in a set of 
rules like the following recently adopted in a small 
city in Wisconsin: 
No married women shall be employed in the public schools 
of after the end of the present school year. Any 
teacher under contract who becomes married shall thereby 
forfeit her contract. Any resignation or leave of absence 
of any married woman under contract shall cancel the con- 
tract and permanently bar her return or reélection. The 
173    
-P-A-G-E-192
  174 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
~~ 
term ‘‘married women’’ in this connection shall not be con- 
strued to include widows or married women who are entirely 
dependent on their own resources. 
Reasons for this attitude.—Three reasons are usually 
given for this attitude. The first is the public bounty 
fallacy. Many laymen still hold that tax-paid posi- 
tions belong to the needy citizens. A married woman 
presumably has a means of support. An unmarried 
woman has none. The second reason is that it is the 
first business of a married woman to look after her 
home, and this duty is considered impossible of proper 
fulfillment if the woman teaches. The third reason is 
often given by superintendents. They argue that mar- 
ried women are home talent and are harder to handle 
as one often has to handle the whole family and some- 
times many of the relatives and friends. It is expedi- 
ent, therefore, to rule against all married women as a 
class rather than to deal with each case on its merits. 
The New York City discussion.—The discussion was 
brought to the attention of the public about ten years 
ago by several incidents in New York City. Mrs. 
Edgell, a teacher of physical training in Erasmus high 
school in Brooklyn, and the wife of a teacher in the 
same school, applied for a year’s leave of absence to 
cover the period when her baby would be born. She 
was apparently the first teacher in New York City 
to ask for a leave of absence for this particular reason, 
though undoubtedly not the first to take a leave for 
the same purpose, but on a different pretext. The 
committee on high schools approved her petition, but 
the board of education not only refused to grant her 
a leave of absence by a majority of 32 to 5, but refused
-P-A-G-E-193
  THE PROBLEM OF THE MARRIED WOMAN TEACHER 175 
to discuss the question. This meant that she must 
resign or be guilty of neglect of duty. 
Again, in 1913, Mrs. Bridget C. Peixotto, a teacher 
for eighteen years in the New York City schools, asked 
for a leave of absence on account of some infection of 
the ears and presented a doctor’s certificate to validate 
her statement. She was granted the leave. But when 
it became known that a child was born, she was dis- 
missed for ‘‘neglect of duty.’’ 
The action of the board on eleven other similar cases 
within a short space of time caused considerable com- 
ment and the case of Mrs. Peixotto was made a test 
case, with the result that in January, 1915, she was 
reinstated with full pay for the time since her dis- 
missal. der the’state law women could not be dis- 
missed for marrying—this had been decided in a pre- 
vious case and Dr. John H. Finley, state commissioner 
of education, gave the decision that absence for child- 
bearing could not be classified as neglect of duty. 
While it would not come under leave of absence for 
serious personal illness, with pay, it could be classified 
as ‘‘absence for personal convenience, without pay.’’ 
Legally, the matter stands in the position indicated 
above in New York State. 
In defense of the action of the board in dismissing 
Mrs. Hdgell, one member of the New York board of 
education issued a written statement purporting to 
set forth some of the arguments of the board. He 
said: ‘‘The board appreciates the inalienable right 
of an infant to a mother’s care and lays down the gen- 
eral rule that a baby must not be sacrificed that its 
parents may enjoy superfluous luxury.’’ His second    
-P-A-G-E-194
  176 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
argument was on the economic side, namely, that Mrs. 
Edgell’s husband was paid $3000, sufficient for the 
family, and that the salaries of men teachers were on 
a basis that presupposed the support of a family. He 
further contended that successive children would keep 
the mother out of school practically all the time and 
that pupils would accordingly suffer. 
By others it was argued that there is something 
pernicious about the woman who does not have chil- 
dren as soon as she is married. Some held that such 
a woman is not fit to be a teacher as women should not 
be forced into wage earning after marriage. They 
contended that there is something wrong with the hus- 
band who permits his wife to work. 
Those opposed to the employment of married women 
argued that: ‘‘It is for the best interests of women 
teachers not to have extra burdens added.to mother- 
hood. It is for the interest of society at large not to 
combine professional and family duties. It is for the 
interest of children to have the mother’s full time. It 
is for the interest of pupils to have unmarried or child- 
less teachers.’’ 
Curtis contended against these arguments. He con- 
tended that: ‘‘In the long run, the stronger and the 
more attractive women marry. Unmarried teachers, 
therefore, constitute a continual selection of the less 
attractive women. Marriage is normal. Unmarried 
teachers, having no normal outlet for their emotions, 
are apt to express them in abnormal ways. -The com- 
munity and the state get more in return for the cost 
of training teachers because the teachers are retained
-P-A-G-E-195
  THE PROBLEM OF THE MARRIED WOMAN TEACHER 177 
longer in service if marriage and motherhood are per- 
mitted. The profession is benefited by retaining the 
stronger and more attractive women.’’ 
+ Curtis outlines an ideal condition wherein the mar- 
ried woman should teach for several years before mar- 
riage, drop out for twelve or fifteen years and when 
her children are old enough not to need her immediate 
care, return to teaching. 
The opinion of magazines.—One indication of the 
trend of public opinion is in the expression of maga- 
zine editorials. 
The Outlook (105-462) is in favor of married teach- 
ers: ‘‘There is no calling that is nominally outside 
the home which is, in fact, so intimately connected with 
the home as the calling of the teacher. Indeed, one of 
the essential duties of the mother is to teach. Other 
things being equal, the woman who is a mother is pre- 
sumably better fitted to teach than one who is not. 
Every such case as this (the New York City case) 
ought to be considered on its merits. It is impossible 
that under some circumstances a woman by becoming 
a mother may thereby become incapacitated to act as 
teacher. We think that it is a fair question whether 
motherhood does not so increase the teacher’s capacity 
for teaching that the leave of absence should be 
granted with pay.’’ 
Again, in 1915 (109-111) the Outlook states: ‘‘It 
seems to the Outlook that it is a self-evident proposi- 
tion that the criterion of fitness to serve as a teacher 
in the public schools should be made solely dependent 
upon the individual’s success with her work. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-196
  178 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
question whether a woman is married or single should, 
in itself, constitute reason neither for employment nor 
for dismissal.’’ 
The Independent (74-606-6) states: ‘‘The board is 
willing enough to grant leave of absence to teachers 
for recreation, recuperation, travel and study, yet it is 
blind to the fact that the experience of maternity is 
far more important than any of these, considered 
merely: from the standpoint of educational efficiency.’’ 
The New Republic (1:8-9) thinks the New York 
board was reactionary in trying to get back to the old- 
fashioned home and woman. It condemns the policy 
of the board and advocates economic independence for 
women. 
The Literary Digest (47-1051) gave the opinions of 
various newspapers on the matter. The Indianapolis 
Star contended that the only test for teachers should 
be one of competency. The New York Tribune, World, 
and Herald, and the Chicago News approved the court 
decision in the Peixotto case. The New York Times 
stated that the decision, however, needed amendment. 
The Times thinks that: ‘‘The school system is a victim 
of feminism, and the law should not interfere with the 
business of the school board.’’s None of the magazines 
in which comments appeared supported the action of 
the New York board. 
Detroit’s experience with married women teachers.— 
Up to January, 1917, no married women had been 
employed in the public schools in Detroit. A few 
months prior to this date the rules of the board were 
changed to read: ‘‘Married women may be recom- 
mended for employment in the public schools at the
-P-A-G-E-197
  
THE PROBLEM OF THE MARRIED WOMAN TEACHER 179 
discretion of the superintendent of schools.’? By Sep- 
tember, 1921, the number of married women teachers 
had increased from none to 386 out of a total of 4,135 
or 9.3 per cent. All of these had husbands living. In 
addition to married women with living husbands, there 
were 7 separated from their husbands, 73 who were 
widows, and 16 who were divorced. Of the married 
women teachers with husbands, only in 14 instances 
were both members of the family employed by the 
board of education, and in only ten other instances 
were the husbands reported as either incapacitated or 
not working. 
In the fall of 1921 the question arose in Detroit as 
to the relative efficiency of married women. The 
bureau of statistics and reference was asked to make 
a study and report its findings upon this subject. 
Therefore, an analysis of the principals’ ratings of 
the married and unmarried teachers was made for the 
year 1920-21. This study showed that married teach 
ers ranked a little higher in professional ability, as 
measured by the principals’ ratings, than the general 
rating of women teachers. About 8614 per cent ranked 
B— (good minus, better than average) or better. 
While of the general body of women teachers only 81.6 
per cent ranked B — or better. 
4 Comparisons of the ratings of married teachers 
showed that they ranked a little higher in ability than 
the men teachers. The length of teaching service of 
married teachers was lower than that for the city as 
awhole. The city median was 3.6 years. The median 
for married women teachers was 2 years and the 
median for married women in service when married 
vets :
-P-A-G-E-198
  180 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
was 4 years. However, it should be remembered that 
prior to September, 1917, there were no married 
women teachers employed in Detroit. 
A study was also made of the size of families of 
married women teachers. The ratio of children per 
marriage among the women teachers was .41, and the 
ratio for widowed teachers was .6. The number of 
children for married men was 1.33. However, one- 
fourth of the women teachers had been married less 
than one year while the same percentile for widows 
was 3 years, and for men, 4 years. The median length 
of marriage was 1% years for the women married 
teachers and 7 years for both widows and men. From 
these data Moehlman concluded: ‘‘There is nothing 
to show that marriage among women teachers tends 
to decrease the size of family in comparison with gen- 
eral class averages. Covering a period of years they 
will tend to exceed the average for their group which 
for the country is 1.2 children per family.”’ 
A study made of the ratings of married women 
teachers who were in service both before and after 
marriage showed that in 86 per cent of the cases in 
Detroit there had been no professional deterioration. 
In fact, 60.7 per cent of the cases considered gained in 
efficiency rating after marriage, while 25.3 per cent 
remained stationary, and only 14 per cent lost in 
rank. 
The “public bounty” fallacy.—To prefer an unmar- 
ried woman. because she ‘‘needs the work’’ and not 
because she ‘‘merits it’’ is almost as poor a reason as 
to prefer her because she is the niece of the mayor, 
the sister of the chief of police, or has some other sort
-P-A-G-E-199
  THE PROBLEM OF THE MARRIED WOMAN TEACHER 18) 
of ‘‘pull’’—an evil practice now disappearing and des- 
tined, let us hope, to complete eradication. 
The people control the school boards. The school 
boards control their officers. Therefore, the only rem- 
edy for the ‘‘public bounty’’ argument is to teach the 
public another and better point of view toward all 
public service. This the officers of the board of edu- 
cation may assist in accomplishing by fearlessly ad- 
hering to sound principles and by giving the widest 
publicity to such principles. 
The “expediency” argument.—Perhaps the most com- 
monly used argument for excluding married women is 
the argument that, under the circumstances, it seems 
‘“‘expedient.’’ It is not uncommon to find one or more 
inferior teachers intrenched in a community through 
long, although perhaps inefficient service. The imme- 
diate effect of any attempt to remove them is a noisy 
protest from friends, who know little about educa- 
tional standards, and who argue that long and faithful 
service merits retention. If these women have homes 
and husbands, they have a local social status and a 
following that counts and is usually strongly used in 
their favor. It may almost wreck the morale of the 
school system to exclude them. Hence, school officials, 
following the line of least resistance, resort to the. rule 
of excluding all married women in order to eliminate 
one or two inefficient married women. 
+ Such an expedient is unjust and damaging to the 
schools just to the extent that it excludes, together 
with the inferior ones, women of proved ability and 
acknowledged achievement. 
According to Miss Bradford: ‘‘There is another
-P-A-G-E-200
  182 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
sort of trouble which may cause some superintendents 
to hold to the reason under consideration. It requires 
a higher order of ability, greater thoughtfulness and 
effort, to direct the experienced woman of high stand- 
ards than it does to handle a lot of girls whose homes 
and relatives are distant and who have no friends in 
the community to make a fuss if they are dismissed. 
Hence, again ease and smoothness in running the 
school machine are considerations that prevail instead 
of féarless, impersonal adherence to what is best for 
the schools. The school superintendent of any given 
community should be the one determined stimulus or 
rallying point, as the case may be, for all forces seek- 
ing better public education.”’ 
The “She-cannot-do-both-well” argument.—A third 
argument against the employment of married women 
arises from the conviction that home-making is the 
first duty and business of married women. It is 
argued that if a married woman attends to her school 
duties properly she must necessarily neglect her home, 
or vice versa. She simply cannot do both well. Ac- 
cording to Miss Bradford: ‘‘A rule excluding mar- 
ried women from the schools to protect homes from 
neglect, implies that the school board and superin- 
tendent assume the prerogative of dictating what the 
home duties of a woman shall be,—a rather doubtful 
assumption.’’ 
Miss Bradford thinks that the problem is solved if 
only those married women teach who have been trained 
for professional life, and who were teachers before 
and up to the time of their marriage. It is assumed 
that they were skilful teachers and were devoted to
-P-A-G-E-201
  
   THE PROBLEM OF THE MARRIED WOMAN TEACHER 183 
their work and happy in it, and were not teaching 
merely for economic reasons. Women who cannot fill 
these requirements shouldn’t teach at all, married or 
single. 
Nepotism.—The employment of married women 
sometimes involves the problem of nepotism or favo- 
ritism to relatives, as when both husband and wife 
teach. There is no danger in this unless the fact of 
relationship overshadows all other considerations. 
School officers and board members may find it impoli- 
tie to employ their own relatives under any circum- 
stances. However, they may find it decidedly to their 
advantage to employ sisters, brothers, husband and 
wife, and other relatives of their employees. A rule 
against nepotism would in most instances be unneces- 
sary and unwise. 
Waste of present system.—The weightiest practical 
reason for the married teachers is economy and effi- 
ciency. The largest source of waste that our present 
system of teacher-supply involves is the waste of 
experience incurred in the loss each year from one- 
fifth to one-fourth of the entire teaching population. 
The average teacher no sooner becomes fairly efficient 
than she leaves the service, giving way to a recruit 
who repeats the same mistakes of apprenticeship, and 
leaves in her turn before these mistakes can be trans- 
muted into matured skill. ‘‘The very nature of the 
selection that produces this loss seems to insure the 
heaviest draft upon the best grades of ability in the 
teaching personnel.’’ 
“To teach well is the privilege of maturity and 
experience; it is the prerogative of men and women

of affairs, of fatherhood and motherhood; it is the 
business of brains and vigorous social participation 
that draws the pupils into the stream of interesting 
and instructive persons and events. What have im- 
mature girls to do with this except as they prepare 
to make it the main object of their lives, irrespective 
of marriage?’’ 
Summary of argument for and against.—Following is 
a summary of all the arguments for and against the 
employment of married women that the writer has 
been able to find advanced anywhere by anybody. 
Many of them are exceedingly trivial. All of them are 
merely opinions. The reader is warned against assum- 
ing that the author holds to any of these views. It all 
depends upon the woman. Individual merit, and 
merit only, should determine the status of married 
women as teachers. 
In the absence of any scientific data on the subject, 
conclusions can be drawn only from the trend of pub- 
lic opinion. The tendency seems to be away from the 
hackneyed arguments of confining a married woman’s 
activities to her home, and to base her employment 
or dismissal on her personal efficiency rather than on 
extra-professional duties or pleasures which she may 
follow. Obviously, no general rule will cover all the 
cases. Some women, on marrying, are glad of the 
opportunity to stop teaching; others are genuinely 
interested in following their profession after they 
marry. Others find their time filled with home-making 
and children, while still other women are able to de- 
vise means of caring for a family and having a pro- 
fessional life. There is no way to catalog women

solely on their marital condition. Hfficiency depends 
on many factors. The school board should give to the 
pupils the best teachers possible. The board is 
scarcely the organization to regulate the teacher’s 
personal life so long as her professional duties are 
kept up to the standard. In the absence of proof that 
marriage or motherhood lowers a woman’s profes- 
sional ability, neither should be the cause of her dis- 
missal,

9. It is not good economy for 
a highly trained specialist to do 
house work when she can give 
more to society by teaching and 
delegating the house work to one 
of lower capacities and training.

15. Married women are quite 
generally permitted in other trades

keep a teacher out all the time. 
17. Many married women may 
use teaching as an excuse for not 
bearing children as some medical 
authorities claim that such work 
induees sterility.

the profession than her home should 
not marry.

deal with groups of the same class. Age and teaching ex-

but we should compare married and unmarried teachers in

over a definite period. 
4. We should keep a comparative record of turnover. 
5. We should keep a comparative record of professional 
study and improvement.

husbands whose wives are teachers in the same system.

  CHAPTER XI 
PROBLEMS IN MEASURING THE MERIT OF TEACHERS 
  Should teachers be rated?—In 1922, Buckingham 
compiled the returns from superintendents of 156 
American cities, more than ninety per cent of whom 
declared that teachers should be rated. In fact, only 
four answered ‘‘no.’’ About 84 per cent of the super- 
intendents thought that at least to some extent salary 
should depend upon rating. The size of the city 
seemed to have no effect on the returns. In 77 per 
cent of the school systems a definite rating scheme 
was in operation. The returns show rather con- 
clusively that the rating of teachers is part of the 
principal’s duties, sometimes exercised alone, but 
more often exercised with the supervisor or superin- 
tendent. 
The purposes to be accomplished in rating teachers 
were given as follows: To determine promotion; to 
fix salary; to determine transfer; to terminate service; 
to stimulate professional growth; to determine fitness 
for teaching in evening or summer schools; to have 
a basis for recommending teachers to other systems; 
to aid in supervision, and to determine which teachers 
should be released from probationary service., This 
list is not exhaustive.

-P-A-G-E-209
  PROBLEMS IN MEASURING THE MERIT OF TEACHERS 191 
Only 100 of the 156 superintendents stated the pur- 
poses of a rating scheme. Of ‘the 100 only 76 checked 
“‘promotion’’; 70, ‘‘salary’’; 55, ‘‘transfer’’; and 84, 
‘termination of service.’? From this it appears that 
less than half of the superintendents use rating effec- 
tively. There is a rather decided tendency on the part 
of the larger cities to put less reliance upon rating 
than is placed upon rating by smaller cities. Larger 
cities have more fixed salary schedules. While 93 per 
cent of the superintendents thought that salary should 
depend upon rating, only 45 per cent indicated that 
teachers in their school systems were actually being 
rated with the purpose of determining salary. In 
actual practice, superintendents attach less importance 
to rating than they do theoretically. The nature of the 
rating schemes may partially account for this being 
the case. 
Kinds of rating schemes.—There are at least three 
ways of measuring the accomplishment of teachers, 
namely, by personal opinion, by comparison, and by 
standard units of accomplishment. The first two meth- 
ods have long been used and will undoubtedly continue 
to be usedeven after standard units of accomplishment 
have been established. 
Personal opinion is valuable to the extent that the 
person who renders the opinion is expert and unbiased 
on the subject under consideration. The opinion of 
an unbiased expert is superior to the average Jor 
median opinion of a large group of persons, few of 
whom are expert or unbiased. The difficulty in rating 
teachers by this method is apparent. Few are expert.

What is good teaching? Until you answer this ques- 
tion you cannot say who is a good teacher. 
Comparison of one teacher with another, or with 
a group, is probably more valuable, provided the com- 
parison is fair, accurate, and extensive. Comparison 
is the method most frequently used in marking or grad- 
ing pupils. It serves to show the position of the 
teacher among other teachers of the same group in 
terms of superior, good, fair, poor, or very poor. Com- 
parison uses opinion, and yet is superior to opinion, to 
the extent that the things compared are concrete and 
objective. 
Most of the schemes for rating teachers are based 
upon either or both of these methods. The following 
is an analysis of some of the typical subjective 
schemes in common use. 
Analysis of typical subjective rating schemes.—One 
of the first attempts to measure the efficiency. of the 
teacher was made by Meriam in 1905. Meriam at- 
tempted to measure the efficiency of teachers in terms 
of the following: (1) Scholarship during the normal 
school course, (2) rank in practice teaching during that 
course, and (3) length of experience. He studied the 
graduates of the classes of 1898 to 1902, inclusive, of 
five normal schools. The estimates of the principals 
of the normal schools, who usually follow quite closely 
the work of every graduate, was taken as the best 
available mark for measuring the efficiency. The 
marks for scholarship and for practice teaching were 
both taken from school records. Thorndike computes 
from Meriam’s findings the following correlation:

lish between .25 ‘* .50

sci. hist. and Eng- 
lish between .25 ‘* 50 
From this it is clear that scholarship may be one 
contributing factor to efficiency in teaching and that 
it is nearly as good a sign of success as is the ability 
shown in practice teaching. Meriam did not attempt 
to make a score card. 
Elliott, in 1910, collected from various sources, 
statements of qualities of teachers. These were then 
compiled in a score card, and numerical values were 
arbitrarily assigned to the several qualities. \The 
qualities themselves were grouped under the headings: 
physical, moral, executive, professional, projective, 
and social. 
In the same year, Ruediger and Strayer undertook 
to answer the following questions: ‘‘What are the 
fundamental qualities of teachers that should receive 
scientific and administrative attention? What is 
their relative importance and how may they be 
determined ?’’ 
In answering these questions, the following points 
were selected upon which a decision should be based: 
Educational qualifications; number of years of teach- 
ing experience; general teaching merit; health; initia- 
tive; personality; teaching skill; ability to carry 
out suggestions; accord between teacher and pupil; 
progressive scholarship, and social factors outside

of the classroom. This scheme was entirely sub- 
jective. 
Hughes, in 1913, enlarged upon the schemes of El- 
liott, Ruediger, and Strayer by adding more items 
upon which teachers were to be rated. 
Boyce, in 1915, formulated a score card for rating 
teachers which embraced 45 different items grouped 
under five main divisions as follows: Personal equip- 
ment, social and professional equipment, technique of 
teaching, and results. Boyce hoped by the use of his 
score card, in time to eliminate the rating of teachers 
on the basis of snap judgment, personal preference, 
comparison, pull, and other subjective factors. He 
believed that he had devised a fairly scientific instru-- 
ment by means of which to determine the promotion 
and vocational guidance of teachers. Boyce’s score 
card rated teachers as very poor, poor, medium, good, 
or excellent, with respect to each of the forty-five 
qualities listed. For the guidance of those who would 
like to analyze such a score card it is printed on page 
195. 
Since 1915, many variations of the types of score 
cards mentioned above have been formulated. In fact, 
almost every superintendent has formulated one for 
his own use. Practically all of them are subjective. 
The Rugg score card.—The Rugg score card deserves 
special mention. Form A consists of a series of ques- 
tions regarding the extent to which a teacher possesses 
certain qualities, or has carried out certain activities. 
Fundamentally, it is intended to serve as a means of 
self-improvement through self-rating. It is assumed 
that answering these specific questions enables the

  teacher to achieve a more definite self-analysis. Fur- 
thermore, answering specific questions enables both 
the teacher and the supervisor to arrive at a common 
understanding. 
Rugg arranges his questions under five heads: 
Skill in teaching; skill in mechanics of managing a 
class; team work qualities; qualities of growth and 
keeping up-to-date; and personal and social qualities. 
In place of the numerical valuation of the Elliott and 
Boyce score cards, Rugg would rate teachers on each 
question as low, medium, or high. Form B of the Rugg 
score card is a device for assigning a numerical rating

Summary numerical rating 
The very best teacher that one knows is used for 
comparing the highest standard; the very poorest 
teacher is selected as the lowest standard; a teacher 
half-way between best and average, as above average 
standing; and a teacher half-way between average and 
lowest as below average standard. In each division 
a value of 38 is assigned to the best teacher, 32 to the 
next best, and so on by steps of eight to the poorest 
who receives 6. The highest possible score that any 
teacher could receive is 118, and the lowest possible 
score is 24. A similar scheme was used for rating 
officers for the United States army during the World 
War. 
The method proposed by Connor.—Connor in 1916, 
after trying the score cards devised by Elliott, Boyce, 
Ruediger and Strayer, and others, and finding them 
unsatisfactory, devised a scheme of his own quite dif- 
ferent from any yet considered. In his judgment, ‘‘A 
perfectly groomed teacher of perfect physical propor- 
tions, working with perfectly graded children in a 
perfect physical environment, may and often does use 
perfectly good methods in a perfectly futile way.’’ 
After having reached this academic conclusion, Con- 
nor and his teachers adopted the following principles 
as guides in devising a rating scheme: (1) Teaching,
-P-A-G-E-216
  198 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
not teachers should be rated. (2) Teaching is rated in 
terms of the results only. (3) Results may be sub- 
jectively or objectively graded as inferior, below aver- 
age, average, above average, or superior, only with 
reference to the amount of improvement made and the 
ability to improve acquired by the particular group. 
By Connor’s scheme, the results of teaching are 
grouped under the following heads: (1) Thinking, 
(2) knowledge and skill, (3) initiative, social signifi- 
cance of situation, (4) morale, (5) emotional reaction, 
(6) effectual self-control in situations socially signifi- 
cant, and (7) deportment. These terms are defined and 
the complete scheme given in detail. 
Connor’s scheme is criticized by a group of southern 
educators, who claim that it has two fundamental 
faults. (1) If the teacher of the perfect type listed 
above should fail to get results, something beyond her 
control would be interfering. The teacher should not 
receive less by a lower rating because of circumstances 
over which she has no control. (2) For the purpose of 
supervision, it is important that there be a method for 
estimating a teacher’s fitness and the efficiency of her 
teaching before she has been at work long enough for 
results to be apparent. 
A professional test for elementary school teachers.— 
Knight and Franzen, 1922, devised a professional test 
for elementary school teachers. This test consists of 
seven pages of questions grouped under 36 divisions. 
These questions are designed to test the professional 
knowledge which the teacher possesses. It is one of 
the best schemes yet devised for getting a line on the 
prospective teacher, or one who has just entered the
-P-A-G-E-217
PROBLEMS IN MEASURING THE MERIT OF TEACHERS 199 
school system. It might well be used for teachers who 
have been in the service for some time. A quotation 
from the test will show its nature: 
IV. If a question is asked by the pupil that you don’t 
know how to answer what would you do? Put a cross be- 
fore the one of these statements which best describes what 
you would do. 
Tell the child you don’t know. 
Give him any answer that comes into your head. 
Tell him to wait a minute and then look it up. 
Go and ask the principal. 
Proceed to look it up with him. 
. Tell him to look it up. 
Tell him it’s a foolish question. 
The test will undoubtedly be revised and simplified. 
No score is given, but after the test has been given to 
several hundred teachers, it will be possible to weigh 
the different items and to formulate a fairly accurate 
score for the measurement of teachers. It is the first 
scientific attempt, of which the author lias any knowl- 
edge, to make a trade or professional test. It could 
easily be made into either a scale or a standardized 
test and apparently one or the other of these objec- 
tives is the intention of the authors. 
Many other attempts to measure teachers subjec- 
tively might be mentioned. The foregoing have been 
selected as examples only. They represent fairly well 
the variety of ideas that are being tested in various 
sections of the country. All of these schemes depend 
almost exclusively upon subjective factors. No two 
people agree in their definition of any particular item. 
Furthermore, but few studies have as yet been made 
to determine the influence of any particular character- 
istic upon success. °

In this connection, McCall states, ‘‘Teachers are at 
present selected and promoted primarily on the basis 
of their attributes, such as intelligence, personality, 
physical appearance, voice, ability in penmanship, and 
the like.’’ 
The relation of personal attributes to success.—No 
one has demonstrated just what causal relationship, 
if any, exists between the possession of various attri- 
butes and the production of desirable changes in 
pupils. 
“The relation between possession of certain attri- 
butes and the degree of favor of a teacher in the 
inspector’s eye is more evident. Dr. Chassell in her 
Ph.D. thesis determined the correlation between cer- 
tain ratings and features of Ph.D. students of educa- 
tion and later success. She found that the score made 
in Ph.D. matriculation examinations at Teachers Col- 
lege correlated with success about .50. The quality of 
their Ph.D. dissertations correlated about .50. The 
letter of recommendation written about these Ph.D.’s 
correlated about .30. Their handwriting correlated 
.20, and their photograph .10. The following showed 
substantially zero correlation with later success, physi- 
cal defects, type of locality of birthplace, age of reach- 
ing a given academic status, study abroad, size of 
family, church relationship, reading knowledge of 
languages, and travel abroad. This study is more 
valuable in the present connection for the technique 
it exemplifies than for its conclusions. The subjects 
were not typical teachers but Ph.D.’s. The criterion 
of success was not demonstrated changes in pupils but 
the opinion of judges.’’
-P-A-G-E-219
  PROBLEMS IN MEASURING THE MERIT OF TEACHERS 201 
Kent and Courtis proposed objective measurements. 
—With the growth of scientific movement in educa- 
tion, investigators have quite generally come to the 
conclusion that the success of teachers must be meas- 
ured objectively in the same manner as the achieve- 
ments of pupils are measures. Kent in a recent article 
entitled ‘‘What Should Rating Schemes Seek to Meas- 
ure?’’ states the case quite clearly. ‘‘An examination 
of the various rating schemes, as well as experience 
in using some of them convinces the writer that there 
is a fundamental weakness or deficiency in practically 
all schemes of this kind up to date.’? Most score cards 
have limited their efforts to the formulation of .a 
scheme for judging the workers’ possession of the 
characteristics necessary for success. ‘‘Any scheme 
for rating teachers which gives from zero to 40 per 
cent as a maximum weighing for the project secured 
by the worker, violates sound principles of educational 
administration. Projects or results should be given 
greater weight than any other single item.’’ 
Courtis says: ‘‘The best proof of a pudding is in 
the eating, and the best proof of ability in a teacher 
is the effect produced by her teaching. My thesis is 
that certification should follow the ‘attainment of 
standard teaching ability, irrespective of the number 
of courses previously taken, the amount of credit 
earned, the length of the training period, or any other 
criteria whatsoever.’’ 
‘‘At this point, however, we encounter difficulties. 
While both of us are perfectly certain we can tell a 
good teacher when we see one, upon investigation our 
meat proves to be another man’s poison. Worse yet,
-P-A-G-E-220
  202 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
when we have found someone like-minded with our- 
selves, we soon discover that the other person’s analy- 
sis usually bears little resemblance to our own. Few 
of us care to hire teachers solely on the basis of an- 
other man’s recommendations, still less do we depend 
wholly upon a teacher’s scholarship record or her 
experience. Her promotion record and her present 
salary are a better guide because these are credits 
earned in the school of experience and are given only 
after a series of long continued tests of the ability 
of the teacher to ‘‘make good’’ on the job. Even here, 
however, the policies and standards of the system in 
which the teachers have won promotion need to bo 
considered. In other words, in teacher training we 
have/ not as yet addressed ourselves seriously to the 
fundamental problem of test-and-scale construction 
and definition of the thing to be measured. No won- 
der there is so little correlation between the amount of 
training and estimates of teaching ability. It is ex- 
tremely difficult to make something well when we do 
not know just what it is we are attempting to make. 
A whole new field of research needs to be explored 
carefully before final standards of teaching ability are 
possible. The program to be followed is as follows: 
First, definition of teaching ability wholly in terms of 
the changes to be produced in children; second, for- 
mulation of standard tests for measurement of these 
changes; third, careful control studies of the relation 
between special qualities in teachers, nature of mate- 
rials used, methods of use, etc., to determine the opti- 
mum combination of all facts involved; fourth, similar 
control studies to determine the optimum type of
-P-A-G-E-221
  PROBLEMS IN MEASURING THE MERIT OF TEACHERS 203 
training for the production of the combination of quali- 
ties desired; fifth, the devising of tests for the selec- 
tion of the capable and the elimination of the unfit 
among those who wish to enter our classes. 
Fortunately we can make progress without waiting 
until this entire program is completed. For instance, 
it is many times more probable that a high-school 
graduate who makes a score of 150 in the Otis tests 
will make a good teacher than it is that one whose 
score is 80 will succeed. Similarly, it is now possible 
to measure and compare the degrees to which two 
teachers produce a specified kind of change in children. 
For instance, the supervisor of arithmetic in Detroit, 
in order to obtain certain information at first-hand, 
taught a class himself for the major part of a semes- 
ter. In 54 days, with drill work only ten minutes a 
day, his class made 79 per cent of the possible gain. 
In other words, the score of the class changed from 
609 to 917 out of a possible 1,000 points given when 
every child in the class is up to standard. In the city, 
as a whole, teachers whose classes made the same in- 
itial score, 600 made on the average 59 per cent of 
the possible gain, although they spent 25 per cent more 
days on the practice. The tests show that the super- 
visor was a much better teacher than the average so 
far as this one time was concerned. But computa- 
tional skill is after all only one item in the changes 
produced and not the most important one either. The 
supervisor’s drill work was of such a character that 
it contributed directly to development of the ideal of 
service in his pupils. He gave them training in self- 
development, self-appraisal, self-control, and experi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
204 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
  ences in working codperatively with their classmates. 
These results were not reflected at all in the test re- 
sults quoted above. Rated by the tests alone, the 
supervisor would not stand out as the best teacher 
in the city, but rated by an adequate series covering 
all the effects produced, his superiority would be evi- 
dent. That is why at present there is so little correla- 
tion between teaching ability and scores in standard 
tests. 
Is it possible to measure teaching ability by means 
of tests? Most certainly! But it cannot be done by 
one who has not defined what teaching ability is, who 
disregards the law of the single variable, and who 
thinks that the routine application of a mechanical 
device will take the place of intelligent analysis and 
interpretation. In my judgment, the most important 
problem before the teaching profession today is the 
definition of what good teaching is in terms of the 
effects to be produced in children and the development 
of standard tests of teaching ability based on these 
definitions.’’ 
The objective method proposed by McCall—McCall 
in How to Measure in Education. thoroughly outlines 
the problems that arise in attempting to measure the 
merit of teachers in terms of the results which they 
achieve. He says in part: 
“Since, however, teachers and supervisors are both 
likely to demand in the near future that their work be 
evaluated in a more scientific and hence=more’ imppt- 
sonal manner, there is summarized below what@ done 
ceive to be the fundamental assumptions underlying 
a scientific procedure for rating and promoting teach-
-P-A-G-E-223
  PROBLEMS IN MEASURING THE MERIT OF TEACHERS 205 
ers and supervisors as well as the steps in the process 
of making such ratings. 
1. The pupil is the center of gravity or sun of the 
educational system. Teachers are satellites of this 
sun and supervisors are moons of the satellites. 
2. All the paraphernalia of education exist for just 
one purpose, to make desirable changes in pupils. 
3. The worth of these paraphernalia can be meds- 
ured in just one way, by determining how many desira- 
ble changes they make in pupils. 
4. Hence, the only just basis for selecting and pro- 
moting teachers is the changes made in pupils. 
5. Scientific measurement itself is fair only when 
we measure the amount of desirable change produced 
in pupils by a given teacher. The measurement of 
change requires both initial and final tests. The plan 
outlined below provides for these. 
6. Scientific measurement is fair only when we 
measure amount of change produced in a standard 
time. This requirement can be satisfied. 
7. Scientific measurement is fair only when we 
measure the amount of change in standard pupils. 
The Accomplishment Quotient is included in the plan 
below because this is a device for converting pupils, 
no matter what their intelligence into standard pupils. 
8. Scientific measurement is fair only when the 
measurement is complete. Absolute completeness 
would require a measurement of the amount of changes 
made in children’s purposes as well as their abilities. 
Absolute completeness is of course impossible and is 
in fact not necessary; partly because a chance sam- 
pling of the changes made will be thorough enough,
-P-A-G-E-224
  206 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
and partly because teachers’ skill in making desirable 
changes in, say, reading is probably positively corre- 
lated with their skill in making desirable changes in, 
say, arithmetic. 
The technique for satisfying the foregoing require- 
ments and evaluating a teacher’s efficiency in, say, 
reading follows: 
1. Determine the initial reading score of the pupils 
in the teacher’s class. 
2. Convert initial reading score into reading age. 
3. Determine each pupil’s mental age at the same 
time the initial reading test is given. 
4. Divide mental age by chronological age to get 
LQ: 
5. Divide reading age by mental age to get A. Q. in 
reading. 
6. Estimate final mental age for the end of the 
teaching period. 
7. Determine final reading score at the end of the 
teaching period. 
8. Convert final reading score into final reading age. 
9. Divide final reading age by estimated final men- 
tal age to get final A. Q. 
10. Subtract mean initial A. Q. in reading from 
mean final A. Q. If the mean difference is zero the 
teacher has been typically efficient. If the difference 
is below zero the teacher is below average in efficiency. 
To the extent that the mean average is above zero, 
just to that extent the teacher has shown superior effi- 
ciency in teaching reading. : 
11. Repeat steps, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 for arith- 
metic and the mean A. Q. difference will be an index of
-P-A-G-E-225
  PROBLEMS IN MEASURING THE MERIT OF TEACHERS 207 
the teacher’s efficiency in teaching arithmetic. In simi- 
lar fashion, her efficiency at teaching other measurable 
abilities could be determined. 
12. Compute the mean of these various mean A. Q. 
differences to get a final determination of the teacher’s 
efficiency. Franzen has defined a teacher’s efficiency 
in terms then, of the following formula where N is the 
number of subjects tested or tests given. 
Teacher Efficieney = 
(Reading A.Q. Diff.)-+(Arithmetic A.Q. Diff.) ete. 
N   
In the case of our illustrative fourth grade class the 
teacher’s efficiency was as follows: 
Teacher Efficiency = = =4+3 
The formula may be used not only for the rating of 
teachers but also for selecting new teachers who are 
given a half-year’s trial. 
What to do in the meantime.—The practical admin- 
istrator who has waded through this analysis will 
ask: ‘‘But what am I to do in the meantime?’’ There 
is but one answer. ‘‘Do the best you know how, but 
don’t delude either yourself or others into believing 
that your practices are scientific and free from all per- 
sonal biases. Base your judgments on the answer to 
this one question: Does she get the desired results? 
Don’t be so much concerned with how she gets results 
but see that she gets them.’’? Nutt well says: ‘‘The 
critical point in the measuring of the teacher’s effi- 
ciency is that objective data and thorough analysis of  
-P-A-G-E-226
  208 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
all the elements involved must take the place of sub- 
jective impressions. Objective data and careful analy- 
ses cannot be secured through a few hasty inspectional 
trips or visits to the teacher’s classroom. The rating 
of teachers on inspectional data and impressions is 
educationally unscientific, and the practice should be 
replaced by that thorough supervision which can guar- 
antee reliable measurement of teaching efficiency.’’ In 
other words, measured supervision is the real objec- 
tive. 
Main points of the chapter.—l. It is generally be- 
lieved that the merits of teachers should be measured 
and should bear some relation to promotion, salary, 
transfer, and termination of service. 
2. Despite this belief, only 77 per cent of the school 
systems have a definite rating scheme and less than 
half of them utilize it with reference to promotion, 
salary, or transfer, and only slightly more-than one- 
half make termination of service depend upon rating. 
8. Rating schemes are either subjective or objective 
or both. Subjective schemes predominate. Subjective 
schemes measure the accomplishments of teachers in 
terms of personal opinion and by comparison of one 
teacher with another or with a group. Their scientific 
value is, therefore, limited. 
4, An analysis of typical subjective rating schemes 
shows that they attempt to measure teachers in terms 
of their attributes without any exact knowledge of the 
relationship, if any, which exists between these attri- 
butes and the changes wrought in children. 
5. Connor, Knight, Franzen, Kent, Courtis, and Me- 
Call protest against the use of subjective rating 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
  PROBLEMS IN MEASURING THE MERIT OF TEACHERS 209 
schemes and advocate other methods of measuring the 
merit of teachers. Knight and Franzen propose a 
standard professional test for elementary school teach- 
ers. The others propose to measure teachers in terms 
of desirable changes produced in children. 
6. Courtis points out that a new field of research 
is opening up in attempting to establish scientific 
standards of teaching ability. The program requires 
(1) the definition of teaching ability in terms of the 
changes to be produced in children; (2) formulation 
of standard tests for measuring these changes; (3) 
control studies of the relation of all personal and 
method factors; (4) similar studies measuring the 
optimum type of training, and (5) devising tests and 
scales to select the fit from the unfit. 
7. McCall best summarizes the fundamental as- 
sumptions underlying the scientific rating of teachers 
and states the technique for satisfying these require- 
ments. The formula, in mathematical terms, reads: 
Teacher Efficiency = 
(Reading A.Q. Diff.)+ (Arithmetic A.Q. Diff.) 
N 
In this formula N equals the number of subjects. 
A. Q. Diff. means achievement quotient difference. 
PROBLEMS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
1. Debate the following statement: ‘‘Rating is funda- 
mentally wrong, impossible of just and correct application, 
lowering to the self-respect and dignity of teachers both to 
themselves and in the eyes of parents and children, entirely 
unnecessary, a detriment to good pedagogy, a bar to placing

  teaching among the professions.’’ (Parrott, A. L. Abolish- 
ing the Rating of Teachers. N. HE. A. Proceedings, 1915, 
pp. 1168-1173.) 
2. Miss B has been rated by her superintendent, super- 
visor, and principal as a C minus teacher. She is a graduate 
of a normal school and this is her third year of experience 
in the local school system. She is not recommended for re- 
appointment. She appears at the next regular meeting of 
the board and pleads for what she terms a ‘‘square deal.’’ 
She claimed that judged by results she is a success, and that 
she has been discriminated against because the principal does 
not like her. How should her case be handled? 
3. The principal of the school rates Miss R. a superior 
teacher in every respect. The supervisor rates her as average. 
The superintendent rates her as below average. Account for 
this wide divergence of opinion. 
4. Superintendent F when asked to write a recom- 
mendation for a teacher sent a copy of the teacher’s last 
rating in the Rugg score card. The rating was unfavorable 
to, the teacher. She had had but one year’s experience and 
hdd been graded low because of her failure to handle certain 
disciplinary problems. The chances are she would never be 
able to secure another position if her ratings were made 
known at the time of her application. Did the superinten- 
dent act justly? 
5. The vocational supervisor rates a man teacher in the 
continuation school ‘‘below average.’’ Undoubtedly his 
judgment is affected by the fact that the teacher is a 
“Imnocker.’’ The superintendent does not want to hurt the 
teacher’s career unjustly. The superintendent asks three 
others to rate the teacher. Their ratings are good, very 
good, and average. Should the superintendent recommend 
this teacher for reappointment? 
6. Criticize the following statement: . if a rating 
scheme is to be truly helpful, its chief element must be self- 
improvement through self-rating. Improvement of teachers 
in service rests directly upon the initial step of self-criticism. 
It is conceivable that this could be stimulated by the per- 
sonal exhortation of the principal. It rarely is, however. 
It can be stimulated from within more helpfully and con- 
tinuously, provided objective, impersonal schemes can be

developed by which teachers can be made critically conscious 
of their strengths and weaknesses. Thus, rating schemes to 
the present time have revealed an important defect, in that 
they were nearly always an administrative scheme superim- 
posed from above.’’ 
7. Summarize the arguments for the abolition of rating of 
teachers. 
8. Teachers of the local school system seriously object to 
rating schemes or score cards for the measurement of their 
efficiency. Enumerate substitutes for such ratings of 
teachers. 
9. The superintendent notices that but few teachers get 
an A rating by principals during their first, second, third, 
or fourth year of teaching. What is the significance of this 
fact? 
10. The arguments in favor of basing salaries in part on 
merit are: (1) It is good business; (2) It eliminates the unfit ; 
(3) It is scientific; (4) It helps the individual! teacher. Read 
the pamphlet by Miss Kimball (see bibliography) and report 
your conclusions.

  CHAPTER XII 
MEASURING THE TEACHER’S LOAD 
Definitions.—A large number of the personnel prob- 
lems that must be dealt with in selecting and in super- 
vising teachers have to do with the question of a 
proper load. Before considering in detail the prob- 
lems involved it seems necessary to define certain 
terms. Teachers, like workers in other fields, may be 
under-ernployed, mis-employed, over-employed, prop- 
erly-employed, un-employed, or wn-employable. 
Under-employed.—One is under-employed if she is 
not following in a reasonable way and to a reasonable 
degree her best interests, abilities, and capacities and 
those of her employer. Teachers are frequently under- 
employed a part or all of the year simply because they 
are not working up to their normal capacities. For 
that matter, most persons fall in this group. From 
this viewpoint, therefore, most persons are under- 
employed. How frequently do we see abilities that are 
not appreciated! How frequently do we see persons 
who do not properly evaluate their own abilities! The 
waste from under-employment, if it could be measured, 
would probably be greater than from any other source. 
Mis-employed.—A person is mis-employed, in one 
sense, if she is under-employed. From another view- 
point a mis-employed person is one who is unfitted for, 
214
-P-A-G-E-233
  MEASURING THE TEACHER’S LOAD 215 
or unhappy in the task she is performing. Some peo- 
ple are unhappy in teaching and others are unfitted for 
the profession. They should seek other fields, not only 
for their own sake but also for the sake of the chil- 
dren under their instruction. 
Over-employed.—One is over-employed if the work is 
beyond her capacity or her strength. The profession 
of teaching requires of some more than they have to 
give, no matter how ready and willing they may be. 
Not many persons are really overworked. It may be 
necessary for some who think they are overworked to 
organize and systematize carefully their work and 
their time. They must lay out their work and assign 
a regular time for performing regular duties and stick 
to a program. They may not enjoy their work and, 
therefore, feel over-worked. Efficiency requires a 
regular work-program and a regular exercise-pro- 
gram. <A. teacher should cultivate the habit of work- 
ing at top speed while she works and of thoroughly 
enjoying what she is doing. She should drop work at 
all other times and play just as hard. 
Un-employed.—An un-employed person is one who 
has no job. She may be voluntarily or involuntarily 
unemployed. She is unemployable, if no matter how 
hard she tries, she cannot find an opportunity to pur- 
sue her profession. Teachers are voluntarily or in- 
voluntarily unemployed at intervals, as in the summer 
time.. Persons who do not meet the minimum require- 
ments for entrance to the profession and others whose 
personality is decidedly below par are unemployable 
as teachers. 
Properly employed.—A teacher is properly employed

if she is following in a reasonable way and to a rea- 
sonable degree her best interests, abilities, and capaci- 
ties and those of her employer. 
It is very difficult to classify some teachers, and ex- 
tremely easy to classify others. Personal opinion, in 
determining the proper load for the teacher, is a factor 
that cannot be entirely ignored. Furthermore, indi- 
vidual interests or abilities vary widely and no defi- 
nite standard exists in any trade for the measurement 
of proper employment. Physical, mental, moral, social, 
or other personal disabilities, and to a certain extent, 
the customs of both society and the profession, render 
some persons un-employable and others over-, wr, 
mis-, or under-employed. The justice of these ob- 
stacles to proper employment are of course debatable, 
yet few question the necessity of placing obstacles in 
the way of those who would engage teachers promiscu- 
ously. Children should not be taught by Tom, Dick 
and Harry. A sane public policy requires such safe- 
guards to the profession as will guarantee that chil- 
dren are taught by representatives of the best of the 
race. 
In defining proper employment as it affects a 
teacher, certain questions arise. What is a fair load 
for a teacher? How shall the character and weight of 
the load be determined? Shall the load be determined 
in terms of time spent, or in terms of work done, or 
both? Shall the load be proportioned to the age, train- 
ing, sex, ability, salary, subject, and grade taught? 
What other factors must be considered? It is difficult, 
in fact, at present almost impossible to answer any of 
these questions. We can only summarize current opin-
-P-A-G-E-235
MEASURING THE TEACHER’S LOAD 217 
ions and the meagre results of a few scientific investi- 
gations that have been made and from these formulate 
a policy to govern a given situation. 
Methods of measuring the teacher’s load——The in- 
vestigations thus far made to determine the teacher’s 
load have attempted to answer the following ques- 
tions: (1) What is the present number of pupils per 
teacher in grade and high schools separately? (2) 
What is the length of the teaching day and week meas- 
ured in terms of clock-hours? (3) What effect, if any, 
has the size of the class upon the teacher’s load? (4) 
What per cent of the teacher’s weekly load is attribu- 
table to each important factor composing the load? 
(5) What, if any, are the differences in the teacher’s 
load due to sex? (6) What is the effect of the person- 
ality of the class? (7) What is the effect of the num- 
ber of different daily preparations required? (8) 
What is the effect of the number of classes taught 
daily? (9) What is the effect of the amount of clerical 
work required? (10) What is the effect of the required 
extra-curricular and extra-classroom duties? (11) 
What is the effect of the social and civic demands? 
The number of pupils per teacher—The United 
States Bureau of Education, in its annual report for 
the year 1917-18, suggested the following definition for 
‘teaching load.’’ ‘‘The total number of pupils divided 
by the total number of teachers gives what is tech- 
nically known as the teaching load.’’ In their com- 
putation, the number of superintendents, supervisors, 
and principals employed did not enter. The average 
teaching load in all city schools was in 1917-18, 35.6. 
Of all the school systems reporting, 39 per cent have
-P-A-G-E-236
  218 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
a teaching load varying from 31 to 36 pupils. The 
lowest number of pupils per teacher in city school 
systems reporting was 14, the highest 86, the median 
34, and the first and third quartiles 30 and 39, respec- 
tively. 
In 1918, Bliss reported a study of 22 cities in the 
United States. He found the following facts: (1) The 
largest number of pupils per teacher in the elementary 
schools was 51, (2) the smallest number of pupils was 
23, and (3) the average number was 32.4. 
In the same report he gives the largest number 
found in high-school classes as 27, the smallest as 11, 
and the median number as 20. In a similar report of 
1920 the following results were given:

In New York City the size of high-school recitation 
sections is determined by the associate superintend- 
ents of schools in charge of high schools. For some 
years it has been the practice in that city to organize 
ninth grade classes into sections of 40 pupils each in 
order to secure a uniformity in size of classes through- 
out the city. Ballou criticized this practice and sug- 
gested the adoption of standard sections of from 28 
to 35 pupils. 
Table V shows the size of classes in the elementary

schools of 180 cities in Illinois, outside of Chicago, for 
the years 1918-19, 1919-20, and 1920-21. The median 
size was 41.4 in 1918-19, increasing to 43.2 in 1920-21. 
In Chicago the median was approximately 46.

In computing the teacher’s load, one may divide the 
total number of pupils in average daily attendance for 
a given building or school system. The figures given 
in the government report cited above were obtained in 
this manner. Another method is to disregard the 
number of rooms or teachers entirely and compute the 
size of classes only. The figures in Table V were ob- 
tained on this basis. These two results must not be 
confused. 
The best size of class—Table VI gives the result of 
a recent inquiry sent to 270 superintendents in cities 
of 25,000 or more population. Note the wide range of 
opinion. A considerable number would have fewer 
than 20 pupils in each class, while others consider 
classes of 40 as more ideal. One superintendent says  
-P-A-G-E-238
  220 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
he would be satisfied with classes of 55 in the primary 
grades!

The reader is warned against the fallacy of the aver- 
age or median opinion. It is in no sense a standard. 
No one should want to be just average. Furthermore, 
the average of a large number of opinions may be and 
often is worse than the best opinion. 
It appears from this fact that teachers in country 
schools and many small village grade schools are in 
a very favorable position with reference to the number 
of pupils to a room. The average for cities is almost 
the maximum for smaller places. Very wide varia- 
tions exist within the same school system as well as 
between cities. Hach district is a law unto itself. It 
is doubtful if such figures as the above are worth much 
as astandard. In fact, each school system must make
-P-A-G-E-239
  MEASURING THE TEACHER’S LOAD 221 
its own standards. The average or median practice 
of other cities is not necessarily a reasonable standard 
to be observed by any locality. 
The number of clock-hours.—The layman who goes 
to his work at 8:00 a.m. and quits at 5:00 p.m. and 
works at least half a day Saturday often envies the 
apparent shorter hours per day and per week of the 
teacher. Board members frequently ask administra- 
tive officers to define a teacher’s day and week. What 
is the best method of doing this? Obviously, every 
teacher must do many things besides teach. She must 
organize, administer, and assist in the supervision of 
not only her own room but the remainder of the build- 
ing as well. Furthermore, she has work that falls at 
lunch time and before and after school at the school 
and elsewhere, all of which may be in direct line of 
duty. 
For example, in Rockford, Hlinois, it was found that 
grade school teachers averaged 3 hours and 24 min- 
utes daily in out-of-class work. The teachers in one 
school reported one hour and 24 minutes daily, while 
a teacher in another school in the same city reported 
that she spent 5 hours and 5 minutes! This last state- 
ment was true of only one individual and was by no 
means an average day’s performance. Teachers in the 
high school spent on the average 4.6 hours daily in 
related duties out of class time. The duties included: 
(1) Work for my own school, its pupils, parents, 
teachers and neighborhood doing the following things: 
Examining papers, conducting clubs, work for school 
activities, settlement work, neighborhood interest, 
home visiting, charity, preparing work, and interview-
-P-A-G-E-240
222 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
ing officials; (2) work for the whole system that does 
not include special advantages for my professional 
group, such as attending association meetings, com- 
mittees, preparing letters, reports, recommendations, 
interviewing officials, and codperation with outside or- 
ganizations; (3) work for my particular group that 
involves advantages for the entire system, such as 
attending association meetings, committees, preparing 
letters, reports, recommendations, interviewing offi- 
cials, and codperation with outside organizations; (4) 
educational and social work primarily for my personal 
interest and advantage; study, recreation, and social, 
charitable, religious, political, and economic activities. 
Koos found that, outside of classroom teaching, 
high-school teachers spent on the average on non- 
instructional duties about two hours daily. Extra- 
curricular activities and assembly-room supervision 
took most of this item. Neither grading of papers nor 
preparation of lessons took as much time as other du- 
ties, popular faney to the contrary. According to 
Koos the average time spent by high-school teachers 
daily in all forms of educational duties both instruc- 
tional and non-instructional is as follows: Men prin- 
cipals, 8.82 clock-hours; women principals, 9.59 clock- 
hours; men teachers, 9.03 clock-hours, and women 
teachers, 8.86 clock hours. 
Woody studied the out-of-school-hours of 130 grade 
and high-school teachers. A summary of the number 
of hours per week devoted to school work outside of 
the school building shows the following averages: 
Preparing lessons, 4 hours; grading papers, 2 hours; 
helping pupils after school, 114 hours; supervising ac-
-P-A-G-E-241
MEASURING THE TEACHER’S LOAD 223 
  tivities, % hour; reports, 1 hour; visiting homes of 
pupils, %4o hour; reading professional literature, 114 
hours. 
A summary of the out-of-school time of these teach- 
ers shows that they spend 11 hours per week on school 
matters and 18 hours per week on recreational activi- 
ties, contradicting the common notion that teachers 
are too busy for recreation. A comparison of high- 
school and elementary teachers shows that the high- 
school teachers give more time to school work outside 
of school, and that the primary teachers give less than 
other elementary teachers. The time for recreation 
for the various groups was practically uniform. The 
more experienced teachers give considerably less time 
to recreation. In conclusion, Woody states that: 
“The average teacher gives 2.2 hours per day to 
school work outside the classroom. This makes the 
entire working day from 7.2 to 8.2 hours in length, 
which is comparable with that of industrial occupa- 
tions. An average of 3.6 clock-hours daily are given 
to recreation. As a whole the men teachers give less 
outside time than women and the executives more than 
teachers.’’ 
In another study Woody shows that the number of 
minutes per week spent by high and grade school 
teachers on school duties of all kinds is, on the aver- 
age, as follows: 
High School Elementary 
School Activities ..... 830 min. 770 min. 
Recreation: .\. ci = nts 792 min. 945 min. 
Self Improvement .... 104 min. 139 min. 
Home Duties ..:..... 717 min. 826 min. 
   
-P-A-G-E-242
  224 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
He concludes that the high-school teacher’s load is 
from 8 to 15 per cent heavier than that of the elemen- 
tary school teacher. In the same study he shows the 
difference in the medians for high-school men and 
women. These are: 
Men Women 
School Activities ..... 660 min+ 920 min.t 
Recreation ........... 770 min. 819 min. 
Self Improvement .... 120 min. 92 min. 
Home Duties ......... 710 min. 720 min. 
Woody’s final conclusion is that the teaching load 
is not a great factor in determining the salary differ- 
ences that exist between elementary and high-school 
teachers. 
The size of class and the teaching load—Koos found 
from his limited data no appreciable difference in the 
teaching load due to the size of classes. The com- 
monly accepted theory that the smaller the class the 
better the work was not confirmed, as his data indi- 
cated no difference that could be directly attributed 
to this cause. 
For years the North Central Association of Colleges 
and Secondary Schools has maintained certain stand- 
ards concerning the size of classes and the teaching 
load. In general, the standard is: No teacher of aca- 
demic subjects should be assigned more than 160 
student hours of class instruction per day or more 
than 6 classes to teach. No school whose records show 
an excessive number of pupils per teacher based on 
+The wide difference in the medians for school activities is probably 
not so important as indicated, since the quartile values for the two 
groups are almost exactly the same. 
 
-P-A-G-E-243

average daily attendance shall be accredited. In prac- 
tice the association has usually accepted 30 pupils per 
period as a maximum and has penalized schools, ex- 
cept in large cities, that have had oversize sections. 
The enormous influx of students into high schools and 
the greatly increased cost of all phases of education 
has led many school men seriously to question either 
the wisdom or the necessity of such regulations. The 
high schools of New York City could not, if this re- 
quirement was strictly observed, be accredited because 
40 pupils to a section is the rule. 
Effect on marks.—Davis, in 1922, made a careful 
study for the association to test the validity of such 
regulations. He computed 5,897 teachers’ grades or 
marks, distributed among 271 classes in 25 cities. 
From these computations he determined the percent- 
age of pupils gaining the different school marks (A, 
B, C, D, E) in small classes (under 20), medium 
classes (20 to 30) and larger classes (over 30). An 
analysis of his figures seems to indicate that size of 
classes has nothing to do with term grades. 
In another study Davis deals with the marks gained 
by pupils organized into controlled groups. In 20 
cities classes were definitely organized into small, me- 
dium, and large sections. Care was taken to secure 
pupils of comparable intelligence and achievement. 
For 9 weeks these groups were, so far as possible, 
given identical instruction. At the end of 9 weeks, 
tests were given, the marks recorded, and a study 
made of these marks. The conclusion from this study 
was precisely the same as in the previous study. 
Namely: ‘‘The size of the class sections has no
-P-A-G-E-244
  
226 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
important effects upon achievements or pupils’ 
marks.’ 
Size and school efficiency.—A study ? was made under 
the direction of the Bureau of Educational Research 
of the University of Illinois in 1920-21, the purpose 
of which was to determine the effect of variations in 
the size of class upon the achievements of pupils. 
Every effort was made to control all the factors. The 
tests were made on classes in elementary schools rang- 
ing in size from about 30 to 54. The conclusion was, 
“That there is little difference between the achieve- 
ments of the pupils when taught in large classes and 
their achievements when taught in small classes.’’ 
A similar study in high school showed that there 
was a very slight difference in favor of small classes. 
Nevertheless the teaching load is heavier. A teacher 
who gives instruction to five classes of 40 students 
each has a much heavier teaching load than the teacher 
who instructs five classes of 20 students each! 
Effect on teacher.—As Davis points out, there is an- 
other side to the problem. What is the effect of the 
size of the class upon the teacher? Does the large 
class tend to make a heavier teaching load than does 
a small class? What size classes do teachers prefer 
to teach? What have the teachers themselves to say 
on the question? 
To answer these questions, Davis sent a blank con- 
taining the following questions to a large group of 
high-school teachers: 
4Bulletin No. 10, Bureau of Educational Research, College of Edu- 
cation, University of Illinois. Relation of Size of Class to School Ejfi- 
ciency.  
-P-A-G-E-245
  MEASURING THE TEACHER’S LOAD 227 
1. What size class yields the most satisfactory term marks 
to pupils? 
2. What size class yields the least satisfactory term marks 
to pupils? 
3. What size class yields the most satisfactory experiences 
for the teacher (inspiration, challenge to best efforts, etc.) ? 
4. What size class is more fatiguing for the teacher? 
5. What size class do you prefer to teach? 
6. Omitting from consideration the matter of outside cor- 
rection of papers, themes, ete., does the large class add appre- 
ciably to the teaching load? 
According to the replies, teachers believe: (1) That 
the medium sized class yields both the most satisfac- 
tory immediate experiences and the most satisfactory 
term marks for pupils and that, conversely, the large 
class yields the least satisfactory returns on both 
counts; (2) that the medium sized class also yields the 
most satisfactory results to the teachers, although the 
large classes yield more satisfaction than do the very 
small classes; (3) that while the large class is the most 
fatiguing to the teacher, the small class is more fati- 
guing than the medium-sized one; (4) that most teach- 
ers (77.3%) prefer to teach the large classes; and (5) 
that a large percentage of the teachers (42.7%) believe 
that, if they could be relieved of outside work, such 
as the correction of papers, themes, and the like a 
large class would not add appreciably to the teaching 
load. 
Davis raises the question whether the above answers 
were not dictated more by traditional biases than by 
any thought out reasoning. ‘‘Certainly teachers have 
been schooled by our association to believe that the 
smaller the class the greater the pupil interest and 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
  228 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
achievement, and likewise the greater the teacher sat- 
isfactions. In the light of the present studies, ought 
not something be done to modify that opinion? Ought 
not, at least, more attention be given to discovering, 
by experimentation, the real facts of the case in re- 
spect to each teacher individually? For at bottom 
may not the problem be one of individual differences 
entirely ?’’ 
In this connection the expressed views of the teach- 
ers severally are pertinent. The following comments 
were culled from the report by Davis: 
Comments favoring small classes—‘‘Pupils prefer 
a small class because they are called upon oftener.’’ 
“‘The oftener a pupil recites the more effort he makes 
and, therefore, the small or medium-sized sections are 
best.’’ ‘‘There is more opportunity for the lazy pupil 
to slide through the large class.’’ ‘‘Small classes are 
best for dull ones.’’ ‘‘The large class is more fati- 
guing because of the problem of discipline and the 
need of more careful planning and also because of 
the greater number of papers to correct.’’ ‘‘More 
nervous energy is expended in dealing with the more 
and more varied individual differences found in the 
large and medium-sized classes.’’ ‘‘It is harder to keep 
interest in large classes because of less opportunity 
for each individual to recite.’’ ‘‘In large classes the 
teacher must stand more in order to see and be seen.’’ 
“Usually in a large class a number of pupils are 
slower than others; their efforts to recite are a bore 
to the others; there is a loss of interest in the recita- 
tion; and immediately a problem of discipline arises.’ 
‘More careful individual work can be given in a small
-P-A-G-E-247
    MEASURING THE TEACHER’S LOAD 229 
class.’’ ‘‘A teacher has opportunity to come into 
closer personal contact with pupils in small classes.’’ 
“Tn composition work (a teacher of English is speak- 
ing), pupils make individual mistakes; they need 
help; hence the small section is best. In literature, 
numbers add to the interest of the discussions.’’ ‘‘If 
all classes are large, the teacher’s load will be greatly 
increased. If some classes only are large, there is 
stimulation.’’ : 
Comments favoring large classes.—‘‘A large class 
is more interesting to a teacher, but is beset with diffi- 
culties for the dull or timid pupil.’’ ‘‘Large classes are 
best for bright pupils.’’ ‘‘I thoroughly enjoy large 
classes.’’ ‘‘There is less pupil competition in small 
classes, and hence less inspiration for the teacher.’’ 
“The small class has little inspiration for the pupils.’’ 
“‘The pleasure of teaching comes from the responses 
of individuals in the class. This is greater in large 
and medium-sized classes.’? ‘‘There is inspiration in 
a large group. Hach pupil challenges another to 
recite.’’ 
Comments favoring medium-size classes.—‘‘The 
oftener a pupil recites the more effort he makes. 
Therefore the small or medium-sized sections are 
best.’? ‘Small classes lack inspiration, large classes 
are fatiguing.’’? ‘‘The teacher of the small class has 
to work harder to keep interest at a high point.’’ 
“The pupils in a medium-size class, by their discus- 
sions, make the class more interesting than the small 
class.’’ 
Comments favoring different size classes —‘‘I like 
the different size classes for different reasons: the 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
    230 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
class of 35 is lively and interesting; the class of 15 
is industrious and quiet.’’ ‘‘It depends entirely on 
the personality of the class as to which yields the 
most satisfaction to a teacher, and as to which is the 
most fatiguing.’’ ‘Size has nothing to do with the 
problem; all depends on the personality of the class.’’ 
“The hour of the day the class meets is an impor- 
tant factor in adjusting a teacher’s load.’’ 
Pupil-recitation periods per week—The teaching 
load may be measured in one way by computing the 
average number of weekly pupil-recitation periods per 
teacher. In the City School Leaflet No. 9, issued by 
the Bureau of Education at Washington, are given 
statistics of the average weekly pupil-recitation 
periods per teacher in various sections of the coun- 
try. By dividing the weekly load by five, the daily 
load may be easily ascertained. See Table VII. 
Example of a “peak” load.—Many teachers will re- 
call experiences similar to the following example of 
a ‘‘peak’’ load cited by a very successful high-school 
principal. 
“As an example of a ‘peak’ load, I recall one par- 
ticular semester’s work of some twenty years ago in 
which I 
(1) served as principal of a high school of 200 
pupils; 
(2) taught chemistry, physics, botany, algebra, and 
geometry ; 
(3) heard eight recitations daily; 
(4) conducted the eight recitations in a corner of 
a somewhat obstreperous study hall seating 200 
pupils of several grades, in which I had to take

(5) had all the laboratory classes to ee after 
school; 
(6) had a teaching load of 175 pupils daily with 
separate preparations for each period, and 
(7) survived and prospered.’’ 
It was such conditions that made standards such as 
that maintained by the North Central Association nec- 
essary and justifiable. Many young men and women 
just graduating from college will find somewhat simi- 
lar conditions facing them today in frontier high 
schools. 
Factors composing the teacher’s load.—Johnson at- 
tempted to determine from the average judgment of 
242 grade-school teachers the relative influence of 9 
different factors in determining the teacher’s load. 
The approximate weight, in terms of per cent, attrib- 
utable to each factor was: 
Mditude Of pupils... .. 6.22... 5 sees 10 per cent.

PELOMO MELE | ojsyecdle disic. s'o + oie sods olin tieiw 5 per cent. 
Johnson’s figures apply only to elementary schools. 
The factors are so worded as to be practically 
indefinable. 
Davis concludes his study by stating that in his 
judgment, ‘‘The most important determinants of the
-P-A-G-E-251
MEASURING THE TEACHER’S LOAD 233 
teaching load are: (a) the personality of the class; 
(b) the number of different preparations for class- 
work required daily; (c) the number of classes taught 
daily; (d) the amount of clerical work connected with 
the teaching process; (e) the extra curricular and 
extra classroom duties, and (f) the social and ¢ivic 
demands.’’ 
Koos in discussing the teaching load of university 
instructors asserts that the load consists for the most 
part of (a) total teaching time; (b) supervision of 
student research work; (c) non-instructional activi- 
ties; (d) personal research; (e) other official duties, 
and (f) other professional duties. The factors deter- 
mining the distribution of time and energy to the 
different elements of the load are, according to Koos: 
(a) the unit of instruction; (b) the mode of presenta- 
tion; (c) the subject or subject group; (d) the advanced 
character of the work; (e) the instructor’s experience 
with the course; (f) the rank of the instructor; (g) 
the repetition of sections, and (h) the size of classes. 
The approximate weight to be assigned to each of 
these factors depends upon the time, the place, and the 
individual. 
The influence of sex.—Sex alone does not seem to 
be an important factor in determining the teaching 
load. Women appear to be slightly more conscientious 
in the matter of the hours which they work, but the 
data are rather inconclusive even on this point. None 
of the studies have deemed it worth while even to in- 
vestigate the question closely. 
The personality of the class.—The personality of the 
class is to some an intangible factor. But in many
-P-A-G-E-252
  
  234 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
schools today the attempt is made to group pupils 
according to their intelligence and achievement. This 
means a more decided personality. The group tends 
to become alike in certain respects. They are all slow, 
average, or fast as the case may be. Obviously, the 
same teacher cannot handle as many slow pupils as 
she can handle average or fast pupils. At least more 
teachers think they cannot and there is no scientific 
proof to the contrary. 
The number of different preparations.—According to 
the best data available, high-school teachers on the 
average spent about one hour a day in preparing their 
lessons. The typical number of recitations daily is 
5, although 25 per cent of high-school teachers handle 
6 or more. If each lesson requires the same amount 
of time for its preparation, the average teacher spends 
at best only 10 to 15 minutes in its preparation. 
What is the relation between the teacher’s prepara- 
tion for the class-work and the effectiveness of class- 
room teaching? It has generally been thought that the 
greater the preparation the easier and more effective 
would be the recitation. If this is true, certainly the 
teaching load should be so regulated as to allow a 
longer time for preparation of lessons. It is inter- 
esting to note that the teachers who spent the least 
time in preparation for their class work are those who 
are giving instruction in Latin, mathematics, science, 
commercial work, practical arts, fine arts, and physi- 
cal education. Those that spent most time (e.g. those 
that spent more than two hours) are the teachers of 
the social studies and (to a lesser degree) the teachers
-P-A-G-E-253
MEASURING THE TEACHER’S LOAD 235 
of English and modern languages. What is the ex- 
planation for the figures? Is it that the work of the 
first group of instructors is so definite in character, or 
else so dependent upon the particular conditions which 
chance may bring to the classroom, that class prepa- 
ration on the part of the teacher is unnecessary or 
undesirable? Let those who know give the answer. 
Davis shows that in high schools the typical number 
of different daily preparations is 3, although 15 per 
cent of the teachers are obliged to make 4, and 8 per 
cent are compelled to make more than 4. On the other 
hand, 8 per cent of the teachers have a schedule that 
requires only one preparation daily, and 3 per cent 
have such a schedule as to require only two. 
The number of classes per day.—This factor was dis- 
cussed in the preceding paragraph. It is an important 
factor, at least the North Central Association thinks it 
is important. The standard set by the association 
reads: ‘‘The number of daily periods of classroom 
instruction given by any teacher of academic subjects 
shall not exceed six.’’ In colleges, universities, and 
junior colleges, an effort is constantly made to reduce 
the number of recitations per day or per week. Thus, 
Learned and Bagley sharply criticize the normal 
schools of Missouri for the overload inflicted upon 
many members of the teaching staff. Case after case 
is cited in which 35 periods per week are required or 
expected. They propose that this shall be cut to 15 
periods a week or an average of 3 per day for 5 days. 
It is interesting to note that in high schools, 26 per 
cent of teachers are now given a schedule of but 4
-P-A-G-E-254
  236 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
classes daily. Only 25 per cent have an allotment of 
more than 5 classes daily. The length of the period 
is, in all but 21 per cent of the cases, 45 minutes. In 
7 per cent, it is longer than 60 minutes and in 14 per 
cent it is from 50 to 60 minutes in length. 
The required clerical work.—One of the most im- 
portant factors affecting the teacher’s load is the time 
required for clerical work such as correcting papers 
and reading themes. The typical high school teacher 
spends from 30 to 60 minutes daily in tasks of these 
_ sorts, although there are approximately as many 
teachers who spend less than this amount of time as 
there are who spend more than this amount. The 
entire distribution is as follows: No time whatever, 
8 per cent; under 30 minutes daily, 22 per cent; from 
30 to 60 minutes daily, 33 per cent; from 61 to 90 min- 
utes daily, 19 per cent; and over 90 minutes daily, 18 
per cent. : 
Among the different departments of instruction, the 
ones in which teachers spend in excess of one hour 
daily in clerical work of the kind mentioned are: Eng- 
lish with 60 per cent; modern language, with 52 per 
cent; Latin, with 48 per cent; physical training (how- 
ever, with only 10 teachers reporting), with 40 per 
cent; mathematics and the social studies, each with 
33 per cent; and the others ranging from 30 per cent 
down. On the other hand, the percentages by depart- 
ments of those spending less than thirty minutes daily 
in this kind of work are as follows: Fine arts, 61 per 
cent; commercial work, 53 per cent; mathematics, 37 
per cent; practical arts, 34 per cent; physical training, 
30 per cent; science, 27 per cent; social studies, 22 per
-P-A-G-E-255
    
MEASURING THE TEACHER’S LOAD 237 
cent; English, 15 per cent; modern language, 14 per 
cent; and Latin, 11 per cent. 
Here again it is apparent that every conscientious 
teacher has more or less of this kind of out-of-school 
work to perform. It varies with departments of in- 
struction and among individual teachers. It is, how- 
ever, a question that cannot fairly be ignored by any 
school administrator seeking to equalize the teaching 
loads and trying to keep his school on a sound ad- 
ministrative basis. 
Extra-curricular and extra-classroom duties.—There 
are, in every school, various routine duties and special 
occasional duties that always add. to the sum total of 
the load carried by teachers. Among these duties are: 
session room supervision, hall duty, attendance on 
auditorium or assembly meetings, consultations with 
principal or superintendent, attendance on teachers’ 
meetings, special lectures or other gatherings, and 
calling at pupils’ homes on special business. Accord- 
ing to reports made by teachers in the study by Davis, 
47 per cent of them spent more than 120 minutes per 
day in duties of these kinds; 24 per cent of them spent 
from one hour to two hours daily in this way; 18 per 
cent of them spent from 30 minutes to 60 minutes thus; 
while only 11 per cent were exempt with less than 
30 minutes daily. Here, also, is found considerable 
variation when the different departments are com- 
pared. For example, 79 per cent of the Latin teachers 
spent over two hours daily in performing duties of 
the kind specified, while 71 per cent of the mathematics 
teachers, 67 per cent of the practical arts teachers, 
54 per cent of the commercial teachers, and 53 per cent 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
    238 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
of the physical training teachers did likewise. Not 
all teachers are necessarily heavily burdened with 
tasks of this sort, but the teachers of certain depart- 
ments seem to be called upon for excessive amounts 
of such labor. Here, doubtless, is the heart of the 
trouble. Namely: the extra-curricular duties are not 
properly distributed, or else their importance is not 
properly recognized and a sufficient allotment of the 
regular school time of the teachers is not made for 
them. Too often, he who can and will is given the 
extra tasks connected with those activities without, at 
the same time, being proportionately relieved of his 
normal quota of other school work. 
The social and civic demands.—To what extent ought 
teachers to participate in social, civic, religious, chari- 
table, and other community activities outside of 
school? Davis found that 61 per cent of high-school 
teachers spent less than 60 minutes per week in social 
and civic affairs while 31 per cent reported that they 
spent no time at all in such matters. What is the 
reason that high-school teachers do not concern them- 
selves to any great extent with such matters? Grade- 
school teachers do little more. Is it due to a lack of 
interest or a lack of time and strength? Let each 
teacher answer for herself. 
How a typical high-school teacher spends her week.— 
Davis gives us some further information that is inter- 
esting and which sheds light upon the problem of 
the teaching load in relation to other activities. He 
finds that the typical high-school teacher spends 
the 24 hours of 5 days a week in the following 
manner:
-P-A-G-E-257

Total ........6 ecccceeeee 1440 minutes   
Likewise, this typical teacher spends a portion of Saturdays and 
Sundays in school work and of the Temaining hours of those days, 
devotes himself to the following interests: 
About 40 minutes to physical recreation; 
About 120 minutes to social recreation; 
About 50 minutes to voluntary professional study; 
About 60 minutes to purely cultural activities; 
About 60 minutes to religious and charitable affairs; and 
About 120 minutes to purely personal matters. 
It is of course fair to inquire: Was the week in 
which the above records were obtained a fairly typi- 
cal one? WHighty-five per cent of the teachers say it 
was; fifteen per cent think it was not, but do not 
specify why they think so. 
Do teachers think their load too heavy?—Do teachers 
themselves think their teaching load too heavy? 
Seventy-three per cent say no; 27 per cent say yes. 
What do the teachers think is the effect (on the teach- 
ing load) of the following items: The subject taught; 
the size of the class; the time of day in which the 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
  240 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
class meets; the grade in which the subject is taught; 
the preponderance of boys; the preponderance of 
girls? Only about 500 teachers made answer to any 
of these queries, but of this number, the conclusions 
are: 64 per cent say the subject taught is not a great 
factor in determining the teaching load; 50 per cent 
say the size of the class is not an item that especially 
concerns them; 62 per cent think the time of day in 
which the class meets is not of great consideration; 54 
per cent think that the grade in which the subject is 
found has little to do with the load; 87 per cent believe 
that the preponderance of either boys or girls in a 
class has no noticeable relation to the load. 
The following individual comments made by various 
teachers in connection with the formal reports show in 
a still more positive way what they severally think of 
the teacher’s load: 
“Tf a teacher is efficient, she must have time for sleep, 
meals, and relaxation. If three or four hours per week are 
taken up with reports, meetings, and similar activities, it 
means so much less on school preparation.’’ 
“<Tf a teacher has five or six classes with five or six different 
preparations, something must be allowed to slip. Many teach- 
ers let that be their health.’’ 
“In my judgment, the classroom work is the lighter end 
of the job. Home duties, and lack of opportunities for di- 
version constitute the heavier burdens.’’ 
“‘Most of my preparation (for school work) is done during 
the first four weeks of the semester.’’ 
“Detailed reports should be omitted. There are so many 
extra classroom requirements that we cannot be pleasant or 
teach the pupils to the best of our ability.”’ 
‘“No time limit (on class periods) by your association will 
lighten teachers’ loads. Some teachers carry a greater load 
in five minutes than others do in five hours.’’
-P-A-G-E-259
MEASURING THE TEACHER’S LOAD 241 
“The principal of the school is the only one who can 
intelligently apportion the work of the school.’’ 
“‘The association has helped greatly by limiting classes to 
30 pupils. Do not take a step backward by changing the 
limit to a larger number.’’ 
“Get rid of the easy and inefficient teachers who make the 
work easy and the children like it, but who, by so doing, 
make the work of the other teachers harder.’’ 
“Give us a shorter school day, thus allowing teachers to 
attend civic lectures.’’ 
“‘Make provision in the regular schedule of teachers for 
extra-curricular activities, or else pass the extra jobs around 
among some of the staff.’’ 
“‘Pay a teacher all he is worth, and his load will be a 
pleasure.’’ 4 
“‘T am entirely satisfied.’’ 
“‘T do not find the load heavy. The great question is how 
are salaries to be raised so as to induce teachers to make their 
loads heavier voluntarily.’’ 
“The principal or superintendent should know and present 
to the teachers the standards for each course.’’ 
“Let secretarial work be done by hired assistants. The 
teacher’s time is too precious to be devoted to needless de- 
tailed work.”’ 
“‘There should be closer contact between the teacher and 
the administrative body.’’ 
“Hight hours per day is all the time that should be re- 
quired of a teacher to do her entire school work.’’ 
“Pay a living wage so that a teacher need not use 
time outside of school hours working to make financial ends 
meet.’’ 
““My work is not too heavy, but I need more outside inter- 
ests to make life more meaningful.’’ 
How do teachers think the load can be lightened?— 
Specific things which teachers mention as ways of 
lightening the teaching load are: More money in order 
to employ teachers enough; smaller classes; fewer ad- 
ministrative duties; not requiring teacher’s attend-
-P-A-G-E-260
  
242 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
ance on school parties, games, etc.; doing away with 
large study groups; longer class periods and small 
classes; school time for grading papers; adequate 
equipment; good janitor service; prescribed text- 
books; more definite syllabi of instruction; removing 
pests before the teacher’s nerves are wrecked; not to 
have to go to work or stop by a bell or whistle; less 
attention to modern prophets; a shorter school day; 
admitting no new pupils to class after the fifth week; 
giving more care to the program, i.e., the class sched- 
ule arrangement; allowing teachers leave of absence, 
without pay, on request; less outside work for pupils; 
teachers’ rest rooms; more clerks for clerical work; 
more reference books; classification of pupils by men- 
tal tests; less red tape in a school administration; 
fewer questionnaires; one entirely free period each 
day; not allowing make-ups to pupils; relief from ex- 
tension lectures; a regularly employed clerk to assume 
the strictly clerical duties of the session room; provid- 
ing separate classes for defective pupils; business 
methods applied to the teaching staff; more oppor- 
tunities for physical and social recreation; to be 
left alone absolutely one period in the school day; 
two sessions a day, instead of one; forbidding pupils 
whose I. Q. is no higher than 100 to take foreign 
languages. 
How superintendents and principals can lighten the 
teacher’s load.—How can the principal of a building (or 
the superintendent of schools in a small town or vil- 
lage) lighten the load of work of his teachers without 
adding additional teachers, decreasing the number of 
pupils per teacher, eliminating certain of the usual
-P-A-G-E-261
  MEASURING THE TEACHER’S LOAD 243 
       required duties of a teacher, or increasing to an appre- 
ciable extent the usual expenses of administration? 
Fcives a partial answer to this question by 
marized account of suggestions based on 
practices in certain high schools in his own state. In 
examining this summary of specific suggestions, it 
should be noted that many of the directions for light- 
ening the teacher’s load relate to ways and means of 
avoiding unnecessary nervous strain, systematizing 
the teacher’s work, and promoting a better spirit of 
cooperation among the members of the staff. Many 
of the suggestions, it is true, call for either an increase 
in clerical help or the better use of the same, the 
greater use of time-saving devices, better preliminary 
planning by the administrator, and greater attention 
to certain matters of administrative routine. The 
summary of suggestions may be fron the average 
classes or rooms. 
By allowing teachers to use the ida help of the 
school for letters relating to school organizations or 
school business. 
By insisting that the janitor wash the blackboards 
daily and dust and clean the rooms carefully. 
By providing simplified printed forms for all regu- 
lar school reports, notices, etc. 
By insuring that new teachers secure wholesome 
and pleasant places to room and board. 
By insuring that new teachers have adequate oppor- 
tunity to form social contacts with the most desirable 
element of the community. 
By adjusting the teaching load according to the ex- 
perience and health of teachers.  
-P-A-G-E-262

By securing needed instructional supplies in ad- 
vance of the date of actual use. 
By cultivating a spirit of friendlines@gqggeagilie- 
work among teachers. 
By eliminating short periods of 5, 10, or 15 minutes 
at the opening of either session of a high school (it 
makes for more businesslike attitude for work to begin 
promptly following the ringing of the last bell). 
By systematizing the making up of ‘‘missed work’’ 
in such a way as to give teachers certain freedom at 
the close of school. 
By distributing advisory responsibilities for student 
activities in such a way as to make the work a real 
pleasure rather than a heavy burden. 
By providing student messengers, student assistants 
in laboratory work, student assistants in library work, 
ete., used to advantage by the building principal in 
checking his own practices in the matter of adjusting 
and lightening the load of work of teachers. 
By providing substitutes promptly rather than al- 
lowing the teachers or the principal to assume the 
work of an absent teacher. 
By providing new teachers with summarized state- 
ments of the established rules, regulations, and poli- 
cies enforced in the school building (brief and 
specific). 
By settling promptly the cases of classroom disci-

teachers.” 
By avoiding long, tedious, uninteresting teachers’ 
meetings at the close of a full day of regular work. 
By preventing or reducing to a minimum the inter- 
ferences with the usual routine of the daily schedule; 
that is, special assemblies, interruptions by visitors,

By cultivating on the part of the pupils a whole- 
some respect for the authority of the teacher. 
By protecting the teachers against the unwarranted 
attacks of spiteful critics. 
By removing promptly objectionable and incorrigi-

for conducting written quizzes and for testing daily 
preparation. 
By helping teachers to discover other ways of solv- 
ing disciplinary problems than the customary one of 
keeping pupils after school. 
By providing a rest bench or high stool or chair 
in each grade room or recitation room. 
By providing a teachers’ rest room on each floor 
of a large building. 
By carrying on supervision in such a way as to elimi-

regular teacher. 
By securing united emphasis on certain habits and 
ideals of pupil conduct. 
By centralizing administration and by having the 
administrative functions performed at the central

Conclusions by Davis.—The following conclusions 
are given by Davis who has undoubtedly studied the 
problem of the teaching load more intensively and ex- 
tensively than the other investigators and, therefore, 
his opinions merit our respect. 
There is no necessary connection between size of 
class and efficiency of instruction as measured by 
pupil’s grades. 
Many teachers prefer to teach large classes, al- 
though the majority express themselves as preferring 
small or medium-size classes. 
Many pupils apparently prefer to be enrolled in 
large classes, although there are few data by which 
to be guided in making a judgment. 
The size of a class in and of itself is not a para- 
mount factor in determining the equity of the teaching 
load. 
If teachers should be relieved of some of the added 
clerical duties incident to large classes, greater num- 
bers would prefer to teach such classes, and there 
would, moreover, be ample justification for the ad- 
ministrative authorities to assign at least some large 
classes to all such persons. 
The North Central Association is not justified in 
 
-P-A-G-E-265
  MEASURING THE TEACHER’S LOAD 247 
demanding that for all teachers, in all types of work, 
the maximum size of class shall be no greater than 30 
pupils, or that the maximum number of pupil-hours 
of instruction per day shall not exceed one hundred 
fifty. 
The most important determinants of the teaching 
load are: (a) The personality of the class; (b) the 
number of different preparations for class-work re- 
quired daily; (c) the number of classes taught daily; 
(d) the amount of clerical work connected with the 
teaching process; (e) extra curricular and extra class- 
room school duties; and (f) social and civic demands 
made upon the teacher. 
The principal of the school is the only one who can 
intelligently apportion the work of the school; even 
he, however, has little scientific data to guide him. 
As corollaries of the conclusions reached above, the 
following practical deductions seem warranted: 
1. A considerable economy of money can be had 
by organizing some, at least, of the classes in the 
school as large classes, and by putting in charge of 
these classes teachers who can effectively manage and 
instruct them. 
2. Considerations of good administration demand 
that machinery of some sort should be developed 
whereby teachers who are capable of instructing large 
classes, and prefer to do so, shall be discovered, 
trained, and promoted. 
8. An obligation rests upon school standardizing 
agencies to assist in dissipating the erroneous notion 
that large classes are always undesirable and should 
be avoided.
-P-A-G-E-266
248 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
  4. The teaching load should be adjusted upon as 
scientific a basis as possible, but with reference always 
to the ability of each individual to carry burdens. 
5. Promotions and financial rewards should be 
graded in accordance with the size and importance of 
the load carried. 
6. An obligation rests upon school administrative 
officers to aid teachers in securing desirable living 
quarters and to assist them to find opportunities for 
congenial social intercourse, and suitable recreational 
diversions. 
Main points of the chapter.—1. It is very difficult to 
determine the proper load for a worker in any field. 
One may be wnder-employed, mis-employed, over- 
employed, properly-employed, wn-employed, or wun- 
employable, depending upon many factors, some of 
which are within and some beyond the control of the 
individual, 
2. The teacher does not escape this difficulty. It is 
in fact almost impossible to define a proper load for 
a given teacher, and much more difficult to make a 
definition that applies en masse. We can only say, in 
general, that a teacher is properly employed if she 
is following in a reasonable way and to a reasonable 
degree her best interest, abilities, and capacities and 
those of her employer. 
3. The investigations thus far made to determine 
the teacher’s load have attempted to answer the fol- 
lowing questions: (1) What is the present number 
of pupils per teacher in grade and high school sepa- 
rately? (2) What is the length of the teaching day 
and week measured in terms of clock-hours? (3) 
 
-P-A-G-E-267
  MEASURING THE TEACHER’S LOAD 249 
What effect, if any, has the size of the class upon the 
teacher’s load? (4) What per cent of the teacher’s 
weekly load is attributable to each important factor 
composing the load? (5) What, if any, is the differ- 
ences in the teacher’s load due to sex? (6) What is 
the effect of the personality of the class? (7) What 
is the effect of the number of different daily prepara- 
tions required? (8) What is the effect of the number 
of classes taught daily? (9) What is the effect of the 
required extra-curricular and extra-classroom duties, 
and (10) What is the effect of the social and civic 
demands? 
4. The present number of pupils per teacher varies 
widely, depending especially upon the size and divi- 
sion of the school system and the subject taught. It 
is very commonly used as an index of the teacher’s 
load but at best is a very crude and unsatisfactory 
measure. 
5. The number of clock-hours per week for teachers 
is a better measure of the teacher’s load and, accord- 
ing to the available studies, averages about seven and 
one-half hours daily for 514 days per week. 
6. The general conclusion seems to be that the size 
of class, contrary to popular belief, has little, if any, 
marked influence upon the achievements of pupils as 
measured by marks or by achievement tests. 
7. The few attempts to measure the relative weight 
that different factors have in making up the teacher’s 
load are indefinite and unsatisfactory. 
8. Sex has no appreciable influence on the teacher’s 
load. 
9. The personality of the class, especially where
-P-A-G-E-268
  250 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
homogeneous speed grouping is used, appears to have 
considerable weight. 
10. The number of different daily preparations is 
also an important factor in determining the teacher’s 
load. 
11. The number of classes per day is another im- 
portant factor in measuring the teacher’s load. 
12. The required clerical and extra-classroom and 
extra-curricular duties add very materially to the 
teacher’s load. Administrative officers should do all 
in their power to distribute properly such duties so as 
more nearly to equalize the loads carried by the 
teachers. 
13. The social and civic demands do not seem to be 
excessive. 
14. A typical high-school teacher’s week is given 
to illustrate the present load. It shows an interesting 
diversity of duties and does not indicate that the 
teacher is particularly overloaded. In fact, it seems 
to be a fair sample of a proper load. 
15. High-school teachers, as a rule, do not complain 
of being overloaded. The 25 per cent who do com- 
plain make various suggestions whereby their load 
may be lightened. 
16. Superintendents, principals, and supervisors 
can appreciatively lighten the teacher’s load by follow- 
ing some of the suggestions offered by teachers. 
17. Davis’ conclusions are sound and constitute an 
accurate summary of the facts so far as high-school 
teachers are concerned.
-P-A-G-E-269

PROBLEMS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
1. Two board members investigate the teaching load in the 
local high school after complaints have come to them of 
unfair discrimination. They find that the head of the Eng- 
lish department teaches but four classes and that the dean 
of girls has but two classes daily. They overlook the facts 
that these teachers have many extra office duties, in the one 
ease the supervision of all English classes in the junior and 
senior high schools and in the second case the dean of girls 
has long office hours for conferences and is really an assist- 
ant to the principal. The board demands that each teacher 
be given a full six class day as other teachers. How may 
the board be made to realize what is a just load for these 
teachers? 
2. A board member visits the high school and finds three 
teachers ‘‘sitting around,’’ as he tells it. He asks the super- 
intendent to make a report showing what each teacher does 
each hour of the day. Visit a high school and write such a 
report. 
8. The high school principal assigns six classes to four of 
his fifty teachers. All other teachers have five classes. The 
four teachers feel that they are being unfairly loaded and 
ask to be paid extra for the extra class. The principal refers 
the matter to the superintendent who in turn explains to the 
teachers that the board would not grant an additional teacher 
or pay any teacher extra for handling six classes. What 
should the four teachers do? What should the principal and 
superintendent do? 
4. Make a special study of the teaching load of grade 
school teachers, kindergarten, grades 1 to 3, 4 to 6, and 7 to 9. 
First, enumerate the wnits you plan to use in measuring each 
teacher’s load. Then apply the units. Compare your result 
for each teacher. 
5. Enumerate the arguments in favor of loading each 
teacher according to her ability, capacity, and interest with- 
out regard to ‘‘standards’’ or what other teachers say or do. 
6. In a certain school system the platoon or work-study- 
play plan of organization has been adopted in two of the 
twenty-two grade school buildings. The teachers in platoon  
-P-A-G-E-270
  
252 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
schools must remain on duty one-half hour longer than in 
other buildings. Should they be paid extra? Why? 
7. The superintendent is asked by a new principal to state 
the hours of teachers. How should he reply? Why?

CHAPTER XIII 
AGE, SEX, AND PROFESSIONAL STABILITY 
Importance of age——Comparatively few persons 
make of teaching a life career. For the vast majority, 
teaching is a temporary matter. For women it is 
a means of occupying themselves, or making a living, 
or securing a little fund against the day when mar- 
riage will relieve them of the monotony of the school 
room. The wag’s definition of the teaching profes- 
sion in the public schools is not far from the truth. 
The teaching profession is composed of ‘‘a mob of 
mobile maidens meditating matrimony.’’ This is par- 
ticularly true in rural and small communities. 
Young men look upon education largely as a step- 
ping-stone to something better in the business world, 
or as a means of financial recuperation in order to 
continue their studies in one of the other professions. 
‘Men and women entering education with these tempo- 
rary, superficial, and transitory interests do not par- 
ticularly better the conditions of those engaged in 
teaching. They do not build up higher standards of 
qualifications nor do they engage in research or in 
professional activities that promote the general wel- 
fare. As one man says: ‘‘Those who take the most 
out of the salary basket and contribute the least to 
253
-P-A-G-E-272
  254 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
the professional standing of teaching are under 25 
years of age.’? This would indicate that teaching is 
not a profession for the majority of beginners but a 
useful temporary stepping-stone to something else. 
It is a statistical fact that most_young women are mar- 
ried before they are twenty-five years of age. 
The great majority of teachers are between the ages 
of 20 and 30. Davis found 60 per cent of high-school 
teachers between these ages and Judd, in St. Louis, 
found an equal per cent of elementary school women. 
Clover in Michigan showed in 1917-18 that more than 
one-half of the women teachers were 25 years of age, 
and Works, in the survey of the rural schools in New 
York already cited, showed that the median age of 
teachers in one-teacher rural schools was 23.7; in two- 
teacher rural schools, 27.7; in village elementary 
schools, 28.5; in high schools, 26; in third class cities, 
29; and in second class cities, 34. The figures last 
cited indicate the drift of older teachers to the larger 
schools and communities. The rural schools are prac- 
tically little more than practice schools for beginners. 
Average age of teachers.—In the survey of the nor- 
mal schools of Missouri, Learned and Bagley found 
that the average teaching life of a teacher in the 
grade schools of Missouri was approximately eleven 
years. About 9 per cent were wholly inexperienced 
each year. The average turnover in small school sys- 
tems is often greater than this. In the State of Mis- 
souri, as a whole, the turnover was approximately 33% 
per cent and in the rural schools, 66% per cent. In 
the high schools of Missouri, 25 per cent of the teach- 
ers were new; 10% of them were resuming teaching 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
AGE, SEX, AND PROFESSIONAL STABILITY 255 
after an interruption perhaps for study; and 15% 
were wholly untried. 
It would appear from this that 15 per cent of the 
total number of high-school teachers are new to the 
profession each year. Probably the statistics from 
Missouri are fairly typical of the United States as a 
whole. From 11 to 15 per cent of the entire teaching 
population must be recruited anew each year. The 
average tenure of teachers is somewhere between six 
and nine years. No very careful and exact study has 
ever been made of this important subject despite hun- 
dreds of investigations of a superficial character. 
Age and certification.—For years past increased ef- 
fort has been made to protect the teaching profession 
against the entrance of very young and immature per- 
sons. These efforts have resulted in legislative acts 
in 38 states establishing a minimum age requirement 
for certification. The facts are set forth in Table VIII. 
The reader will note that only 10 states fail to specify 
a minimum age. In 5 of the 38 states specifying a 
minimum age, a higher age is required for a more 
advanced certificate. Only one state (Texas) grants 
a certificate to a 16-year-old person, and only 6 states 
(Mississippi, Vermont, Wyoming, Alabama, Maine, 
and Minnesota) to a 17-year-old person. In 28 states a 
person must be 18, and in Delaware, 20 years old in 
order to receive even the lowest certificate. It is a 
curious fact that Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Con- 
necticut, and New Hampshire fail to specify any mini- 
mum age, but in practice the beginners in those states 
are usually older than in many states where a mini- 
mum age is specified.

  AGE, SEX, AND PROFESSIONAL STABILITY 257 
Age of beginners——An examination of the ages of 
normal-school pupils indicates that many of them are 
under age during the period of training. In the state 
normal schools of Missouri in 1913-14, 5 per cent of 
the enrolment was less than 17; 11 per cent less than 
18; 23 per cent less than 19; and 35 per cent less than 
20 years of age. In the recent survey of the rural 
schools of New York, the facts concerning the ages of 
teachers are as set forth in Table IX.

Davis, in 1922, studied the beginning age of teachers 
of academic subjects in the high schools belonging to 
the North Central Association. He found that 25.7 
per cent of the academic teachers begin teaching un- 
der 20.. Judd in the St. Louis Survey (1922) found 
only 27 women and one man 20 years of age or under 
teaching in the schools of that city. Jessup in the 
Cleveland Survey (1915) found only four women 
teachers under 20 in Cleveland. These facts would 
seem to indicate that the beginning age in cities is 
from one to two years higher than in the rural schools.
-P-A-G-E-276
  258 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
Raise the beginning age-——What is the significance 
of the data concerning the age of beginning teachers? 
A vigorous campaign should be waged in every state 
in the Union to raise the minimum age for any certifi- 
cate to 20 years at the earliest possible date. By 
raising the age three things are assured. These are: 
increased maturity, increased academic and profes- 
sional preparation, and increased professional stabil- 
ity. Increased minimum salaries warrant increased 
minimum ages and minimum qualifications. It is a 
fact that most beginning teachers today can earn more 
money in a school room during the first two or three 
years of teaching than they can earn in any other 
occupation. With high initial salaries should go in- 
ereased standards of age, maturity, and academic and 
professional qualifications. Only by such means can 
a stable teaching profession become established. 
Age and the teacher’s training—What is the sig- 
nificance of age to the teacher’s training? Works 
gives a table showing the percentage of teachers re- 
ceiving a certain amount of training in various types 
of schools. These data will be found in Table X. 
From Table X it would appear that between 10 
and 15 per cent of elementary school teachers in the 
State of New York have attended high school two 
years or less and that between 45 and 66 per cent have 
attended four years or more. From the facts sub- 
mitted by Works it would appear that age has a defi- 
nite relation to the problem of the amount of training. 
Relatively speaking, the older the teacher, the more 
training she has had. However, this is not necessarily 
true. After the first five or six years of training, as

Judd points out, ‘‘The difference between the new 
teacher and the old teacher in the matter of training 
does not seem to be consistently in favor of either 
group. In some states the new teacher seems to ex-

Forty N. Y. cities of 3rd class and 7 of 2nd had 80 per 
cent and 62 per cent with two years and more. 
about as many other states the reverse is true. In 
the survey of the schools of Missouri in 1914-15 it 
was estimated that about 2400 new teachers were 
needed annually in that State to supply the rural 
schools alone. A critical study of 452 inexperienced 
teachers shows that 24 per cent receive less than four 
years of high school instruction, and 4 per cent have 
no training above the elementary school. Generally 
speaking, the older the beginner the greater amount 
of training she possesses. If the age for entrance 
could be moved up two or three years, undoubtedly
-P-A-G-E-278
  260 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
the amount of preparation would increase in direct 
ratio. 
Age and teachers’ efficiency.—Works is firmly of 
the opinion that there is a very definite relation 
between age and efficiency. He says: ‘‘Age and 
experience go together, of course, and both are recog- 
nized within certain limits, as contributing to the 
efficiency of the teacher. It is true that a girl of 18, 
just out of high school, may do excellent work in her 
first position in an unsupervised rural school. But 
it is generally agreed that these cases are very ex- 
ceptional and that the measures provided by training, 
age, and experience, although rough measures, can 
safely be called quite true and accurate when one is 
attempting to evaluate the work of so large a group of 
teachers as that represented by the rural schools of 
New York State. 
Kahn places most of the blame for failure at the 
door of inexperience. He believes that even ‘‘born’’ 
teachers improve with experience. ‘‘The teacher 
whose head is crammed with pedagogic rules cannot 
teach and lacks judgment. He knows a remedy but is 
unable to diagnose the case and fails to apply it. 
From his entire mass of pedagogic knowledge he is 
unable to draw the principle which fits the particular 
ease and this inability is principally due to a lack of 
experience or practice.’’ 
Cubberley states: ‘‘Many superintendents, who 
must be regarded as authorities, contend that after 
a certain number of years of service, most teachers 
reach a plane where they cease to make any substan- 
tial improvement without further study and training.
-P-A-G-E-279
  
  AGE, SEX, AND PROFESSIONAL STABILITY 261 
This point is usually placed at about the seventh or 
eighth year of teaching experience.’’ Obviously, the 
period of years will depend upon the individual. 
Knight has recently made one of the few studies of 
the effect of age. He begins the study by asking a 
question and answering it. ‘‘Has age anything to do 
with good teaching?’’ His answer is: ‘‘Age has little, 
if anything to do with good teaching and should con- 
sequently be neglected in the selection of teachers or in 
any other circumstances.’’ This is rather a sweeping 
statement based upon an investigation involving only 
100 teachers in 3 school systems. Seventy-five high- 
school graduates were asked to write down the age 
and the means employed by the two most helpful 
teachers that they had had while in school; the two 
least helpful and their ages; the ages of the two best 
liked and also the same regarding the two least liked. 
The ages were approximates only. The results of his 
study are summarized in Tables XI and XII.

Knight’s conclusions were: ‘‘The percentages are 
larger in the case of young teachers because there are 
more teachers to choose from. But the proportion is 
no greater with the old and the reverse is also true. 
Consequently, we can lay it down, pending contradic- 
tory data which probably will never come, that being 
a helpful or well liked or at least helpful or non-liked 
teacher is not a matter of age.’’ It is doubtful if such 
a conclusion is warranted, based on the meager data 
at hand and the particular method used in determining 
merit. 
Courtis of Detroit is making an extended investiga- 
tion of this question but his results are not at present 
available. Pending this investigation, the reader will 
do well to hold in abeyance any definite conclusions re- 
garding the significance of age and its relation to 
teachers’ efficiency. 
Age and adaptability.—It is one of the basic laws of 
psychology that with the increase of age there is a 
lessening of the power of flexibility. Habits become 
fixed and the power of adaptation decreases. This, of 
course, varied with the individual. In some, flexibility 
and adaptability increase with age. William James 
has admirably set forth his views on this matter in 
his well known chapter on habit. ‘‘Habit,’’? James 
says, ‘‘dooms us all to fight out the battle of life upon 
the lines of our nurture or our early choice, and to 
make the best of a pursuit that disagrees, because 
there is no other for which we are fitted, and it is too 
late to begin again. . . . Already at the age of twenty- 
five you see the professional mannerisms settling down 
upon the young commercial traveler, on the young doc-
-P-A-G-E-281
  AGE, SEX, AND PROFESSIONAL STABILITY 263 
tor, on the young minister, on the counsellor-at-law. 
You see the little lines of cleavage running through 
the character, the tricks of thought, . . . the ways of 
the ‘‘shop’’ in a word, from which the man can by- 
and-by no more escape than his coat sleeve can sud- 
denly fall into a new set of folds. . . . It is well for 
the world that in most of us, by the age of thirty, the 
character has set like plaster and will never soften 
again. If the period between twenty and thirty is the 
critical one in the formation of intellectual and profes- 
sional habits, the period below twenty is more impor- 
tant still for the fixation of personal habits... . 
Hardly ever is a language learned after twenty, spoken 
without a foreign accent. . . . The great thing then in 
education is to make our nervous systems our ally 
instead of our enemy. It is to fund and capitalize our 
acquisitions, and live at ease upon the interest of 
the fund. For this we must make automatic and ha- 
bitual, as early as possible, as many useful habits as 
we can.”’ 
This statement coming from one of America’s fore- 
most psychologists, even though written some years 
ago, is recognized as true today. It means that age is 
important especially when educational procedure and 
educational viewpoints are changing almost overnight. 
Psychologically, it is impossible for the older teacher 
without having been grounded in a scientific attitude 
early in her career, readily to change her conceptions 
and procedure to meet new educational requirements. 
This idea is voiced by Judd in commenting upon the 
age of the teachers in the St. Louis system: ‘‘It ap- 
pears from this table that less than one-half«of  
-P-A-G-E-282
264 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
the teachers have had ten years’ experience. This 
' fact is favorable in so far as it gives promise of great 
flexibility of thought and greater willingness to take 
up new practices.’’ 
Age and Salary.—If training, experience, and effi- 
ciency increase with age, then salary also should 
increase. One of the greatest factors in attracting 
teachers into the profession is the high initial salary. 
One of the greatest factors in causing teachers to leave 
the profession soon after they have entered it can be 
traced to the small amount of increase. Usually the 
maximum is only one and one-half times the minimum 
salary. If, for example, the minimum is $1000, the 
maximum is usually $1500. It is pointed out in the 
Baltimore Survey that ‘‘Teachers salaries should be 
based primarily on the needs of those who remain per- 
manently in the service rather than on the needs of 
the younger group, many of whom will teach but a 
short time.’’ It is the terminal salary rather than the 
mitial salary that should have the most serious con- 
sideration. 
In practically every school system there are two dis- 
tinct groups of teachers in the elementary school and 
in the high school. (1) The younger group range in 
age from 18 to 28 or 30, and (2) a more mature group 
made up of teachers between the ages of 35 to 50. Of 
the younger group, it can be predicted with almost 
certainty that over one-half will leave the service be- 
fore they reach the age of 30,—many, indeed, after 
three, four, or five years of teaching. Of the second 
group, a great majority will remain in service until 
they reach the age of retirement. ‘‘These mature and  
-P-A-G-E-283
  
AGE, SEX, AND PROFESSIONAL STABILITY 265 
permanent teachers form the backbone of the public 
school service in all of our school systems. Upon the 
conditions under which they work, the rewards and 
recognitions which they receive, and the facilities that 
are provided to insure their professional growth, will 
‘depend very largely, not only the efficiency of their 
teaching, but also the repute in which the calling is 
held by the public and its attractiveness to the type 
of young person which it seeks to enlist in its service.’’ 
Age and pensions.—The earlier purpose of teachers’ 
pensions and retirement systems was to provide for 
the aged. It was felt that the old teachers had given 
the schools their best at a minimum wage. They had 
not been able to save enough money upon which to 
retire. Therefore, sympathy, charity, and decency 
demanded that these old teachers be retained in service 
even after they were no longer able to render the effi- 
cient service demanded by a modern school system. 
By pensioning such teachers, it was thought that the 
problem would be solved. Originally, pensions were 
provided for this group only. 
Today the emphasis is shifting. We are taking a 
broader view of the problem. All the newer pension 
systems provide benefits for all the members of the 
school system regardless of age. These newer sys- 
tems deal not only with the contingencies of super- 
annuation and disability after long service, but also 
with death or disability at any time, with resignation 
and dismissal, and even with differences of salary 
level. For example, the pension systems now in opera- 
tion in Massachusetts, New York City, Pennsylvania, 
and Connecticut refund all contributions with interest
-P-A-G-E-284
  266 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
in case of resignation and dismissal or death, or they 
provide certain optional benefits. 
The real purpose of the present-day pension systems 
is to encourage teachers to remain in the profession. 
This will increase the average teaching life of the 
teachers and make for a more permanent personnel. 
The scope of the present-day pension systems is 
rapidly being enlarged, not only in teaching but in 
many other professions and trades. Provisions are 
being made for disability even in the case of young 
teachers on the grounds that the hardship which pre- 
mature disability may cause when one is young may 
be far greater than if incapacity comes in old age. 
Slowly, therefore, the great importance of disability, 
death benefits, withdrawal benefits, and annuity bene- 
fits are coming to be understood. 
Bankruptcy of present teachers’ retirement systems. 
—It is a startling fact that all but half-a-dozen of the 
hundred different pension systems for teachers in the 
United States are bankrupt. They are not organized 
on a sound actuarial basis. Studensky shows that, 
‘‘They are insolvent in so far as they have failed to 
provide for adequate reserves with which to meet ac- 
erued liabilities as well as liabilities incurred through 
services rendered since the establishment of the sys- 
tem. It matters not that most of these systems are 
still able to make payments, still have unexpended 
cash on hand, and are and will be able for a few years 
to continue to meet their payments. They are no less 
insolvent than the systems which are already bank- 
rupt. Only by shifting their huge deficiencies ahead 
year by year do they continue to exist. By doing so
-P-A-G-E-285
AGE, SEX, AND PROFESSIONAL STABILITY 267 
they increase of course these deficiencies because of 
the continued failure to discount future liabilities. 
The longer they operate, therefore, the greater are the 
deficiencies and the more insolvent the funds 
become.’’ ® 
Significance of sex.—According to Professor Thomas, 
organic and struetural differences between men and 
women do not necessarily show the inferiority or su- 
periority of either sex, so far as mentality is con- 
cerned. Thorndike and other students of the problem 
are in agreement with this statement. Women prob- 
ably have as great intellectual possibilities as men. 
Dr. Helen Thompson of Mt. Holyoke says that save 
in points directly related to the greater physical 
strength of men, there is surprisingly little difference 
between the sexes. ‘‘According to our present light, 
the psychological differences of sex seem to be largely 
due, not to differences in average capacity nor to 
differences in mental activity, but to differences in 
the social influences brought to bear on the individual 
development from infancy to adult years. The ques- 
tion of the future development of the intellectual life 
of women is one of social necessities and ideas, rather 
than the inborn psychological characteristics of sex.’’ 
Feminization of classroom teaching.—Originally 
teaching was almost wholly done by men. The indus- 
trial revolution made it necessary for many women to 
work in shops and factories. This broke down the no- 
tion that a woman’s place was in the home. As she 
went out of the home to compete with men in shops 
and factories she demanded equal education with men.

268 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
During the same period education became increasingly 
popular. Qualified men teachers in sufficient numbers 
were not available. Men were attracted away from 
teaching to other occupations of more economic 
promise. 
The old notions of discipline that had prevailed dur- 
ing the medieval period were giving way to a newer 
conception of child development, a development not 
through military discipline but through love, sym- 
pathy, and intelligent understanding and direction. 
Consequently women not only began to seek teaching 
positions but teaching positions began to seek women. 
At first this was limited to elementary education but 
before the middle of the nineteenth century it included 
the academy and the high school, and at least in a few 
instances, the colleges and universities. During the 
Civil War the male teachers were drafted. At the 
close of the war there was another rapid expansion 
west of the Mississippi river and popular education 
grew by leaps and bounds. The Civil War had made 
it necessary for the women to take over many occupa- 
tions that before the war had been almost exclusively 
reserved for men. Teaching was one of the first to be 
taken over. Not many trades were open to women 
at this time outside of the home and practically no 
other profession except teaching. Naturally, there- 
fore, women were willing to work for less salary and 
boards of education everywhere were confronted with 
the necessity of reducing taxes. Consequently, large 
percentages of women were employed. This process 
has continued until today, not only the proportion but 
also the absolute number of men teachers in compari-

son to women teachers has decreased. The figures for 
the period 1890-1916 are as follows: 
    1890 1900 1910 1916 
Men: ..:... 125,000 126,000 110,000 123,000

Statistics also show that there is a larger proportion 
of men teachers in cities than in small towns and rural 
sections. The distribution in various sections of the 
country of male and female teachers is shown in the 
following table.

The tendency for the proportion of men to hold its 
own or even to increase slightly from 1910 to 1915 is 
shown in Table XII. This is especially true in the 
western and middle western sections of the country. 
However, the World War further decreased the per- 
centage of men. Probably the economic depression of 
the last few years has tended to recruit men again to 
the profession. The chances are that the percentage 
of men will not continue to decrease at the same rate 
as during the last twenty years. The percentage of 
women instructors in colleges and universities has con- 
tinually increased. 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
  270 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
Sex and position.—In the past, women have been ex- 
cluded from administrative positions largely due to 
social traditions and prejudices. Now, that women 
vote and that a larger percentage of girls are gradu- 
ating from our high schools than boys and that girls 
in increasing numbers are attending college, we may 
expect a rapid increase of women in administrative 
positions. Just what traits and characteristics, if 
any, are possessed by women that may make them 
better for administrative positions than men, it is hard 
to state. Probably the real reason is not to be found 
in sex differences, but as Miss Thompson points out, 
“In the social influences brought to bear on the de- 
veloping individual.’’ Until within a few years, women 
have not aspired to fill administrative positions. The 
Great War again demonstrated that women could suc- 
ceed in many lines and occupy all sorts of administra- 
tive positions with great ability and skill. It is prob- 
ably safe to predict that women in the future will not 
be denied the opportunity to demonstrate their admin- 
istrative ability. 
Influence of sex on salary.—There is a growing de- 
mand in education for equality of opportunity for the 
sexes. The inequalities that have so long existed be- 
tween men and women’s positions and salaries are be- 
coming intolerable to women. They are demanding 
‘equal pay for equal work.’’ They mean by this equal 
pay for equal preparation, equal devotion to study, 
equal experience, equal skill, and equal hours and 
service. Of course, equality must be taken with a grain 
of salt. The Constitution declares all men ‘‘equal’’ 
but the late Lord Bryce well said on one occasion that
-P-A-G-E-289
  
AGE, SEX, AND PROFESSIONAL STABILITY 271 
while the Constitution of the United States declares 
that all men are equal, they have not been born six 
months before the greatest of inequalities exist be- 
tween them. 
The following table shows the proportion of men’s 
salaries received by women as compiled by sections of 
the country and covers the average for all grades of 
teachers in public schools in the year 1917.

On the average, women teachers receive 74 per cent 
of the salary of men teachers. Women more nearly 
equal men in the matter of salaries in small towns 
and cities and rural districts. In larger cities, the 
women range from five to twenty-five per cent lower 
than men. Men seem to have a corner on the best paid 
positions which are, as a rule, administrative positions. 
These figures are all faulty and incomplete. The only 
real basis of comparison would be to take men and 
women of equal preparation, experience, ability, and 
skill in positions of the same level. When this is done, 
the difference between men and women outside of 
larger cities would probably decrease but not entirely 
disappear. The teaching profession does not escape 
the operations of the law of supply and demand. As 
 
-P-A-G-E-290
272 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
long as the women seeking teaching positions far out- 
number the men seeking the same positions, and as 
long as women can be employed in occupations other 
than teaching at lower salaries than men, it will be 
difficult to equalize the salaries of the sexes in 
education. 
Frequently in the arguments for ‘‘equal pay for 
equal work’? it is pointed out that the great majority 
of women do not have families to support while at least 
a majority of the men do. Available statistics would 
seem to indicate that about 90%, of the women teach- 
ing in high school and grade schools are unmarried, 
and that about 65 to 70 per cent of the men are mar- 
ried. Of course, the fact that women are not married 
does not mean that they do not have other dependents. 
Main points of the chapter.—1. Teaching is a young 
folks profession, the great majority of teachers being 
between twenty and thirty years of age. 
2. The median age for teachers is lowest in rural 
schools and highest in city school systems, indicating 
that rural schools are little more than practice schools 
for beginners. 
3. Gradually the states have increased their mini- 
mum age requirements for certification from 15 and 
16 to an average now of 18. A vigorous campaign 
should be waged to increase the minimum age to at 
least 19 or preferably 20. 
4. High initial salaries now paid to beginners jus- 
tify requiring higher academic and professional quali- 
fications and higher age and increased maturity for 
beginners. 
 
-P-A-G-E-291
AGE, SEX, AND PROFESSIONAL STABILITY 273 
5. Efficiency increases on the average with each 
additional year of experience during a period of from 
5 to 8 years. Beyond this, age and experience do not 
seem to be so important. 
6. Salary should increase with increased efficiency. 
The terminal rather than the initial salary deserves 
the most consideration. 
7. Pensions and retirement schemes for teachers 
are gradually becoming remodeled on the basis of old- 
line insurance companies, thus losing their charitable 
features and becoming more and more sound business 
organizations. 
8. Sex derives its importance in the teaching per- 
sonnel largely from traditional and economic con- 
siderations. 
  PROBLEMS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
1. Mrs. Y—, age 53, applies for a 6th grade position. 
The superintendent is a young man and is naturally a bit 
prejudiced against old teachers. He tells her frankly that 
he wouldn’t think of hiring a teacher who is over 45 years 
old. She asks for hist reasons and he honestly attempts to 
give them. What should he say? 
2. Superintendent B—— refuses to hire anyone under 22 
years of age. He argues that he wants only tried and true 
teachers, that he doesn’t want any beginners or any teachers 
with less than three years of experience. Is his position 
sound? Why? 
8. The Teachers’ Club decides to make a study of the 
effect of age on efficiency. How should they proceed? 
4. The Teachers’ Club is asked to contribute its ideas to 
the revision of the teachers’ retirement law of that state. 
Outline a course of reading and a list of topics for discus- 
sion.

5. Enumerate the outstanding characteristics of the pro- 
fession of (1) law, (2) medicine, and (3) the ministry. Com- 
pare teaching with these. 
6. Miss G—— is 64 years old. She is an excellent teacher 
in every respect. A certain board member doesn’t like her 
because she wouldn’t pass his son. He desires to have the 
superintendent recommend the elimination of all teachers 
who have taught 25 years and are over 60 years of age. The 
superintendent knows that if Miss G- leaves, her chances 
of getting another position elsewhere are very slim indeed. 
He is outspoken in her defense. What arguments may he 
cite for the retention of teachers regardless of age? 
7. The women teachers demand equal pay for equal work 
in the school system of R—— over which you are superin- 
tendent. Write a report defining your position on this ques- 
tion. 
8. Miss B. argues that she deserves the same salary 
as another teacher because she is just as old, as long experi- 
enced, efficient, and devoted. She acknowledges that she has 
only one year of training while the other teacher has a 
teacher’s degree. Miss B. argues that results are the only 
thing that count. Is she right? Why? 
9. Explain the meaning of the following sentences: ‘‘In 
the development of pension systems the tendency has been 
toward a steady extension of the pension system to all classes 
of the school personnel.’’ . . . ‘‘The contingencies of death, 
resignation, and dismissal are inadequately considered or not 
considered at all in the majority of pension systems.’’

CHAPTER XIV 
FACTORS DETERMINING THE SALARIES OF TEACHERS 
Growth of the salary schedule idea—Perhaps the 
most important development concerning the wages of 
teachers during the past fifty years has been the idea 
of a salary schedule. Before the Civil War, in a few 
large cities, notably Boston, Philadelphia, and New 
York, lists were made of the salaries paid to teachers 
and these lists were used as a basis by board members 
and officers in determining advances in salaries, re- 
placement salaries, and salaries of beginners. Such 
lists were not schedules as we now think of the term 
‘‘schedule.’’ But they were the forerunners of the 
schedules that developed later. 
Previous to the development of the idea of a salary 
schedule it was the practice, on the part of teach- 
ers, to-get-what-they-could-get or take-what-they-were- 
given and, on the part of the board, to-pay-what-they- 
had-to-pay or what-they-could-afford-to-pay. These 
practices still prevail in hundreds of American com- 
munities where the idea of a salary schedule has never 
been broached. Hach teacher gets what he or she can 
get. Personal, social, political, charitable, and even 
religious pulls are exercised. Frequently the schools 
get into politics and local bosses dictate not only the 
275  
-P-A-G-E-294
  276 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
selection of the personnel but also the remuneration. 
Obviously under such a plan, or rather lack of plan, 
many injustices are done. 
Basic principles of salary schedules—An examina- 
tion of existiny salary schedules reveals no two ex- 
actly alike. There seem to be some problems peculiar 
to each locality. Whether these problems are real or 
imaginary, it is difficult to say. Probably, much of 
the difference arises from the fact that each school 
system is a law unto itself and attempts to solve its 
problems in its own way. Many schedules are formu- 
lated by those who have some hobby or bias that they 
believe should be recognized. Others are made by 
those who know little about how good schedules are 
built. Trial-error-and-success methods have been used. 
The schedules of the nearby cities or the cities of a 
given class have been examined and from those a 
schedule for a given locality has been formulated with 
special reference to the local difficulties. 
The writer has found from his own experience that 
many unforeseen situations arise that must be tem- 
porized with in the best manner possible. No doubt 
expediency accounts in part for the great diversity of 
ideas to be found in salary schedules. 
There are, however, certain basic principles that are 
common to all situations and which should not be 
ignored. <A schedule should not be copied simply be- 
cause it is successful elsewhere. Sound principles 
should first be established and a schedule built upon 
them. A salary schedule should tend to make teaching 
a profession. It should serve to secure and to retain 
competent and desirable persons as teachers. It
-P-A-G-E-295
  FACTORS DETERMINING THE SALARIES OF TEACHERS 277 
should be so arranged and so administered as to assure 
a maximum of service and professional growth from 
all teachers. A schedule that lulls teachers into pro- 
fessional lethargy is wrong. 
The following basic principles should be observed in 
formulating a salary schedule for teachers. 
Minima. A minimum age, certificate, amount and 
kind of training should be required of all beginners. 
By insisting upon high minimum standards the profes- 
sion of teaching, like the professions of law, medicine, 
engineering, and the ministry, elevates the competency 
and, therefore, the social and economic status of its 
members. 
It follows that every beginning teacher is entitled 
to a minimum salary that will provide a reasonable 
living wage and standard of living which will attract 
people of refinement and ability to teaching. 
Equality of opportunity. Other factors being the 
same, the teacher in one grade should receive as much 
salary as the teacher in any other grade or school 
division. There is no evidence showing that a teacher 
in the lower grades needaless training for her work 
than is needed by a high-school teacher. The training 
should differ in kind but not necessarily in amount. 
There is reason to believe that highly trained teachers 
in the kindergarten and elementary grades pay their 
way by making the experiences of children richer and 
more complete. 
Adwancement. Salary increases and attainable 
maximum should be so arranged that (a) they offer a 
career in teaching; (b) they induce the best young men 
and women from the high schoo! to prepare for teach-
-P-A-G-E-296

278 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
ing; and (c) they srcuURE CONSTANT IMPROVEMENT DUB- 
ING THE TIME OF TEACHING. 
Every successful teacher should find it possible to 
pass from a mere living wage to an economic inde- 
pendence or saving wage and from that to a cultural 
wage. The second of these, the economic independence 
wage, should provide the teacher with a salary ade- 
quate to meet her necessary expense and those of her 
dependents with margin enough to provide for neces- 
sary professional advancement and above that a mar- 
gin for saving and investment. The third, or cultural 
wage, should be enough to provide economic indepen- 
dence and still allow for travel, additional study, and 
a reasonable amount of the best of music, literature, 
art, etc.; thus, to keep the teacher a true representa- 
tive of the best of the social inheritance of the race. 
Traimmg. The more and the better the academic 
and professional preparation that a teacher has, other 
factors being equal, the more salary she should re- 
ceive. Every salary schedule should recognize the 
value of training. The more time and money spent in 
general preparation, the larger should be the return 
upon the investment. <A ‘‘year’s training’? may not 
always mean exactly the same but it is a more constant 
and better defined measure than many other elements 
affecting the salary of teachers. Where it is neces- 
sary for a teacher to have special training in addition 
to her regular training, as in the teaching of special 
subjects and groups, the additional salary paid to such 
a teacher should be enough to warrant the additional 
investment of time and money necessary to secure this 
special training.   
 
-P-A-G-E-297
  
  FACTORS DETERMINING THE SALARIES OF TEACHERS 279 
Experience. The more successful experience a 
teacher has had, other factors being equal, the more 
salary she should receive. Teachers, as a class, im- 
prove rapidly during the first few years of their expe- 
rience, then more slowly until a plateau is reached 
beyond which improvement is still slower. However, 
there are many individual exceptions to this general 
tule. The value of increased experience should be 
recognized in a salary schedule, regardless of where 
it is obtained or the amount. 
Merit. There should be enough flexibility in the sal- 
ary schedule to provide extra pay for teachers of 
extra ability. In other words, merit should be recog- 
nized, other factors being equal. 
Sex. Between the sexes there should be, wherever 
possible, equal pay for equal merit, equal training, 
equal experience, and equal work. This means that 
schedules should be based primarily upon the salaries 
which wil] attract and hold capable women. 
Advantages of a proper salary schedule-——There are 
at least nine advantages that may be urged in favor 
of a salary schedule that is based upon sound princi- 
ples. They are as follows: 
A salary schedule is impersonal. It tends to fix an 
impersonal basis for the remuneration of teachers, 
thus lessening the influence of personal, local, social, 
charitable, religious, political, or other dangerous in- 
fluences ‘that operate in public service. This is prob- 
ably the chief administrating argument. Without a 
schedule, officers and boards are frequently unjustly 
subjected to tremendous pressures in the interest of 
some individual. With a schedule, it is possible to 
 
-P-A-G-E-298
  280 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
convince all but the most obdurate that justice and 
fair dealing prevail. Unfortunately, unless merit is 
recognized, a schedule may level all teachers to one 
basis. At first thought this seems democratic, but it is 
likely to result in a deadening influence since it reduces 
competition. 
It deals justly with new teachers. A salary schedule 
makes it possible to deal justly and fairly with new 
teachers. New teachers ought not to come into a 
school system at a higher salary than those they re- 
place unless their experience, training, and ability 
merit the advance. Every year the superintendent has 
to fill vacancies. The market for teachers, like most 
markets, is a shifting one. There seems to be no way 
to stabilize it. With a fixed salary schedule, the super- 
intendent knows exactly what he can offer for a given 
amount of training, experience, and merit. Teachers 
long in service are therefore assured that young and 
inexperienced teachers will not be allowed to compete 
with them unfairly. 
It deals justly with home teachers, A salary sched- 
ule protects the home teacher against unjust discrim- 
ination when she is placed in competition with teachers 
from outside of the city or locality. It is a fact that 
many home teachers are willing to work for less in 
their home town, and that many boards want to employ 
as many home teachers as possible in order to save 
taxes. A schedule based upon the cost of living of 
home teachers will be lower than a schedule based 
upon the cost of living of imported teachers. Now, 
the schools are more than local enterprises. The home 
girl should be able to earn as much at home as away

from home. Most schedules recognize this fact and 
base their minimum upon the living costs of an outside 
teacher. This protects the home teacher who consti- 
tutes, on the average, from 50 to 75 per cent of the 
teaching staff in most localities. It may be that too 
much has been said about inbreeding. It is impossible 
to find a scientific study of its effect. 
It makes a career possible. A salary schedule helps 
to make teaching a profession rather than an occupa- 
tion, a trade, or just a job. The prospective teacher 
knows before hand about what she may expect at each 
stage in her career. It stimulates the recruiting of 
the best young people; it tends to hold them in the pro- 
fession and to offset the attractions of other trades. 
It is a decided aid in the vocational guidance of 
teachers. 
It secures better preparation. It stimulates the 
prospective teacher to prepare more deliberately for 
teaching and to continue her preparation after enter- 
ing the profession. Especially is this true where re- 
ward for training is an essential consideration in the 
schedule. Thus, it reduces the future per cent of me- 
chanical and routinized job-holders. It is also an im- 
portant factor in remaking old teachers by rewarding 
them for additional preparation. 
It increases tenure. Not only is the tenure in the 
local system increased by a proper salary schedule, but 
the tenure in the profession, regardless of place, is 
increased. The almost universal adoption of salary 
schedules in cities means that a city teacher is guar- 
anteed something of a career regardless of where she 
teaches. County and state salary schedules would be
-P-A-G-E-300
  282 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
required to give this same guarantee to teachers in 
other than city schools. Thus far no progress has 
been made in the establishment of county and state 
schedules. Teachers’ associations should set up sched- 
ules for the guidance of non-city schools. 
It stimulates teachers. A schedule tends not only to 
relieve the teacher from constant fear for her eco- 
nomic security, but also to stimulate her to reach the 
highest possible professional achievement. A guar- 
anteed economic security threatens the professional 
worker and often drives her to the acceptance of low 
standards of personal and professional culture. 
It improves the social status of teachers. The prin- 
ciples of a just salary schedule are not only in accord- 
ance with the principles and practices now prevailing 
in commercial and industrial activities and in other 
professions, but they are also in accord with univer- 
sally accepted ideas of justice. The adoption of a 
schedule based upon such principles elevates the eco- 
nomic, cultural, and social status of teachers. 
It helps fix the yearly budget. When a salary sched- 
ule is in operation it is possible to determine more 
readily the items in the budget covering the cost of 
instruction than is otherwise possible. In fact, the 
amount can be determined years ahead. 
Problems in introducing a new schedule.—In formu- 
lating and introducing a new salary schedule many 
baffling economic, educational, and personnel problems” 
are bound to arise. They must not be overlooked. It 
may take two or three years to work out some of them. 
The success or failure of the schedule will depend not 
only upon its soundness but also upon the tact with
-P-A-G-E-301
  
  FACTORS DETERMINING THE SALARIES OF TEACHERS 283 
which these problems are handled. Among the out- 
standing problems are the following: 
How are the teachers now paid? That is, how much 
is now paid to each teacher in the system and on what 
basis? The superintendent should have a record of (a) 
the experience, (b) the training, and (c) the salary of 
each teacher in the system under his supervision. The 
schedule which he proposes to recommend must be 
built in part upon these data. He will find it prac- 
tically impossible to lower the salary of any teacher 
and, in most cases, highly undesirable. 
‘‘Provision should always be made for those older 
and more experienced teachers who have been in the 
school system a number of years, but who do not 
qualify for Class I in the salary schedule. Both in 
fairness to these teachers and to the younger teachers 
who are entering the system under present standards, 
these experienced teachers must not be penalized by 
the new schedule. It is not necessary for them to 
receive the maximum salary given-teachers with more 
adequate training, but on the other hand their salaries 
in no case should be below what they were getting on 
the old schedule. It is even wise to make special pro- 
vision for teachers who have less than the desired 
amount of preparation, but who have taught in the 
schools of that city for ten, fifteen, or twenty years. 
In this way these teachers may be paid comparable 
salaries without forcing them to complete normal 
school or college courses. 
“Tn any new schedule which provides for increases 
in salaries paid teachers, the salary should not be 
made retroactive. Teachers should not expect to go 
 
-P-A-G-E-302
284 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
to that salary in the new schedule which their training 
and past experience would entitle them to receive had 
the new schedule been in operation throughout the 
period of their experience. The safest transitional 
program in this matter is to give each teacher on the 
new schedule the salary that is just above the salary 
which he has been receiving under the old schedule. 
Another method is to give the teacher on the new 
schedule the salary which is nearest to the one which 
the teacher would have received had the old schedule 
remained in effect. Hither one of these plans will put 
the new schedule into operation with very little, if 
any, additional cost over what the old schedule would 
have called for.’’? 
\. The present wage scale for teachers may be called 
a celibate wage scale. The general assumption is that 
the vast majority of teachers have no dependents. 
This operates to establish a low minimum, a low maxi- 
mum and few advances. See Chapter X for a further 
discussion of this point. 
How much money is available? The second eco- 
nomic problem is more difficult. How much money is 
available this year, the next, and during the life of the 
schedule? Surely, a year-to-year schedule is unde- 
sirable. A schedule should be built for the future as 
well as for the current year. This means that the 
superintendent must carefully compute the cost of the 
schedule over a period of, say, ten years. He must 
be able to compare the cost of the new schedule with 
the old. He should see the money before he spends it. 
He must remember that the schedule has to be sold

not only to the board of education but also to the pub- 
lic, and not for a day only but for the future. Other- 
wise his work fails and not only is he discredited but 
also the idea of a salary schedule as well. 
What should be the minimum salary? The theo- 
retical answer is: at least enough to provide a living 
wage for twelve months and a standard of living that 
will draw people of refinement and ability to teaching. 
But, practically, how much is this? Who can answer? 
Certainly, big salaries should not be paid to begin- 
ners. The beginner is an apprentice. He should be 
expected to begin low in teaching just as in other lines. 
Too often the mistake is made of raising the minimum 
without much reference to the maximum. The mini- 
mum should be at least equal to the minimum in other 
trades requiring equal ability and equal preliminary 
training. If it is slightly above the minimum of other 
trades it will tend to attract superior ability into 
teaching. Of course, economic conditions change from 
time to time so a rough average must be taken and 
applied for a given period of years. If the schedule 
is properly arranged it will be possible to apply a flat 
per cent increase or decrease as economic conditions 
change. This can be done without changing a single 
principle of the schedule. 
‘“Where a distinct change is made in the minimum 
salary offered, the minimum should be increased grad- 
ually from the old minimum to the new, otherwise it 
would be possible for beginning teachers to receive a 
larger salary than teachers who started with a lower 
minimum and who have had one or more years of 
experience in the schools of that city.’’ If all teachers  
-P-A-G-E-304
  286 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
receiving less than the new minimum were increased 
in salary to a point where they would receive more 
than beginning teachers, this difficulty will be allevi- 
ated. Old teachers should not receive less than the 
new minimum salary. It will distribute some of the 
increased cost called for in the new schedule over a 
period of four or five years if the minimum is in- 
ereased gradually by increments less than the annual 
increase provided by the new schedule. One method 
of doing this is shown in Table 56 of the N. HE. A. bul- 
letin. Assume that the old minimum was $1000, the 
new minimum is $1200, and the annual increase $120. 
By paying beginning teachers the salaries suggested 
in the table there would be a gradual transition from 
the $1000 to the $1200 minimum.”’ 2 
How fast should one be able to advance? The rate 
of advancement is another difficult problem. If a 
teacher can pass from a beginner’s salary to the maxi- 
mum salary in from 5 to 10 years and must then stand 
still the rest of her professional career or change 
cities, there is little incentive for her continued effi- 
ciency, especially if she is a home teacher. Some 
provision should be made for her to advance almost - 
indefinitely. The recommendations of the N. HE. A. 
Committee on Salaries agrees only in part with these 
statements. Their report reads as follows: 
‘Salary increases or increments should be of suffi- 
cient size to be perceptible in the teacher’s annual 
budget. This increase should be large enough to make 
possible trips to places of national interest, continua- 
tion of music lessons, an extension course, or some 
3 Teachers’ Salaries. N. E, A. Bulletin, July, 1923, pp. 80-81.

FACTORS DETERMINING THE SALARIES OF TEACHERS 287 
other expenditure which will add to his efficiency as a 
teacher, and not go merely to the payment of back 
debts or the securing of a better boarding place. This 
increase should approximate 10 per cent of the salary. 
This is conservative, since it stands not only for in- 
terest upon his investment in training, but also for the 
increased earning power resulting from successful 
experience. Increases should vary in number and 
amount for teachers with varying amounts of train- 
ing and experience. These variations should be deter- 
mined by the maximum salary to be received and are 
justified on the same grounds that varying salaries to 
teachers with varying amounts of preparation are 
justified. Six increases are recommended for teachers 
with two years of standard normal school training and 
from eight to twelve increases, depending upon the 
size of the maximum salary, for graduates of colleges 
and universities.’’ 
What should be the relation of the maximum to the 
minimum. In most salary schedules the maximum is 
only one and one-half times the minimum. If the 
minimum is $1000, the maximum is around $1500. In 
many the maximum is even less than this. Why? Is it 
lack of money or lack of foresight in planning the 
schedule? Probably both. The closeness of the maxi- 
mum to the minimum is unfortunate in most schedules. 
Relatively speaking, under such a schedule, beginners 
are over-paid and teachers of long service are under- 
paid. It would be better to have a lower minimum, 
provided, of course, it were not too low to attract the 
best beginners. Broadly speaking, the maximum 
should be so arranged that it cannot be reached too
-P-A-G-E-306
288 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
soon, but when it is reached it should amount to at 
least twice the minimum and preferably two and one- 
half or three times the minimum. With a high maxi- 
mum the required standard of training and merit 
should be equally high. 
‘“‘Maximum salaries. should be high enough to 
justify looking upon teaching as a career and remove 
it from the ‘‘stepping stone’’ class of occupations: 
Such maximums will serve as one of the strongest at- 
tractions toward teaching for the ambitious and capa- 
ble young men and women graduating from high 
schools and selecting their life occupations. It is cer- 
tain that the possibility of attaining high maximum 
salaries will do more to attract men and women of 
ability, community and educational leaders, than any 
other element in a salary schedule. The realization 
that hard work and deserved success may be finan- 
cially rewarded without forcing the individual into 
administrative work is a positive result of higher 
maximum salaries. Another distinct value of higher 
maximum salaries is that these salaries will tend to 
hold teachers longer in the field of education and thus 
save to the schools and the children the increased 
value which comes from their experience.’’ *® 
What should be the relation of the maximum to the 
cost of living? As indicated above, the teacher of 
high attainments should be able to advance from the 
living wage of a beginner to an economic or saving 
wage and finally to a cultural wage. Just how to de- 
fine any of these terms is, of course, difficult. A living 
wage for one may be a saving and possibly a cultural 
* Teachers’ Salaries, N. E. A. Bulletin, July, 1923, p. 75.
-P-A-G-E-307
FACTORS DETERMINING THE SALARIES OF TEACHERS 289 
wage for another. Average estimates must be made. 
Roughly, we may say that a reasonable saving wage 
is two, two and one-half, or possibly three times a 
living wage. 
What should be the relation of the schedule to sup- 
ply and demand? Undoubtedly, there are always good 
teachers willing to work cheaper than those now em- 
ployed. The teaching market is like all labor markets 
in this respect; there is a ‘‘bear’’ and a ‘‘bull’’ market 
as economic conditions change. A schedule helps to 
stabilize the market and renders the operation of 
“bear and bull’? movements less effective. Some, who 
cannot or will not see the schedule idea, want the hir- 
ing of teachers to proceed solely upon the economic 
principle of supply and demand. Teaching is not pri- 
marily an economic undertaking; it is, or should be, a 
profession. A profession puts the public interest be- 
fore the self-interest. It seems reasonable, therefore, 
to protect teachers to some extent against the ruthless 
operation of the principle of supply and demand; but 
too much protection may be equally dangerous to the 
profession. Competition is the life of a profession as 
well as of trade. 
How many schedules are necessary? In New York 
City teachers and other school officers are paid accord- 
ing to no fewer than 85 different salary schedules. 
This is too many. It is doubtful if there are 85 differ- 
ent grades of service in public education. In smaller 
cities the question arises: Should there be a separate 
schedule for kindergarten, primary, intermediate, 
junior high school, and senior high school teachers? 
Or, should these distinctions be ignored and a unit sal-
-P-A-G-E-308
  290 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
ary schedule adopted? The writer feels very strongly 
the desirability of a unit schedule. The distinction in 
salary should not be in terms of the grade or group of 
grades taught. Three things should be considered, 
namely: (a) the amount of experience; (b) the amount 
of training; and (c) the merit of each teacher. The 
particular grade or subject is not'so important. If less 
training is required for a given position in comparison 
with another, less money should be paid, other factors 
being equal. ‘ 
In the older type of salary schedule, for example 
New York City, advances in salary were based upon 
(a) length of service, and (b) the grade taught. No 
provision was made for variations in the amount and 
kind of training and in merit. Too much emphasis 
was placed upon experience and grade taught. By 
1923, as shown in Table XIV, the idea of a unit salary 
schedule had made considerable progress. Many cities 
had either revised their old schedules or adopted for 
the first time unit schedules. The unit schedule bases 
its increases to teachers upon (a) academic and pro- 
fessional training, (b) length of service, and (c) merit. 
Should increases be based in part upon length of 
service? Yes, all schedules have recognized this prin- 
ciple. Furthermore, increases should continue so long 
as service renders one increasingly efficient. No one 
knows just how long this is. It is generally agreed, 
however, that service beyond a certain number of 
years does not continue to improve the quality of 
teaching, at least at the same rate. There is no proof 
of this statement one way or the other. The writer 
believes in continuing increases at a decreasing rate

even up to old age, assuming, of course, continued 
efficiency. 
What recognition should be given to service outside 
of the system? While practice tends to be provincial 
in this matter, there is a growing tendency to consider 
service in one school system the equal of service in 
another system. This seems sound and equitable. 
What difference does it make where the experience 
was secured? Even country school experience, espe- 
cially if intelligently supervised and directed, may be 
approved. If it is good for a teacher to change towns 
she should be able to do so without penalty unless 
inefficient or incompetent. 
What recognition should be given to service outside 
of teaching? None, unless that outside service is di- 
rectly related to teaching as in commerce, agriculture, 
trade and industrial subjects and a few other branches. 
Even then it may be doubted if one year of practice is 
the equivalent of one year of teaching. Possibly, a 
good rule would be to require, as in a laboratory sub- 
ject, three years of practical experience for one year 
of teaching. Few of the schedules have as yet recog- 
nized experience outside of teaching. However, modi- 
fications of this nature will occur in the future. The 
following has been proposed in one city to care for 
this problem: (a) Credit will be allowed for experi- 
ence outside of the teaching profession, which is ap- 
proved by the educational committee upon the recom- 
mendations of the head of the department, the prin- 
cipal, and the superintendent of schools. (b) In order 
to receive credit, such practical experience must be 
closely related to the subject or subjects subsequently
-P-A-G-E-311
FACTORS DETERMINING THE SALARIES OF TEACHERS 293 
taught and in the judgment of the majority concerned 
be of direct value in equipping the person for such 
teaching. (c) Each year of so approved practical 
experience up to and including ten years of such 
experience, shall count not to exceed the equivalent of 
one-half year of teaching experience. 
Should increases be based upon promotional exam- 
inations and certificates? No, unless these are equated 
in terms of academic and professional courses in 
recognized institutions for teacher-training. Why 
should each school system attempt to set up a sepa- 
rate accrediting agency when higher educational in- 
stitutions have been doing this for years? Much less 
attention should be paid to examinations and certi- 
ficates and much more attention given to regular 
courses in. established institutions. 
Should increase be based upon academic and pro- 
fessional training? Yes, such training costs money 
and represents an investment of capital that should 
produce returns. The amount of training that is 
recognized in the schedule should be unlimited and the 
kinds should not be too narrowly restricted. Anything 
that improves one’s personal and professional culture 
and skill in a substantial degree should be recognized. 
Should merit be recognized? Yes, wherever and 
whenever it is possible to measure merit accurately. 
Is it now possible to measure the merit of a teacher? 
This opens up a whole new field of research, especially 
if we attempt to measure merit objectively. Courtis 
says: ‘‘The best proof of the pudding is in the eating, 
and the best proof of ability in a teacher is the effect 
produced by her teaching.’’ We are all perfectly cer- 
 
-P-A-G-E-312
    294 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
tain that we can tell a good teacher when we see one 
and yet we all make mistakes in our estimates. The 
teacher’s scholastic record, her promotional record, 
together with that vague thing known as personality, 
are the essential factors used in evaluating her. Only 
after a series of long continued tests would it be pos- 
sible to measure the effects produced by her teaching. 
Teachers now feel that they are too frequently mis- 
judged by their principals, supervisors, and superin- 
tendents. This leads them to distrust all present 
methods of measuring merit. 
Should increases be granted for travel? As far as 
the writer is aware, no university or teacher-training 
institution gives any credit for travel unless such 
travel is highly organized, supervised, and directed by 
regular professors. A school system should not, as a 
rule, attempt to set up a separate accrediting agency. 
Use the accrediting agencies already in existence. Un- 
doubtedly, travel when properly directed, is highly 
educational. But so too is general reading, concert 
attendance, etc. Sometimes travel rejuvenates a tired 
teacher more than academic or professional study. 
However, teachers as a group are still woefully lacking 
in the personal and professional culture so much 
needed for the highest service in teaching. 
Should the distinction between sexes be recognized? 
The theoretical answer would be ‘‘no.’’? But, prac- 
tically, it is not yet possible in most places to wipe 
out the distinctions in salaries that exist between men 
and women. Such distinctions have not been wiped 
out in other trades and it is difficult for education to 
go ahead of other trades, and set up a basis for edu-
-P-A-G-E-313
  FACTORS DETERMINING THE SALARIES OF TEACHERS 295 
cation that does not operate elsewhere. The move- 
ment for ‘‘equal-pay-for-equal work’’ is as old as 
society itself. In teaching, it first attracted national 
attention in 1906 when it was made the chief issue of 
educational legislation in New. York City. Finally, 
in 1912, the principle of ‘‘paying the position’’ re- 
gardless of sex was adopted. Similar campaigns were 
successful in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and in 1916 
the legislature of Oregon adopted is as a state meas- 
ure. The phrase ‘‘equal-pay-for-equal-service’’ is 
misleading. What is really meant is equal pay for 
equal merit, equal length of service, equal training, and 
equal work. Where it is impossible to wipe out the 
distinction, it may be possible to justify the difference 
in terms of necessity, supply, and demand; or in 
terms of the difference in hours of work, or duties 
undertaken. 
The salary schedule, Rockford, Illinois.—The schedule 
adopted at Rockford, Illinois, January, 1923, under the 
writer’s direction, has certain features never before 
fully recognized. The distinction between grade, 
junior, and senior high-school teachers is entirely 
ignored. Teachers are paid according to the length of 
service and the amount of training. No limit is placed 
on the amount of service recognized. No attempt is 
made to measure merit on account of the diversity of 
ideas as to how it should be measured. This is a 
limitation of the schedule that can easily be amended. 
A suggested amendment would read like this: ‘‘All 4 
teachers are to be advanced one-fourth or one-third 
faster than this schedule; all B teachers are to ad- 
vance in accordance with this schedule; all C teachers
-P-A-G-E-314
    296 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
are to stand still until they get a rating of B or better, 
and all teachers who do not progress from a C rating 
within a reasonable length of time are to be dropped 
or put on probation.”’

be added to the minimum salary, up to and including a total of four 
years of such training beyond normal school. 
4, Credit for training is cumulative and each half year salaries will 
be adjusted accordingly. 
Exceptions. 5. Teachers whose present salaries are below this sched-_ 
ule will be given increases not exceeding $100 per year until they reach 
the schedule. However, teachers of twenty to thirty years’ experience 
will be raised to their schedule in two equal annual raises, and teachers 
of thirty or more years’ experience will be raised to their schedule 
immediately, and then all such teachers shall participate in further 
advances in accordance with the schedule. Providing, however, that 
only ten years of experience outside of Rockford shall be credited toward 
salary increases on account of experience. 
6. Teachers, who in 1922-23 are paid more than such a schedule 
should permit, will not have salaries reduced during the coming year. 
* Explanation of Rating: A—Excellent; B—Good; C—Medium. 
1. ‘‘Initial Salary’’ is the salary paid the teacher without experi- 
ence for her first year’s work. 
2. ‘Annual Increases’? are based on rating, each teacher being 
rated by superintendent, principal, and supervisors in charge of sub- 
jects taught by teachers. 
3. The ‘‘Pre Maximum’’ may be passed by Class-II teachers who

298 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
Main points of the chapter.—1. In colonial days teach- 
ers were paid in a variety of ways, chief among which 
were: bequests, subscriptions, rents, tuitions, rates or 
taxes, barter, emoluments including ‘‘boarding round,’’ 
exemptions from civic services, and income from extra 
duties. 
2. These methods of payment were unsatisfactory 
and gradually gave place to the salary method now 
universally employed. 
8. At first the salary method was operated on the 
theory of pay-what-you-have-to-pay and get-what-you- 
can-get theories. These methods are unsatisfactory 
but still prevail in many places. 
4. In cities during the past fifty years the idea of an 
automatic salary schedule has developed until today 
this method is almost universally adopted. 
5. The advantages of an automatic salary are: (a) 
secure an additional year of training beyond the two years required 
- for that classification, this training to be approved by the superin- 
tendent. Class-III teachers should receive additional training equivalent 
to_two six-weeks summer schools in approved institutions to pass the 
**Pre Maximum.’’ 
4. The ‘‘Super Maximum’’ is reached by not more than 20 per cent 
of the group after a period of years in which a uniformly excellent 
record has been attained. 
5. Olass-I teachers are a group subject to special legislation, but 
their increases and maximum may not be more than those set for 
Class-II teachers. 
6. A teacher passes automatically from one class to another on 
completion of the minimum scholastic requirements for that class. 
7. The board of education may, on recommendation of the super- 
intendent and teachers’ committee, make exceptions to this schedule in 
individual cases. 
8. Principals, supervisors, and special teachers may receive com- 
pensation above that which they would secure on the schedule. 
9. No inereases are provided for teachers rated ‘‘Fair’’ or ‘‘Poor.’’ 
A teacher rated ‘‘Poor’’ is thereby automatically dropped from the sys- 
tem; a teacher rated ‘‘Fair’’ may be retained at the same salary but 
a second rating of ‘‘Fair’’ will serve to eliminate that teacher auto- 
matically.

it is impersonal; (b) it cares for new teachers; (c) it 
secures better academic and professional preparation; 
(d) it makes a career possible; (e) it protects the home 
teacher ; (f) it increases local and professional tenure; 
(g) it stimulates teachers to do their best; and (h) 
it raises the social status of the profession. 
6. Economic and educational problems arise in for- 
mulating a salary schedule that must be carefully con- 
sidered. The economic problems pertain to the 
amount of money available for salaries and the best 
methods of distributing it. 
7. The educational problems pertain to the best 
methods of fairly and justly rewarding and stimu- 
lating teachers to do their best and to continue at their 
best as long as possible. The special educational ques- 
tions are: (a) the number of schedules; (b) length of 
service to be recognized; (¢) kind of service to be 
recognized; (d) the recognition of academic and pro- 
fessional service; (e) recognition of merit; (f) recog- 
nition of differences between sexes; and (g) recogni- 
tion of travel and other possible means of self-culture. 
8. There are two types of salary schedules. The 
older type is an automatic schedule based on years of 
service and grade taught. The new type is called a 
unit schedule and is based upon the amount of 
academic and professional training, the years of serv- 
ice, and the merit of the individual. The second type 
is the better. 
9. There are eight principles upon which a unit 
schedule should be based. These principles involve 
(1) the beginning wage; (2) the disregarding of grades 
taught; (3) the arrangement of increases to stimulate 
 
-P-A-G-E-318
  300 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
growth; (4) the academic and professional training; 
(5) the amount of successful experience; (6) the recog- 
nition of a saving and a cultural wage; (7) the flexi- 
bility to provide for merit; and (8) the equality of 
sexes, where possible. 
PROBLEMS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
  
1. Miss B is a high-grade teacher of English, head of 
the department with fourteen other teachers under her super- 
vision. She is a self-made teacher. Nearly twenty years 
ago she was invited and urged by the board of education to 
accept the position. She is a graduate of a high school with 
only one year of training. No one questions her teaching 
efficiency, her culture and scholarship. Her family is one 
of the old highly-respected pioneer families of the com- 
munity. Miss B comes to the superintendent and pro- 
tests that the new automatic single salary schedule, while giv- 
ing her an increase from $1800 to $1875, which is her maxi- 
mum, puts other teachers with less experience and possibly 
less merit, but more training ahead of her. The superinten- 
dent admits that this is true. There are other teachers of far 
less merit in the same position. What should the superin- 
tendent recommend and why? 
2. The men teachers get together, formulate a salary 
schedule for men, and ask the superintendent for his support. 
There are ten women to one man in the system. The pro- 
posed schedule pays men $500 more than women, equally 
qualified and occupying similar positions. The unit schedule 
for women is similar to the one at Rockford, Illinois. What 
should the superintendent say or do? 
8. The school nurses ask to be put on the same schedule 
as teachers, namely, they are to be paid according to their 
training, experience, and merit. They are to receive a salary 
equal to that of teachers. The superintendent supports them 
in their request. Should he? Why? 
4. The special teachers request that they be paid at least 
$200 above their position on a unit salary schedule because  
-P-A-G-E-319
    FACTORS DETERMINING THE SALARIES OF TEACHERS 301 
of the nature of their work. The superintendent says no, 
that their work is different but no harder than that of regu- 
lar teachers. How would you settle a question of this char- 
acter? : 
5. In 1919 the Michigan State Teachers’ Association, 
through its Committee on Salaries, issued the following state- 
ment: 
‘‘What Should the Minimal Salary in Your Community Be? 
“‘To Teachers, Superintendents, School Boards, and School 
Patrons: 
“The Committee does not believe that a fair minimum can 
be set for the whole state, but it does believe that a mini- 
mum can be worked out for each community by following 
the suggestions given below: 
“*(1) Secure an exact estimate of the total monthly ex- 
penses of the average woman grade teacher for board, room, 
laundry, and street-car fare. 
**(2) Divide this amount by 55 per cent, to cover in addi- 
tion other expense such as clothing, insurance, church, charity, 
club dues, magazines, physician’s bills, dentist’s bills, rail- 
road fares, entertainments, school philanthropy, expenses for 
teachers’ conventions, ete. 
““(3) Multiply this total by 12 in order to secure the amount 
of necessary expenses for the calendar year. (It should be 
remembered that teachers are entitled to yearly salaries suf- 
ficient to cover their actual expenses for a period of 12 
months.) 
**(4) To the total expense thus secured, add what you feel 
should be the percentage of savings. This should be not less 
than 10 per cent; in fact, some communities should pay sal- 
aries sufficiently large to give a minimal saving of more than 
this amount. 
“‘Applying these suggestions to a typical situation, we 
have the following results: 
“‘In A—— the expenses of a woman grade teacher per 
12 months, for the four items: board, room, laundry, and 
street-car fare, amounts to $416. Dividing this by 55 per 
cent to cover also the additional items given above under (2), 
we have the total expense $753.36. If A—— should care 
to provide 10 per cent for savings, the minimal salary for a 
woman grade teacher in A—— should be $832.

“To find the minimal salary for a woman high-school 
teacher or for men teachers follow the same procedure.’’ 
1. Try this method to determine the minimal salary in 
your home town or college community. What is the amount? 
Is it an adequate minimal salary? 
2. On the basis of the results you obtain, do you con- 
sider the plan a satisfactory one for determining minimal 
salaries? 
3. How much salary are you expecting for your first year 
of teaching? Why this amount? In what other kind of an 
opening could you receive more?

CHAPTER XV 
SEPARATIONS, OR FAILURES, RESIGNATIONS, AND DISMISSALS 
Separations.—When a new teacher is added to the 
staff it is called an accession. In the same way, when 
a teacher leaves, resigns, is dismissed, or quits for 
any other reason, it is called a separation. If all 
teachers were selected by able experts and with the 
utmost care, occasional separations would still be nec- 
essary. A teacher who is doing average to excellent 
work today may become a failure in a few years. She 
may grow sour and crabby, routinized, broken in 
health, or she may fail to keep up with the profession. 
Standards are changed from time to time which re- 
quire adjustments on the personnel side. When we 
remember that many teachers now in school systems 
were selected by lay board members not because of 
their teaching ability but because of personal, social, 
political, religious, and other unprofessional considera- 
tions, we realize more fully that separations are often 
necessary in the interests of the education of the chil- 
dren as well as in the interest of the finances of the 
school district. 
Unprofessional considerations still operate to hold 
many failing teachers in the service. Such practices 
are justifiable only when they do not interfere with 
the best interests of the greatest number. If ineffi- 
304  
-P-A-G-E-323

cient teachers or other school officers are in great finan- 
cial need, some other means of providing for them 
should be employed rather than inflicting them upon 
children year after year who are in no way to blame 
for the teacher’s financial condition. However, expe- 
rience shows that with rare exception no public em- 
ployer will resolutely dismiss a faithful servant who 
has become incapacitated due to old age if the person 
has no resources, unless inefficiency is especially 
marked. Boards of education and officers of boards 
do not and will not recommend the retirement of in- 
capacitated teachers without giving careful considera- 
tion to the needs and welfare of such teachers after 
retirement. <A school officer cannot be true to his trust 
and permit a teacher who ought to be removed to 
stay in the school room. His first duty is to the chil- 
dren. To remove a teacher, especially one with a well- 
established record is not a pleasant duty. Yet, it is a 
duty that has to be performed at times. It should be 
performed without fail. It should be done honestly, 
fairly, and with sound judgment. A teacher should 
have no occasion to feel that she is at the mercy of a 
narrow lay board or school officers governed by sel- 
fish and political motives. 
Relative importance of different causes of failure.— 
According to Miss Moses, who critically studied the 
relative influence of different causes of failure with 
reference to 205 cases in 76 different school systems, 
the ten most important causes of failure should be 
ranked as given in Table XV. ; 
The five most important causes of failure are, ac- 
cording to Table XV (1) poor instruction; (2) weak- 
 
-P-A-G-E-324

ness of personality; (3) lack of interest; (4) weakness 
in discipline, and (5) lack of sympathy and tact. 
Obviously, much depends upon the meaning given to 
these different terms. Personality, for example, may 
be defined in a variety of ways. In fact, there is no

standard definition of the term. This accounts for the 
great difference of opinion that appears immediately 
an attempt is made to say which is the most important 
factor in causing the success or failure of a teacher. 
Buellesfield, in his investigation, used terms some- 
what different in meaning. He found both the chief 
cause and the chief contributing cause of failure. The 
causes are ranked in order of their importance in

308 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
According to Buellesfield, weakness in discipline is 
responsible for a larger per cent of failures than any 
other single cause. His findings are in accordance 
with the data given by Littler in a study of failures 
among elementary school teachers. One of Littler’s 
correspondents, who had kept a record of failures for 
a number of years, claimed that three-fourths of all 
failures are due to lack of disciplinary power. 
According to Buellesfield, the seven chief causes of 
failure are, in their order of importance: (1) weakness 
in discipline; (2) lack of judgment; (3) deficiency in 
scholarship; (4) lack of interest in work of teaching; 
(5) poor health; (6) want of maturity; (7) wrong 
religious views for the community. 
The per cent of failures is about twice as great in 
high schools as in elementary schools. The laboratory 
subjects are responsible for the highest per cent. Over 
two-thirds of the total failures in high school have 
four years or less experience. 
Littler gives twelve causes of failure among ele- 
’ mentary school teachers. Chief among these are (1) 
lack of discipline; (2) lack of instructional skill, and 
(8) weakness of personality. Poor health seems to 
have little weight in determining success or failure. 
Miss Moses gives us an analysis of the specific 
causes of failure included under the general headings 
of Table XV. The following quotations are taken from 
her report: 
“Poor instruction. The teachers whose failure was 
ascribed to poor instruction fell into four subordinate 
groups: 
(a) Those who used poor or inadequate methods.
-P-A-G-E-327
  FAILURES, RESIGNATIONS, AND DISMISSALS 309 
(b) Those who were unable to judge adequately the 
capacity of the pupils. (c) Those whose methods were 
good, but not adapted to the pupils. (d) Those who 
were weak in the technique of the recitation. (e) 
Those whose theories were good, but who could not 
carry theory over into practice. (f) Those who could 
not cover the required work in a given length of 
time.’’ 
More than one-half (26 out of 43) of the individuals 
who failed because of poor instruction fell in the first 
of these subordinate groups. Their methods were 
characterized as ‘‘poor’’ and inadequate. Four more 
suffered from a similar defect—their methods were 
antiquated and worn out. Seven were unable to judge 
correctly the children’s capacities. Four who failed 
fell in the third group—their methods were good but 
not adapted to the pupils. The other groups com- 
prised single individuals. The second group of fail- 
ures (those who were unable to judge children’s 
capacities) is particularly significant. In general these 
teachers taught ‘‘over the heads’’ of their pupils, at- 
tempted to do too much ‘‘lecturing’’ and applied other 
university methods ineffectively. 
Weakness of personality. Unfortunately, compara- 
tively few superintendents report the specific weak- 
nesses that are included under this general term. A 
general lack of culture and refinement is indicated by 
some; lack of force and magnetism by others; unfor- 
tunate habits that seem on the surface to be trivial and 
unimportant are also mentioned; and several teachers 
seem to spoil the effect of their work by too much 
talking. On the whole, however, the general concept
-P-A-G-E-328
  310 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
of personality, although so frequently employed in 
making judgments regarding teachers, is extremely 
vague and intangible and little can be done in correct- 
ing the deficiencies which our study reveals in respect 
to personality until it is split up into more specific 
factors. 
Lack of interest. The teachers who fail because of 
lack of interest may be more specifically classified as 
follows: (a) Those who cannot or do not generate 
sufficient energy for the work; the ‘‘lazy’’ teachers. 
(b) Those who are satisfied with superficial work. (c) 
Those who do not work for definite results. (d) Those 
who are merely ‘‘time servers.’’ (e) Those who have 
too many outside interests. (f) Those who lack in- 
terest in the work of the school. 
Of the thirty failures that have been placed in this 
general class, twelve fall in the first sub-group—they 
are reported as ‘‘lazy.’’ It is probable also that many 
of those listed with the second and third sub-groups 
could ascribe their failure to the same defect. They 
did not prepare their lessons carefully, frequently 
leaving them until the class hour and guiding their in- 
struction by the drift of the class and the impulse of 
the moment. Four teachers were reported definitely 
as being ‘‘time-servers,’’ and four more as having too 
many outside interests. 
Weakness in discipline. This is among the clearest 
and most unequivocal of the causes of failure. While 
a more minute analysis would be helpful in indicating 
possible methods of relief, it is impossible from our 
returns to do anything more than place these twenty- 
six teachers together in one group.
-P-A-G-E-329
FAILURES, RESIGNATIONS, AND DISMISSALS 311 
Lack of sympathy. This defect assumes several 
more specific aspects: (a) a general lack of knowledge 
of human nature; (b) inability to get the pupil’s point 
of view; (c) unwillingness to help the slower pupils; 
(d) inability to comprehend and appreciate the emo- 
tional side of the adolescent’s life. 
The first of these defects seems to be the most sig- 
nificant accounting for nine out of the twenty failures 
falling in the general class. It is, obviously, a general 
rubric and could be made to include all of the others. 
Inability to codperate. The most significant weak- 
ness here is inability to become an effective part of 
the high-school organization. Some teachers simply 
lack the capacity for team-work. Others are too inde- 
pendent; they perhaps could codperate, but they will 
not. They deliverately set themselves against those in 
auihoniiya: esr Soe 
Unprofessional attitude. This defect is closely re- 
lated to the last named. Some teachers fail to take 
the work of teaching seriously—to look upon it as a 
business proposition. Lack of common sense, lack of 
balance, and lack of good judgment are also faults 
that are frequently mentioned in this connection. 
Weakness in knowledge of subject-matter. This de- 
fect is apparently not so common a cause of failure 
as one might suppose. This is probably due in part to 
the fact that scholarship is one quality upon which a 
superintendent can be fairly certain in selecting a 
teacher. Academic training is usually required, and 
academic records are available. 
Disloyalty. There are several different varieties of 
disloyalty. Sometimes it is disloyalty to those in au- 
 
-P-A-G-E-330
  312 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
thority, sometimes to fellow workers, sometimes to 
pupils. Every case of marked disloyalty usually 
causes the teacher’s dismissal. This is the defect that 
seems to be most uniformly fatal to tenure. 
Immorality. It is comforting to note that immo- 
rality plays a comparatively insignificant réle in this 
tragedy of failure. It is a matter of question whether 
some of the failures attributed to laziness do not prop- 
erly belong in this class. 
Poor health. This seems to be the least frequent 
cause of failure, accounting for only two instances out 
of over two-hundred. It is, of course, difficult to say 
in how many other cases ill health played a determin- 
ing part. 
. Causes for dismissal——aA brief summary of existing 
laws bearing on tenure in different states shows that 
teachers may be legally dismissed for (1) incom- 
petence, (2) mis-conduct in office, (3) unprofessional 
conduct, (4) failure to comply with the regulations 
prescribed by the board, (5) neglect of duty, (6) any 
cause that renders a teacher’s service unprofitable, 
(7) the best interest of the school, (8) insubordination, 
(9) immorality, (10) any cause deemed sufficient, and 
(11) decreased attendance. The laws of no single state 
specify all these causes. 
Twenty-five superintendents enumerated the follow- 
ing causes for dismissal, some of which are not speci- 
fied in law, which had come within their experience: 
incompetency ; inability to get along with pupils; poor 
discipline; inability to get along with parents; lazi- 
ness; disturbing and agitating, (for example, teach- 
ers’ unions) ; indiscretion; inability to get along with  
-P-A-G-E-331
  FAILURES, RESIGNATIONS, AND DISMISSALS 313 
faculty ; inability to get along with superiors; playing 
politics, holding job by pull; devoting too much time 
to outside social interests; devoting too much time to 
home interests; feeling too big for the job; revolu- 
tionary ideas; lacking in self-control; erratic and high- 
tempered; ill health, either mental or physical; unpro- 
gressive; failure to obey rules and regulations of 
board; immorality, criminality; inhuman, cruel, or 
brutal conduct; advocating questionable doctrines, 
irreligious, unpatriotic; expiration of certificate; 
slovenliness; religious, political, or moral bigotry; de- 
crease in population; spoilt politics; misuse of school 
property, and carelessness in financial matters. 
Professional and unprofessional causes.—It will be 
noticed that most of the causes for dismissal are pro- 
fessional, and yet ‘‘Any cause deemed sufficient,’’ or 
“The best interests of the school’’ are terms that are 
so elastic and subject to such wide interpretation that 
no teacher can consider her tenure safe even during 
the year covered by her contract. This situation is 
aggravated by the fact in twenty-seven states the 
local school boards have the right to dismiss teachers. 
In seven others the local boards act on the recom- 
mendation of the local or county superintendent, and 
in five states teachers may be dismissed by the county 
superintendent. The same causes that serve as a basis 
for dismissal operate in the suspension or revocation 
of certificates, which, in effect has the same conse- 
quence as dismissal, but the control of certification is 
always in the hands of a professional authority—the 
county superintendent, county board of examiners, 
state superintendent, or state board of education. Not
-P-A-G-E-332
  314 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
only is the basis of dismissal elastic, but only in 
twenty-seven states do the laws require that a notice 
of charges and a hearing be given to the teacher about 
to be dismissed. Appeal from the decision of the local 
board is provided for in twenty-three states; in six- 
teen, the appeal may be taken to the state or county 
superintendent; in three, to the state board of educa- 
tion; in one, each to a special commission, the superior 
courts of the state, the county probate court, and the 
attorney-general. There is thus no established prac- 
tice except in favor of control by the local lay board. 
Methods of dismissal.—The methods used by school 
officials in getting rid of failing teachers may be de- 
seribed under the following headings: (1) annual re- 
elections; (2) refusal to re-elect; (3) requested resig- 
nation, and (4) trial. 
Annual re-election—In most schools, teachers are 
annually re-elected. This is stated in the rules and 
regulations and specified or implied in the contract. 
Each year the officers of the board and the board itself 
determine the successes and failures. Those teachers 
who are not considered successful are dropped. Under 
this arrangement it is possible to dispense with the 
services of an undesirable teacher simply by not re- 
appointing her. Such a method saves the teacher and 
the school board from the notoriety of a more or less 
public trial. Where the annual election is properly 
handled, there are some pronounced advantages in 
the plan but its chief weakness lies in the fact that lay 
boards rather than professional officers determine, for 
the most part, who should be retained and who should 
be eliminated. <A teacher should not be made to feel
-P-A-G-E-333
  FAILURES, RESIGNATIONS, AND DISMISSALS 315 
that her success is dependent upon meeting the narrow 
prejudices and whims of some lay member of the board 
or influential citizen. 
Requesting resignation—Another method of elimi- 
nating teachers is to ask them to resign. This method 
is probably very fair if properly handled. Again, the 
teacher and the school board are saved from the noto- 
riety of a public trial. The teacher is given the privi- 
lege of writing her own resignation either before or 
after reélection. Inasmuch as the factors of place and 
associates partially affect the success of a teacher, it 
is possibly a good plan to give every teacher a second 
or third trial. By permitting her to resign, the teach- 
er’s record is kept clear and she is given an oppor- 
tunity to go elsewhere without prejudice. It is a privi- 
lege almost universally granted by superintendents and 
administrative officers. The following case is typical. 
Example of resignation—In the town of S——., 
Miss D——. was reported to the superintendent of 
schools by the principal and the supervisor as failing 
in her work. The superintendent, upon investigation, 
found that Miss D——. was extremely slovenly in the 
care of her room and very weak in discipline. She 
was a third grade teacher with insufficient preparation. 
Furthermore, she had in ten years of service failed 
to improve her preparation either by extension, cor- 
respondence, or summer sessions. She was a very 
quiet and inoffensive teacher and unable to do hall or 
playground duty effectively. She had been constantly 
rated as a below-average teacher. But for one reason 
or another she had been carried each year, although 
her salary had not been materially increased, and was
-P-A-G-E-334
316 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
still practically at the minimum. The superintendent 
and the board had thought by failing to raise her 
salary she would automatically eliminate herself but 
this scheme had not worked. Finally, the superintend- 
ent took charge of the case, called a council of the 
principal, supervisor, and teacher concerned, and 
stated all the facts and conditions clearly, concisely, 
but kindly, and asked that she resign. Miss D——. 
begged to be given another chance and was finally con- 
tinued for another year, but was told that she would 
be dropped or forced to resign at the end of the year 
unless her work materially improved. Great care was 
exercised to aid her in every way and repeated sug- 
gestions were made which, if observed, would have 
improved her rating, but she seemed incapable of im- 
provement. Therefore, at the end of her second year, 
the superintendent recommended that she be dropped 
provided she did not resign. She resigned but not 
without an ineffective protest. 
The trial—Probably the worst method of attempting 
to dismiss teachers is the trial method now being ad- 
vocated by many teachers’ organizations. The method 
is usually practiced in large cities where life tenure 
is practically guaranteed. Tenure laws usually pro- 
vide that the supervisory officers may decide that a 
teacher is unfit.. But where such decisions are made, 
the officer must file the charges against the teacher in 
writing. The teacher is then notified and may employ 
counsel. The trial is held before the board of educa- 
tion and the lawyer pleads the case for the teacher. 
Because of the legal technicalities involved and the 
difficulties of actually proving the charges against 
 
-P-A-G-E-335
FAILURES, RESIGNATIONS, AND DISMISSALS 317 
teachers, the trial really becomes a trial of the super- 
visory officers and the board of education instead of 
the teacher. 
In regard to this method, Dutton and Snedden make 
the following statement: ‘‘If teachers are given long 
terms of permanent employment, subject only to dis- 
missal for unprofessional conduct or incapacity, it can 
be shown by the experience of many cities that under 
conditions of supervision, dismissal will be practicable 
in exceedingly few cases, even where incapacity or de- 
fect of character is notorious. The reasons for this 
lie in the great difficulty of proving legally that a given 
teacher is incapacitated. If popular sympathy is 
aroused the superintendent and board of education are 
usually quite unwilling to face the opposition that 
gathers in defence of the teacher who is only relatively 
inefficient. . . . In San Francisco and New York, for 
example, the effect of a number of decisions reversing 
the action of the board and even causing it to pay 
large sums of ‘‘back pay’’ has undoubtedly had the 
effect of making the boards afraid to undertake the 
removal of teachers.’’ 
On this same subject Ohieaten says: ‘‘Often the 
publicities and the personalities of the trial leave the 
teachers and the public in no good frame of mind 
towards the schools, and the damage done by the pub- 
lic trial and the newspaper notoriety is often not 
repaired for months to come. Any attorney, without 
difficulty, can create a bad situation for the superin- 
tendent and board at such a trial. Parents whose 
sympathies have been worked upon, are summoned in 
great numbers to testify for the teacher; the superin- 
 
-P-A-G-E-336
  318 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
tendent and the principal who testify against the 
teacher are bullied and grilled; and the board, in its 
effort to protect witnesses against a browbeating law- 
yer and to bring the hearing to a conclusion, can be 
led into technical errors during the trial, and on these 
an appeal to the courts can be based, in case the board 
dismissed the teacher, with the practical certainty that 
the courts will regard the preponderance of common 
evidence and the technical flaws as more important 
than the professional evidence submitted and the in- 
terests of the children in the schools. The almost 
certain result is a legal reinstatement, with full back 
pay. The result on the schools is thoroughly 
vicious. . .. 
“Tf our purpose is to develop a self-satisfied and 
unprogressive teaching force, to ruin our American 
public schools, and eventually to turn education for 
those who can afford it, over to the private and paro- 
chial schools to handle, leaving public schools to min- 
ister only to the needs of the poorer and more ignorant 
classes, then life tenure laws for teachers and princi- 
pals is one of the surest means of doing this. So large 
and so important a business as education—where per- 
sonal growth is so necessary to meet changing needs— 
cannot be successfully conducted on such a basis of 
employment. Life tenure for all efficient service, and 
not as a guaranteed legislative right to all.” 
Moore, commenting on the workings of the New Jer- 
sey tenure-of-office law says: ‘‘There is one feature 
which does not yet, but will in time, tend to lower 
the efficiency of the schools. I refer to the state
-P-A-G-E-337
   FAILURES, RESIGNATIONS, AND DISMISSALS 319 
tenure-of-office law. Security in office during good 
and efficient service is something which all interested 
in the public schools pray earnestly for, but lodgement 
in office for life is quite another matter. It is practi- 
cally impossible to prove professional incompetency in 
court; and places where teachers can appeal to the 
courts for final review of adverse action against them 
by boards of education, and are practically never dis- 
missed, have poor schools. Such tenure-of-office is 
good for the clerk, but bad for the work. Teachers 
should of course have the right to demand a public 
hearing, but it should be conducted by the board of 
education, not by a court. The best kind of tenure of 
office is that which an enlightened public demands and 
insists upon for its teachers. Both teachers and pub- 
lic are unfortunate in having any other kind.’’ 
Guiding principles—School officers should never for- 
get that they are first of all personnel supervisors. 
They should do all in their power to make the schools 
successful. Practice has established the soundness of 
observing guiding principles like the following: 
1. Great care should be exercised in selecting and ap- 
pointing only highly competent teachers. 
2. A teacher should be originally assigned to the 
position where she is most likely to succeed, or reas- 
signed as soon as possible. In other words she should 
be given a right start and every possible chance for 
success. 
3. An inexperienced teacher should be given strong 
support, careful supervision and guidance. The same 
is true of weak teachers.
-P-A-G-E-338
320 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
4, If it is immediately evident that the teacher is 
hopeless beyond any possibility of improvement, she 
should be immediately dropped. 
5. At least two or three supervisory officers should 
agree upon the merit of a teacher before she is 
dismissed. 
6. It is a good practice to transfer teachers, when- 
ever possible, at least once or twice in preference to 
immediate dismissal. 
7. However, in case of immorality or marked indis- 
eretion which ruins the possibility of the teacher keep- 
ing the good will and respect of the students and com- 
munity, she should be immediately dropped. The 
teacher should always be notified regarding her weak- 
nesses. <A record of the notification should be kept 
by a supervisory officer. She should then be given 
every possible means of improving. 
8. A teacher should never be dropped, asked to re- 
sign, or dismissed for any cause whatsoever without 
being duly notified sometime in advance that such 
action is imminent. 
9. A teacher should not be dismissed on hearsay- 
evidence or idle gossip. A teacher is likely to suffer 
in most communities by false statements about her and 
her work. Evils are grossly magnified, truth is dis- 
torted, and many false and malicious charges are 
made. Every teacher should be protected against 
the undue bias created by the wagging of false 
tongues. 
10. A teacher should never be dismissed because of 
personal, political, or religious prejudices. Super- 
visory officers should be very careful to be impersonal
-P-A-G-E-339
  
FAILURES, RESIGNATIONS, AND DISMISSALS 321 
in judging teachers just as they should be impersonal 
in disciplining pupils. 
11. Requiring the resignation or granting a leave of 
absence should be used whenever possible in prefer- 
ence to an abrupt dismissal. Decrease in salary or 
decrease in position, or, at least, no increase in salary 
or position may be successfully used to secure 
resignations. 
12. Objective measures of the teacher’s work, when- 
ever obtainable, are more valuable than personal 
opinions. 
13. A teacher who has been dismissed should rarely, 
if ever, be reinstated, unless the dismissal is caused by 
some temporary or trivial affair which has blown over, 
or, unless the supervisory officer admits his first judg- 
ment was wrong. He should be willing to make such 
an admission when necessary but should be careful 
to make sure that the necessity rarely arises. 
14. Verbal resignations should never be officially re- 
ceived unless made in the presence of others. 
15, Failures should not be passed on to other school 
systems with unqualified recommendations on the part 
of supervisory officers. On the other hand supervisory 
officers must realize that teachers sometimes succeed 
in one position or place where they have failed in 
another. They should never deny or place insur- 
mountable obstacles in the way of those desiring a 
new start or another trial. 
Success is relative-—A teacher is not necessarily a 
success simply because she is able to ‘‘get by.’’? One 
may be reélected from year to year and yet be rather 
unsuccessful. Success means, or should mean, more
-P-A-G-E-340
  322 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
than merely holding down the same position from 
year to year. There are all degrees of successful 
teachers, ranging from the mere job-holders to the 
highly intelligent, cultured, self-sacrificing, devoted, 
and spirited teacher, who by the burning light within 
her, illumines the lives of her pupils. 
For convenience we may divide the outstanding fac- 
tors affecting the teacher’s success as follows: (1) 
factors in the immediate physical environment; (2) 
factors in the immediate human environment; (3) fac- 
tors of administrative and supervisory staff, and (4) 
the inherent and acquired qualities of personality pos- 
sessed by the teacher herself. 
Physical factors.—Light, heat, air, color, dust, hu- 
midity, water, rest rooms, service rooms, and many 
other physical comforts or discomforts must be con- 
sidered. Books have been written on this subject. Yet 
unhygienic conditions of work still prevail in thou- 
sands of classrooms. For example, of the 660 class- 
rooms examined in Salt Lake City in 1916, only 96 
were properly lighted. In Springfield, Illinois, 8 out 
of every 10 classrooms had cross lighting. Hvery- 
where the teacher must face the light. Glare on 
blackboards and walls is universal and yet under- 
illumination prevails. 
The whole question of heating, ventilating and hu- 
midifying classrooms is unsolved. We know that 
warm moist air in slight motion is more comfortable 
than when still, and that a temperature of from 68 
to 72 degrees is better for work than either a much 
cooler or warmer room. 
Comfortable and sanitary rest rooms and lunch
-P-A-G-E-341
FAILURES, RESIGNATIONS, AND DISMISSALS 323 
rooms should be provided. There can be no doubt 
but that most teachers are sensitive to a pleasant 
street and site and attractive school yard, and that a 
clean, light, airy and sunny room, equipped with at- 
tractive fixtures, appropriate pictures and the like are 
distinct aids toward a happy mental attitude, and 
therefore distinct aids to success. 
Social factors.—The teacher who is able to succeed 
socially is usually more successful in the classroom, 
and vice versa. Too many teachers are introverts. 
They are too self-conscious. They lack social experi- 
ence and the social graces that make it easy and nat- 
ural to mix well with other folks. Many teachers seem 
to possess an inferiority complex. They do not feel 
that they are as good as their associates. They in- 
stinctively shun social opportunities. 
A proper social life is conditioned not only by the 
environment but also by the individual. An open, 
sunny disposition, the power and habit of smiling, a 
congenial good will toward others, must be cultivated. 
One should make others feel that they are easy to 
approach. A repellent personality can never be as 
successful as an attractive one. Personality is the way 
you do things. If your personality needs changing 
simply change the way you do things. In other words, 
personality may and must be systematically cultivated. 
It grows and flowers under such cultivation. 
Personal factors.—The teacher’s work is very diffi- 
cult simply because she deals with the human spirit 
in relation to the social spirit. Scientists know little 
about the human body and mind, although thousands 
of the best minds of the race have worked during hun- 
 
-P-A-G-E-342
  324 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
dreds of years upon its analysis. Yet the human body 
is a simple organism compared with the human mind, 
or with that even more intangible but potent force 
known as the social mind and spirit. The very best 
teacher in the world knows little, indeed, of either 
of these things. The teacher’s task is rendered much 
more difficult if she does not know her own abilities, 
characteristics, aptitudes, ideals, prejudices, temper 
and skills. Many of the serious problems that the 
teacher faces in her everyday work originate from 
her own personality. Three of the greatest maxims a 
teacher (or anyone else for that matter) can practice 
are those announced hundreds of years ago by Soc- 
rates, Marcus Aurelius and Jesus. Socrates said: 
“‘Know thyself.’ Marcus Aurelius said: ‘Control 
thyself.’? Jesus said: ‘‘Deny thyself.’’ 
Main points of the chapter.—l. New teachers or 
other employees are called accessions. Accessions are 
necessary because of turnover and because of expan- 
sion of the personnel. 
2. Turnover is caused in part by failures and fail- 
ures are caused by a great variety of factors, chief 
among which are poor instruction, weakness of dis- 
cipline, poor personality, and lack of interest. 
3. The legal causes for dismissal vary according 
to the state but are sufficient in number and variety 
to cover practically all kinds of cases. The four most 
commonly enumerated causes are incompetency, mis- 
conduct, neglect of duty, insubordination. 
4. Many other causes are enumerated, some of 
which are professional and some unprofessional. Only  
-P-A-G-E-343
FAILURES, RESIGNATIONS, AND DISMISSALS 325 
professional causes should, except in rare cases, 
operate. 
5. The four methods of separation are (1) failure 
to reélect; (2) refusal to reappoint or elect; (3) re- 
questing resignation, and (4) hearing or trial. 
6. Of the four methods, the public trial is alone un- 
professional. Laymen are not as a rule competent 
to pass on the merits of a teacher. A trial before a 
board of peers or before the board of education should 
be used as the final resort and no appeal should be 
possible to civil courts. 
7. Guiding principles are necessary in the matter 
of handling failures. Fifteen important principles are 
enumerated. 
8. Success is relative and depends upon factors in 
the physical environment, factors in the social or hu- 
man environment, the nature and kind of supervision, 
and personal factors possessed by the teacher herself. 
PROBLEMS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND 
. DISCUSSION 
1. The parents of the children in the third grade at C 
school complain that the teacher is too old for further service. 
In her day she was considered a good teacher, but she has 
been steadily falling behind. She is honest and conscientious 
but lacks enthusiasm. She is deadening. <A good drill mas- 
ter, nothing more. She has taught 37 years and should 
retire but no one likes to suggest it to her. How would you 
go about it to persuade her to voluntarily retire with all the 
honors that go with long service? 
2. Miss F is a teacher of but two years’ experience 
in the town of B. She signed her contract with the other 
teachers in May to return to teach in the fall. She is a very   
  
 
-P-A-G-E-344
  
  326 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
good primary teacher. In September, one week before the 
opening of school, she writes asking to be relieved of her 
contract. She gives no reason for her decision. Should the 
superintendent accept her resignation and find a new teacher 
immediately or should he make an attempt to find out her 
reasons and try to retain her? 
3. From a reliable source, the knowledge has come to the 
superintendent that Miss M: has been guilty of negligence. 
She has continually been tardy to her classroom. On Mon- 
day she did not appear all morning and gave no notice to her 
principal. With quite definite proof of her conduct, Miss 
M. is called into the superintendent’s office. She con- 
fesses that she has been negligent but asks for another trial. 
Should the superintendent, knowing that she is guilty, allow 
her to continue the remainder of the year on probation? 
Should he dismiss her immediately? Should he give her an 
opportunity to resign? 
4, Miss A- , a fair teacher of mathematics, has had 
twenty years’ experience. She is hired to teach in the local 
high school. Before the end of her first year in the local 
school system it develops that she is a gossipy trouble-maker 
among her fellow teachers and very hard for the high-school 
principal to work with. She cannot take suggestions and 
makes herself a general nuisance. However, no definite 
charges can be made against her and at the end of her first 
year she is not dismissed but put on trial for another year. 
She becomes more and more troublesome and the principal 
decided that her contract must not be renewed a second year. 
Non-codperation is the charge. In the meantime she has 
made friends with many members of the local board who 
think she is fine, mainly because she has made favorites of 
their children. How should the superintendent and high- 
school principal proceed? Should the committee on appoint- 
ments be informed of the teacher’s conduct? Should the 
superintendent know where each member of his board stands 
in regard to Miss A. ’s dismissal before he takes any 
steps to dismiss her? Should she be given a trial? Why?

CHAPTER XVI 
SIGNIFICANCE OF TURNOVER 
The nature of turnover.—By turnover is meant the 
replacements necessary in order to maintain a stable 
working force during a given period. It is caused by 
temporary or permanent withdrawals or separations 
from the working force. For example, the school sys- 
tem at X——. regularly employs twenty full-time 
teachers. Every month some are ill and their places 
must be filled with substitutes. Occasionally, the ill- 
ness may last a month or two, or even the remainder of 
the year. Again, one or more teachers may resign and 
it becomes necessary to replace them. Replacements 
for any cause, no matter whether temporary or or per- 
manent,-eause turnover. If, in X——., all of the 
twenty teachers worked every day for the entire year 
the working force would be maintained without the 
aid of a substitute or the necessity of a replacement. 
But such is rarely the case. 
Turnover may occur during the year as described 
above. This is the only kind of turnover known in 
trade and industrial establishments. Most contracts 
in business are made for an indefinite period and may 
begin or end at any time during the year. In educa- 
tion the case is different. Contracts are for a fixed 
period, namely, the school term or year. Therefore, 
328
-P-A-G-E-347
SIGNIFICANCE OF TURNOVER 329 
the turnover during the year is relatively small com- 
pared with turnover in trade and industrial establish- 
ments. In fact, comparisons in turnover are rarely 
made on this basis. In education the large proportion 
of turnover comes at the end of the year. It is so 
much larger than that occurring during the year that 
it is usually the only form of turnover mentioned in 
education. : 
In the town of X——., to continue the illustration, 
twenty full-time teachers are needed this year and 
will be needed next year, but at the beginning of the 
new school year, for various reasons, only eight of the 
twenty will return and twelve new names will be added 
to the pay roll. The twelve represent turnover, and 
as twelve is sixty per cent of twenty, the turnover is 
sixty per cent. But in reality the annual turnover 
is larger than sixty per cent. The replacements occur- 
ring during the year should be added. In other words, 
the annual turnover in a school system should be com- 
puted on a 12-months basis and should include both 
turnover during and at the close of the school year. 
Significance of turnover.—In business and industry 
it has been found that one of the best ways of deter- 
mining the stability of an establishment is to examine 
the labor turnover for such establishments. Scientific- 
employment, like high wages properly distributed, is 
in the long run an economy. It is more efficient (and 
therefore less expensive) to keep trained, experienced, 
and highly competent teachers than it is to hire each 
year less experienced, less trained, and less competent 
teachers at less salary. It undoubtedly pays to con- 
serve human as well as material resources. As much

thought and technique should be put into the problem 
of hiring and utilizing teachers. as is given to the pur- 
chase and utilization of buildings, supplies, and other 
materials. Unnecessary hiring and firing is being re- 
duced to the minimum in the business and industrial 
world. Perhaps education can learn from the prac- 
tices of such establishments many valuable lessons in 
labor efficiency. 
Turnover in education may be regarded as a pro- 
fessional barometer. There are, in every school sys- 
tem, certain stabilizing influences that build up morale 
or esprit de corp that make for contentment and effec- 
tiveness. There are also other influences making for 
disaffection, discontentment, lack of interest, ineffi- 
ciency, and instability of personnel. It is the function 
of personnel management to strengthen the former 
and to defeat the latter. 
Normal turnover—A certain amount of turnover 
among teachers is a normal and necessary thing. 
Shifting from grade to grade, school to school, county 
to city, city to city, from lower to higher positions, and 
even in and out of the profession is to be expected and, 
within proper limits, is desirable. It may, therefore, 
be called normal turnover. This necessary movement 
of teachers is an entirely natural ebb and flow. It 
results from the normal contraction and expansion of 
positions in education, from changes in salary levels 
and from different levels of educational opportunities 
open to teachers. 
Interest in the question of teacher turnover cen- 
ters, therefore, not only upon its general or normal

extent but more specifically upon whatever part of it 
may be considered abnormal and unnecessary. From 
this viewpoint, it is essential to know: (1) the various 
factors which are likely to increase or decrease its 
volume; (2) the nature and extent of teacher mobility, 
instability, or turnover, and (3) whether any employ- 
ment methods have been or can be devised which will 
make it possible to reduce teacher turnover to such 
an extent as to increase the efficiency and promote the 
welfare of both the schools and the teachers concerned. 
Causes of turnover.—Turnover in education is 
caused, on the one hand, by certain constant factors 
over which the local board of education has. practi- 
cally no control and, on the other hand, by certain 
variable factors over which it may be possible to exer- 
cise, by the use of proper employment methods, a 
reasonable degree of control. The number of influen- 
tial factors is greater than one would at first think. 
Recently the writer asked 50 superintendents to state 
all the factors that in their experience operated to 
affect turnover and tenure. The following factors 
were enumerated. There are no definite data as to the 
influence of each. Some of the factors are predomi- 
nantly economic in character, others political, or pro- 
fessional, or individual, or social, or geographical. © 
They are, therefore, grouped under these six headings: 
I. Economic factors. 
1. Inadequate salaries. 
2. High cost of living. 
8. Economic fluctuations as during war, ete. 
4. Size and wealth of community.

23. Uncertainty of tenure. 
24. Lack of provision for old age. 
Individual factors. 
25. Desire for change—wanderlust, unrest, ete. 
26. Age and sex. 
27. Marriage. 
28. Health—personal and family. 
29. Unfitness—incompetency, immorality, ete. 
30. Desire to start over. 
31. Friendships elsewhere. 
Social factors.

35, Lack of social common sense.

86. Restricted social opportunities. 
87. Lack of community appreciation. 
88. Poor living conditions. 
VI. Geographical factor 
89. Climatic conditions. 
It is difficult to state which of these factors are the 
most influential. Much depends upon the individual 
and the locality. The writer is of the opinion that 
youthfulness and sex are probably the two chief causes 
for turnover. 
Age and turnover.—As long as school boards con- 
tinue to hire even 16, 17, 18, and 19-year-old girls, the 
annual turnover will continue to be higher than it 
would otherwise be if the minimum age could be gradu- 
ally raised to, say 20, as in Delaware, in which case 
greater stability will result. Wherever possible, it 
should be raised to 21 and 22. This is the practice in 
cities that demand at least two years of training be- 
yond high school and from one to two years of experi- 
ence as a minimum for entrance. Obviously, age is 
not the sole factor. It is merely a means to an end. 
By raising the age minimum the minimum prepara- 
tions and maturity are automatically increased. The 
transients are also reduced in volume. 
Sex and age.—Girls do not, as a rule, take teaching 
or any other occupation very seriously until after they 
have passed the age of expectancy. This is an impor- 
tant thing to remember in hiring young women. They 
feel transitory. They expect to be married sooner or 
later and, usually, sooner. Many girls attend normal 
school and college dreading the thought of teaching 
 
-P-A-G-E-352
334 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
and with no real expectation of ever teaching. Con- 
sequently, they are apt to take their training rather 
lightly and also their first two or three years of ex- 
perience. They frequently migrate from community 
to community, no doubt in part, to increase their ex- 
pectancy. Some of them change trades for the same 
reason. Young people like to move about and are 
not afraid to take the chances involved. 
Many boards of education, especially in large cities, 
have learned the truth of this and now reduce the 
annual turnover by the simple expedient of refusing 
to hire girls with less than one or two years of experi- 
ence elsewhere and with less than two years of train- 
ing beyond high school. Of course, if all boards re- 
fused to hire inexperienced teachers there would be 
no recruiting. Each board, therefore, should take its 
| share of inexperienced persons. They should be taken, 
however, on probationary terms. 
How to compute turnover.—Hnough has been said 
to show the confusion that now exists in education in 
attempting to compute turnover and tenure. In edu- 
cation no satisfactory method has as yet been used. 
The writer, therefore, suggests that we borrow the 
latest and most reliable methods used by economists 
in computing turnover in industrial establishments. 
Brissenden and Franken, in a recent book entitled 
Labor Turnover in Industry (1922), offer us practi- 
cal suggestions worthy of consideration. They say in 
part: ‘‘Just as turnover is a misleading term for use 
in general reference to the phenomenon of labor in- 
stability, so the term ‘‘percentage’’ is equally confus- 
ing for use in measuring the extent of this phenome-  
-P-A-G-E-353
SIGNIFICANCE OF TURNOVER 335 
non. We know exactly the extent of the replacement 
necessary to maintain the normal working force when 
we know, let us say, that replacements took place in 
any given concern at the rate of two for each full-year 
worker in the normal work force. In other words, the 
phrase ‘‘rate of replacement”? accurately designates 
what ‘‘percentage of furnover’’ has been loosely used 
to express.’’ 
The primary object in measuring the extent of turn- 
over is to determine the number of repeated trans- 
actions involved in the maintenance of the working 
force. Quite naturally we are chiefly interested in the 
number of persons it is necessary to hire to keep the 
establishment going. The turnover rate is then the 
replacement rate. The replacement rate is deter- 
mined by simply computing (1) the number of separa- 
tions from the pay roll and (2) the number of 
accessions to the pay roll. Whichever number is 
smaller represents the number of replacements. By 
‘accessions’? is meant the number hired during the 
given period. By ‘‘separations’’ is meant the total 
of the number quitting for any and all causes during 
the same period. 
Inaccuracy of present statistics—Unfortunately, no 
one has yet studied turnover in education with this 
degree of accuracy and until this is done our statistics 
will continue to be unreliable and scarcely comparable 
to the more accurate statistics characteristic of indus- 
trial establishments. 
It is estimated by Almack that there are no less than 
150,000 teaching positions vacant every year. Just 
how many of these are voluntary and how many are 
 
-P-A-G-E-354
  336 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
enforced it is impossible to say. In rural schools the 
teacher turnover, according to Almack, is greatest. 
Only 30 per cent of the teachers are reélected. It is 
the common practice to elect a rural school teacher 
for three months and then reélect her if she pleases 
the children. Almack estimated that in the larger dis- 
tricts in Oregon (exclusive of Portland) 44.3 per cent 
of the teachers were new one year to the school in 
which they were teaching. About 41 per cent of the 
principals and 25 per cent of the superintendents were 
also new. In middle-size districts over 50 per cent of 
the high-school teachers and 30 per cent of the princi- 
pals were new. In the small districts the turnover was 
even greater, over 61 per cent of the teachers and 50 
per cent of the principals were new. 
In the city of Baltimore it was found that 122 new 
teachers were needed in the year 1915-16. Of this 
number 71 were due to death or resignation, leaving 
51 new positions created to care for expansion in the 
enrolment. In 1918-19 it was necessary to hire 527 
new teachers, only 212 of which were due to 
replacement. 
Turnover and position.—In the Flint (Mich.) Survey 
(1920) it was found that the per cent of turnover was 
‘‘strikingly excessive.’’ The figures in terms of per 
cent for each group of educational employees follow. 
It is not clear just how these figures were compiled. 
Apparently the surveyors had no clear idea of what is 
meant by either turnover or tenure, separations or re- 
placements. The figures are, therefore, wholly mis- 
leading and unreliable.

Unfortunately, the figures for Flint include all ac- 
cessions whether for the purpose of replacement or for 
expansion due to the rapid growth of the city. 
Transfers—One method of handling a failing 
teacher is to transfer her to another position. Not 
all transfers are for this reason, however. A transfer 
may be made for any of the following causes: (1) 
physical reasons, including the physical factors of the 
position itself and the health and strength of the 
teacher; (2) failure of the teacher, and the desire to 
give her another chance; (3) the teacher is better fitted 
for another position; (4) a change in the enrolment 
either increasing or decreasing the need of teachers; 
 
-P-A-G-E-356
    338 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
(5) the teacher desires a change or a promotion, or is 
better prepared for other work. 
Absenteeism and substitutes.—Absenteeism is a con- 
tributory cause of turnover. Many cities permit teach- 
ers to be absent without loss of pay for a period of 
from three to ten days during the year for personal 
illness, illness or death in the immediate family, quar- 
antine, enforced attendance at court, or epidemics that 
cause the closing of school. 
When schools are in session and absenteeism occurs, 
it is usually necessary for some arrangement to be 
made for the substitute. Most cities provide a regular 
list, leaving it to the office of the superintendent. Sub- 
stitutes are not always held to the rigid qualifications 
of regular teachers and are usually paid a flat per 
diem rate equal to the minimum salary. The practice 
is growing in larger cities to provide regular substi- 
tutes and to use the substitute list as an eligibility 
list from which promotions to the regular staff are 
made as vacancies occur. 
Methods of decreasing turnover and increasing tenure. 
—The most important method of decreasing turnover 
is to start at the source and hire only teachers of high 
professional training, ability, interest, and experience. 
It can be shown that the great cause of turnover in 
the profession as a whole is youthfulness, inexperi- 
ence, lack of training, and lack of life-career interests. 
Perhaps the second most important method is to pay 
teachers progressively, beginning with a reasonable 
initial salary and advancing them each year in the 
same school system as long as they continue to im- 
 
-P-A-G-E-357
  SIGNIFICANCE OF TURNOVER 339 
prove in service. This method is discussed more fully 
in the chapter on salaries. 
Perhaps the next method in importance is to im- 
prove the local living and social conditions. Certainly, 
teaching can never be made attractive unless the so- 
cial status of the teacher is improved. While the 
writer is of the opinion that the social status of the 
teacher is determined largely by the teacher herself, 
he believes, nevertheless, that society at large has a 
responsibility for the improvement of the teacher’s 
social status which it has failed to perform. 
A fourth method of decreasing turnover and increas- 
ing tenure would be for local boards voluntarily to 
adopt or to be compelled by state legislation to adopt 
some reasonable and equitable plan of tenure that 
would protect the teacher against needless and in- 
jurious firing and at the same time protect the tax- 
payer against overloading the system with job-holders 
and the children against inefficient and incompetent 
retainers. 
A fifth method of meeting this problem would be 
to organize better and to standardize the service of 
placement agencies. Certainly, much of the fluidity 
of teachers’ employment is due to the activities of 
teachers’ agencies. The agencies themselves are not 
entirely to blame for this condition and many of them 
are militant in its correction. More uniform salary 
schedules throughout a given area would reduce 
fluidity. 
Along with improved salary schedules, providing 
for continued experience and efficiency, there arises  
-P-A-G-E-358
  340 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
a need for sound pension systems. It is a lamentable 
fact that less than 10 of the 100 teachers’ pension 
systems in the United States are actuarily sound. 
Every school board and official can aid in the correc- 
tion of the existing pension systems and the establish- 
ment of new systems on a sound basis. 
Main points of the chapter.—l. By turnover is meant 
the replacements necessary in a given period of time 
in order to maintain a stable work force. All 
separations, whether temporary or permanent, cause 
turnover. 
2. Turnover is a barometer of the relative strength 
of the factors making for stability and the factors 
making for instability of personnel. 
3. A certain amount of turnover is unavoidable and 
therefore may be called normal turnover. Abnormal 
and unnecessary turnover constitute the real problem. 
4, There are many causes of abnormal turnover, 
chief among which are youthfulness and sex and 
salary. 
5. More careful methods of computing turnover 
must be used before the extent of necessary and un- 
necessary turnover can be ascertained. The methods 
used in industrial establishments are commended. 
Educational statistics on this subject are faulty be- 
cause the methods of computing them are variable and 
incomplete. 
6. Six methods of decreasing turnover are (1) hire 
more carefully; (2) pay progressively; (3) make 
teachers comfortable locally; (4) reasonable guaran- 
teed tenure; (5) better teachers’ agencies, and (6) bet- 
ter pension systems.

PROBLEMS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
1. Define the meaning of the phrase ‘‘stable work force.”’ 
How should the terms accession and separation be used? 
2. How would you define or determine ‘‘normal’’ turnover 
in education? 
8. Collect figures to show the differences in turnover are 
due largely to sex and age. 
4. Discuss the question of teachers’ agencies and their 
effect on the stability and mobility of teachers. 
5. Show how accurate statistics on turnover may be se- 
eured. Of what practical value would such statistics be to 
an administrator? 
6. A teacher threatens to leave unless her salary is raised. 
Should she threaten? Should a superintendent or board of 
education be moved by such threats? 
7. Show how the social status of teachers affects turnover. 
8. Summarize the advantages of rapid turnover. 
9. Should transfers be called turnover? Why? 
10. Study the relation between the mental alertness or 
general intelligence of teachers and turnover. 
11. Study the relation between length of service or ex- 
perience and turnover. 
12. What is meant in the following statement by ‘‘specifie 
diseases’: ‘‘Labor turnover is the expression of all the 
specific diseases within an organization which, separately or 
together, serve to discourage employees from continuing in 
their employment.’’ (Scott and Clothier, p. 478.)

  CHAPTER XVII 
HOW TO INCREASE TENURE 
Tenure and efficiency.—In most quarters it is a gen- 
erally accepted fact that a teacher increases in value 
the longer she remains in the school system and in the 
profession. Of course, this is not true of teachers who 
are by nature incompetent or who become ill, disabled, 
routinized, or who fail to grow professionally. Teach- 
ers, like workers in other fields, continue to improve 
for a certain number of years, depending upon the 
individual. They then reach a level or plateau beyond 
which advancement is less rapid. Some teachers reach 
this plateau early in life. Again, certain teachers re- 
main on a plateau of efficiency for a great many years, 
apparently neither increasing nor decreasing in effi- 
ciency. They seem to stand still, No one knows just 
at what age a teacher ceases to increase in efficiency. 
Some superintendents maintain that teachers increase 
in efficiency up to 30 years of age, others up to 40, still 
others up to 50, and a few even up to 60 or beyond. 
The general assumption seems to be that a teacher 
reaches her maximum of efficiency before she is 40 or 
45, and after that remains on a plateau of efficiency 
for a period of 10 or 20 years at most, after which 
time, with rare exception, efficiency decreases. 
Undoubtedly, this general assumption is based upon 
the experience of workers in other fields. In trade and 
342 
 
-P-A-G-E-361
  HOW TO INCREASE TENURE 343 
industry the older the applicant after, say forty, the 
less chance she has of appointment. There is a preju- 
dice against the ‘‘old man”’ or the ‘‘old woman.’’ Age 
is vaguely defined. The prejudice that appears in 
trade and industry apparently is borrowed by school 
men and applied to teaching. Is this prejudice well 
founded? If so, the universal agitation for guaran- 
teed tenure, or what practically amounts to guaranteed 
tenure, is a move in the wrong direction. It is the 
writer’s purpose in this chapter carefully to analyze 
the available data on the problems of tenure in order 
that the reader may be guided in his views by such 
data rather than by prejudices or opinions superfi- 
cially derived. 
Loss of efficiency.—As shown in the previous chap- 
ter, tenure in village and small city schools is very 
short. Almack says: ‘‘In urging a high school gradu- 
ate to prepare herself for teaching one might say to 
her that her contract will be for nine months, that 
she may reasonably expect to teach two years in the 
same district, and that she will continue to teach about 
four years.’’ 
If a teacher does not reach her maximum teaching 
efficiency until'she has had at least five years’ experi- 
ence, and if in passing to a new school after her initial 
experience, she does reach her maximum of efficiency 
short of two or three years, it would seem that at least 
50 per cent of the teachers of the United States do not 
reach their maximum of efficiency before leaving the 
profession, and that not more than 25 per cent reach 
it in a given school system. 
It is commonly estimated that the efficiency of an
-P-A-G-E-362
    344 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
industrial plant is in direct proportion to its labor 
turnover. On this basis schools lose from 50 to 75 
per cent of the efficiency attainable under a policy of 
continuous service. 
Lack of accurate statistics—No accurate statistics 
exist on tenure. Certainly the situation cannot be 
as bad as pictured by Almack. A distinction should be 
made between tenure in a given locality and tenure in 
the profession. These two different things are usually 
confused. The writer is convinced that the total teach- 
ing life of the average teacher is much higher than 
commonly stated. 
Part of the confusion in statistics on tenure results 
from indiscriminately mixing statistics on turnover 
with statistics on tenure. While the two are closely 
related they are not necessarily identical. Further- 
more, the statistics on tenure would indicate a much 
greater professional stability than can be derived from 
the statistics on turnover. Bobbitt presents the fol- 
lowing random sampling of the tenure situation as it 
existed in a number of cities around the country in 
1916:

  HOW TO INCREASE TENURE 345 
Four ways of measuring tenure.—There are several 
ways of measuring the tenure of teachers. First, we 
may measure the length of time a person or a group 
of persons have occupied their present positions. Ob- 
viously, this measure is primarily important in show- 
ing the annual turnover. It shows the instability of 
the profession in a given place. Most of the studics 
on tenure stop at this point. Thus we find that Miss 
X——. has been in her present position two years. 
The second way is to measure the total length of 
service regardless of place up to a given date. Thus 
we find that Miss X——. has taught to date a total of 
eight years. 
In the third place, we may measure tenure by com- 
bining the first method with the second. Thus we 
find that Miss X——. with a total teaching experience 
to date of eight years, occupied her first position one 
year, her second two years, her third one year, her 
fourth three years, and has been two years in her 
present or fifth position. But Miss X——. is still 
teaching and may remain in the profession for a num- 
ber of years. 
Therefore, there is a fourth way of measuring ten- 
ure. We may measure tenure by compiling the total 
length of service in teaching of persons who have left 
the profession, or are about to leave it. The results 
obtained will depend upon the method of measure- 
ment that is used. 
Tenure and position.—In the Flint Survey (1920) it 
was found that the instability in tenure was ‘‘strik- 
ingly excessive.’’ The figures in terms of per cent 
for each group of employees are given on page 337.

years is compared with the tenure situation in Rock- 
ford where the teachers remain on the average 9.1 
years. 
In the Baltimore School Survey (1920-21) statistics 
on tenure are given in terms of turnover. Thus, it 
was found that changes in the teaching staff from 1915 
to 1921 were as given in Table XVII.

Replacements and new positions.—It should be re- 
membered in computing both turnover and tenure that 
in growing communities an increased number of teach- 
ers are needed each year. The figures from Baltimore, 
for example, show a very marked growth and expan-

sion in the years 1918-19 and 1919-20. The figures for 
the last 13 years for Flint, Michigan, are even more 
startling and give some measure of the difficulties 
that rapidly growing cities face in providing adequate 
teaching service. 
The large number of new teachers needed in Flint 
each year is due to turnover and expansion. Expan- 
sion alone accounts for from 50 to 100 new teachers 
yearly during the last five years. Unless replacements 
due to turnover and new accessions due to expansion 
are carefully separated, the statistics on turnover are 
practically worthless. Furthermore, in statistics on

tenure in relation to position, it should be borne in 
mind that a large number of new teachers, due to 
expansion, bring down the average tenure of the 
working force. Therefore, a distinction should be 
made between accessions due to replacements of the

Tenure of superintendents and high school principals 
in Michigan.—In 1923, Woody made a study of the 
tenure of the superintendents and high-school princi- 
pals in Michigan in their present positions (1921-22). 
He divided the cities of Michigan into five groups ac- 
cording to their size. His findings are as follows:
-P-A-G-E-367

First quartile 6 2 1.2 2.1 2.3 
Third quartile 2.5 3.0 4.2 8.5 19.8 
  ‘One-half of the superintendents in cities of Group I 
have occupied their present positions less than 1.4 
years; one-fourth of them less than 0.6 of a year, and 
only one-fourth of them 2.5 years or more. In other 
words, three-fourths of them have been occupying 
their present positions not over two and one-half 
years. Stated in another way, if you should stand all 
of the 252 superintendents in a row according to the 
length of their tenure in their present positions and 
should start to count, beginning with the shortest ten- 
ure, you would have counted 100 of them before you 
came to one who had occupied his present position 
three years. The tenure is longer for superintendents 
in Groups 2, 3, 4 and 5. But even in Group 4 (cities 
having a population of between 5,000 and 15,000), half 
of the superintendents have been occupying their pres- 
ent positions less than 3.5 years; one-fourth of them 
2.1 years or less, and only one-fourth of them 8 or 
more years. It is significant that the tenure of super- 
intendents in the larger cities is very little greater 
than in the smaller cities. Of course, there are a few 
superintendents in each group who are relatively per- 
manent and the proportion is slightly greater in the 
larger cities than in the smaller cities. The peripatetic 
nature of superintendents is clearly shown by such 
statistics.’’  
-P-A-G-E-368

The situation in regard to high school principals 
is even worse. The data are as follows:

These facts show that in the first three groups, half 
of the high-school principals have been occupying their 
present positions less than one year, and in the first 
four groups not more than one-fourth have been oc- 
cupying their present positions three years or more. 
In general, the figures presented on superintendents 
and high-school principals in Michigan probably repre- 
sent the tenure situation in most of the Middle West- 
ern and Southern states fairly well. There is almost 
an utter lack of permanency of tenure on the part of 
superintendents and principals as well as on the part 
of teachers. This rapid shifting in administrative 
and supervisory offices means that the policies of the 
school systems are in constant state of flux and that 
the board of education is the most permanent influence 
in the maintenance of educational policies. Appar- 
ently, superintendents and principals must devote too 
much time to moving rather than improving. By high 
mobility they increase the teaching procession rather 
than improve the teaching profession. 
Tenure, experience or length of service to date.— 
The second way of measuring tenure is to compute the 
length of service, regardless of place, the teachers have

ers had had in their present positions. The Roman nu-

merals, I, II, and III, across the top of the table refer 
to cities of different sizes. I is the smallest size 
cities; II the middle-size cities, and III the largest. 
It is interesting to note from this table that high-school 
teachers in Washington have a total median tenure 
in the largest cities of approximately 8.2 years while 
those teachers employed in middle-size cities have had 
a total tenure of 4.5 years.
-P-A-G-E-370
  352 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
Similar studies have been made by Davis and others. 
All such studies illustrate this method of computing 
tenure. This method is faulty, due to the fact that 
the rapid expansion in education means a large num- 
ber of new recruits each year. This appreciably 
affects the median of tenure of teachers in service. 
Furthermore, many of the teachers now teaching will 
continue for a number of years. 
Tenure, position, and service to date.—A third way 
of measuring tenure would be to compute the total 
length of service and at the same time the number of 
years served in each locality. Obviously, this is only 
a combination of the first and second methods. 
Tenure and life service——The fourth method of 
measuring tenure is to compile the total length of 
service of persons who have already left the profes- 
sion or of persons who are about to leave it. So far 
as the writer knows, no one has ever made a study of 
tenure on this basis. A study of two or three thou- 
sand cases at random would undoubtedly give us more 
accurate figures concerning the tenure situation in the 
oo than any other method. When we speak of 
the tenure of doctors we do so regardless of place or 
time. We want their life service record in medicine. 
Attempts have been made to determine the median 
life service record in teaching by means of the second 
method described above. It is doubtful if the same 
results would be obtained if the fourth method were 
used. At present, no statistics are available. No one 
really knows how long teachers on the average teach. 
Advantages of long tenure.—The following advan- 
tages of long tenure are cited: (1) The education of
-P-A-G-E-371
  HOW TO INCREASE TENURE 353 
children suffers greatly under the instruction of new 
and inexperienced teachers. (2) A certain amount of 
time is wasted in adjusting the new teachers no mat- 
ter how well qualified they may be. (3) Proper grad- 
ing, grouping, classifying, and marking of pupils is 
seriously handicapped because new teachers must learn 
the children anew. (4) There is less unity and con- 
tinuity in materials of instruction as well as in methods 
where teachers change frequently. (5) Frequent 
changing of teachers makes it impossible to become 
closely identified with the life of the community. (6) 
Frequent turnover costs the public considerable money 
each year that might be spent to greater advantage. 
(7) The development of a local esprit de corps is al- 
most impossible when each year inexperienced teachers 
replace other inexperienced teachers. (8) Short tenure 
results in a lowering of standards. Good teachers and 
good textbooks are the two absolute essentials for good 
instruction. There are laws against too frequent 
change of textbooks and as teachers are more im- 
portant than books there should be some way to in- 
crease their tenure. (9) European practices seem to 
show a decided advantage for long tenure. 
Boston’s tenure law.—In Boston, in 1885, certain 
educational leaders decided that the public school sys- 
tem should be ‘‘independent of personal or partisan 
influence and free from the malignant power of patron- 
age and spoils.’’ As a result, in February, 1889, a 
committee on rules of the Boston schools recommended 
that a tenure law be established for the following addi- 
tional reasons: 
(10) The annual election does not attract first-class
-P-A-G-E-372
  354 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
talent to the profession. (11) In practice the annual 
election does not drop the poor, incompetent, and in- 
efficient teachers. (12) The annual election is not 
applied to the policemen, firemen, or to judicial offi- 
cers, and hence should not be applied to other public 
servants, as the teachers. (13) During annual elec- 
tions some of our best teachers have been ‘‘black 
balled’’ for insignificant reasons. The tenure law 
adopted by Boston at that time provided that each 
teacher should undergo a probationary term of one 
year followed by four annual elections, after which a 
permanent tenure was given whereby the teacher was 
subject to removal only for a cause considered suffi- 
cient after a hearing before a committee of the board. 
Disadvantages of long and guaranteed tenure.— 
Among the disadvantages of long tenure, the follow- 
ing should be cited: (1) When tenure is not guaran- 
teed the teachers know they are constantly under fire 
and therefore strive to do their best. (2) Short ten- 
ure is the prevailing practice in other trades. In fact, 
guaranteed tenure is the exception rather than the rule 
in most occupations. (3) Boards of education are 
becoming less and less political in their character and 
therefore the question of the annual reélection of 
teachers is becoming more and more a formal matter 
presented to the board by its officers. The school offi- 
cers representing boards frequently find that the teach- 
ers’ positions have been filled without the greatest 
regard to efficiency. A permanently guaranteed ten- 
ure law would hamper boards of education and school 
officers in improving the standards of education in a 
community. (4) It is better that a few teachers lose 
 
-P-A-G-E-373
HOW TO INCREASE TENURE 355 
their jobs occasionally, even though not always justly, 
than to risk loading the profession with a larger per- 
centage of incompetent job holders than at present. 
It is obvious that this would apply only to certain 
communities where political and personal pull and in- 
fluence has been used to secure and retain positions. 
Probably but few school systems are entirely exempt 
from the operation of such influences. In order to be 
efficient, a school system should be kept free from all 
personal and partisan influences. (5) The actual con- 
tact and the moral and personal influences which 
teachers themselves exert in any community are usu- 
ally sufficient guarantee that they will receive justice 
at the hands of school officers and boards. No perma- 
nent or long guaranteed tenure of teachers is needed 
to protect teachers in this regard. On the contrary, 
drastic legislation is sometimes necessary and would 
be at times extremely useful in protecting children 
against incompetent teachers. 
Summary of laws affecting tenure.—Kandel, in 1920, 
summarized the laws of the various states as they 
affect teacher tenure. He said in part: ‘‘Whatever 
the customary practice may be, in law, security of ten- 
ure does not prevail over a large part of the country. 
While the towns and cities show a tendency to encour- 
age stability and permanence, even in many places of 
size the tenure of administrative officers is limited 
either by law or by the rules of the appointing boards. 
No matter how long a term may be provided, the 
teacher who feels that he must stand for election at 
the close of that term must inevitably be beset by 
anxiety, even though unconsciously. The demand for  
-P-A-G-E-374
$56 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
life-terms is just as unreasonable as the present 
practice. 
An examination of state school laws produces only 
“six cases in which terms longer than one year are per- 
mitted. In each case a probationary period of service 
varying from one to three years is required. In 
Arizona, superintendents and principals may be ap- 
pointed for two-year terms. In California, the prac- 
tice is that every teacher holds her position from year 
to year unless notice of dismissal is given before June 
10th. In Iowa, superintendents may be appointed for 
three-year terms after service of one year. School 
committees in Massachusetts may appoint teachers 
after one year of service, at pleasure. Superintend- 
ents and principals in Missouri are eligible after their 
first year to appointment for two-year terms. In Mon- 
tana, teachers hold their positions from year to year 
after their first year. In New Jersey, after three years 
of service a teacher is assured of her position during 
good behavior. In the cities of New York State, teach- 
ers may, after a probationary period of from one to 
three years, by a recent law, be appointed on per- 
manent tenure. Three-year terms without any period 
of probation are permitted in Ohio, while in Oregon 
teachers after a probationary period of two years 
enjoy permanent appointments, but this law applied 
in practice only to Portland. The Pennsylvania law 
grants three-year. terms to teachers who hold certifi- 
cates exempting them from further examinations. In 
Washington, only principals and superintendents may 
be appointed for longer than one-year terms. Finally, 
Wisconsin encourages teachers to retain their yosi-
-P-A-G-E-375
  HOW TO INCREASE TENURE 357 
tions by the grant of a bonus varying with the length 
of service. 
Thus, ,only five states—California, Massachusetts, 
Montana, New Jersey, and Oregon—by law recognize 
the principle of permanent tenure for teachers; and 
two other states, Ohio and Pennsylvania, permit the 
appointment of teachers for three-year terms. The 
conditions of appointment for principals and superin- 
tendents are only slightly better.’’ 
The underlying principle seems to be that: ‘‘Officers 
and employees of the public have no interest or prop- 
erty in the offices and situations which they occupy.’’ 
Interpreted in its lowest terms, this means thatthe 
» spoils system still prevails at this time when it has 
generally been eliminated from civil service positions 
in the country. Only upon this basis can one explain 
the regulation so frequently found in the laws that 
trustees may not appoint teachers beyond the terms of 
their own office. In many cases the law forbids the 
making of contracts for more than one year and even 
in providing for renewals, reappointments may be de- 
layed until June or July—the close of the school year. 
Other unreasonable conditions that are found are pro- 
visions that the teacher shall hold her position only 
as long as the money holds out or that she may be 
dismissed if the schoolhouse is destroyed or emptied 
by epidemics. Upon these terms no teacher can give 
efficient service. 
A typical city tenure regulation.—Detroit gives per- 
manent tenure to teachers who render satisfactory 
service. The rules read: ‘‘Hereafter teachers will 
be divided into two groups (1) probationary, and (2) 
 
-P-A-G-E-376
  358 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
regular. The probationary group consists of teachers 
who have been in service less than one year and such 
other teachers who are placed in this classification be- 
cause of unsatisfactory service. 
(a) All teachers in the service of the board of edu- 
cation for one year or more on September 1, 1920, who 
are now rendering satisfactory service shall be given 
a continuing contract for 1921-1922 and succeeding 
years, subject to cancellation for cause upon 30 days’ 
notice. 
(b) All teachers who have served less than one year 
and all teachers who are not rendering satisfactory 
service, shall be classified as probationary teachers. 
Regular teachers whose work is judged to be unsatis- 
factory shall be placed on the probationary list at the 
end of any semester. 
(c) At the end of a year of probationary service. 
1. A teacher whose service has been unsatis- 
factory shall be dropped. 
2. A teacher whose service is of doubtful 
merit may be continued as a probationary 
teacher a second year, but no teacher shall 
be given more than two years of trial as 
a probationary teacher. 
8. A teacher whose service has been satisfac- 
tory shall be given a continuing contract 
for the next and succeeding years. 
(d) There shall be no change in salary of any 
teacher during the fiscal year except that in case of 
promotion to another authorized position the schedule 
salary for said position may be paid from the date of 
such promotion.’?
-P-A-G-E-377
  HOW TO INCREASE TENURE 359 
The immediate results of this amended by-law was 
to give permanency of tenure to deserving teachers 
and to make possible a very careful selection of new 
teachers. The old contract could be terminated at the 
end of thirty days. Under the new arrangement a 
teacher was to be given a probationary period of one 
year in which to make good on deficiencies, with the 
full opportunity to return to regular standing. It 
should eventually result in higher professional stand- 
ards, better teachers, and better schools. 
Main points of the chapter.—l. Generally speaking, 
it is believed that the efficiency of a teacher increases 
with tenure up to an uncertain age. 
2. The present condition of high annual turnover 
and short tenure in a given position and in the pro- 
fession as a whole, together with the fact that a teacher 
with less than five years’ experience is rarely at her 
maximum efficiency, means that the schools lose from 
50 to 75 per cent of the efficiency attainable under a 
policy of continuous service. 
3. Present methods of measuring tenure are inac- 
curate. <A distinction should be made between tenure 
in a given position, tenure in the profession to date, 
and the total length of tenure of those leaving the 
profession. 
4. Great care should be exercised in separating fig- 
ures on turnover and figures on tenure. Tenure and 
turnover are two separate things and should be figured 
separately. 
5. The tenure of teachers in a given position is very 
short. The same is true of superintendents and 
principals.
-P-A-G-E-378
360 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
6. Tenure in the profession averages between six 
and ten years, depending upon the group studied. It 
is shortest for rural teachers and longest for high- 
school teachers. This suggests that increased training 
means increased age, increased life-career motives, 
and therefore increased professional stability. 
7. The advantages of long tenure are higher stand- 
ards of craftsmanship. 
8. The disadvantages are the possibly increased 
difficulties of weeding out incompetent teachers and of 
raising the academic and professional requirements 
of others. 
9. Tenure laws are still experimental in nature so 
far as the whole country is concerned. Only five states 
—California, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, 
and Oregon—recognize in law the principle of perma- 
nent tenure for teachers. An increasing number of 
the larger cities have permanent tenure rules adopted 
by the local board of education. The regulations for 
the city of Detroit are cited as a fair example of the 
best practices in large cities. 
PROBLEMS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
1. Miss B——, age 56, applies for a position. She has 
served faithfully and effectively in adjoining cities for over 
80 years. She is an A teacher and is moving in order to be 
at home. Would you hire her? Why? 
2. Compile figures to show a local board the probable loss 
in efficiency which the school system suffers due to the policy 
of annual elections and no or slight increases in salary. Re-

  CHAPTER XVIII 
HOW TEACHERS ORGANIZE AND WHY 
The beginning of teachers’ organizations——Should 
teachers organize? Yes, there can be no disagreement 
over the advisability of teachers organizing. The idea 
of teachers’ associations grew slowly in the American 
colonies. At first they were merely informal local 
gatherings to discuss ways and means of improving 
teaching and schools in general. In time these local 
gatherings became more or less permanent and loose 
organizations were formed which in turn led to the 
creation of state and, finally, national associations. 
State associations—The first state associations 
were organized in New York, Rhode Island, and 
Massachusetts in 1845. Within ten years associations 
were formed in 20 other states. Before 1900, all the 
states but Delaware had state associations and one 
has since been organized in Delaware. 
National associations.—In 1856 a call was issued by 
the presidents of ten state associations to teachers 
throughout the United States to assemble in Phila- 
delphia, on the 26th of August, 1857, for the purpose 
of organizing a National Teachers’ Association. The 
first meeting was attended by 41 men and 2 women 
representing 12 states and the District of Columbia. 
The following year. 67 additional men and 4 additional 
363
-P-A-G-E-382
  364 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
women were elected to membership. From such 
meager beginnings has grown the present association 
of nearly 150,000 members. 
Except for the years 1861, 1862, 1867, and 1878, 
meetings have been held annually. In 1870, an affilia- 
tion was affected with other associations of teachers 
and the present National Education Association or- 
ganized. The aim of the association as announced in 
1870 was: ‘‘To elevate the character and advance the 
interest of the profession of teaching, and promote 
the cause of popular education in the United States.’’ 
The earlier purposes of the National Education As- 
sociation.—The work of the National Education Asso- 
ciation since its inception has been entirely profes- 
sional. An analysis of its activities shows that it has 
interested itself in every conceivable phase of educa- 
tion, but it has never attempted to unionize or resort 
to tactics characteristic of unions. In fact, the domi- 
nant aims and interests have always been social and 
educational rather than political or economic. In this 
the association has followed the highest ideals of serv- 
ice and exhibited a splendid example of professional 
dignity. 
Until recently there was no connection between the 
local associations of teachers and the state associa- 
tions, or between the state associations and the na- 
tional. The local, state, and national associations 
were, and still are, practically independent of each 
other and predominantly social, educational, and in- 
spirational in aim. They included in their membership 
a relatively small per cent of the teaching population 
of the country, and but few of those who belonged
-P-A-G-E-383
HOW TEACHERS ORGANIZE AND WHY 365 
were active participants in the proceedings. There 
were few successful attempts at concerted action. The 
conception prevailed that each association should have 
an inspirational and instructional meeting once a year 
and that that was about all it could expect to accom- 
plish. Legislation, salaries, and better conditions of 
work were occasionally discussed and improvements in 
these matters promoted and, to some extent, accom- 
plished. But definite policies were rarely formulated 
or consistently pursued. They frequently expressed 
lofty ideals in resolutions and then proceeded ‘‘to neg- 
lect their offspring as the codfish neglects its eggs.’’ 
Their aspirations are as but ‘‘seeds sown on the rock 
or else fleecy summer clouds that are speedily dis- 
solved in thin air.’ They are frequently criticized 
as being little better than ‘‘structures of sand.’’ ‘‘Not 
so do strong social groups cherish their ideals and 
their policies.’’ 
The newer purposes of the National Education As- 
sociation.—The growing dissatisfaction with loose knit 
local, state, and national associations has resulted in 
the last ten years in a gradual change in the aims, 
purposes, and plans of these organizations. They are 
slowly growing in self-consciousness and are adopting 
definite policies that affect the status of the teacher 
economically as well as professionally. The annual 
meeting is becoming only one phase of the work of the 
association rather than the whole thing, as in the past. 
The reorganization of the National Education Asso- 
ciation illustrates the tendency. 
In the Declaration of Purpose, adopted in 1919, the 
object of the association is reiterated but amplified
-P-A-G-E-384
  
  366 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
by the following statement: ‘‘To accomplish this ob- 
ject (ie. to elevate the character and advance the in- 
terests of the profession of teaching and to promote 
the cause of education in the United States), it is 
imperative that the public shall give generous sup- 
port to public education in order that men and women 
of the highest character and scholarship shall be at- 
tracted to the profession of teaching as a career, and 
that the highest professional standards shall be de- 
veloped and maintained and the most efficient service 
rendered by those engaged in the teaching profession. 
The association will, therefore, exert all its influ- 
ence through its officers, its committees, its publica- 
tions, and its official staff to the accomplishment of the 
following objects: (1) To secure the enactment of such 
state and federal legislation as will give proper recog- 
nition and support to public education and provide 
adequate compensation for teachers; and (2) to estab- 
lish and maintain such educational standards with 
respect to the training and qualifications of teachers, 
length of school term, compulsory attendance, sanitary 
buildings, modern equipment, and organization for the 
elimination of all class distinction and privilege, and 
the most improved educational policies and methods 
attainable through the continued investigation and 
study of educational problems, in order that public 
education shall make the largest possible contribu- 
tion to the welfare of the community, the state, and 
the nation.’’ 
Instead of considering that such things as cam- 
paigns for higher salaries, improved tenure, old age 
annuities, pensions for teachers, fuller participation

of teachers in the administration and management of 
school systems, the employment of field secretaries, 
lobbying for better legislation, the creation of a na- 
tional department of education with a representative 
in the president’s cabinet, research work, and other 
like measures are outside of the province of the asso- 
ciation, it is now giving a great deal of time and finan- 
cial support to these matters. 
State associations also reorganizing—The state 
teachers’ associations, notably in California, Iowa, 
Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, and Missouri, 
have changed their organization to a representative 
basis, published a paper, employed a full time secre- 
tary, supported a lobby for educational legislation, 
and in other ways more aggressively represented the 
needs of the profession. Moreover, there is a strong 
sentiment in many places to have the local, city, and 
county associations affiliate with the state organiza- 
tion. The Washington State League of Teachers says: 
“‘We favor the county organization of teachers as or- 
ganized units of the Washington Education Associa- 
tion and the National Education Association.’? The 
Educational Council of the State Teachers’ Associa- 
tion of Colorado recently adopted a resolution which 
reads: ‘‘The teachers of America should be associated 
in a national association with the state associations 
as units of the national associations, with local asso- 
ciations throughout the various state members of the 
state association; that each of these units should keep 
itself free, unencumbered, and unattached, in order 
that, by the independence of its position, it may lay 
its program for the benefit of public education before

  368 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE. TEACHING STAFF 
any and all organizations which ought to join with it 
in improving educational conditions.’’ 
The history thus briefly cited of teachers’ organiza- 
tions answers beyond a doubt the question, ‘‘Should 
teachers organize?’’ Quoting from Sneeden, we all 
instantly agree, ‘‘Teachers should organize—organize 
purposefully, resolutely, and effectively. They should 
organize first of all to promote those educational in- 
terests which in the long run mean most to the state 
and to society. They should organize to promote the 
interests of their own profession—wherever and how- 
ever these interests do not clash with the larger inter- 
ests of society. Self-help of a kind that does not lead 
to war and destruction must be organized but must be 
so organized that the good of all the strong, the de- 
serving, the worthy, shall be subserved thereby.’’ 
Should teachers unionize?—The second question is :— 
Should teachers unionize? Dissatisfaction with the 
usual teachers’ organization became marked just at 
the close of the 19th century. In Chicago, in 1897, it 
took the form of a new organization known as the 
Chicago Teachers’ Federation, to membership in which 
only classroom teachers were admitted. The new or- 
ganization immediately began action for increased 
salaries. In 1902, the agitation resulted in increases 
in taxes upon certain corporations and slight increases 
in salaries. On October 16, 1902, while the above agi- 
tation was going on, the federation received a letter 
from the Chicago Federation of Labor inviting them 
to affiliate. This raised an important question, in fact 
it was the biggest question that had ever come before 
the federation. Finally, after a debate lasting nearly
-P-A-G-E-387
  
HOW TEACHERS ORGANIZE AND WHY 369 
two years, the Chicago Teachers’ Federation decided 
to enter the Chicago Federation of Labor. The rea- 
sons given were: ‘‘Because they could, by so doing, 
utilize practically the hitherto ineffective support of 
public opinion without being obliged to commit them- 
selves to any policy in conflict with the one they had 
already adopted.’’ 
In September, 1902, the Public School Teachers’ 
Association of San Antonio, Texas, affiliated with the 
American Federation of Labor. At least nine local 
associations of classroom teachers in various parts 
of the country affiliated in the period 1902 to 1910. 
By 1910, the experiment had, for one reason or an- 
other, proved a failure and all had abandoned their 
affiliation except the association at San Antonio. The 
early labor union movement among teachers failed 
because teachers who were active in the movement 
came to believe that the affiliation could not succeed. 
The public was opposed to the idea and suspicious of 
its purpose. Many teachers likewise questioned the 
desirability of affiliation with the American Federa- 
tion of Labor or any other group organization. They 
argued that the American Medical Association, the 
American Bar Association and similar professional 
organizations had not affiliated and did not contem- 
plate doing so. Furthermore, local associations of 
teachers were too weak to do much alone. Therefore, 
the idea grew in the minds of those who believed in a 
union that a new national association of teachers was 
necessary. 
The American Federation of Teachers.—In 1916, the 
various federations of teachers in Chicago and vicinity 
 
-P-A-G-E-388
  370 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
issued a call for the formation of a national organiza- 
tion which resulted in the organization, April 15, 1916, 
of the American Federation of Teachers. To this fed- 
eration a charter of affiliation was granted by the 
American Federation of Labor May 9, 1916. At the 
time of organization there were only eight locals with 
a membership of 2,800 teachers. By April 1, 1920, a 
total of 169 locals with a membership of over 15,000 
had affiliated. Later, the Chicago Teachers’ Federa- 
tion withdrew from the American Federation of 
Teachers and is no longer affiliated with labor unions. 
Purpose of new organization.—The reader will at 
once ask: ‘‘Why was a new organization created? 
Why not work through the National Education Asso- 
ciation?’’? The real answer is because the National 
Education Association would not affiliate with the 
American Federation of Labor or any other body, and 
the ring leaders of the new organization believed that 
affiliation with the American Federation was essential 
for the accomplishment of its purposes. Their argu- 
ments were as follows: 
‘“‘A national organization of teachers, consolidated 
for protection and service and backed by organized 
labor will command the attention and deserve the re- 
spect of political parties, of capital, and the public. 
With the great mass of teachers joining the movement, 
it will have members in every community who could 
influence every family in the land. It is bound to be 
a potent agent for the promotion and guidance of 
public opinion. Upon its members, who necessarily 
would do much to mould the political thought and 
develop the economic efficiency of each succeeding gen-
-P-A-G-E-389
HOW TEACHERS ORGANIZE AND WHY 371 
eration of citizens, will depend to a great extent the 
future of the republic. ... 
“The American Federation of Teachers offers the 
opportunity for effective organization, nation-wide. 
It came as a result of years of experience on the part 
of the teachers in a dozen cities throughout the coun- 
try. They found themselves unable to combat with 
success the well organized influences inimical to the 
best interests of public education. The professional 
organizations and the wealthy class never offered their 
support, or treated the teachers as being of their num- 
ber. The laboring class recognized the teachers as be- 
ing human beings, doing a necessary part of the 
world’s work, and offered to support their demands 
for higher wages and better working conditions.’’ 
So it is ‘‘That teachers—who have not had to live 
by their hands and suffer the privations and difficul- 
ties of many of the members of the trade unions— 
have found it necessary in the time of need and ex- 
tremity to turn for active support, not to manufac- 
turers’, bankers’, lawyers’ associations and other so- 
called respectable elements of the community, but have 
had to turn to these bodies of organized labor.’’ 
The American Federation of Teachers at its annual 
convention January 1, 1920, offered the following pro- 
posals to the accomplishment of which the support of 
the convention was pledged: 
‘1. That there be established a minimum salary of 
$2,000 for teachers. 
2. That there be teacher-members of all boards of 
education, because none other has the first-hand knowl- 
edge of the needs of the pupils and of the teachers.
-P-A-G-E-390
  372 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
3. That there be a council of teachers in each town 
or city elected by the body of the teachers with legally 
recognized right to initiate and participate in the de- 
termination of policies. 
4. That there be a teachers’ council in each school. 
5. That the school become in spirit and actuality a 
part of the community through codperation with civic 
organizations, wider use of the school plant, and such 
modifications in the curriculum as to include the 
earlier introduction of instruction in industrial his- 
tory, civics, economics, and American history. 
6. That high standards be maintained in all normal 
and other training schools for teachers, and that all 
appointments of teachers be made probationary for 
not more than three years so that efficiency may be 
guaranteed.’’ 
The convention also included the following resolu- 
tion in regard to teachers’ tenure of office: ‘‘That this 
organization, through its affiliation with labor, use 
every effort to secure laws granting tenure of office 
along the following lines: (a) After a reasonable pro- 
bation period, permanent tenure during efficiency. (b) 
All dismissals both during and after probation to be 
for causes definitely embodied in the educational law 
such as gross insubordination, inefficiency, conduct un- 
becoming a teacher, ete. (c) After a period of proba- 
tion, dismissal for any cause, including inefficiency, to 
be only by a trial board, of seven chosen as follows: 
Three by the school board, three by the teachers, the 
six to elect a seventh who is not to be either a mem- 
ber of the school board or of the teaching force. 
At all hearings teachers shall be represented by
-P-A-G-E-391
  
HOW TEACHERS ORGANIZE AND WHY 373 
counsel. Appeal from the decision of the trial board 
may be made to the civil courts whose decision shall 
be final.’’ 
Objections to affiliations with labor unions.—Dean 
James Hj. Russell voices the opinion of the great ma- 
jority of American teachers against offensive and de- 
fensive alliances as follows: ‘‘The organization of 
teachers should codperate with every other group of 
citizens for the public good, but should avoid entan- 
gling alliances with anyone. The teacher occupies a 
peculiar position in the body politic. He instructs chil- 
dren in the rights and duties of citizens. His wards 
of today become the voters of tomorrow. Some of 
them will be found in every group, sect, party, and 
organization that exists in the community. He should 
teach them the fundamental principles of American 
life and help them to make wise choices in their affilia- 
tions, but he may not proselytize or conduct propa- 
ganda for any cause on which citizens are divided. A 
decent respect for the opinions of others must char- 
acterize all that he does. The organization, therefore, 
that acts as the super-teacher cannot favor either Jew 
or Gentile, Republican or Democrat, capitalist or la- 
borer. ‘Friends of all, but allies of none’ must be the 
slogan of a teachers’ organization.’’ 
The people to whom the school system belongs are 
mainly not members of labor unions. There are about 
4 million out of 110 million population who are mem- 
bers of labor unions. Instead of organizing teachers 
for democracy, affiliation of this character forms them 
into a special class. The same argument may be used 
as forcefully for teachers to affiliate with the Manufac- 
 
-P-A-G-E-392
374 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
turers Association, the Bar Association, the Christian 
Associations or even political parties. 
Summary of arguments on unionizations—Follow- 
ing is a summary of the main arguments pro and con 
that have been used in discussing the merits of the 
question: ‘‘Should teachers unionize and affiliate with 
a special group or groups?’’ 
AFFIRMATIVE ARGUMENTS 
Teachers’ organizations should af- 
filiate with A. F. of L. because: 
1. It will draw classroom teach- 
ers into a closer brotherhood. 
2. It will give needed publicity 
to the people regarding the schools. 
3, It will gain improved finan- 
cial support for teachers. 
4, It will make the classroom 
teacher the real factor in educa- 
tion that he should be. 
5. It will secure better pay for 
teachers. 
6. It will promote the adoption 
of local, state, and national legis- 
lation to advance the efficiency of 
education, 
7. It will increase the value of 
schools to the people. 
8. It will inform teachers of 
their community of interest in the 
main problems of society and im- 
prove the standards of qualifica- 
tions for teaching. Neqative ARGUMENTS 
Teachers’ organizations should not 
affiliate with A. F. of L. be- 
cause : 
1. Teachers are the employees 
of all classes and should not take 
sides. 
2. It will take the spirit of 
service out of teaching and put it 
on the basis of commercialism. 
3. It means that teachers will 
become subservient to a strong 
class organization rather than a 
free professional group. 
4. It will take away the profes- 
sional attitude of teachers and 
give them the attitude of day la- 
borers or wage-earners. 
5. It will align other groups 
against teachers. 
6. As administrative and super- 
visory officers are not allowed to 
affiliate, it would bring about an 
unealled for division between 
executives and classroom teachers 
and so lead to disloyalty on the 
part of teachers and considerable 
friction. It would cut the head 
off from the body. 
7. As members of A. F. of L. 
teachers would be used as ‘‘cat’s- 
paws’? to give each generation 
biased training in the so-called 
fight of Labor vs. Capital. 
8. Teachers would suffer as ac- 
complices in whatever the A. F. of 
L. undertook in other fields, how- 
ever radical those things might 
be. 
 
-P-A-G-E-393
HOW TEACHERS ORGANIZE AND WHY 
AFFIRMATIVE ARGUMENTS 
(Continued) 
9. It will strive to secure for 
teachers their due weight in de- 
termining educational policies 
through teachers’ councils, teach- 
ers’ representation on boards of 
education, on municipal councils, 
and in legislatures. 
10. Affiliation with A. F. of L. 
will make for ‘‘ Democracy in Edu- 
cation.’’ 
  375 
NEGATIVE ARGUMENTS 
(Continued) 
9. To affiliate with this organ- 
ization will mean that teachers 
have to face problems of strikes, 
collective bargaining, and standard 
rates. 
10. Teachers will be accused of 
being biased and their teaching of 
labor problems will be discounted. 
11. The A. F. of L. is better 
able to develop in the teaching 
group as a whole, the qualities 
needed for resistance to repression 
in the freedom of teaching. 
Naturally, opposition to unionization developed in 
many places. The following examples illustrate this. 
“The objects of the constitution of your Teachers’ 
Union are: (1) To provide means for the legal pro- 
tection of teachers’ interests; (2) to protect teachers 
against oppressive supervision; (3) to increase the 
efficiency of the schools in democratic education; and 
(4) to obtain equal suffrage among men and women. 
All of these objects are amply provided for under the 
constitution and laws of our state. We resent the 
efforts of any class organization to control or in any 
way to interfere with the administration of the public 
schools of this district in their own individual inter- 
ests, except in the manner provided by law.’’ 
In Los Angeles, the board of education voted unani- 
mously that: ‘‘All propaganda for the formation of 
a union among the teachers must cease, and that all 
teachers now members of the American Federation of 
Labor must cancel their membership or resign.’’ Many 
such instances might be cited. Apparently, neither 
the teachers nor the public are looking with favor upon
-P-A-G-E-394
  876 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
the unionization idea when accompanied by afiiliations 
with labor unions. In Detroit, two locals of the Ameri- 
can Federation of Teachers were voluntarily dissolved 
by the union teachers themselves, and a new associa- 
tion independent of the American Federation of Labor 
was formed to replace them. The president of the 
association said in explanation: ‘‘It was felt that 
teachers could not afford to sacrifice their professional- 
ism and non-partisan position for the sake of labor’s 
support in their campaign for higher salaries. The 
need of a thorough democratic organization which 
would provide a forum for the discussion of school af- 
fairs and seek to raise the professional standard of 
teachers is greater, the teachers thought, than the 
necessity for a labor union.’’? The Boston policeman’s 
strike drove home to many teachers the difference be- 
tween public service and industrial wage earning. 
Unionization may be ‘‘a good servant but it is also 
a bad master.’’ This question has not yet affected 
many school systems outside of the larger cities. Nor 
is it a settled question. The facts and arguments on 
both sides speak for themselves. The two outstanding 
features of the American Federation of Teachers are 
that it is composed of classroom teachers and that it 
was originally and is still affiliated with the American 
Federation of Labor. Both of these features have 
their serious objections. The first tends to create a 
false division of interests. Superintendents, super- 
visors, and principals work hard and long in the in- 
terest of the classroom teacher. They were once class- 
room teachers themselves. Their efforts are fre- 
quently misconstrued and falsified by short sighted
-P-A-G-E-395

agitators who think the executive officers have more 
power which they may not have. Nothing is gained 
by classroom teachers fighting their supervisors. Co- 
operation is the keynote to real success in all labor 
problems. 
The affiliation of teachers with union labor has 
affected the attitude of the public in most places ad- 
versely. Has it increased or lowered the morale of 
the teaching force? There is little or nothing to show 
that the affiliation with labor has had any influence on 
the results except in a few local instances. 
The present-day tendency.—Today it appears that 
the older educational associations have adopted prac- 
tically all the good points of the new organizations and 
bid fair to become dominant influence in all educational 
matters. The union idea is still on trial. But the 
National Education Association and its affiliated state 
and local associations have the field and seem to be 
increasingly sensitive of their responsibilities and 
privileges. 
Main points of the chapter—1l. Should teachers 
organize? The history of education answers this ques- 
tion in the affirmative. Local, state, and national asso- 
ciations of a professional character were established 
early in our national history and have gradually grown 
to large proportions. 
2. Among them, the National Education Association 
is preéminent. Its earlier purposes were social, edu- 
cational, and professional. It exercised little directive 
influence. It was more or less justly called a ‘‘struc- 
ture of sand.’’ 
3. Of late, the National Education Association has  
-P-A-G-E-396
  378 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF K 
taken on new vigor and through affiliations with State 
and local associations has a membership of nearly 
150,000—the largest professional association in the 
world. 
4. Dissatisfaction with the impotence of profes- 
sional associations led, about 1900, to the raising of the 
questions: ‘‘Should teachers unionize? Should they 
form an offensive and defensive affiliation with non- 
educational organizations, particularly with the Ameri- 
can Federation of Labor?’’ 
5. Local efforts from 1900 to 1910 to unionize and 
affiliate with the American Federation of Labor for 
the most part failed. 
6. With the coming of the World War these efforts 
resulted in the organization, in 1916, of the American 
Federation of Teachers. 
7. The purpose of this new organization was to se- 
cure the backing of labor unions for campaigns for 
educational betterment, especially in behalf of teachers. 
8. The program of the American Federation of 
Teachers adopted in 1919, called for (1) a minimum 
wage of $2,000; (2) teacher-members on all boards of 
education; (3) teachers’ councils in each community 
with power to participate in policies; (4) teachers’ 
councils in each school; (5) wider use of the school in 
the socialization of the population; (6) higher profes- 
sional standards and greater support for teacher train- 
ing institutions; (7) permanent tenure during efficiency 
after a brief probationary period; (8) trial before dis- 
missal by a representative board with teachers sitting 
on the board; and (9) appeal from the decision of the 
board to the civil courts.
-P-A-G-E-397
HOW TEACHERS ORGANIZE AND WHY 379 
9. A storm of objections was immediately raised, 
not against the unionization of teachers, but against 
the affiliation of teachers’ unions with non-educational 
organizations. 
10. The general conclusion seems to be that the 
newer and more broadly conceived functions of the 
National Education Association with its consequent 
increased strength makes a union unnecessary. 
PROBLEMS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
1. The superintendent is anxious to have his school system 
100 per cent so far as membership in the State and the 
National Education Associations are concerned. He decides 
to address all of his teachers on this subject urging them, 
for their own good, to become members. What arguments 
should he use? 
2. A teacher of long tenure says that she will not join 
either the local, state, or national association. The principal 
urges her do so and reports her to the superintendent as the 
only teacher in the building who is not a member, thus keep- 
ing the building from becoming 100 per cent. The superin- 
tendent knows that he has no right to require anyone to 
belong to anything. Nevertheless, he calls the teacher in and 
after quietly calling her attention to the unpleasantness re- 
sulting from her absolute refusal to join, the superintendent 
says she must join and be one with the rest or he will regard 
her as unprofessional. Is the superintendent justified in 
doing this? How should he handle such cases? 
8. The local board passes a resolution stating that any 
teacher who accepts a contract with the board must not be a 
member of a union. Is such a position justifiable? 
4. What are the distinguishable differences between 
teachers’ unions in America and in Europe? 
5. Debate each of the six planks in the program of the 
American Federation of Teachers for 1920. (See p. 371.) 
6. Define your own position on this question and be pre- 
pared to state your arguments clearly and concisely.

CHAPTER XIX 
HOW TEACHERS’ COUNCILS WORK 
Reasons for teachers’ councils.—The growth of self- 
consciousness among classroom teachers has led them, 
as we saw in the last chapter, to organize, and some 
of the bolder and more discontented spirits even to 
unionize and affiliate with the American Federation of 
Labor. The reaction that followed this attempt re- 
sulted in the rapid growth of teachers’ councils, espe- 
cially in city school systems. Probably the idea of 
teachers’ councils was first developed in England and 
France. But the idea in American education was in- 
evitable.. Our school systems grew very rapidly with 
the urbanization of our population. Consequently, 
division of labor took place and the individual came to 
feel himself more and more a mere cog in a great 
machine. 
Somehow, as a result of this, the notion has taken 
root that the schools are undemocratic in their organ- 
ization and management. The writer’s study and ex- 
perience does not bear out this conclusion. Neverthe- 
less, he realizes that the notion is prevalent, not only 
among classroom teachers, but also among ‘‘uplifters’’ 
who view the schools as outsiders. Even the typical 
classroom teacher is called an autocrat, the Autocrat 
of the Classroom. The writer honestly believes that 
381
-P-A-G-E-400
  382 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
the American school systems allow the classroom 
teacher more personal and professional freedom, in 
the matter of method, course of study, organization 
and participation in management, than the systems of 
any other country in the world. Perhaps we can and 
should have more freedom. It is insistently demanded 
by some that more is needed. All fair minded admin- 
istrative and executive officers and teachers will do 
their best to lift the stigma of the accusation that they 
are autocrats and do not desire the best democratic 
organization possible. 
The growth of teachers’ councils——Dallas, Texas, 
was among the first cities to adopt a teachers’ council. 
The board of education, in a resolution adopted in 
1909, asked that a Teachers’ Advisory Council be or- 
ganized composed of one person from each grade, two 
principals elected by the principals and one elected 
by the board. The high-school faculty was also repre- 
sented. Boston followed. It is significant that both 
of these councils were initiated by the superintendents. 
Sears gives the description contained in Table XXI of 
typical teachers’ councils. Sears sent an inquiry to 
268 superintendents asking for a copy of the constitu- 
tion and plan of organization together with certain 
facts about the origin, powers, plans of procedure, 
and achievements of any teachers’ organization. The 
purpose of which was to participate in the administra- 
tion of the schools. Usable replies were received from 
131 of these cities. Of these replies 46 reported that 
no such teachers’ organization existed, while 85 re- 
ported one or more teachers’ organizations, 70 of 
which are participating in the administration of the
-P-A-G-E-401
HOW TEACHERS’ COUNCILS WORK 383 
schools. It is believed that the documents and the 
facts contained in the replies are fully representative 
and afford a fair picture of the present status of this 
movement in the United States. 
The variety of names.—Organizations within the 
school system, attempting to represent the teaching 
staff and to exercise some influence over the general 
policy of the school system, bear a great variety of 
names, According to Sears they are variously called 
teachers’ councils, teachers’ clubs, teachers’ advisory 
councils, advisory council, superintendent’s advisory 
council, the academic council, teachers’ economic coun- 
cil, teachers’ association, the school council, and the 
high school or grade school teachers’ council. Occa- 
sionally the word ‘‘guild’’ and ‘‘union’’ are used. It 
appears that there is not a great deal in the name. 
They are all organized chiefly with the purpose of par- 
ticipating in the administration in order to promote 
the welfare of the teaching staff and to advance educa- 
tion in general. Obviously, many of them are older 
organizations parading under a new name with en- 
larged ideas of their function and importance. In 
many places where no organization exists the super- 
intendent and the teaching staff are codperating in 
the fullest way for the good of all. It is certain that 
in many cities an organized council could not improve 
much upon the present relationship between teachers 
and executive officers nor add much to the facilities 
for teacher participation in administration. 
By whom are teachers’ councils organized?—A study 
of the replies received by Sears, Ortman, Updegraff 
and others indicate that in nine cases out of ten, teach-

ers’ councils are voluntarily suggested and initiated 
by the superintendent of schools and his immediate 
staff of supervisory officers. Superintendents have 
always used committees of teachers for various pur- 
poses. The organization of a council has, in a sense, 
grown out of this practice. In only two or three in- 
stances do superintendents express doubt as to the 
possible value of a teachers’ council and then it is 
usually due to the unfortunate militant or prejudiced 
leadership that happens to have seized the temporary 
control of the council. Teachers’ councils have been 
known in a few instances to use very unprofessional 
tacties to accomplish very selfish and unprofessional 
desires. No organization is perfect and mistakes are 
just as likely to be made on the part of teachers as on 
the part of executive officers. In many instances, 
where the superintendent is working through commit- 
tees, doubt is expressed by the teachers themselves as 
to whether as successful work can be done through a 
formal organization as through informal committees. 
The basis of council representation.—A study of the 
brief data contained in Table XXI shows very clearly 
that the basis of representation is far from uniform. 
New York City has a council of 45 who represent some 
23,000 teachers, while Birmingham, Alabama, has a 
council of 40 representing 850 teachers. Such varia- 
tions raise the question of what should be the basis 
for determining the size of the council. There is no 
accepted basis. The dangers of getting a council so 
large that it will not form a good working group, or 
so small that it will not be representative of all, are 
obvious. It is difficult to say which is the more impor- 
 
-P-A-G-E-405
HOW TEACHERS’ COUNCILS WORK 387 
tant of these two criteria for determining size, 
though it is obvious that each has received attention 
and that opinions differ widely. 
Sears says: ‘‘If one of the functions of a teachers’ 
council is to convert a disorganized group of separate 
workers into a well codrdinated staff, and that cer- 
tainly should be one of its functions, then the question 
of representation in the council is of importance. In 
some cases the membership of the council is made up 
of representatives from the various independent 
teachers’ organizations in the city, sometimes the 
presidents of the organization serving ew efficio and 
sometimes the members being elected by vote. Again, 
teacher groups, such as kindergarten, junior high 
school, grade principals, etc., are used as the basis. In 
some cities representation is by schools, in others by 
grades, in others various combinations of these forms 
exist. In the majority, the principals, and in many the 
superintendents are represented in the council. Elec- 
tive, rather than ex efficio or appointive membership 
seems to predominate, as it most certainly should if 
the council is to be representative or to be a real co- 
ordinating force in the system. Evidently this is a 
point in the development of councils which, together 
with size, needs to be thoroughly studied. It would 
seem that a council composed of members who repre- 
sent a number of teachers’ clubs, some social and 
others permanent would, if they really represented 
their constituents, be less in harmony and so less effec- 
tive as a working organization than would be the case 
where the actual school work is the basis. So much 
depends, too, upon the personal and professional 
 
-P-A-G-E-406
  $88 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
makeup of the council that nothing short of experi- 
mentation will find the best solution.’’ 
What do teachers’ councils do?—The purposes of 
a council established at New Britain, Connecticut, 1910, 
were stated as follows: ‘‘(1) to furnish the teaching 
body a definite and organized means for conference 
with the school committee for the expression of its 
sentiments and judgments; (2) to encourage profes- 
sional improvement among teachers; (3) to develop a 
sense of solidarity among teachers; (4) to afford the 
largest opportunities of initiation on part of teachers.’’ 
Some councils are almost purely local in their 
interests, while others pay practically no attention to 
local problems and work with state associations for 
desired school legislation. The work of most or- 
ganizations of this type may be summarized as fol- 
lows: (1) Build up the morale of the teaching staff 
through lecture and social activities. (2) Create a 
better understanding between teachers and adminis- 
trative officers. (3) Work on courses of study and 
selection of books. (4) Work for desired state legisla- 
tion. (5) Promote a better and a higher salary sched- 
ule and other matters affecting the status of the 
teacher. (6) Act as a cabinet for the superintendent. 
The above are typical but do not exhaust the list. 
Teacher participation is a settled fact. The question 
is: How best may teacher participation be carried 
out? Obviously, nothing succeeds with poor leader- 
ship. The teachers should pick their officers and coun- 
cilmen with great care. The movement should not be 
hampered, as it is in some places, by falling into the 
hands of disgruntled and radical teachers who feel
-P-A-G-E-407
HOW TEACHERS’ COUNCILS WORK 389 
sure that they, and all other teachers, are being ground 
down by an oppressive system. There are apt to be 
dangerous radicals in every large teaching staff. These 
people seek power and frequently get it. They in- 
variably abuse their power, using it to accomplish sel- 
fish purposes and freely resort to methods which they 
themselves vigorously condemn in the others. Good 
leadership is the first necessity. No organization in 
the long run is better than its leadership. As Pope 
says: 
“For forms of government, let fools contest, 
That which is best administered is best.’’ 
An unsolved problem.—The success of teachers’ 
councils is not being hampered by superintendents so 
much as by ignorant and vicious leadership on the part 
of teachers. Teachers are too frequently assuming 
that their superiors are not in sympathy with their 
aspirations. Assumptions of this kind lead to mis- 
understandings and antagonisms. They forget that 
all supervisory and administrative officers were orig- 
inally classroom teachers and therefore know the prob- 
lems from two viewpoints instead of one. As Sears 
says: ‘‘The teachers have sought this opportunity to 
broaden their service. They must not overlook the 
fact that they are assuming an obligation, failure to 
carry out which the public would be slow to excuse. 
This movement means a change in the social as well as 
professional status of the American teacher if it suc- 
ceeds, and a distinct modification of the superinten- 
dency. My study of the movement has convinced me 
that the number of extremists is inverse in ratio to the
-P-A-G-E-408
  390 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
noise they are making, that the idea is thoroughly 
sound, and that the vast majority of teachers and ad- 
ministrators are studiously concerned about it. While 
the study does not suggest any diminution of the execu- 
tive authority of the superintendent, it does clearly 
suggest that in very many cases that authority should 
act more largely than it has in the past in terms of 
staff service rendered by teachers. That teacher par- 
ticipation should be permanently limited solely to staff 
service, seems to the writer doubtful. The most natu- 
ral line of cleavage between the teaching and the ad- 
ministrative functions, a line which in the nature of 
things must not remain permanently fixed, can be 
found, however, only by careful study and experiment. 
The necessary experiment is now under way, as above 
described, and deserves our most serious study.’’ 
A typical Constitution and By-Laws of a Teachers’ 
Club.—The writer has selected the following constitu- 
tion from over a hundred examined as typical of the 
great majority. It may serve as a guide to those who 
desire to create such an organization and it may also 
shed light upon other matters not covered in this 
chapter.

What teachers’ councils are doing. —Teachers’ coun- 
cils are everywhere interesting themselves in problems 
pertaining to the welfare of both the children and the 
teaching profession. It is impossible to list all of the 
problems, but the following are suggestive: Parent- 
teachers’ activities, go-to-school week, better English, 
free concerts and entertainments, health and safety 
teaching, community civics and Americanization, pub- 
lic school publicity, music contests, public speaking, 
salary schedules for teachers, principals, and other 
school employees, teacher rating schemes, codes of 
professional ethics, the promotion of junior high 
schools and special education, scientific testing of both 
intelligence and educational achievements, teachers’ 
pensions, sick, health, and accident insurance, retire- 
ment laws, promotion of extension education such as 
night schools, ete., professional study, travel, corre- 
spondence and extension classes with financial recogni- 
tion of the same, individual instruction, visual educa- 
tion, vocational and industrial education, playground 
improvements, charities, welfare work both within and 
without the profession, programs for the beautifying 
of classrooms and school buildings, vocational and edu- 
cational guidance for students, teacher representation 
in the administration of schools, ete.

  HOW TEACHERS’ COUNCILS WORK 395 
Main points of the chapter.—1. Beginning about 1909, 
local organizations have been formed in most of the 
larger cities of the United States composed chiefly of 
classroom teachers. The chief purpose of such organ- 
izations is to further the participation of classroom 
teachers in the administration of the school system. 
2. These organizations are usually entirely local 
and bear a great variety of names. They are for the 
most part promoted by the superintendent of schools 
in order to codrdinate the efforts of all for the good 
of all. 
3. The basis of representation in these councils vary 
widely. There is no standard. 
4. Teachers councils when properly led are a con- 
structive force and not only initiate many excellent 
measures but also aid the administration in the pro- 
motion of other measures that might otherwise fail. 
5. The constitution and by-laws of the Highland 
Park (Michigan) Teachers Club is an excellent model 
to follow. 
6. Teachers’ councils interest themselves in prac- 
tically every problem that has to do with the welfare 
of children and the welfare of the teaching profession. 
PROBLEMS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
1. The teachers at X feel that the superintendent is 
too autocratic and arbitrary. From time to time he issues 
orders that are later countermanded. The teachers lose con- 
fidence in his leadership. The superintendent finally realizes 
this and decides that he has been wrong in his method of 
cooperation. He attempts to formulate a better plan of pro- 
cedure. What should he do?  
-P-A-G-E-414
  396 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
2. The superintendent at X- has for years been a 
figure-head. He spends all his time going about shaking hands 
and praising the teachers in high terms for practically every- 
thing they do. Naturally they like him, but the board feels 
that he is just a good fellow. He lets the teachers run every- 
thing including the superintendent. The board’s estimate is 
probably correct. What should they do? Why? 
3. The Teachers’ Club at Y- is dominated by a small 
group of old teachers who are home products and who got 
into the school system years ago by politics of the ‘‘spoils’’ 
type and have maintained themselves ever since despite all 
efforts to the contrary. Superintendent Z is hired with 
the understanding that he is to run the schools. The officers 
of the Teachers’ Club oppose his election openly on the 
ground that he is not in sympathy with the aims of their 
club. Nevertheless, he is elected. He immediately begins to 
act independently and opposition to him is aroused. The 
board supports him and he proceeds to reorganize the 
Teachers’ Club in such a way that it is no longer run by a 
clique. Are such situations common? 
4, What is the ideal basis for representation on a teachers’ 
council and why? 
5. Debate the value of a teacher member of a board of 
education. Is it necessary? Valuable? To whom? Why.? 
6. Why have teachers’ councils been organized by superin- 
tendents? 
7. Should school officers leave teachers’ councils alone? 
That is, should they ignore them, or attempt to codperate 
with them, or run them? Why?

CHAPTER XX 
THE TEACHER’S HEALTH, RECREATION AND LEISURE 
Importance of health and leisure.—Health and leisure 
are two of the cardinal objectives of modern educa- 
tion. Teachers especially should be living examples of 
good health. It can be shown scientifically that to an 
extent at least, intelligence, social, and moral integrity 
depend upon the level of vitality that is maintained by 
the individual. Only a few people out of a thousand 
work and play vigorously. Most people are under- 
vitalized. They could do twice as much and feel twice 
as well if they maintained a higher level of vitality. 
“Tt makes a large difference whether the level of 
vitality is maintained at fifty per cent of potential, or 
at one hundred per cent. The vocational demand for 
efficiency, when reduced to specifics, is a demand for 
forcefulness, for accuracy, for speed, for endurance, 
and for consistency or uniformity of work. These are 
all fruits of a full vitality—The devitalized individual 
is nervous, incodrdinate, uncertain in his movements 
and inhibitions. The range of his mental life is nar- 
rowed. He does not see so many things at one time, 
and his failure to observe all of the things related to 
his work involves him in mistakes and accidents.—The 
physical condition of an individual or of a nation is 
intimately related to the moral and civic character.—

  400 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
For the man of very low vitality (possesses) little 
power to hold many things in mind at once that are 
needed for seeing complex social relations. As a con- 
sequence, he is morally incapacitated. He misses the 
road, largely because he cannot see where it lies. He 
falls upon the guidance of instinct, passion, and other 
crude impulsions.’? + 
“Throughout the centuries,’’ says Curtis, ‘‘man has 
been dreaming of the time when he should be emanci- 
pated from continuous toil. The teacher already has 
this gift of leisure toward which the world has so 
long aspired. She has absolutely ample time for 
recreation; and teaching with its intimate contact with 
children and its opportunity for service, might well 
become the ideal life toward which the privileged 
classes would aspire. It should keep the teachers in 
perfect health, should cause her to increase up to full 
maturity in physical strength and vigor and in the 
beauty which comes with health and vitality.’’ 2 
Teachers neglect health and leisure—Yet teachers 
as a class are not healthy. According to Dr. Wood, 
“«31 per cent are not sufficiently vigorous to meet suc- 
cessfully the continuous strain to which teachers are 
subject.’’—Supervisors report that 16.3 per cent of 
teachers are nervous, 11 per cent are irritable, 9.2 per 
cent are low in vitality, 3.4 per cent are affected with 
other handicaps. A total of 43.3 per cent of those re- 
ported in this investigation were below the standard of

physical health requisite for those intrusted with the 
instruction of children.’’ * 
Occupational ailments.—Occupations are sometimes 
characterized by ailments or diseases that are par- 
ticularly prevalent among workers in them. While 
no ailment or disease is peculiar to the teaching pro- 
fession, nevertheless, certain ones are more prevalent 
among teachers than among other workers. 
Nervousness.—‘‘Nerves’’ seem to be the most char- 
acteristic ailment of teachers. From 30 to 60 per cent 
of all teachers’ ailments are of this general character. 
Probably 50 per cent of absenteeism is caused by 
“nerves.’? In New York City, 45.9 per cent of all the 
teachers reported nervous disorders. About one-third 
of the breakdowns are due to neurasthenia. This con- 
dition is shown in a strident voice, a morbid worry, 
and often by a quick temper. Indigestion and consti- 
pation are caused largely by nervousness and an un- 
regulated sedentary life. 
Tuberculosis—It is estimated that one out of every 
twenty children is tubercular. There must be millions 
of tubercle bacilli floating in the air of nearly every 
classroom. Over one million children are taught by 
tubercular teachers. The average number of female 
teachers dying from tuberculosis was, in one year, 256 
in each 1000 deaths. In Baltimore the number was 452 
to each 1000. The average number of deaths in the 
same years from tuberculosis was 140 to 1000. The 
rate for teachers is almost twice the rate for the coun- 
try as a whole. Teachers are peculiarly subject to

tuberculosis as the figures in Table XXII show. The 
percentage of teachers afflicted increases at a rapid 
rate with their years of service.

Goldhahn found that among male teachers the excess 
mortality rate due to tuberculosis was 60 per cent over 
the general population for the years from 20-29, and 
23 per cent for the years 30 to 39. 
Dr. Van Tussenbroek found teachers’ mortality rate 
from tuberculosis very high between 25 and 35 years 
exceeding in those years the rate of physicians by 
about 30 per cent and that of lawyers by over 60 per 
cent. 
Curtis points out that: ‘‘The teacher at her work is 
using a very small lung capacity, and the cells in the 
lower part of the lungs are almost entirely unused.
-P-A-G-E-421
  THE TEACHER’S HEALTH, RECREATION AND LEISURE 403 
It is these unused air cells which are first attacked by 
the tubercle bacillus. (Therefore), teaching is a dan- 
gerous occupation for anyone with a tubercular ten- 
dency.’’? Such a person should be deflected into some 
other profession. But if she finds herself in it, her 
remedy is to live in the open air, rest, live free from 
worry, and exercise moderately in such a way as to 
develop her lungs and to build up reserve vitality suffi- 
cient to throw off the deadly disease. 
Low vitality.—In a report to his board of education 
(1896), Superintendent Balliet of Springfield, Massa- 
chusetts, summarized 159 replies to a health question- 
naire which he had submitted to his teachers. He 
found that 84% held the opinion that the teacher of 
average physical constitution suffered a decided phys- 
ical impairment in the period between the 5th and 10th 
year of teaching service; 50 per cent placed the time 
under 7 years and 7 per cent said it exceeded 10 years. 
Both of these investigations are based upon the opin- 
ions of teachers concerning their health. Perhaps 
after all teachers are actually healthier than they 
think they are. 
The German investigations have been more exten- 
sive than any in the United States. However, the re- 
sults are somewhat similar. Dr. Sigel (1895) exam- 
ined all teachers in Leipsig with the conclusions that 
42.8 per cent were suffering from definite diseases, 
mostly affections of the heart, lungs, throat, or nerv- 
ous system. The German statistics of Karup and 
Gollmer embrace the records of 12,381 teachers of all 
grades. In spite of the fact that they show a large 
per cent of tuberculosis and nervous disorder, the total
-P-A-G-E-422
  404 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
mortality rate for male teachers was found to be 
slightly lower than that of the total population. 
In Amsterdam in the year 1903, 24.7 per cent of the 
1203 male teachers missed duty because of illness, and 
34.2 per cent of the 909 female teachers. Seventy-nine 
per cent of the illness lasted two weeks or less; 8.5 
per cent between two and four weeks; and the remain- 
ing 12.6 per cent lasted over four weeks. The causes 
of these absences were as follows: 34 per cent nervous 
disorders; 16.5 per cent throat and lung trouble; 65 
per cent contagious disease, and 43 per cent all other 
illnesses, 
In Jessup’s Survey of the teaching staff of the 
Cleveland schools, 1914, he found that an average of 
40 individuals were absent from the teaching force 
each day because of some illness. This figure applies 
only to those who received pay while absent, and no 
teacher received pay for more than 10 days absence in 
one year. It is interesting to note that these absences 
cost the city of Cleveland $40,000 that year. 
Out of 500 teachers replying to a questionnaire sent 
out by Dr. W. H. Burnham in 1904, 3714 per cent said 
that their health had been impaired in school work. 
Country school teachers.—Only one instance of the 
actual examination of any considerable number of 
country school teachers can be cited. The citation is 
from a report made by Dr. Mabel Ulrich of the Health 
Service of the Northern Division of the Red Cross. In 
1920, specially trained instructors were placed in 
county institutes to give health talks and ‘‘make such 
physical examinations of teachers as are commonly 
smade by county nurses.’? Three thousand teachers  
-P-A-G-E-423
  THE TEACHER’S HEALTH, RECREATION AND LEISURE 405 
were examined. These were almost wholly from rural 
or small-town communities. The median age was, 
“around the late teens or early twenties.’’ Results 
showed 221% per cent with defective vision, 23 per cent 
with diseased tonsils, 2114 per cent with bad posture, 
17 per cent with defective teeth, and 9 per cent with 
diseased glands. In other words, about one teacher 
out of every four, even in rural communities and at 
the very beginning of their teaching experience, shows 
need of medical attention. 
Physical examination—An increasing number of 
boards of education are requiring an annual physical 
examination of all employees. The greatest practical 
value of such a requirement is the official emphasis 
given to the need of good health. Teachers neglect 
their own health and the annual check serves to over- 
come their apathy and indifference. In many instances 
teachers who think they are perfectly well discover 
that they need attention. They come to realize that, 
‘individual health implies high ideals of health, 
strength, endurance, symmetry, and beauty; it enor- 
mously increases one’s capacity to work, to be happy, 
and to be useful.” 
Teachers are frequently unwise in their diet, care- 
less in matters of exercise and recreation, irregular in 
sleep, and irrational in dress. They dress too thinly 
for cold outdoor weather and perhaps too heavily for 
indoor schoolroom temperature. They bring upon 
themselves some of the uneasiness as to future de- 
pendence by inattention to matters .of thrift and con- 
servation. They waste their energy by careless plan- 
ning, or no planning at all, of the routine work which
-P-A-G-E-424
  406 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
it is incumbent upon them to do. And so for reasons, 
partly within and partly without the teacher’s control, 
the occupation of teaching carries with it great risk in 
the contraction of disease. 
Sick leave-—Many boards of education allow teach- 
ers from five to ten days a year sick leave on full pay. 
This practice is a frank recognition of facts as they 
exist. Such a privilege is rarely abused. 
Need of recreation—Curtis thinks that: ‘There 
are five rather obvious reasons for the recreation of 
teachers. They are: That the teacher may maintain 
her health; that she may be personally attractive; 
that she may continue to grow mentally; that she 
may be successful as a teacher; and that she may 
enjoy life. While recreation does not furnish the 
complete answer to all of the problems involved, it 
is an essential element in all, and to some it may be a 
full solution.’’ 
Personal attractiveness.—Unhealthy people are, as a 
rule, physically unattractive. Erect posture, bright 
eyes, a clear skin, full chest, lively step, and other indi- 
cations of vivacity and vitality are always attractive. 
Boyer found at Annapolis that: ‘‘The height of the 
naval cadets could be increased one and one-half inches 
by systematic exercises after the age of eighteen.’’ 
Light and rapid movements are expressions of grace. 
William James once said: ‘‘Simply to live, breathe, 
and move should be a delight. The thoroughly healthy 
person is full of optimism; ‘‘He rejoiceth like a strong 
man to run a race.’’’ Overflowing vitality is seldom 
seen except among children. Most people squander 
their vital surplus before middle life. Yet it is in this
-P-A-G-E-425
THE TEACHER’S HEALTH, RECREATION AND LEISURE’ 407 
vital surplus that the secret of personal magnetism 
lies. Our health ideals must not stop at the avoidance 
of invalidism, but should aim at exuberant and ex- 
ultant health. Our aim should be to see not how much 
strain our strength can stand, but how great we can 
make that strength. 
How teachers recreate.—The few studies that have 
been made of how teachers spend their leisure time 
indicate that teachers are inclined to take ‘‘just what 
comes along.’’ There is little evidence of systematic 
or planned recreations of an individual or of a co- 
operative character. Passive recreations such as read- 
ing, lectures, concerts, music, movies, theaters, and 
entertainments are the most popular. Next comes 
other passive activities such as sewing, crocheting, tat- 
ting, china painting, and the like. The more active 
avocations such as riding, walking, driving, motoring, 
sleighing, camping, fishing, swimming, skating, canoe- 
ing, bowling, gardening, and housework are patronized 
occasionally but not systematically. Less than 10 per 
cent of the teachers take part in any kind of sport 
outside of walking. ‘‘The three principal forms of 
recreation for teachers are reading, moving pictures, 
and walking.’’ ¢ 
Mental condition——Doctors have discovered that 
fatigue is due primarily to the toxic products in the 
body. The red blood becomes blue. The worn out tis- 
sues are cast off through the lungs, the urine, and the 
sweat glands. Muscle must be rebuilt by activity. If 
the blood of a fatigued dog is injected into a normal 
dog, the normal dog is almost immediately fatigued.

If waste products are washed out of the body, greater 
vigor is at once evident. 
Mental fatigue is often due to physical neglect. The 
first thing to do is to exercise vigorously in the open 
air, bathe, and rest a half hour or so. Most teachers 
carry their work around with them. They are always 
thinking and talking shop. They dwell on the same 
ideas and hover over the same situations. Often a 
complex results, a shop complex as deadly in its re- 
sults as a guilt, fear, shame, or inferiority complex 
from which so many individuals suffer. 
Systematic, vigorous, physical activity recreates tis- 
sue. It renews the blood. It causes complete forget- 
fulness of daily routine and results not only in refresh- 
ing one physically but also stimulates one mentally. 
‘“‘Napoleon said his mind was arranged like a bureau 
of drawers; he drew out one when he wished to attend 
to that subject, and pushed it back when he was 
through. When he wanted to go to sleep, he closed all 
the drawers and sleep ensued almost immediately.’’ 
‘Teachers should lock their cares in their desks when 
the day’s work is done and then go and play—not sit 
or loaf, but play vigorously until they are tired and 
have forgotten everything. Recreation should become 
the teacher’s religion. The mental habits of estab- 
lished routine are hard to reform but persistent effort 
soon results in new and more worth while habits. 
Time to recreate-—The period from the close of 
school until supper should be used for recreation. 
Again, from seven to ten P. M., in seven days, there 
are 21 hours in which to play at least a portion of the 
time. Every Saturday is also available to the teacher

THE TEACHER’S HEALTH, RECREATION AND LEISURE 409 
as also are frequent vacations and holidays with their 
opportunity for travel. American teachers have the 
shortest day, the shortest month, and the shortest year 
of any teachers in the civilized world. 
Recreation will not only result in better teachers 
but also in better teaching. The proper use of leisure 
time is something every teacher attempts to teach 
others but something which she often fails to practice 
in her own life, the failure of which costs her health, 
growth, enjoyment, and personal attractiveness. 
Main points of the chapter.—1. Good health and the 
proper use of leisure time are two of the seven cardinal 
objectives of modern education. 
2. The level of vitality is rarely maintained at more 
than 50 per cent of the potential. Consequently most 
people are under-vitalized and less efficient and less 
happy than they should be. 
3. Teachers have the gift of leisure but fail to 
realize it. In place of using the available leisure for 
proper vigorous recreation they loaf and engage in 
sedendary pursuits. 
4. Nerves and tuberculosis are peculiarly teachers’ 
ailments. Nearly 50 per cent of teachers complain of 
the first, and more than twice as many teachers as 
other workers suffer from the latter. Much of this is 
unnecessary and is due to neglect. 
5. Compulsory physical examinations and sick leave 
on pay help the profession, but taken alone are entirely 
inadequate to cope with the problem. 
6. The five reasons for recreation for teachers are 
health, grace and attractiveness, mental growth and 
vigor, greater success, and greater enjoyment. 
 
-P-A-G-E-428
  410 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
7. Fatigue is often more apparent than real. It is 
the result of toxic poisons left in the unrelaxed body. 
Fatigue is, therefore, often due to neglect. 
8. A shop complex characterizes many teachers. 
This complex is as deadly in its results as a guilt, 
shame, fear, or inferiority complex from which so 
many persons suffer. 
9. Complete forgetfulness of work comes to those 
whose recreation is vigorous and enjoyable. 
10. Teachers have plenty of time in which to re- 
create. The hours between leaving school and supper 
time, the evening hours, Saturdays and Sundays, the 
frequent holidays and vacations offer her ample oppor- 
tunities if she but avails herself of them. 
PROBLEMS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
1. Outline a program of recreation for teachers that will 
be so attractive as to teach them the value of play in their 
own lives and induce them to recreate systematically. 
2. Make a study of the campaigns now under way in school 
systems for the improvement of the health of teachers and 
other school employees. 
8. Make a study of the way teachers now spend their 
leisure hours. 
4. How would you measure the value of a proper hygienic 
and recreational program for teachers? 
5. Make a study of all the health and recreatory provi- 
sions for teachers now being provided in school buildings.

CHAPTER XXT 
ETHICS OF THE TEACHING PROFESSION 
Distinction between a business and a profession.— 
The difference between a business or an industry and 
a profession is simple and unmistakable. The cri- 
terion of the former is the financial return which it 
offers to its shareholders. Businesses and industries 
are organized primarily for profits, and not primarily 
for service. At least, this has been true until recently 
and is still true for a great majority of business and 
industrial undertakings. That they render a service 
cannot be denied but service is secondary rather than 
primary. In the professions, on the contrary, service 
is primary and profits secondary. A professional man 
is measured by the service which he performs and not 
the gains which he amasses. Professional men occa- 
sionally grow rich, but the measure of their success, 
both for themselves and for the public, is not the 
money which they make but the fact that they have 
improved the health, safety, knowledge, or goodness 
of their community. While one may enter a profession 
for the sake of livelihood and depend upon it for his 
income, a strictly professional man does not consider 
that any conduct which increases his income is, on that 
account, good.

  414 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
Perhaps the day will come when all businesses and 
industries and, for that matter, all subsidiary trades 
will be imbued with the idea of service primarily and 
profits secondarily. If that day ever comes the work 
of making boots or building a house will, in itself, be 
no more degrading than that of curing the sick and 
teaching the ignorant. Any necessary labor is honor- 
able and it should be at least equally free from the 
vulgar subordination of moral standards to financial 
interests. 
It cannot be said that business has as yet attained 
a specific code of ethics resting on considerations 
broader than the sense of self-interest and obedience 
to the minimum requirements of law. Undoubtedly 
such a code is in the making. By business ethics we 
generally mean the practice of fair play and honorable 
dealing which men should observe in business. Sharp 
dealing, unfair competition, the exaction of the ‘‘pound 
of flesh’? may be reprobated by the decent majority 
and the individual held in contempt, but there is no 
general organization of business men which has the 
power to discipline its offenders. While the activities 
of business men, each in pursuit of his own success, are 
tempered by the ‘‘general will;’’ nevertheless, their 
activities are not, as a rule, over-ridden. This does 
not mean that business men are selfish while profes- 
sional men are altruistic. There are some people be- 
longing to professions who are less professional than 
some business men. However, organized professions 
definitely proclaim the ideal of service and assume to 
some degree to discipline their members, while busi- 
ness pursuits do not.
-P-A-G-E-433
  ETHICS OF THE TEACHING PROFESSION 415 
What is a profession?—The word ‘‘profession’’ has 
been defined by the Supreme Court of the United 
States as ‘‘A vocation involving relations to the affairs 
of others of such a nature as to require for its proper 
conduct an equipment of learning or skill, or both, and 
to warrant the community in making restrictions in 
respect to its exercise.’”? Every organized profession 
avows itself to be an association existing primarily to 
fulfil a definite service within a community. Tawney, 
in his admirable book Acquisitive society, says in part: 
‘“‘A profession may be defined most simply as a trade 
which is organized, incompletely no doubt, for the per- 
formance of a function. It is not simply a collection 
of individuals who get a living for themselves by the 
same kind of work, nor is it merely a group which is 
organized exclusively for the economic protection of 
its members, though that is normally among its pur- 
poses. It is a body of persons who carry on their work 
in callings, with rules designed to enforce certain 
standards both for the better protection of its mem- 
bers, and for the better service of the public. Its 
essence is that it assumes certain responsibilities for 
the competence of its members or the quality of its 
wares, and that it deliberately prohibits certain kinds 
of conduct on the ground that they are calculated to 
bring into disrepute the organization.’’ 
The professional interests combine a number of ele- 
ments. As Ivers states: ‘‘It includes what one may 
term the extensive interest, that interest devoted to 
the economic and social status, the reputation, effort, 
success, and emoluments attaching to the profession 
asa body. It includes also the technical interests di-
-P-A-G-E-434
  416 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
rected to the art and crafts of the profession, to the 
maintenance and improvement of its standards of 
efficiency, to the quest for new and better methods and 
processes and to the definition and promotion of the 
training requisite for the practice of the profession. - 
It may also include a third interest which may be 
classified as cultural. The cultural interest is best de- 
fined as art for art’s sake. Many workmen take pride 
in their work for the self-satisfaction which it renders 
them quite without respect to profits.’’ 
In these two statements we have as good a defini- 
tion of a profession, measured by this definition, edu- 
cation may be found wanting in certain respects. 
Certainly, only at higher levels of the profession, for 
example in college and university teaching, would all 
phases of such a definition be applicable to the pro- 
fession of teaching. 
Self-interest versus public welfare——A profession is 
an association existing primarily to fulfil a definite 
service within a community. Commercialism stands 
generally as the antithesis of professionalism. No 
man can today practice a profession without making 
terms with business or commerce. Otherwise he will 
be subjecting himself to the risk of financial ruin. 
Hthical codes must protect both the self-interests of 
the worker and the interests of public welfare. Pro- 
fessionalism challenges commercialism to seek the pub- 
lic interests. The following quotation gives the chal- 
lenge direct: 
“Our knowledge and our skill are inheritances. 
They have been bought and paid for by the laborious 
struggles of men and women down through the ages,
-P-A-G-E-435
  ETHICS OF THE TEACHING PROFESSION 417 
through sweat and agony, through suffering, poverty 
and deprivation. They are ours by inheritance only, 
and we are the trustees of that knowledge and skill. 
They belong to society. It is not a question of whether 
we should give back part of them as a charity. Our 
first obligation is to the society from which all derive 
them. Men have never sought to carry the treasures 
of knowledge to the grave. They have ever sought 
to give them to the world, and we, through our applica- 
tion and study, seek to acquire what they have given 
to mankind. But it was to all men that the knowl- 
edge was given. No chosen few that use it have the 
right to sell it for private gain to others who use it 
for private gain, unless in so doing they confer a true 
benefit upon society as a whole.’’ 
Professional self-regulation and discipline —Hach 
profession tends to leave its distinct stamp upon a 
man. It is easier to distinguish the teacher and judge 
than it is to distinguish, outside of their work, the 
plumber or the machinist. The professional group 
creates a group bias. Practices of the trade tend to 
establish habits peculiar to it. These habits find ex- 
pression both in action and in thought. The phrase, 
“‘T can tell a teacher anywhere’’ is as true as the simi- 
lar phrase, ‘‘I can tell a doctor anywhere.’’ It is a 
mark of professionalism and a credit to those repre- 
senting the profession. 
The fundamental element of professional life is the 
idea of an efficient and skilled service. Therefore, it 
is but natural that professions tend to regulate them- 
selves. These regulations are extra-legal. They take 
the form of professional codes. Ethics can not be re-
-P-A-G-E-436
  418 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
duced to a source of inviolable rules or commands 
which can be applied everywhere and always without 
regard to circumstances. Hvery profession has both a 
written and an unwritten code of ethics. A profes- 
sional code simply prescribes the duties of the mem- 
bers of the whole group toward those inside and out- 
side of the group. The professions of law, medicine, 
and dentistry have succeeded in establishing self- 
regulation to a certain degree. It is assumed in a 
democracy that anyone has a right to enter any pro- 
fession, and the Supreme Court of the United States 
has held that ‘‘It is undoubtedly the right of every citi- 
zen of the United States to follow any lawful calling, 
business or profession, he may choose, subject only to 
such restrictions as are imposed upon persons of like 
age, sex, and condition.’’ 
In the legal profession at first an oath was all that 
was deemed sufficient but after a century of growth in 
America, the Bar established from its unwritten code 
a written code. This code has been published from 
time to time broadcast to the community and covered 
not only what one lawyer could expect from another, 
but also what the public could expect of lawyers in 
general. The self-regulations of the medical profes- 
sion are much stricter. Thus far the writer has never 
heard of teachers at any level of the profession defi- 
nitely establishing courts for the disciplining of way- 
ward brethren, but the indications are that the teach- 
ing profession, like the medical and legal professions, 
is gradually becoming self-conscious of this need. The 
present general interest in codes of ethics for teachers 
augurs well for the future of the profession. 
 
-P-A-G-E-437
  
ETHICS OF THE TEACHING PROFESSION 419 
The mission of ethics for the teaching profession.— 
The credulity and ignorance of the public restricts the 
development of codes of ethics for all the professions. 
The public misunderstands the mission of ethical rules. 
Ethical rules for the profession are often considered 
by outsiders as attempts on the part of a profession 
to restrict entrance. Every profession must build its 
own code of ethics and offer it to the public with a dis- 
interested and unselfish purpose. Even then it is mis- 
understood by the public. 
Ethical codes of other professions.—The following 
professions have developed codes of ethics which are 
more or less operative and which are doing a great 
service in building up the reputation of the service in 
the community: Law, medicine, engineering, archi- 
tecture, literary services, journalism, education, min- 
istry, social work and business. The teaching profes- 
sion can learn a great deal concerning ethical codes by 
studying the history and methods of application of 
these codes in other professions. Thus far the teach- 
ing profession has developed its own local codes with- 
out much reference to the codes of other professions. 
Ethics of the teaching profession.—Codes of ethics 
for the teachers have been formulated, in some in- 
stances, by local groups as, for example, the Banard 
Society of Providence, Rhode Island. Others have 
been prepared by teachers’ associations, either local 
or state. The following associations of teachers now 
have approved codes: California, Michigan, Missis- 
sippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, Mlinois, 
and Oregon. The Pennsylvania Code was approved 
by the state education association in December, 1920. 
   
-P-A-G-E-438
  420 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
Over three years were spent by the committee in pre- 
paring it. In preparing it the committee studied all 
the other available codes for the teaching profession 
as well as the codes of other professions, including 
medicine, law, architecture, and the ministry. 
PENNSYLVANIA CODE OF ETHICS FOR TEACHERS 
This code is an application of the general principles of 
ethics to the special obligations, rights, and privileges of the 
teaching profession. 
I, PROFESSIONAL ATTITUDE 
The highest obligation of every member of the teaching 
professions is due to those who are under his professional 
care, 
Il, COMPENSATION 
The teaching profession should demand, for each of its 
members, that compensation which will enable him to render 
the most efficient service. To attain maximum efficiency the 
compensation must be sufficient to enable him to live upon 
a scale befitting his place in society, to permit the necessary 
expenditures for professional improvement, and to make 
proper provision for those dependent upon him, and for 
himself in his old age. 
Il. OPEN-MINDED STUDY OF EDUCATION 
Every member of the profession should be a progressive 
student of education. To this end he should be a thought- 
ful reader of educational literature, should attend and par- 
ticipate in educational meetings, should engage in such ex- 
perimentation and collection of data as will test the value of 
educational theories and aid in the establishment of a scien- 
tifie basis for educational practice, and should be willing to 
give to his fellow members the benefits of his professional 
knowledge and experience. 
IV. CRITICISMS OF ASSOCIATES 
(a) The motives for all criticisms should be helpfulness 
and improvement. Adverse criticisms, known or heard,
-P-A-G-E-439
  ETHICS OF THE TEACHING PROFESSION 421 
should not be made or repeated except to the one criticized, 
or to his superior with the full expectation that opportunity 
for explanation will be afforded. On the other hand, when 
corrupt and dishonorable practices are known to exist they 
should be fearlessly reported to the proper authorities. 
(b) Adverse comments and insinuations in regard to the 
work of a predecessor or of the teacher of a previous grade 
are to be condemned. 
Vv. APPOINTMENTS AND PROMOTIONS 
(a) All appointments, promotions or advancements in sal- 
ary should be obtained exclusively on merit. To this end, 
it is proper for the candidate to make his qualifications known 
to the proper school authorities, either directly or through a 
teachers’ agency. 
(b) A teacher should take no steps towards obtaining a 
specific position until he knows the position is vacant or about 
to be vacant. 
(c) No teacher should secure an offer elsewhere for the 
sole purpose of using it as a means to obtain an increase of 
salary on his present position. 
(d) Upon accepting appointment in a given district a 
teacher should notify all other districts to which letters of 
application have been sent. 
(e) Whenever a superintendent is seeking a teacher in an- 
other district he should inform the superintendent or the 
proper officials of the district, but a superintendent’s reluc- 
tance to part with a teacher should not deprive the teacher 
of an opportunity for deserved advancement. 
VI. CONTRACT OBLIGATIONS 
A teacher should never violate a contract. Unless the con- 
sent of the employing body is obtained releasing the obliga- 
tion, the contract should be fulfilled. On the other hand, 
when a teacher is offered a better position elsewhere it is 
against the best interests of the schools to stand in the way 
of the teacher’s advancement by arbitrary insistence upon 
the terms of a needlessly rigid contract, when the place can 
be satisfactorily filled.
-P-A-G-E-440
  422 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
VII. DEMOCRACY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCHOOL PLANS 
The superintendent should be recognized as the profes- 
sional leader of the school system. Each member of the 
system should be given opportunity to collaborate in the 
solution of professional problems; but when a policy is finally 
determined, it should be loyally supported by all. 
VIII. RELATIONS BETWEEN SUPERVISORY OFFICERS AND TEACHERS 
(a) Codperation, loyalty, and sincerity should characterize 
all relations between supervisory officers and teachers. 
(b) Each teacher is entitled from time to time to state- 
ments of his professional record, whether favorable or un- 
favorable, and may properly make requests for such state- 
ments. Moreover, every teacher whose reémployment is not 
intended should be given timely notice. 
(c) A supervisor of classroom work should observe the fol- 
lowing ethical principles in relation to the teachers whose 
work he observes professionally. 
1. He should express an opinion upon the work observed 
following each professional visit. 
2. He should recommend ways to remove every fault 
pointed out, and allow reasonable opportunity for improve- 
ment. 
8. He should not criticize a teacher before other teachers 
or before pupils. 
4. He should just as certainly and just as unfailingly 
point out the excellence as the faults of the work observed. 
5. He should give ample opportunity for conference pre- 
vious to observation of the teacher’s work, 
(d) A superintendent or other supervisory officer should 
be ready and willing at any time to answer official inquiries 
from prospective employers concerning the qualifications of 
any teacher under him, and should be willing to write to any 
interested party, at the request of a teacher, giving a state- 
ment of the teacher’s professional record under him; but 
evasive or equivocal letters of recommendation should not 
be given.   
      
IX. RELATIONS TO PARENTS 
(a) Teachers should maintain codperative relations with 
parents, and should meet criticism with openmindedness and 
courtesy.
-P-A-G-E-441
  ETHICS OF THE TEACHING PROFESSION 423 
(b) Teachers should not discuss the physical, mental, moral 
or financial limitations of their pupils in such a way as to 
embarrass the pupils or parents unnecessarily. Neverthe- 
less they should exercise the utmost candor, as well as tact, 
in their communications with parents on matters of real im- 
portance. Information concerning the home conditions of 
the pupils should be held in confidence by the teachers. 
X. RELATIONS TO PUBLISHERS AND SUPPLY HOUSES 
No member of the profession should act as an agent, or 
receive a commission, or royalty, or anything else of value, 
for any books or supplies in the selection of which he exer- 
cises official decision. 
X. TEACHERS’ AGENCIES 
The profession should unhesitatingly condemn teachers’ 
agencies that encourage teachers to break their contracts, 
that work for the appointment or promotion of unqualified 
teachers, or that make recommendations for positions not 
known positively to be vacant. Any member of the profes- 
sion who has knowledge of such action, should report it to 
the Commission on Professional Ethics. 
XU. LOYALTY TO SCHOOL BOARDS 
(a) It is the duty of every member of the profession in 
a school system to recognize the legal authority of the board 
of directors, and to be loyal to its policies established in 
accordance therewith. 
(b) If, however, the attitude of a school board should 
clearly and persistently be such as to prevent the members 
of the profession employed by it from serving the best inter- 
ests of the pupils, and if repeated efforts to remedy the situa- 
tion have been without avail, then an appeal should be made 
to the Commission on Professional Ethics. 
XII. COMMISSION ON PROFESSIONAL ETHICS 
(a) There should be a Commission on Professional Ethics 
operating under the Pennsylvania State Educational Asso- 
ciation. This Commission shall consist of the President of 
the Association, ex officio, and four members of the profes-
-P-A-G-E-442
  424 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
sion, appointed by the President, with terms of four years 
each, one term expiring on July first each year. 
(b) It shall be the duty of this Commission to study the 
various problems of professional ethics arising from time to 
time, to give the inquiring members of the profession its 
interpretation of the meaning of various principles in this 
code, to arrange for investigations rendered advisable in 
connection with this code, to take such action in regard to 
their findings as may be deemed wise, to make recommenda- 
tions to the State Association as to amendments or additions 
to the code, and in general to have oversight of all questions 
arising in connection with the ethics of the teaching profes- 
sion within the state. 
Main points of the chapter.—1. The chief difference 
between a business and a profession is the difference 
between serving the self-interest and serving the pub- 
lic interest. Business is organized for profits first, 
and service is subsidiary to profits. Professions are 
organized for service first and profits afterwards. The 
Rotary motto ‘‘Service Before Self’’ expresses the 
growing conception of a higher code of ethics for 
business. 
2. A profession requires learning and skill sufficient 
in quantity and kind to warrant the making of restric- 
tions in respect to its exercise. It also sets up its own 
standards and restrictions and disciplines its own 
members. 
8. The knowledge and skill necessary to pursue a 
profession belong to all because it is the result of social 
effort over a long period of years. 
4. Ethics for the teaching profession serves the 
same purpose as in the professions of law, medicine, 
engineering, dentistry, etc. The real purpose is to pro-
-P-A-G-E-443

tect the public. Not self-interest but public interest 
comes first. 
5. The code of ethics for the teachers of the State 
of Pennsylvania is an excellent model. 
PROBLEMS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
1. Miss B , a third grade teacher, thinks she is a better 
kindergarten teacher than the one who holds the local posi- 
tion. The transfer would mean a material increase in salary 
and Miss B. has had special kindergarten training. How- 
ever, Miss ©: , the present teacher and fairly successful, 
has not announced her intention of resigning. Miss B. 
interviews each member of the local board seeking the kin- 
dergarten position. What should be the attitude of the 
superintendent and board toward such an applicant? 
2. Mr. A resigns one week before the opening of school 
in order to accept a position at a larger salary elsewhere. 
How may he do this ethically? 
3. Miss H. flunks pupils and then offers to tutor them 
at a dollar and a half per hour. Is she ethical? 
4. Mr.B is always gossiping about his superintendent. 
He bears a false tongue. The superintendent is worried that 
Mr. B does not like him and is working behind his back 
to undermine him. The superintendent pays no attention 
to it. Should he? : 
5. Mrs. T: gets interested in politics and openly en- 
gages in a controversy involving the reélection of two board 
members. The superintendent sends out notice that it is 
regarded as impolitic for school employees to engage in con- 
troversial differences in the community. His notice is un- 
heeded. What should he do? 
6. Mr. B. applies for another person’s position in the 
same school system before it is known that there is the pos- 
sibility of a vacancy. The superintendent severely repri- 
mands Mr. B. , who defends his actions. The superin- 
tendent replies by refusing to recommend Mr. B—— for any 
position. Was he just?

7. Why do you agree or disagree with the following state- 
ment by President Coolidge? 
‘“‘The standards which teachers are required to maintain 
are continually rising. Their work takes on a new dignity. 
It is rising above a calling, above a profession, into the realm 
of art. It must be dignified by technical training, ennobled 
by character, and sanctified by faith. It is not too much to 
say that the need of civilization is the need of teachers. The 
contribution which they make to human welfare is beyond 
estimation. In our own country this service was never better 
performed than at the present day. The earnest conscien- 
tious men and women, running from the head of the great 
university down to the kindergarten, represent a force for 
good which is immeasurable. The influence which they 
create for better things, the inspiration which they give for 
higher ideals, are the chief contributing force to the stability 
of society and the march of progress. They point the way 
to the dawn, they lead toward the morning, toward light, 
toward truth.’’ (Calvin Coolidge—The Price of Freedom. 
Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1924, p. 225.)

Many State Teachers’ Associations have formulated codes 
of ethics for teachers, superintendents, and other school em- 
ployees. These may be secured by writing to either the State 
Superintendent of Public Instruction of the particular state 
or to the secretary of the State Teachers’ Association. For 
example, in 1922 the Michigan State Teachers’ Association 
published a code of professional ethics for teachers which 
was sent to every teacher in the state.

  CHAPTER XXII 
THE LEGAL AND SOCIAL STATUS OF THE TEACHER 
A. The Legal Status 
Teachers frequently need to know their legal rights 
and obligations. This is especially true for beginning 
teachers. From time to time, problems are bound to 
arise that involve the law. It is, therefore, well for 
the teacher to know not only the school law of the 
particular state in which she teaches, but also the 
philosophy of the law as demonstrated in court de- 
cisions. The legal status of the teacher is determined 
not only by common law but by state constitutions, 
statutes, rules and regulations of local, county, and 
state authorities, and the interpretation of all of these 
by the courts. 
Present legal status of the teacher.—The legal status 
of the teacher varies according to the state. It would 
be difficult to enumerate all the powers, duties, respon- 
sibilities, and restrictions placed upon teachers in all 
of the 48 states. The list would include such matters 
as certification, methods of selecting teachers, teach- 
er’s contract (oral and written), dismissal of teacher, 
duties and authority of teacher, corporal punishment, 
teacher’s power to suspend and expel, teacher’s legal 
residence, teacher’s protection against slander, teach- 
428
-P-A-G-E-447
  THE LEGAL AND SOCIAL STATUS OF THE TEACHER 429 
er’s liability for slander, compensation legislation, 
pension laws, ete. This by no means exhausts the 
subject. 
A study of the statutes and their interpretations 
by the courts indicates that it is intended that every 
obstacle shall be removed which shall in any way hin- 
der the advancement and improvement of public in- ~ 
struction. It shows further that the teacher’s rights 
are, for the most part, carefully safeguarded. Per- 
haps a clearer understanding of the legal status of the 
teacher would obviate many unpleasant and unfortu- 
nate situations which tend to recur in every state and 
which not only hamper the efficiency of the schools, 
but also cause considerable personal discomfort to the 
teacher. 
Certification—The first legal obligation imposed 
upon teachers pertains to certification already fully 
described in Chapter VI. However, in some states 
where the statutes read that no person shall teach in 
the common schools who does not hold a certificate of 
qualification at the time of his employment there have 
arisen questions over the interpretation of the phrase, 
at the time of his employment. Some courts hold that 
a teacher cannot make a valid contract to teach unless 
he holds a certificate at the time of making the con- 
tract, but if the teacher should subsequently secure 
a certificate prior to the opening of his school and is 
allowed by the board to proceed and draw his salary, it 
is interpreted that the board by so doing ratifies the 
new contract, the terms of which are implied to be 
identical with the terms of the previous invalid con- 
tract. In Illinois, the difficulty regarding this point 
 
-P-A-G-E-448
  430 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
was obviated by an amendment? passed in 1893 which 
provided that ‘‘the teacher must hold, at the time of 
entering upon his duties, a certificate of qualification 
covering the entire period of his employment.’’ 
Authority to revoke certificates—The decision in 
the case of Stone vs. Fritz? in Indiana in 1907, may be 
cited to show who has authority to suspend or revoke 
teachers’ certificates. Fritz, a teacher, neglected school 
duties and refused to attend institutes. Superinten- 
dent Stone revoked his certificate. Fritz took the mat- 
ter to court. On appeal to the Supreme Court the 
superintendent was upheld. In delivering the opin- 
ion the court said in part: 
It is not intended that judicial officers, howsoever wise, 
shall usurp the prerogatives and functions of superintendents 
of schools and thereby substitute their own opinions and 
judgments for those of men held accountable for results in 
educational affairs. Tribunals established by law may not 
infringe upon the jurisdiction of each other. Questions af- 
fecting the competency and general conduct of teachers may 
not be taken indiscriminately from the school tribunal and 
submitted to courts and juries. If the superintendent shows 
bias and judicial incapacity, he must answer only to the body 
responsible for his election for the manner in which he con- 
ducts his office, so long as he keeps within its legitimate 
sphere. 
From this it is evident that the authority to sus- 
pend or revoke teachers’ certificates is delegated by 
statutes to county superintendents and to state super- 
intendents and other officers of public instruction and 
the causes for which they may be revoked are enume-

-P-A-G-E-449

rated. It is a generally accepted doctrine that certi- 
ficates cannot be revoked for causes not specified in the 
statutes. In case a superintendent attempts to revoke 
a certificate upon grounds outside the statute, a teacher 
may secure the intervention of a court of equity to pre- 
vent the threatened revocation. If, however, a super- 
intendent is proceeding to hear a charge fairly within 
the statute, and upon reasonable notice, the accused 
must follow the procedure provided in the school law. 
If aggrieved by a decision of a county superintend- 
ent, his only right of appeal is to the state superin- 
tendent of instruction, whose decision is final and not 
subject to review unless the grounds are outside the 
limits covered by the statute. 
Age of certification—A teacher is required to be a 
certain number of years old before he can receive a 
certificate. Sex and nationality are rarely mentioned, 
except occasionally in cases of negroes. In Oklahoma, 
for example, it is a misdemeanor for a white person 
to teach in a negro school, or for a negro to teach in 
a white school. Furthermore, in certain states, a 
teacher must be an American or signify his intentions 
of becoming an American. It has been held under 
various statutes for certificates that if a teacher’s cer- 
tificate expires while he is teaching, and it is not re- 
newed, he cannot legally recover pay for teaching 
thereafter, or damages from breach of contract of 
employment. 
Contracts.—The power to enter into contracts with 
teachers and fix their compensation and terms of em- 
ployment reposes in the local school board. In the 
absence of a statute clearly to the contrary, an oral 
 
-P-A-G-E-450
432 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
contract with a teacher is valid. A statute providing 
that a teacher’s contract shall specify certain things 
and that it shall be filed with the clerk of the board 
has been held to be directory only. Many cases involy- 
ing this point have come up from time to time. Pear- 
son vs. School District * occurring in Wisconsin in 
1911 is typical and the line of reasoning followed by 
the court is clear cut. 
The conditions under which this case arose are as 
follows: At a regular meeting of the board, at which 
all members were present, the employment of Pearson 
as a teacher for the ensuing year was authorized and 
Pearson accepted. The agreement was not reduced to 
writing. The agreement was never revoked by mu- 
tual consent nor did Pearson at any time or in any 
way by his conduct indicate that he wished or intended 
to withdraw from the contract. Before the opening of 
the school the sentiment of the board changed and 
they decided to disregard the oral contract with Pear- 
son. They hired another teacher and refused to allow 
Pearson to enter upon his duties as a teacher in their 
school. 
Pearson sued the board for breach of contract and 
was granted judgment including recovery of salary. 
The board appealed the case. The Supreme Court 
upheld the decision of the lower court. In rendering 
the decision the court said in part: 
The statute does not say that the contract must be in 
writing and the court can not read into the statute provisions 
not found there for the purpose of rendering an oral con- 
tract, otherwise unobjectionable, void because not in writing, 
*144 Wisconsin 620, 129 N. W. 940.

in the absence of express statutory requirements. .. . It 
needs no citation of authority to point out that statutes in 
derogation of common law must be strictly construed... . 
The contract in question was valid. The judgment of the 
court below is affirmed. 
A decision in a case in Illinois in 1896, Pollard vs. 
School District,t also covers the point of the validity 
of an oral contract with a teacher. Anna Pollard was 
engaged to teach a school but when the time came for 
her to open school the directors refused to let her 
teach. She brought suit to recover on her contract 
which was not in writing. The lower court ruled 
against her. She carried her case to the appellate 
court which reversed the decision of the lower court. 
The justice of the appellate court in delivering the 
opinion said in part: 
While it does not appear that a record was made of it 
(the contract), yet it was a special meeting of the board at 
which they might legally transact such official business. The 
evidence tends to show that such was their object and pur- 
pose and that, as they knew, it was so understood by the 
appellant (Anna Pollard). That they proceeded informally 
and made no record does not affect the validity of what they 
did so far as the appellant is concerned. 
Contract made at regular or special meeting.— 
School boards can not make a valid contract employ- 
ing a teacher except at a regular or special meeting 
held as required by law. In the case of Armstrong vs. 
District No. 128 of Lee County, Illinois,’ which 
oceurred in 1910, Armstrong was offered a contract to 
*65 Illinois app. 104. School Law of IIL, para. 3, p. 42, circular 157.

-P-A-G-E-452
434 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
teach at $87.50 per month but refused, asking $90. 
Later he decided to accept the offer of $87.50. He met 
one of the directors and together they went to the 
residence of another director who said, ‘‘That settles 
it.’ When the time to open school arrived, Armstrong 
offered his services but the board had employed an- 
other teacher and refused to let Armstrong have the 
position. At the close of the first month of school 
session Armstrong brought suit to recover salary for 
the month. The circuit court ruled against him as did 
also the higher court on appeal. The court held that: 
The evidence shows that the conversation between the two 
directors on May 22nd was at a casual meeting. There hav- 
ing been no meeting called, whatever was done by the two 
directors at a casual interview without the previous arrange- 
ment, was unofficial and not binding on the district. 
Informal contract ratified—An informal contract 
with a teacher at an informal or casual meeting of the 
board may be later legally ratified and such ratifica- 
tion is equivalent to full compliance with the necessary 
formalities, and renders the contract valid from its 
inception. An informal contract may be ratified if a 
board gives silent acquiescence to the teacher’s per- 
formance of school duties and grants pay for any part 
of services rendered.” 
Contracts for terms to cover more than one year.— 
The powers of school boards are limited to those ex- 
pressly granted by statute or such as result by neces- 
sary implication from those granted. Under this prin- 
ciple it is held that boards in Illinois, outside of Chi-

THE LEGAL AND SOCIAL STATUS OF THE TEACHER 435 
cago, have no power to make contracts for the employ- 
ment of teachers for terms to commence beyond the 
expiration of the current school year. In the case of 
Stevenson vs. District No. 1 of Iroquois County, Ili- 
nois,® the court held: 
There is doubtless, no objection to contracts for the teach- 
ing of terms extending for a reasonable time beyond the cur- 
rent school year, when such contracts are entered into in 
good faith, and not for the purpose, merely, of forcing upon 
the district an unsatisfactory teacher or defeating the will 
of the voters at the annual election. But the spirit and 
intent of the law are clearly repugnant to the idea that one 
board of directors may, by contracts wholly to be carried 
out in the future, divest future boards of the power to select 
the teachers they shall desire for the terms to be commenced 
after their organization. 
Special requirements in contracts.—In making con- 
tracts to employ teachers boards have the absolute 
right to set up special requirements and standards of 
qualification. The teacher’s certificate becomes only a 
minimum requirement. In this connection a Missouri 
court recently held that: 
In the interest of a higher educational qualification, the 
defendant board of education had the right, in addition to 
having a statutory certificate to require her to take an exam- 
ination in which she should maintain a certain standard of 
fitness as a teacher.® 
In Pennsylvania the exclusion of women from prin- 
cipalship of certain schools was held to be within the 
discretion of the board.1? Boards have the right to

436 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
decline to employ or reémploy any applicant for any 
reason whatsoever or for no reason at all, unless tenure 
laws otherwise state. In the case of Fursman vs. Chi- 
cago 11 the Supreme Court held that: 
It is no infringement on the constitutional rights of any- 
one for the board to decline to employ him as a teacher in 
the schools, and it is immaterial whether the reason for the 
refusal is because the applicant is married or unmarried, is 
of fair complexion or dark, is or is not a member of a trade 
union or whether no reason at all is given for such refusal. 
Rules adopted by the board.—Rules and regula- 
tions adopted by a board prior to the making of a con- 
tract of employment with a teacher, which are known 
or ought to be known to the teacher when he enters into 
the contract, form part of the contract, and the teach- 
er’s employment is subject thereto.12 All reasonable 
rules adopted by the board subsequent to the making 
of such a contract bind the teacher with equal force. 
Contract affected by district indebtedness.—A con- 
tract by a school district for the services of a teacher 
is void if it requires the contracting of an indebted- 
ness which the district is forbidden by statute to con- 
tract,!* and the maintenance of a school throughout the 
school year is not such a necessity as will justify a 
school district in exceeding its statutory debt limit in 
employing a teacher therefor. The mere fact that the 
district has no money on hand with which to pay a 
teacher for services rendered does not invalidate a

teacher’s claim.1 No cases involving this principle 
are of record in Illinois but decisions have been de- 
livered in the States of Washington,’® Montana,'* Mis- 
souri,!7 and Indiana 18 which stand as precedents. 
Board members cannot contract to teach.—A. school 
board cannot contract with one of its own members to 
teach school. It is against public policy to allow one 
standing in such a relation to contract with himself 
concerning the subject of his trust. The reason for 
the rule is clear when it is considered that it is the 
board’s duty to remove a teacher when necessary. It 
is fundamental that a man shall not be a judge in his 
own case. Here again we find in the case of Scott vs. 
Williamstown, Vermont,’® the court presents a clear 
discussion of the principle although in that particular 
case the board member who had taught the school was 
granted a judgment for recovery on the basis of 
quantum meruit. The court in delivering the opinion 
makes reference to an earlier case in Wisconsin ”° 
where judgment was denied a director who had con- 
tracted with the board to repair the school building. 
From these cases it is clear that for a board member 
to undertake to teach in his own district could be justi- 
fied only in case of extreme difficulty in securing some 
other competent teacher and in case of the unanimity 
of the community in desiring him to take personal

charge of all or any school room work. Even in such 
a case, sound policy would demand that he resign from 
membership on the board before the drawing of any 
contract. 
Abandonment of contract.—Legal opinion is divided 
upon the question as to whether a teacher may se- 
cure court action enabling him to recover unpaid salary 
in case he voluntarily leaves his position before teach- 
ing the full term for which he contracted. In such an 
instance a teacher cannot recover on his contract. But 
the question arises as to whether he can collect a rea- 
sonable sum for the services he has already performed 
in quantum meruit. The decision in an early school 
ease, Turner vs. Britton,?4 occurring in 1834 in the 
State of New Hampshire, forms the basis upon which 
later decisions have depended in those instances in 
which recovery has been allowed. In Iowa, Kansas, 
Nebraska, South Dakota, Texas, and North Carolina 
the courts have followed the precedent established by 
the decision in Turner vs. Britton, allowing the teacher 
to recover the value of his service less damages result- 
ing from his breach of the contract. In other states, 
by a very pronounced weight of authority, the courts 
generally hold that an employee who wilfully abandons 
his employment is without remedy against his 
employer. 
Dismissal of teachers.——The right to hire teachers 
presupposes the right to dismiss them for incom- 
petency, unsatisfactory service, or the best interests 
of the school or other causes specified in law. Hvery 
contract made with a teacher includes by implication 
* New Hampshire 1834, 26 Amer. dec, 713, 
 
-P-A-G-E-457
  THE LEGAL AND SOCIAL STATUS OF THE TEACHER 439 
the statutory provisions for dismissal. In the absence 
of statutory provision there remains the implied power 
to dismiss for adequate cause. Proceedings in a case 
of dismissal must conform to the statute and the bur- 
den is upon the board ”? to establish the truth of the 
charge upon which proceedings are based. 
Illinois cases of dismissal.—Illinois statutes do not 
specify grounds upon which a teacher may be dis- 
missed other than those contained in the statute cover- 
ing the revocation of certificates. A typical case of 
dismissal for insubordination is Leddy vs. Board of 
Education #? in 1911. Miss Leddy, after persistent 
refusal to carry out certain instructions of the superin- 
tendent authorized by the board, was dismissed. She 
sued to recover salary for full time and was denied 
judgment. The court held in affirming the decision of 
the lower court that: 
To hold otherwise would be assuming the position that a 
teacher, whether competent, or not, could assume control of 
school affairs, disregard the orders of the superintendent and 
the board of education, and thereby materially interfere with 
the proper and legal conduct of the school. 
In Robinson vs. District No. 4,2 Robinson was dis- 
missed on the ground that the best interest of the 
school required it. The court in delivering the opinion 
said in part: 
Upon the whole evidence we are constrained to the con- 
clusion that in this particular school the plaintiff failed to 
‘portray the requisite qualities of temper, discretion, and

fortitude of a good teacher, and thereby and by his own fault, 
deprived the school of the benefit of all the good qualities he 
commanded. .. . The directors were justified in dismissing 
him, as they did, for sufficient cause. 
In Tingley vs. Vaughn ”° the school directors were 
held to be justified in annuling the contract with 
Vaughn after he became suspected of immorality, al- 
though there was no proof of specific acts of vice 
against him. The court said in part: 
If suspicion of vice or immorality be once entertained 
against a teacher, his influence for good is gone. The par- 
ents become distrustful, the pupils contemptuous, and school 
discipline essential to success is at an end. . . . The evidence 
in this record shows sufficient cause under the statute to jus- 
tify the appellants in annulling the contract. 
Dismissal at the option of the board.—There is con- 
siderable difference of opinion among the courts re- 
garding the validity of the provision in a contract that 
the teacher may be dismissed at the option of the 
board. In a Wisconsin case the board had provided in 
a teacher’s contract that: ‘‘We reserve the right to 
close the school at any time if not satisfactory to 
us.’’?6 Upon discharge of the teacher before the term 
of the contract had expired she brought suit to recover 
for the remaining time. She was granted judgment 
by the supreme court which ruled that such a provision 
was unauthorized by law and not valid. The court in 
rendering the decision said in part: 
The only power which a board has to discharge.a teacher 
is the power which they may exercise on behalf of the dis- 
17 Til. app. 347.

THE LEGAL AND SOCIAL STATUS OF THE TEACHER 441 
trict when the teacher is guilty of some breach of contract 
which at common law would justify an employer in discharg- 
ing his servant, or when the teacher has lost all right to teach 
the school by reason of annullment of his certificate in the 
way prescribed by statute. 
A board was upheld by the Illinois supreme court in 
1898 in the case of Olney School District vs. Christy.2” 
The contract contained the clause, ‘‘The continuance 
of an engagement with teachers is at the option of the 
directors.’? The teacher taught five months under this 
contract and was then discharged. She brought suit 
to recover salary for the month following her dis- 
charge. The lower court granted her a judgment. The 
board appealed to the appellate court which ruled that: 
By the terms of the contract they could dispense with her 
services whenever they saw fit to do so, and were under no 
legal obligation to state any cause for their action. 
Whether the courts hold such a provision valid or 
not, it is unprofessional and undignified for a teacher 
to sign a contract containing a proposition so humili- 
ating. 
Dismissal for marriage-——We do not find that the 
legal status of a female teacher who marries while 
under contract to teach has been tested in the Illinois 
courts. Illinois has no statute covering this point or 
governing boards of education in the making of rules 
or contracts with regard to this matter. In fact, Illi- 
nois statutes are silent regarding the causes for which 
a teacher may be dismissed. This being true, boards 
in Illinois may adopt and enforce a rule that would 
make marriage a cause for dismissal.

setting up marriage as an additional cause for dis- 
missal is not valid. Even in cases where the statute 
states broadly that, ‘‘A teacher may be dismissed for 
cause only,’’ the courts hold that a board rule, dis- 
missing a teacher who married while in service, is ca- 
pricious and unreasonable and therefore invalid and 
have sustained the teacher in her right to marry with- 
out forfeiture of contract or position. In 1915, the 
supreme court of Oregon affirmed a decision 78 issuing 
a mandamus for the reinstatement of a teacher who 
had married while in service, even though a board rule 
stated that a teacher by so doing would automatically 
resign. In 1914, in West Virginia it was held that the 
marriage of a female teacher ?° after the contract was 
made’ was not ground for its revocation or her re- 
moval. In 1904, in the State of New York, the supreme 
court held that a bylaw *° passed by a board of educa- 
tion, providing that if a female teacher married her 
place should become vacant, was void and that the 
teacher could not be discharged on the ground that this 
bylaw was a part of the contract. 
Duties and authority of teacher—The employment 
of a teacher carries with it the assignment of certain 
duties and authority that are by necessity inherent 
in the position. Perhaps the most important of these 
is the government and discipline of his school. The 
nature of school organization requires that the teacher

become responsible for discipline. It devolves upon 
him to maintain good order and to secure from pupils 
faithful performance of their school work. He must 
have power and authority to enforce, if necessary, 
prompt obedience. The celebrated Dr. Johnson wrote 
to his biographer, Mr. Boswell, in 1772 that: 
The government of a schoolmaster is somewhat of a mili- 
tary government. It must be arbitrary; it must be exercised 
by the will of one man, according to circumstances. 
Statutes generally provide that the board shall have 
the power to adopt and enforce all necessary rules and 
regulations for the management and government of 
the public schools of their district. To the teacher is 
delegated the responsibility of enforcing such rules as 
may be necessary and reasonable for the good conduct 
of the school. 
Corporal punishment.—The matter of corporal pun- 
ishment is covered in some instances by statute, in 
many instances by board rules, and in some instances 
by the principles of common law only. It is a matter 
that has brought teachers into court from time to time 
in every state in the Union. Cases are of record cover- 
ing practically every conceivable type of situation.*+ 
Under the principle of common law that the teacher 
stands ‘‘in loco parentis’’ the teacher is upheld in his 
right to inflict corporal punishment. A teacher, for 
the purpose of correction, represents the parent and 
has parental authority delegated to him; but this au- 
thority is not the full extent of the parent’s right.%?

A teacher has authority only to restrain and correct 
when necessary in carrying out the purposes for which 
he is employed.®* 
The teacher’s power is discretionary in matters of 
discipline. The law recognizes that, in cases of dis- 
cipline, no other person can have all the facts before 
him as the teacher has,—the offense, the acts, looks, 
nature, and needs of the child; and the extent of the 
influence of his conduct upon others and therefore 
courts are inclined to look with reasonable indulgence 
upon the efforts of a teacher to maintain good order 
and discipline in his school. Courts hold that in in- 
flicting corporal punishment a teacher must exercise 
reasonable judgment and discretion and must be gov- 
erned as to the mode and severity of the punishment 
by the nature of the offense and the age, size, and ap- 
parent powers of endurance of the pupil. The 
teacher inflicting corporal punishment must be consid- 
ered as acting in a judicial capacity and cannot be held 
for errors of judgment provided he acts conscien- 
tiously and from motives of duty.** If, however, it 
appears that punishment has been unreasonably severe 
or that it was administered with malicious intent,37 
the court will not shield the teacher and he is liable 
to answer a suit brought for assault and battery. Pun- 
ishment inflicted upon a pupil to whom the reason 
therefor is unknown cannot be justified.*®

  THE LEGAL AND SOCIAL STATUS OF THE TEACHER 445 
Under the broad principles of common law it is ob- 
vious that the teacher has the right to administer nec- 
essary and reasonable punishment. Those rights have 
remained unchanged since the rise of common law, but 
the meaning and interpretation of the words ‘‘neces- 
sary,’’ ‘‘reasonable,’’ ‘‘just,’? ‘‘proper,’’ ‘‘cruel,’’ 
‘Cexcessive,’’ ete., as applied to punishment are ever 
changing according to the state of civilization and the 
ideas prevalent at any particular time. Present day 
school organization, present day methods of instruc- 
tion, the content of present day curricula, and present 
day private and community interest in, and attitude 
toward school education, all have become factors tend- 
ing to eliminate the necessity for drastic punitive 
measures in connection with school management. Al- 
though only one state, New Jersey, has a statute pro- 
hibiting corporal punishment and comparatively few 
boards have rules or bylaws forbidding their teachers 
to use it, as a general practice, corporal punishment 
has gradually disappeared from our public school 
system. 
Teacher’s power to suspend and expel.—In pursu- 
ance of his duties in maintaining good order and disci- 
pline in his school and in enforcing reasonable rules 
for its government, the teacher has the power to sus- 
pend or expel a pupil for a breach of discipline or for 
gross misconduct.*® This power lies primarily in the 
teacher but his action must be subject to review and 
approval of the board. In some states the rights of 
teachers and boards to suspend and expel are defined 
. by statute. The causes for which a pupil may be sus-

  446 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
pended are usually stated in broad terms and a wide 
range of discretion is left to the school authorities. 
Court cases arise when pupil or parent questions the 
decision of teacher and board as to insufficient cause, 
unreasonable action, or malicious intent. In these 
cases suit is always brought against the board as rep- 
resenting final authority. Courts hold that no action 
can be maintained against a board who approve and 
sustain a teacher’s suspension of a pupil unless it can 
be proved that the board did not act in good faith. 
In McCormich vs. Burt,*° occurring at Ottawa, Illinois, 
the court said in part: 
A mere mistake in judgment either as to their duties or 
as to facts submitted to them, ought not to subject such 
officers to action. . .. The party complaining can have no 
action when such officers act in good faith in the line of what 
they think is honestly their duty. 
Control of pupils outside of school hours.—The au- 
thority of teachers in assuming responsibility for 
pupil’s conduct outside of school hours, whether the 
pupil be upon the school premises or entirely removed 
from the school grounds, is thoroughly established and 
generally recognized.‘ Courts hold that the power 
of school authorities over pupils extends to all acts of 
pupils which are detrimental to the good order and the 
best interests of the school, whether committed in 
school hours, on the way to and from school, or even 
in the pupil’s home. The supreme court in Iowa held 
that:

THE LEGAL AND SOCIAL STATUS OF THE TEACHER 447 
The view that acts, to be within the authority of the school 
board and teachers for discipline and correction, must be 
done within school hours is narrow and without regard to the 
spirit of the law and the best interests of the school.*? 
In Missouri a teacher was upheld for punishing a 
pupil for fighting and swearing on the way home from 
school.4? In Texas there is a parallel case.*#* The 
supreme court of Michigan upheld a teacher and the 
board of education in the enforcement of a rule re- 
quiring pupils to go directly to their homes at the close 
of school.t® The supreme court of Vermont upheld a 
teacher in punishing a pupil for using disrespectful 
language in the presence of another pupil while pass- 
ing the teacher’s house even though the pupil had 
returned to his own home before this occurred.** 
Teacher’s right to receive pay when school is closed. 
It is a general rule that no deduction can be made 
from a teacher’s salary for interruptions of the school 
sessions ‘7 unless special provision is made in the con- 
tract covering such contingencies. This principle ap- 
plies in case school is closed on account of an epidemic 
or in ease the school building is destroyed or rendered 
unfit for use by storm or fire. There are certain fac- 
tors which may enter into cases and cause exceptions. 
Space will not permit of their discussion. We find 
only one case of record in Illinois in which a teacher 
has brought suit to recover salary for time during 
which the school was closed on account of an epidemic.

This is the case of Phelps vs. District No. 109 4 
brought before the appellate court in 1921. The school 
had been closed by the state board of health on ac- 
count of influenza. The board refused to pay salary 
for the time during which the school was ordered 
closed. There was no provision in the contract cover- 
ing the point at issue. The teacher had held herself 
in readiness to teach during the time. The court 
granted the teacher a judgment for recovery in full 
and in delivering the opinion said in part: 
We are of the opinion, and so held, that appellee’s right 
of recovery for the time in question is not barred by the 
closing of said school on the order of the State Board of 
Health. Appellee under her contract was obliged to hold 
herself in readiness at any and all times to resume her duties 
as such teacher. She was not in a position to seek other 
employment. The closing of the school was not an act of 
God. The school district is liable under its contract for the 
salary agreed upon. 
Two cases in Illinois are of record in which the 
teacher secured judgment for recovery of salary after 
boards of education failed to provide quarters for the 
school when the building in one case was destroyed by 
fire and in the other by storm.*? The court held in 
each case that the teacher was prevented from fulfill- 
ing his part of the contract by the wilful act of the 
board in failing to provide other quarters for the hold- 
ing of the school.

reimburse him.®® If a teacher has undertaken such 
responsibilities and has advanced money for certain 
school purposes on his own initiative and his action 
has been approved and ratified by the board, by reim- 
bursing him they would set a precedent which might 
give rise to implied authority to make other similar 
expenditures, 
We find only two cases of record involving this prin- 
ciple. In the case of Noble vs. Williams,® occurring 
in Kentucky in 1912, the board failed to pay rent, 
buy coal, or provide seats. In order to conduct the 
school the teachers paid the rent and bought the sup- 
plies. The court refused to order the board to reim- 
burse the teachers. In the case of Taylor vs. District 
No. 6, Taylor hired a janitor without authority from 
the board and sought to recover for his expense but 
was refused judgment.®? 
Teacher’s legal residence——Going to another dis- 
trict, county, or state to teach may or may not affect 
a change of residence. As in all other questions con- 
cerning residence, the question as to whether a teacher 
in going to another locality to teach loses his resi- 
dence and gains another, is largely a question of fact 
determined by the element of intention. In Kluts vs. 
Jones in New Mexico °? in 1916 it was held that:

acter, which will tend to bring him into disrepute may

able proof that the allegations are true.°®° However,

teacher need not allege or prove special damages to 
sustain an action against a person making a slander- 
ous accusation.®8 
In 1910 in Carrol County, Illinois, a teacher was 
granted a judgment and damages against a school 
director on a charge of slander.®® She had taught the 
school two years and had been informally promised 
the position for a third year. Before she had secured 
a formal contract one of the directors, opposing her 
reappointment, made statements not only to other 
members of the board but to persons not in the pres- 
ence of board members which imputed immorality and 
tended to injure the teacher’s good name and reputa- 
tion as a teacher. She was granted judgment on the 
ground that the director had not made his communica- 
tions under circumstances of privilege and that he 
had not spoken from a sense of duty or with an honest 
belief in their truth. 
Teacher’s liability for slander——A teacher is liable

the publication in a local newspaper of a letter which 
he had written concerning the student. The supreme 
court granted the student a judgment and damages 
on the ground that the occasion of publication was 
not privileged and the fact of malice could not be 
evaded. In Michigan in 1917,*! a decision was ren- 
dered upholding the president of a normal school who 
had advised persons conducting a rooming house that 
a certain student was of undesirable character. The 
supreme court held the occasion to be privileged 
because: 
President McKinny would have been derelict in his duty 
if he had not conferred with these persons and advised them 
in the light of his knowledge and information concerning 
the student. 
Application of workmen’s compensation laws.— 
The majority of states have not placed school boards 
among employers under the application of their work- 
men’s compensation laws. The latest amendment in 
Illinois covering this point was adopted in 1919.°? It 
enumerates among employers affected, ‘‘The state and 
each county, city, town, and school district therein.’’ 
The states of California, Utah, and several others have 
compensation acts, the provisions of which are closely 
parallel to the Illinois statute. 
We find no cases of record in Illinois in which a 
school board has contested the payment of damages 
awarded to a teacher under the law. A Utah case ®

came before the supreme court of that state in 1920 in 
which the board refused to pay a teacher an award 
made by the commission. In rendering the decision 
the court held that: 
While it is true that the act merely requires school dis- 
tricts to pay the compensation provided for in the act, and 
does not provide how the funds shall be raised, yet that does 
not relieve the district from the duty of paying the compen- 
sation awarded. . . . If the money which is paid to a teacher 
or other employee of the district under the act is paid for 
school purposes, that is, for the support and maintenance of 
the schools, it still would be paid in furtherance of the trust 
with which school funds are impressed. . . . It is admitted 
that the only fund from which the board can and does pay 
premiums to insure the school buildings is the fund for the 
support and maintenance of the schools. ... The attorney 
general and his assistants contend that the phrase ‘‘support 
and maintenance of schools,’? when given proper force and 
effect, is ample in meaning and scope to cover the compen- 
sation provided for in the act. 
A California case °* came before the appellate court 
of that state in 1917. The court affirmed the award 
of the commission and the supreme court refused to 
grant retrial. 
A decision in Massachusetts in 1917 ® held that: 
A teacher in an occupational school who instructs in

the ground that it turns on the fine definition of terms 
and ignores the fact that the teacher was subjected 
to precisely the same dangers as a regular mechanic 
earning his wages by use of his hands. Public opinion 
will soon bring all schools under the application of 
compensation acts. 
B. The Social Status of the Teacher 
What is meant by social status?—The writer has 
searched in vain for a definition of the term ‘‘social 
status.’? The term ‘‘social’’ itself is all embracing. 
It includes within itself the economic, political, re- 
ligious, ethical, racial, and intellectual status. One’s 
standing in a community, whether the community is 
large or small, is roughly estimated in terms of the 
above factors. Is he economically dependent or inde- 
pendent? Is he a non-voter or an active participant in 
political affairs? Is he a non-member, inactive mem- 
ber, or actively identified with the religious welfare 
of his community? Is he a negligible, passive, ordi- 
nary, or potent moral force? Is he of a negligible or 
dominant race or family? Is he himself, regardless of 
race or family, a weak, average, or strong personal- 
ity? Is he from a low intellectual order, average, or 
superior? In other words, what is his standing in the 
community? What do his fellow citizens think of him? 
Is he looked upon as a citizen of influence whose judg- 
ment and opinion is sought, or is he looked upon as 
an outsider, transient, here today and gone tomorrow? 
Does the profession of teaching draw persons who are 
superior in most of these respects or only average or
-P-A-G-E-473
THE LEGAL AND SOCIAL STATUS OF THE TEACHER 455 
inferior? Who knows the answer to these important 
questions? 
Traditional status of the teacher.—Some of the 
stigma attached to teaching undoubtedly results from 
the humble plane occupied by public school teaching 
in earlier days. Critics and humorists should remem- 
ber that public school teaching as a profession is 
scarcely a hundred years old. The Greek and Roman 
pedagogues were frequently slaves. In the middle 
ages only monks and scribes knew how to read and 
write and they were looked upon as being unmanly 
because of this accomplishment. Even in America 
during the colonial period, teaching was not regarded 
as a high calling except in college and Latin grammar 
schools. Hzekiel Cheever and Lovell were excep- 
tional men. The social status accorded teachers in 
general was much lower than that accorded to them. 
From the early beginnings of public education in 
America teachers were for the most part either very 
young and inexperienced, or old, worn-out, and unfit 
for the more active and vigorous trades of pioneer 
days. Naturally, in the vigorous struggle for exist- 
ence imposed upon every individual in the early colo- 
nies the weak, the lame, the young, the inexperienced, 
and the aged and helpless were delegated tasks within 
their power. Furthermore, the schools were local in- 
stitutions and naturally political, social, religious, and 
charitable motives determined who were selected to 
teach children. Red-blooded men and women were re- 
quired at the frontier. The teacher was at the mercy 
of a great many personal and unpleasant influences. 
So strong was the competition in other professions
-P-A-G-E-474
  456 PERSONNEL PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHING STAFF 
like law and medicine, that these professions were able 
to cast off their failures. But the reverse was true in 
teaching. Other trades and professions were more 
attractive. Consequently, the teaching profession 
cast off its successes rather than its failures. 
With the entry of women into trades outside of the 
home, teaching became feminized. Women could be 
hired at a pittance. They had practically no economic 
status. By hiring women, taxes could be kept down. 
Thus, the stigma cf being a poorly paid and undesir- 
able occupation was early established. 
Evidence of improved status.—Gradually the status 
of the teacher has been improved. There is evidence 
that it is beginning to be regarded more highly by the 
public. Recently Counts asked 322 seniors of New 
England and Middle Western high schools to rank 45 
different occupations according to desirability. The 
occupations included army captain, insurance agent, 
ditch digger, physician, machinist, banker, college pro- 
fessor, high-school teacher, rural-school teacher, su- 
perintendent of schools (in a town of 50,000), factory 
manager, ete. The college professor was ranked third, 
the superintendent of schools fifth, the high-school 
teacher eleventh, the elementary-school teacher thir- 
teenth, and the rural-school teacher nineteenth. By 
common consent, the ditch digger received forty-fifth 
place. In only one school was rural-school teaching 
ranked on the average as low as twenty-third place. 
These young people doubtless reflect the general atti- 
tude of many kinds of homes on teaching. It is sig- 
nificant that teaching was ranked relatively high by 
this group.
-P-A-G-E-475
  THE LEGAL AND SOCIAL STATUS OF THE TEACHER 457 
Summary.—The social status of the individual 
teacher is determined for the most part by personal 
qualities and not by the profession. The individual 
teacher makes her own status. Perry summarizes 
the present status of the American teacher as follows: 
She has limited but rather definite legal authority with its 
attendant responsibility ; she has practically no official stand- 
ing; she is poorly remunerated financially; and her social 
and professional standing depends almost wholly upon her 
personal qualities and little upon the legal recognition of 
her calling. And yet we are conscious day by day of a gain; 
we may be confident that the teacher’s status of a generation 
hence will be far in advance of that of to-day. The State, 
if it is wise, will do much, on its own initiative, to further 
this advance; the citizens of the State will demand better 
and better service as they come more accurately to evaluate 
the worth of service; but no governmental paternalism, no 
civic impulse, can factor so tremendously as the enlightened 
effort of the teachers themselves to make themselves profes- 
sionally worthy. It is the physicians who have created the 
profession of medicine, it is they who maintain and advance 
its standards; it is the lawyers who have converted the prac- 
tice of law into a profession; so must it be the teachers who 
establish their vocation upon a professional footing.

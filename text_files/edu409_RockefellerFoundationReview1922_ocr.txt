Review of Work in 1922 
By GeorGeE E, VINCENT 
PRESIDENT 
THE YEAR IN BRIEF 
During the year 1922 the Rockefeller Foundation, either 
directly or through its departmental agencies, the Inter- 
national Health Board, the China Medical Board, and the 
Division of Medical Education, (1) endowed chairs of 
medicine and of surgery in Hongkong University; (2) 
pledged $1,125,000 toward new buildings for the College of 
Medicine of the State University of Iowa; (3) contributed to 
the current maintenance of two medical schools in Canada; 
(4) completed the buildings, strengthened the faculty, and 
wholly financed the Peking Union Medical College; (5) 
agreed to appropriate $300,000 toward laboratories and pre- 
medical teaching in two Chinese institutions and in one 
missionary university in Peking; (6) helped 19 hospitals in 
China to increase their efficiency in the care of patients and 
in the further training of doctors and nurses; (7) promised 
to co-operate in the rebuilding and reorganization of the 
medical school of Sao Paulo, Brazil, and of the medical 
school of Siam in Bangkok; (8) made a survey of medical 
schools in Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, Po- 
land, and Switzerland, and studies of English and Scotch 
methods of clinical teaching; (9) sent eminent medical men as 
visiting professors or consulting officers to China, the Philip- 
pines, Brazil, and Salvador; (10) arranged for a commission 
of medical scientists from Strasbourg to visit the United 
States and England; (11) gave emergency aid in the form of 
medical literature, laboratory supplies and apparatus, fel- 
lowships and stipends to promising investigators and teachers 
in the Pasteur Institute of Paris and in many other Euro- 
pean centers; (12) pledged two million dollars toward the

  Map or WorLpD-WIDE ACTIVITIES OF 
The Rockefeller Foundation is concentrating its resources upon a compara- 
tively limited range of activities within the closely related fields of public health 
and medical education. The public health program graphically presented on 
this map is carried on through the International Health Board. Work in the 
field of medical education is in charge of the Division of Medical Education, 
except the work in China which is done through the China Medical Board. 
Campaigns for the relief and control of hookworm disease were carried on in 
21 governmental areas throughout the world. Sixty-six demonstrations in 
malaria control were supported in 10 Southern States, and field studies in 
malaria control conducted in six other countries. Aid was extended to full- 
time county health departments in 163 counties in the United States, and 
similar work aided in Brazil. Activities for the eradication of yellow fever 
were carried on at the invitation of the government in Mexico and in other 
countries. French health agencies were assisted in antituberculosis work, 
Contributions were made to the development of schools of hygiene and other 
agencies for training health personnel in Brazil, Czechoslovakia, England, the 
Philippine Islands, Poland, and the United States. The sum of $32,840 a 
year for five years was given to the Health Section of the League of Nations 
to maintain an international epidemiological intelligence service, and $60,080 
a year for three years for international exchange of health personnel. Other

public health activities include: financial co-operation in a demonstration of rural 
health administration in the province of New Brunswick, Canada; temporary 
financial aid, with advice and counsel, in establishing a public health laboratory 
service in several American states and Central American countries, and a 
department of health in Czechoslovakia; the lending of experts as consultants. For the promotion of medical education, the Foundation gave $300,000 to 
the University of Hongkong; appropriated $500,000 toward a gift of $3,500,000 
for the medical school of the Free University of Brussels; continued payments 
on its gift to University College Hospital Medical School, London; paid sums 
pledged to five Canadian medical schools and to the Pasteur Institute in Paris; provided teachers or advisers in the medical school of the University 
of the Philippines and Salvador University; furnished scientific equipment 
and English or American medical literature to 82 European institutions; and 
made a study of medical schools and the needs of medical science in Europe. 
In China, one medical school was supported in full, and aid was given to 
two other medical schools, a number of hospitals, and the pre-medical science 
teaching in six institutions. 
Fellowships were provided for 237 individuals from 23 countries. A leading 
health authority and a commission of medical scientists from France were

maintaining institutes and instruction for health workers; 
(14) shared in 34 countywide and 32 town demonstra- 
tions of malaria control in ten Southern States and con- 
tinued field studies and surveys in the United States, Porto 
Rico, Nicaragua, Brazil, Palestine, Australia, and the 
Philippines; (15) co-operated with the Mexican and other 
governments in steadily restricting the prevalence of yellow 
fever; (16) resurveyed centers of hookworm infection 
in four Southern States, and carried on control work 
in 21 foreign governmental areas; (17) took part in 
promoting full-time health service in 163 counties in 
18 states of the United States, and in several counties 
in Brazil; (18) agreed to support for five years the 
disease-reporting service and for three years the interna- 
tional exchange of health personnel program of the 
Health Section of the League of Nations; (19) provided 
fellowships in public health, medicine, nursing, chemistry, 
and physics to 237 advanced students from 23 coun- 
tries; (20) by consultation and providing of personnel aided 
public health administration in the United States, Australia, 
Brazil, Canada, Central America, Czechoslovakia, France, 
the Philippines; (21) contributed to mental hygiene projects, 
demonstrations in dispensary administration, hospital in- 
formation service, surveys of nursing education and hospital 
management, the organization of tuberculosis work in France, 
the training of French health visitors, and other undertakings 
in the fields of public health and medical education. 
THE FIRST DECENNIUM 
The Rockefeller Foundation was incorporated May 14, 
1913, under a special charter granted by the State of New 
York and with an initial endowment of $100,000,000, the 
gift of Mr. John D. Rockefeller. Administration was en-

THE FIRST DECENNIUM 9 
trusted to an original board of nine members, who were 
given the power to add to their number and to choose their 
successors. A few weeks later the Rockefeller Sanitary 
Commission, which had 
since 1910 been combating 
hookworm disease in the 
Southern States, was re- 
organized as the Interna- 
tional Health Board and 
became a departmental 
agency of the Rockefeller 
Foundation. In 1914 a sim- oe et 
ilar subsidiary, the China ies pay etal er at 
Medical Board, was created This and five other Canadian medi- 
age 2 cal schools have received contributions 
to administer a program of toward a general program of develop- 
medical education in the ™™* 
new Oriental republic. The rapidly developing work of 
the Foundation in aiding medical schools in many countries 
led the trustees in 1919 to set up a Division of Medical 
Education. Through these agencies the Foundation has 
co-operated during its first decade, chiefly in public health 
projects and the improvement of medical education, with 
governments and institutions in 60 countries. 
During the first year or two, while the trustees were con- 
sidering questions of policy, gifts were made to a variety of 
institutions and projects, for example, the Palisades Inter- 
state Park, a Wild Life Refuge in Louisiana, the American 
Academy in Rome, an investigation of industrial relations, 
and to various other objects which no longer fall within the 
scope of the Foundation’s work. By the terms of gift, the 
founder retained the right during his lifetime to direct the 
distribution, in fulfilment of the purpose of the charter, of 
“$2,000,000 of the income annually. This resulted in nu- 
merous appropriations to a wide range of charitable and 
religious societies up to July 19, 1917, when Mr. Rockefeller 
waived his right of designation and left the unrestricted

control of the entire principal and income in the hands of 
the trustees. 
With the outbreak of the World War, the Foundation was 
one of the first American agencies to send a relief commission 
to Belgium and other Continental countries, but as soon as 
the Commission for Relief in Belgium and the American Red 
Cross assumed responsibility the trustees withdrew their own 
agents and made contributions for relief through these so- 
cieties. The war program of the Rockefeller Foundation in- 
cluded medical and surgical research and instruction through 
the Rockefeller Institute, the Medical Division of the Na- 
tional Research Council, and other centers; welfare work 
for soldiers and prisoners through the agencies equipped for 
this purpose; food and. clothing supplied in part directly 
but chiefly through the Commission for Relief in Belgium, 
the American Relief Administration, and the American Red 
Cross; and a war emergency campaign against tuberculosis 
in France. The total sum spent by the Foundation on war

work was nearly twenty-two and one half million dollars. 
From the outset the example of the Rockefeller Institute 
for Medical Research, the success of the International 
Health Board in applying scientific knowledge, and the 
interest of the Foundation in aiding Western medicine in 
China suggested policies which have been consistently de- 
veloped. Public health work in co-operation with govern- 
ments called for a supply of specially trained men and 
women. The dependence of sound preparation for pre- 
ventive medicine upon an efficient general medical education 
became increasingly clear. Thus the Foundation has come 
to concentrate its attention and resources upon the closely 
related fields of public health and medical education. Even 
in these large spheres it has concentrated upon activities 
which are described and illustrated in this Review. 
During the past ten years the Rockefeller Foundation has 
received from Mr. John D. Rockefeller a total of $182,- 
704,624. Its total disbursements have amounted to $76,- 
800,000, representing the income from year to year and 
$17,500,000 appropriated from principal. In addition it has 
pledged future income to the extent of $15,600,000. 
MEDICINE AN INTERNATIONAL PRODUCT 
Modern medicine has been likened to a river whose many 
ributaries have, during the centuries, flowed from all 
quarters of the world. From Egypt, Babylonia, India, 
China came rivulets of mingled superstition, empirical art, 
and positive knowledge. Greece was a copious spring from 
which a growing volume of insight, skill, and wisdom welled 
even from Homeric times down into the early centuries of 
the Christian Era. Rome was a sandy plain absorbing 
rather than augmenting the stream of medical lore which 
found three channels, through southern Italy, Byzantium, 
and the Arab civilization, into the deepening current of the 
Renaissance. Thence, flowing on into modern times, the 
medical tradition has become a broad river swollen by 
tributaries from Italy, France, Holland, Britain, Germany,

On this map are shown (1) the countries in which surveys of medical educa- 
tion have been made by representatives of the Foundation up to the end of 
1922, and (2) the location of medical schools aided during 1922 
Scandinavia, Russia, the United States, the British do- 
minions, Japan, and other countries. 
A mere enumeration of the names famous in the history 
of medicine affords striking evidence of its international 
character. Hippocrates, Aristotle, and Galen, the Greeks; 
Rhazes and Abbas, the Persians; Avenzoar, the Arab; 
Mondino and Morgagni, the Italians; Vesalius, the Belgian; 
Paré, the Frenchman; Harvey, Hunter, and Jenner, the 
Englishmen; Boerhaave, the Hollander; Johannes Miiller, 
the German; and the moderns, Pasteur, Koch, Lister, 
Virchow, Ehrlich, Manson, Metchnikoff, and Reed. Since 
1901 the Nobel prize for contributions to medical science 
has been awarded to 18 men of 12 different nationalities: 
four to Germans, two to Frenchmen, two to Russians, two 
to Danes, and one each to an American, an Austrian, a Bel- 
gian, an Englishman, an Italian, a Spaniard, a Swede, and 
a Swiss. 
Obviously, international co-operation in creating medical 
science depends upon communication of ideas from worker 
to worker and from country to country. Hippocrates, 
Celsus, and Galen produced a body of medical literature.
-P-A-G-E-15
MODERN MEDICINE 13 
Arab authors transmitted it to Western Europe. Today 
every leading country is producing a copious literature in 
the many departments of modern scientific medicine. To 
the prompt interchange of information which this printed 
matter makes possible is in part due the rapid contemporary 
progress in medical research and practical procedures. The 
interruption of this traffic in ideas during the World War 
was a serious thing. The Rockefeller Foundation is helping 
to restore such commerce to something like its normal 
state by the distribution of medical periodicals in Europe. 
Quite as important as the circulation of the printed page 
are personal intercourse between leaders of science, and the 
migration of advanced students. The early pioneers in 
medicine set an ex- 
ample of itinerant 
pursuit of knowledge 
and experience. 
Hippocrates, born 
in Cos, studied at 
Athens and 
traveled frequent- 
ly in Thrace, 
Thessaly, and 
Macedonia. Ga- 
len, a native of 
Pergamus, re- 
ceived his medi- 
cal education at Alexandria and finally made Rome his 
headquarters. Vesalius left his birthplace in Brussels to 
study or teach at Louvain, Paris, Venice, and Padua, and to 
travel in Spain and Palestine. Medical students from many 
nations used to resort to the famous schools of Italy, France, 
and Holland. In the nineteenth century the rapid progress 
of German medicine drew physicians and advanced students 
from abroad to many German and Austrian universities and 
clinics. Berlin, Vienna, Paris, and London each attracted 
representatives from parts of the world where medicine was

less advanced—Southern Europe, Central and South Amer- 
ica, the United States, Japan, and the British dominions. 
The formation of international scientific associations has 
helped to create a sense of solidarity among medical scien- 
tists. | Since 1867, 17 international medical congresses 
have been held in the chief capitals of Europe and one in 
Washington. The Rockefeller Foundation, by granting 
fellowships for study outside the holders’ own countries, by 
inviting commissions from foreign nations to visit the 
United States and other countries, by enabling the Health 
Organization of the League of Nations to finance the inter- 
migration of health officers, and by other methods, is help- 
ing medical scientists and practitioners of all nations to 
work together more effectively. 
FROM MAGIC TO MICROBE 
Auguste Comte in his Positive Philosophy asserted that 
every body of knowledge passes through two stages, the 
theological and the metaphysical, into a third, the positive or 
scientific. In the first stage happenings are attributed to 
the action of spirits and divinities; in the second, to ab- 
stract entities; while in the third, causal connections are 
ignored and the scientific mind is content merely to record 
the fact that certain things always occur simultaneously or 
in sequence. There is enough truth in Comte’s so-called 
law to make it suggestive and useful, although his statement 
is too precise and mechanical. 
The growth of medical science has followed in a general 
way Comte’s law. The practice of medicine has often been 
a function of sorcerers, magicians, priests, and astrologers. 
The very term “medicine man” is significant. Among 
primitive people today, the healing art is saturated with 
superstition, fear of evil spirits, faith in the efficacy of amu- 
lets, charms, weird potions, and grotesque cures. But 
the ignorance, superstition, and credulity about disease 
and its cure displayed by the great populations of Europe 
and America should make for humility. The advertise-
-P-A-G-E-17
MODERN MEDICINE 15 
ments in many newspapers, the flourishing of palpable 
quacks, the prevalence of preposterous cults, the crazes 
which sweep through whole nations, are striking evidence 
that our civilization 
is only on the border 
line of the scientific 
stage. Higher edu- 
cation itself seems 
far from guarantee- 
ing immunity 
against the attacks 
of a primitive 
credulity.

relatively free from pices of the Siamese Red Cross Society, which 
superstition. After Heetenenie leading part in the fight against hook- 
the Renaissance, 
medicine began a steady advance. Anatomy flourished with 
Vesalius; with Harvey physiology was revived; Morgagni and 
Bichat created pathology; von Baer reorganized embryology; 
the theory of organic evolution gave an impetus to medical 
research; with Pasteur and Koch bacteriology came into its 
own; biochemistry has assumed a fundamental réle. In 
spite of many survivals of mysticism and metaphysics which 
will long persist, modern medicine has entered the scientific 
stage. 
METHODS, SPIRIT, AND SCOPE OF MODERN 
MEDICINE 
Medical science, in common with other sciences, relies 
upon observation, comparison, and experiment, or upon a 
combination of these methods. The anatomist by ob- 
servation and comparison, that is, by dissection of human 
and animal bodies and by examination of the living, maps 
and describes the intricate structure of organic forms and 
studies the laws of growth and development. The physi-

Crystallogapher, mycologist, bio- 
chemist, pathologist, immunologist, 
founder of modern bacteriology, al- 
though never receiving a medical 
degree, Louis Pasteur, whose cen- 
tenary is now being celebrated, has 
had perhaps more influence on medi- 
cal science and public health than 
any other man in modern times. It 
can be said without exaggeration 
that millions of human lives have 
been saved by his discoveries. The 
Pasteur Institute of Paris, which he 
founded, is receiving aid from the 
Rockefeller Foundation during the 
period in which it is recovering from 
the effects of the War 
  ologist by physical means, by 
chemical analysis, by obser- 
vation of men, and by experi- 
ment upon animals gains in- 
sight into the nature of vital 
processes. The tacteriologist 
by observing through the 
microscope the minute plants 
and organisms which live in 
blood and tissues, by intro- 
ducing them into animals 
under varying conditions, and 
by comparing results discovers 
definite and verisable facts 
about the causes of health 
and disease. The pathologist 
studies by microscopic meth- 
ods, by examination of mor- 
bid growths, by experimenta- 
tion upon animals, the nature 
and effects of organic diseases. 
The results which each man 
secures and the methods he 
employs are made publie and 
are then tested by other in- 
vestigators. Mere personal 
opinion and unverified asser- 
tion have no place in modern 
scientific medicine. 
Upon the physician falls the task of discovering the cause 
or causes of disease in individual patients and of helping 
them to regain a state of normality or health. This is often 
a much more complicated and difficult thing than the duty 
laid upon the laboratory scientist. The bedside practitioner 
must apply knowledge supplied by anatomy, physiology, 
pharmacology, biochemistry, pathology, bacteriology, to 
which he must add his own personal experience, data de- 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
MODERN MEDICINE 17 
rived from records of many cases, and the summarized ob- 
servations and conclusions of other clinicians. Medicine in 
this sense is obviously an art based upon science rather 
than an exact science in itself. When the doctor has at his 
disposal in a given case all the data that modern methods 
can furnish, temperatures, blood pressures, blood counts, 
chemical and bacteriological tests, X-ray plates, reports of 
similar cases, his own recorded or remembered experience, 
the testimony of his own trained senses, he must interpret 
all these facts by a careful process of logical reasoning and 
organize them into either a final judgment, or into a tentative 
hypothesis, which is subject to further tests by later develop- 
ments. ‘This calls for careful preparation, the scientific 
attitude, sincerity, and constant hospitality to new knowl- 
edge and improved methods. 
The spirit of modern medicine is, then, scientific; it seeks 
to be open-minded toward new truth, provided this can be 
rationally related to the great body of firmly established and 
organized knowledge about nature, life, and mind, about 
which all scientific men agree. Scientific medicine cannot 
accept ideas which are merely mystical, or imply unknown 
and unverifiable physical or chemical properties, or invoke 
supernatural intervention, or are in other ways clearly fan- 
tastic or beyond the reach of any available demonstration or 
experiment. So also modern medicine refuses to be labeled 
with the name of any school or cult. It is committed to no 
“pathy’’; it knows no panacea; it is prejudiced only in favor 
of conclusions drawn by soundly reasoned processes from 
exact and verified facts. It recognizes the intricacy of its 
problems; it realizes that only a beginning has been made; 
it does not hesitate to admit ignorance or to suspend judg- 
ment. Its constant aim is the discovery of truth and its 
application to human need. These ideas, it must be ad- 
mitted, are the conscious principles of a relatively small 
number of the medical men of the world. But the modern 
scientific spirit is permeating the great body of practitioners 
who have in the past too much relied upon dogmatic
-P-A-G-E-20
18 ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
diagnosis, rule-of-thumb, ‘“‘shot-gun” prescriptions, and a 
cheerful bedside manner. The personality and attitude of 
the physician toward his patients ought to be important 
sources of power and success but they should supplement 
rather than take the place of the scientific method and 
spirit. 
The scope of modern medicine is as wide as the range of 
influences, physical, biological, mental, and social, which 
affect health. It has been asserted with some reason that 
in its preoccupation with the diseases of the body, scientific 
medicine has too much neglected the psychic and social 
factors. The rapid spread of cults which invoke various 
forms of mental suggestion, is probably due in some measure 
to the failure of modern medicine to include in its scope the 
relations of physical and mental states, to study these in a 
scientific spirit, and to utilize the healing powers of rationally 
controlled sugges- 
tion. Recent prog- 
ress in psychiatry, 
the war-time experi- 
ence with disorders 
of the mind, the rise 
of mental hygiene, 
and the increased 
attention being 
given to these sub- 
jects in medical

relations, and economic status—factors which often have a 
vital bearing upon the condition of the patient. Thus 
modern medicine is coming to appreciate that its problem 
is not merely the body of the sick man, but the larger whole 
which includes his mental states and his physical and social 
environment. Perhaps the most important and significant 
extension of the scope of modern medicine is into the field 
of prevention by providing immunity through vaccination 
against many communicable maladies, by co-operating 
largely with public health authorities, by insisting on fre- 
quent examinations to detect incipient defects and diseases, 
and most of all by urging conformity to the laws of personal 
hygiene and the seeking of positive, vigorous, abounding 
health. 
PUBLIC OPINION AND MEDICAL PROGRESS 
In democratic countries like the United States, Great Brit- 
ain, Canada, and Switzerland, the popular estimate of the 
social value of science, the general esteem in which scientific 
men are held, the willingness of legislative bodies and of pri- 
vate citizens to supply funds, and the readiness of leaders and 
people to accept and apply the results of scientific research 
are determining factors in the progress of knowledge. Unless 
the leaders of opinion and a substantial proportion of the 
adult population appreciate the aims and methods of science, 
understand something of the value of evidence, are familiar 
with reasoning processes, and are prepared to recognize the 
authority of disinterested experts, science cannot attain the 
place it deserves or render the service of which it is capable. 
Chemical, electrical, and mechanical engineers have won 
distinction and recognition because their work is tangible 
and convincing both to the trained leader and to the man 
in the street. The medical scientist, with vastly more com- 
plex problems to solve, must ask for the support of a much 
more intelligent, imaginative, and sympathetic form of 
public opinion. For example, as preventive medicine grad- 
ually restricts or eliminates certain common diseases, the 
maladies which remain may be those relatively much more

  20 ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
difficult to deal with. Unless the public appreciates this 
fact, doctors in the future may be plausibly but quite un- 
justly charged with being less efficient than their prede- 
cessors. 
On the whole, the response of popular governments, of 
democratic publics, and of individuals to the demands of 
modern medicine has been encouraging. Medical schools, 
teaching hospitals, and research institutes have been im- 
proved, multiplied, and supported by private gifts and 
public grants. Public health activities have been widely 
extended; their efficiency has steadily increased; appropria- 
tions for them have rapidly mounted. Yet in spite of these 
evidences of at least popular acquiescence there are dis- 
heartening instances of an almost benighted ignorance. If 
there is any one thing that has been repeatedly demonstrated 
to the complete satisfaction of all well-trained minds capable 
of dealing logically with evidence it is that vaccination for 
smallpox affords an extraordinary immunity against that 
disease. In autocratic Germany before the war, thanks to 
a strict enforcement of vaccination, smallpox was almost 
unknown. In the United States, on the other hand, the 
disease is widely diffused; in some regions it is almost 
endemic. From time to time it breaks out in towns and 
cities. It is not uncommon for individuals and groups to 
resist vaccination. Occasionally the law is defied and’ re- 
mains unenforced. Anti-vaccination societies carry on 
fanatical campaigns of misrepresentation, offering misleading 
statistics, invoking the authority of discredited physicians, 
citing unverified cases, and making emotional appeals. The 
very sincerity of such agitators is at once an evidence of 
mental instability in the population and an added danger 
to sound thinking and wise social policy. 
The question of animal experimentation, a vital necessity 
to medical research, has a direct bearing upon the relation 
of public opinion to scientific progress. If the anti-vivisec- 
tionists could have their way they would forbid by law 
procedures which have saved and will in the future save

surgery and our present knowledge of such diseases as 
diabetes, smallpox, tuberculosis, diphtheria, cerebrospinal 
meningitis, tetanus, puerperal fever, syphilis, rabies, bu- 
bonic plague, relapsing fever, cholera, and yellow fever. 
The only protection which medical science and social welfare 
have lies in the public opinion to which legislatures must in 
the long run defer. If the leaders of opinion, educational

THE TRAINING OF DOCTORS 
The growth of scientific medicine during the last 50 years 
has radically changed the prerequisites, subject matter, 
organization, methods, equipment, duration, and cost of 
medical education. Knowledge and technique have enor- 
mously increased. Demands upon the time and energy of
-P-A-G-E-24
  22 ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
teachers have grown heavy and exacting. The expenses 
for laboratories, teaching hospitals, salaries, and supplies 
have mounted rapidly. Under the new conditions the earlier 
apprenticeship system has disappeared, although close 
association between the student and his teachers is valued 
and is retained in the best contemporary schools. The 
proprietary medical college manned and managed by a 
group of practicing physicians has been unable to maintain 
  
      
Srarr or THE Department or Mepicine, Pexina Union Mepicau CoLiece 
itself in competition with privately endowed or publicly 
supported schools. Private practitioners, however, still con- 
stitute the great body of clinical teachers in most medical 
schools the world over. 
The new conditions have produced the typical modern 
center for teaching and investigation, the unified university 
medical school in a stimulating scientific and cultural en- 
vironment, controlling its laboratories and hospitals under 
the direction of full-time staffs. Only a few university 
schools throughout the world have reached or approximated 
this standard. The tendency, however, in all advanced 
countries is toward this university type. Traditional pre-
-P-A-G-E-25
; MEDICAL EDUCATION 23 
conceptions, the vested interests of practitioner professors, 
unfamiliarity with new ideas and methods, and lack of 
funds are the more obvious obstacles to progress. A leading 
.aim of the Rockefeller Foundation is to further the develop- 
ment of medical schools of the university type by diffusing 
information, training personnel, and, in important centers, 
by making appropriations toward endowment or buildings 
or both. 
The idea of teaching the medical student all that is known 
about health and disease is on the face of it absurd. There 
is complaint already that too much is being forced upon him, 
and that he has no time to think for himself. It is agreed 
that the undergraduate medical course should not seek to 
give a complete education but to ground the student in the 
fundamentals of knowledge and technique and inspire in 
him the scientific spirit and a sense of social obligation. 
These necessary limitations are resulting in the development 
of graduate teaching. The time seems to be coming when 
all the surgical and other specialties and advanced labora- 
tory work will be taught as graduate subjects. 
The raising of standards, with consequent lengthening of 
the medical course and the increase of its cost to both in- 
dividual students and to society, gives rise to a number of 
serious questions. The shortening by two years of the com- 
bined elementary and secondary school period is advocated 
by some in order to reduce the age at which a doctor may 
begin his career. The granting of more scholarships to 
promising students is urged. There is agitation for a 
shorter, less expensive type of training to maintain the 
supply of general practitioners, on the theory that many 
superficially trained doctors will settle in rural districts 
which now lack resident physicians. Other people foresee 
a system of local hospitals serving surrounding areas by 
out-post dispensaries and visiting nurses. While some 
differentiation may be expected between doctors who go 
into general practice immediately and those who pursue 
graduate studies in the specialties, there is no reason to 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
  24 ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
suppose that in advanced countries the standards of medical 
education will be lowered. The tendency at present is in 
quite the opposite direction. 
FROM BRUSSELS TO BANGKOK 
The Foundation’s constructive program in medical edu- 
cation during 1922 included an agreement to contribute 
$1,125,000 toward the building project of the State Uni- 
versity of Iowa; contributions to the maintenance funds of 
the medical schools of the Université de Montréal and the 
University of Alberta, Canada; completion and maintenance 
of Peking Union Medical College; annual gifts to the medical 
schools of Shantung Christian University, Yale-in-China, 
and St. John’s University, Shanghai; the endowment of 
chairs of medicine and of surgery in Hongkong University 
Medical School; an agreement to assist the Siamese govern- 
ment to reorganize its medical school in Bangkok; a similar 
proposal to the medical school of Sao Paulo, Brazil; the 
lending of expert administrators or teachers to the Sao Paulo 
school as well as to Peking Union Medical College, the 
University of the Philippines, and the medical school of 
Salvador. Besides all this, surveys of medical schools 
were made in Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, 
Poland, and Switzerland. 
In addition to the 12 schools mentioned in the first para- 
graph of this section, the Foundation has during recent 
years made substantial contributions to eight others. The 
Free University of Brussels is receiving three and a half 
million dollars for the construction of a modern medical 
center. Five millions have been given to University College 
and to University College Hospital Medical School, London, 
to enable them to improve their equipment and teaching 
efficiency. In Canada a half million was contributed to the 
medical school of Dalhousie University, Halifax. A million 
was added to the medical endowments of both McGill 
University, Montreal, and of the University of Toronto. 
The University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, received a half

been pledged toward the important projects which are 
being carried out by Columbia University and the Uni-

The different ways in which the Foundation may come into 
relations with a medical school vary from the making of an 
official visit to large gifts for buildings or endowments. Be- 
tween these limits lie the sending of information about build- 
ings, organization and administration, emergency provision 
of literature and laboratory supplies, temporary resident 
fellowships, the lending of experts, the training of teachers, 
and the making of appropriations for specific purposes.

the United States, medical schools are of distinctly different 
grades as measured by personnel, equipment, resources, and 
ideals. In spite, however, of great variation in quality, all 
these centers of teaching are more or less directly dominated 
by the aims and methods of modern medicine. It is one 
aim of the Rockefeller Foundation to hasten the development

MODERN MEDICINE IN CHINA 
To one medical school—the Peking Union Medical College 
—the Rockefeller Foundation through the China Medical 
Board sustains a unique relation. This institution, recon- 
structed upon foundations laid by a group of missionary 
societies in 1906, and administered by its own Board of Trus- 
tees, is entirely supported by the Foundation. This medical 
center is the chief feature of a program by which the China 
Medical Board seeks to promote scientific medicine in China. 
The important developments during 1922 were connected 
with pre-medical education. Offers were made to two Chi- 
nese institutions, Southeastern University, Nanking, and 
Nankai College, Tientsin, and to the missionary university in 
Peking, to contribute toward science laboratories and equip- 
ment, to lend visiting professors, to grant fellowships for 
further training of Chinese teachers, and to add to mainte- 
nance funds. In previous years the Board made somewhat 
similar arrangements with St. John’s University, Shanghai, 
Hunan-Yale School, Changsha, Fukien Christian University, 
Foochow, Ginling College, Nanking, and Canton Christian 
College. Because it is important for the success of the Peking 
Union Medical College that it should draw students from a 
wide range of preparatory schools and colleges, the Board has 
adopted a policy of aiding not only foreign but Chinese in- 
stitutions. 
In the Peking Union Medical College, in the pre-medical 
school, and in the nurse training school, the total registra- 
tion of undergraduates in September, 1922, was 124. During 
the previous year 58 graduate students registered for special 
courses or served as assistants. In addition to the courses 
conducted by the regular staff of 49 foreign and 27 Chinese 
teachers, special instruction was given by distinguished 
visiting professors from the University of Vienna, Harvard, 
Northwestern, and Johns Hopkins Universities, and from tha
-P-A-G-E-30
  28 ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. The cost of 
maintaining the College and its hospital for the year 1921- 
1922 was $547,533. 
Hospitals well equipped, adequately staffed, and advan- 
tageously located are essential to the introduction of modern 
medicine in China. Many missionary hospitals and a few 
under Chinese control are serving the cause not only by car- 
ing for patients, but by raising the professional and ethical 
standards of Chinese practitioners, and by educating the 
Chinese public in the meaning of scientific medicine. To 
come into closer and more sympathetic relations with the 
public, the Peking Union Medical College has recently ap- 
pointed a co-operating committee of prominent Chinese to 
aid in interpreting the College to the community. 
Recently the X-ray department of the Peking Union Med- 
ical College has helped a number of hospitals to install new 
equipment or to readjust old apparatus. The services of an 
advisory architect have been made available for hospital ad- 
ministrators. In 1922 the Board aided directly 19 hospitals, 
of which one was Chinese. Since 1915 gifts totaling $659,- 
487 have been made to 32 different hospitals. For all pur- 
poses the China Medical Board has since its organization 
disbursed $13,292,504. 
While the Peking Union Medical College was being rebuilt 
a considerable number of fellowships for study abroad were 
granted to Chinese and to missionaries on furlough. But as 
soon as facilities for advanced study were available in 1921, 
fellowships were granted for study in Peking and aid for 
foreign study limited to students who show capacity for ad- 
vanced work which Peking cannot provide, or who are in 
training for influential teaching positions. Other activities 
of the Board have included grants for translating medical 
books into Chinese and for improving the journal of the China 
Medical Missionary Association, for office and secretarial 
field service, and for popular educational work. 
The Foundation has so far almost wholly refrained from 
undertaking work in preventive medicine in China. The
-P-A-G-E-31
MEDICAL EDUCATION 29 
International Health Board’s co-operation in a hookworm 
project at the Pinghsiang colliery in Central China served 
chiefly to demonstrate the difficulty of permanent accom- 
plishment under existing conditions. The absence of stable 
and efficient central and provincial governments; popular 
ignorance of modern medicine; peculiar biological, social, 
and economic conditions; and the lack of trained personnel, 
make public health progress at present extremely difficult. 
The problem is not, however, being ignored. A member of 
the staff of the International Health Board is attached to the 
Peking Union Medical College, where he gives instruction 
to undergraduates in hygiene and public health, administers 
the health service of the College, conducts special courses in 
school hygiene, and spends part of his time in the field study- 
ing health conditions. With the gradual growth of Western 
medicine in China, progress in public health may be expected.

In 1922, the China Medical Board made to this university one of its first 
grants for pre-medical teaching under purely Chinese auspices. Southeastern

capital of China
-P-A-G-E-32
  30 ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
ceipt of periodicals and books provided by the Rockefeller 
Foundation. Save for a small contribution to a committee in 
Austria for food packages for medical scientists, the Founda- 
tion has left to other organizations the task of emergency re- 
lief and has concentrated efforts upon helping to maintain the 
continuity of scientific work by filling gaps in medical libra- 
ries, contributing apparatus and supplies to laboratories, 
supplementing the stipends of productive research men, 
granting fellowships for foreign study, and inviting com- 
missions to make international visits. 
During the years of the war, the medical libraries of Cen- 
tral Europe received almost no publications from the Allied 
countries, which in turn had only fragmentary information 
as to recent scientific progress in Germany and Austria. 
There was danger that valuable time and precious materials 
would be wasted upon unconscious duplication of results or 
that fruitful ideas would come to naught because they could 
not be related to others which would give them significance. 
Primarily in the interest of modern medicine as an interna- 
tional product, the Rockefeller Foundation began in 1920 to 
assist in the distribution of British and American medical 
journals to European medical centers. Losses in exchange 
were made good and 
the pre-war purchas- 
ing power of library 
funds thus restored.

places committees of scientists arranged for the abstracting

and circulating of periodicals and thus utilized them to the 
utmost. 
The wearing-out of apparatus and the depletion of current 
supplies in scientific laboratories were inevitable results of the 
war. The medical schools of Vienna, Gratz, Budapest, Inns- 
bruck, and Prague were among the first to suffer acutely. To 
these the Foundation made grants which were wisely and 
economically administered by local committees. Surveys 
made during 1922 showed that German and Polish labora- 
tories were approaching the conditions from which Austria 
had suffered two or three years earlier. It was decided, 
therefore, to extend the scope of emergency laboratory aid. 
Serious as were the problems of literature, equipment, and 
supplies, the question of personnel was absolutely vital. It 
was feared that the continuity of scientific progress might 
be interrupted, because young men either would be unable 
to go on with their studies or could not be trained to the old- 
time efficiency. To assist the Pasteur Institute of Paris to 
recruit and educate research assistants the Rockefeller 
Foundation pledged in 1921 the sum of $75,000 to be 
paid in three instalments during 1921, 1922, and 1923. 
Fellowships for foreign study (see page 46) have been 
awarded to men and women in Austria, Belgium, Czecho- 
slovakia, England, France, Netherlands, Hungary, Jugo- 
slavia, and Poland. Their appointment, training, and return 
undoubtedly had an encouraging influence on the main- 
tenance of standards and the progress of medical science. 
Until the autumn of 1922 it had not seemed necessary to 
grant fellowships to men for study in their own countries, 
but the plight of medical scientists in Germany and increased 
cost of research menaced the quality, if not the very exis- 
tence, of German medical science. Representatives of the 
Foundation after a first-hand study recommended a program 
of emergency relief which was adopted by the trustees in 
December, 1922. Under this plan a committee of German 
medical scientists will apportion to a group of exceptionally 
promising investigators and teachers sums of money to be
-P-A-G-E-34
32 ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
supplied by the Foundation to be used for moderate in- 
creases of personal stipends and for necessary apparatus, 
supplies, books and periodicals. The German government 
has agreed that this money shall be free from all taxes upon 
either institutions or individuals. Again it should be noted 
that this is not a project of general relief for a needy class, 
but a selective program in the interest of medical science 
throughout the world. 
MEDICAL EDUCATION AND PUBLIC HEALTH 
The strengthening of medical schools, and emergency aid 
for medical scientists have a direct bearing upon the essential 
task of preventing disease, which is one of the leading ideals 
of scientific medicine. The dependence of this movement 
upon the knowledge, skill, and social spirit of the medical 
profession is too generally overlooked. Statistics of births, 
deaths, and sickness furnish the facts by which public health 
policies and procedures are guided. The data are supplied 
almost exclusively by practicing physicians. If they are 
competent diagnosticians and conscientious in making 
reports, the resulting statistics are trustworthy; otherwise 
they are incomplete and misleading. If doctors are familiar 
with modern laboratory tests, they may not only safeguard 
their individual patients but by prompt notification of con- 
tagious diseases protect the community. The extent to 
which a public diagnostic laboratory is utilized is one index 
of the intelligence, alertness, and social-mindedness of the 
profession in the area which the laboratory serves. The 
success of campaigns to improve water and milk supplies, 
to reduce infant mortality, to make medical examinations 
of school children, to establish special clinics, to introduce 
or extend public health nursing is conditioned in large 
measure upon the attitude of local physicians. 
It is immensely to the credit of the profession that doctors 
have been among the pioneers and leaders in the develop- 
ment of preventive medicine.. They had the imagination 
and faith to realize that the chief purpose of medicine must
-P-A-G-E-35
PUBLIC HEALTH 83 
be to keep people well, rather than to rest content with 
alleviating or curing diseases which might have been avoided. 
During the last 50 years scientific medicine Has discovered 
the causes of many maladies and has learned how to protect 
individuals and communities against them. Many diseases 
formerly dangerous may now be discovered in their earliest 
stages and effectively controlled. Then, too, knowledge 
about the normal conditions of healthy living has so increased 
that people may be measurably helped to maintain sound 
minds in 
sound bod- 
ies. Further-

vention have Sruppents at Work In THE Puysics LaBoraToRy

been elabo- 
rated so that not only striking reductions in death-rates but 
other evidences of positive well-being have been manifested. 
It is primarily to medical schools that society must look for 
the training of men and women who as the doctors of 
the future may be counted upon to preach and practice 
the gospel of health. 
  THE TRAINING OF HEALTH STAFFS 
Emphasis upon the preventive side of medicine in medical 
schools is gradually changing the attitude of the medical 
profession as a whole, but it cannot turn out public health 
administrators ready to head city and state departments of 
health. The too prevalent idea that any practicing phy- 
sician is capable of discharging the duties of a health officer 
needs to be vigorously combated. Such a post ought to be 
filled by a person who in addition to a basic medical prep- 
aration has had specialized training for what has become a 
distinct profession. This training includes lecture courses
-P-A-G-E-36
  84 ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
and laboratory and field work in the causes of contagious 
diseases and methods of controlling them, in sanitary engi- 
neering, vital statistics, administration, and other subjects. 
Only recently have special schools been organized to give 
training of this kind. The leaders in the public health

So little satisfied are they with the school of experience 
that they welcome heartily the new institutions. 
The International Health Board has from the outset been 
impressed with the need for trained sanitarians. It has wel- 
comed opportunities to co-operate in establishing schools of 
public health. During 1921 a request was received from the 
British Ministry of Health, to share in the creation of such a 
training center in London. Negotiations resulted in an 
agreement by the International Health Board of the Rocke- 
feller Foundation to give $2,000,000 for land, building, and 
equipment for a school which the British government has 
undertaken to maintain. A site on Gower Street near the 
British Museum and University College Medical School has 
been purchased, and a committee is at work upon a scheme 
of organization and plans for a building. This School of 
Hygiene in London will occupy a strategic position. For 
teaching purposes it will command the great scientific re- 
sources, public health records, and the well-trained expe- 
rienced personnel of the unusually efficient health services of 
Great Britain. By virtue of the position in the British  
-P-A-G-E-37
PUBLIC HEALTH 35 
capital, the new institution will exert an influence throughout 
the Empire. It seems likely, also, to serve as a training center 
for prospective health officers from many other nations. 
Similar institutions which have been assisted during recent 
years are the School of Hygiene and Public Health of Johns 
Hopkins University, the School of Public Health of Harvard 
University, and, on a smaller scale, institutes of hygiene in 
Prague and Warsaw, and a department of hygiene in the 
Sao Paulo medical school, Brazil. or all these enterprises 
the Foundation has appropriated or pledged nearly ten mil- 
lion dollars. 
It will of course be many years before these professional 
schools can supply the demand for trained leaders. Many 
members of a specialized health department staff, such as 
statisticians, sanitary engineers, nurses, bacteriologists, labo- 
ratory technicians, and inspectors, will be prepared in other 
university departments, in special schools, or as apprentices 
in the service. Meantime a large number of men and women 
now in active health work must be given additional instruc- 
tion in connection with their duties. Hence the organization 
of special local institutes for instruction and demonstration 
and for personal contact with well-known leaders. In 1922, 
the Board contributed toward the expenses of such institutes 
in four states and continued to support an experimental 
correspondence course for local health officers, the success of 
which was sufficient to suggest the offering of a similar 
course for public health nurses. 
CLOSING IN ON YELLOW FEVER 
Definite progress was made during 1922 in the Inter- 
national Health Board’s campaign to drive yellow fever from 
the world. The comparatively small number of reported 
cases of the disease were confined to Mexico, to a restricted 
area in northern Brazil, to points on the West Coast of 
Africa, or to ships en route from one of these countries. The 
Mexican authorities warmly welcomed and supported the 
co-operation of the Board. To one familiar with the history

  YeLtow Fever in Rerreat 
Map of Western Hemisphere showing steady reduction cf infected areas 
of yellow fever, the fact that for a whole year Central 
America, the West Indies, and all but one country of South 
America were free from the scourge which for nearly two 
centuries ravaged these regions, is strikingly significant. It 
is hard to realize that this latest phase of the fight on yellow 
fever began only five years ago. 
The earlier stages of the campaign are well known. Fol- 
lowing the discovery by Ross that malaria is transmitted by 
the mosquito, American Army medical officers, headed by 
Walter Reed, in 1900 proved conclusively that yellow fever 
is spread only by the infected female Stegomyia mosquito.
-P-A-G-E-39
PUBLIC HEALTH 37 
By depriving the Stegomyia of access to water in which to 
lay her eggs, and by screening houses against such mos- 
quitoes as matured, General William C. Gorgas, first in 
Cuba and later in the Panama Canal Zone, achieved a nota- 
ble control of yellow fever. Inspired by these triumphs, 
Dr. Oswaldo Cruz succeeded in ridding Rio de Janeiro of the 
disease, a feat soon emulated by Dr. Licéaga at Vera Cruz. 
In succeeding years yellow fever was gradually restricted 
to certain seed-beds whence from time to time it spread over 
considerable areas. 
The fear lest the opening of the Panama Canal might 
carry yellow fever to the dense population of the Orient, 
and General Gorgas’ faith that the menace might be entirely 
removed resulted in a decision of the Board to undertake a 
campaign of eradication. In 1916 General Gorgas visited 
Central and South America, made a report, and recom- 
mended systematic efforts to put an end to the disease in 
well-known endemic centers, such as Guayaquil in Ecuador, 
Merida in Yucatan, and an area in North Brazil. He also 
advised investigation of suspected foci in Venezuela and on 
the West Coast of Africa. Measures were promptly adopted. 
Dr. Hideyo Noguchi, of the Rockefeller Institute for Med- 
ical Research, made investigations in Guayaquil and Merida, 
discovered the yellow fever germ and prepared a vaccine 
and a serum which have since given encouraging results. In 
November, 1918, a campaign was begun in Guayaquil with 
the result that since June, 1919, no case has been reported 
there. Meantime General Gorgas organized national 
yellow fever commissions in the chief countries concerned. 
Epidemics were checked in Central America. <A serious 
outbreak in northern Peru was promptly controlled. General 
Gorgas was at the head of a commission on its way to West 
Africa when he died in London in July, 1920. Gradually 
the remaining sources of infection in the Caribbean region 
were traced to Mexico, and the Mexican government invited 
the co-operation of the Board. It is too early to predict a

complete victory, but the successors of General Gorgas 
share his faith that it will in time be won. 
CONTROLLING MALARIA AT LOW COST 
The disease which in 1753 an Italian called malaria because 
he thought it came from “bad air’’ has a long and sinister 
history. It is believed that the ancient Egyptians knew it. 
Hippocrates clearly described it. The decline of Greece and 
Rome is attributed largely to malarial fevers. In 1640 
cinchona bark was introduced into Europe from Peru and 
was gradually employed as a specific remedy. Various 
medical men studied the disease and connected it with 
marshy areas. One suggested the possibility that the mos- 
quito might be involved. In 1820 an alkaloid called quinine 
was obtained from cinchona bark. Knowledge about the 
malady grew until in 1880 Laveran, a French army surgeon, 
discovered the organism which causes malaria. Ross in 
1897 demonstrated the transmission of the malaria organism 
by mosquitoes. MacCallum’s studies completed the knowl- 
edge of the life cycle of the parasite. Contributions from 
many other sources rapidly confirmed and expanded Ross’s 
results. Experiments in control of mosquitoes by use of oil 
and larva-consuming fish were carried on. By 1910 a tech- 
nique had been worked out for the prevention of malaria 
through drainage, screening, and other methods of mosquito 
control, and through the use of quinine. 
Gorgas employed these methods in Panama. Ross, at 
Ismailia in Egypt, and Watson, in the Federated Malay 
States, achieved striking results. Italy introduced a wide 
distribution of quinine supplied free by the government. 
In 1912 the United States Public Health Service began 
studies and experiments in Mobile, Alabama, in conjunction 
with the State Department of Health. The work was later 
extended to Louisiana. A demonstration was made in 
1914-1916 in a cotton-mill town in North Carolina, following 
a successful effort to control malaria in a lumber camp in 
Mississippi. During the war the Public Health Service
-P-A-G-E-41
PUBLIC HEALTH 389 
efficiently discharged the duty of protecting 43 areas in the 
vicinity of army camps in 15 states. 
Practically all of these projects were directly supported by 
government. Many of them had to be carried through 
almost regardless of cost for the sake of industrial or military 
ends. The question as to whether a small city, a town, or a 
rural area could be protected against malaria at a cost 
which the local population could afford remained to be 
answered. It was to test the possibility of effective control

Tue UBIQUITEERS 
“Ubiquiteers,” meaning “Men from Everywhere,” is an international public 
health fraternity organized in 1922 in the School of Hygiene and Public Health 
of Johns Hopkins University by the holders of International Health Board 
fellowships. In the year 1921-1922 these fellows represented more than a 
dozen countries 
at a low per capita expense that the International Health 
Board began in 1916, in co-operation with state and federal 
authorities, a series of demonstrations in small towns in 
Arkansas and Mississippi. The net result of these experi- 
ments was so encouraging, that for the season of 1920 wide- 
spread demonstrations were begun under the joint auspices 
of the local governments, state health departments, the 
United States Public Health Service, and the International
-P-A-G-E-42
40 ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
Health Board. The program for 1922 included 34 county- 
wide malaria control demonstrations and 32 town demon- 
strations in ten states. All the demonstrations have af- 
forded cumulative proof that under normal conditions an 
average community can practically rid itself of malaria at 
a per capita cost of from 45 cents to $1 per year. In addi- 
tion, the Board conducted experiments in mosquito control 
by use of fish and by screening under a variety of conditions, 
and tested the curative and protective possibilities of quinine. 
HOOKWORM DISEASE AS AN EDUCATOR 
The relief of a disabling malady prevalent throughout 
areas inhabited by nine hundred million people of the world 
is sufficiently important in itself. But the control of hook- 
worm infection has another and even more significant 
value. It is an 
effective means 
of educating 
people in the 
meaning of public 
health work and 
of persuading 
them to support 
more comprehen- 
sive measures 
for preventing 
other diseases as 
well. For   
  Using Paris Green To Kini tHe Larvan or THE 
Mataria Mosquito 
It hasrecently been found that Paris green is an 
inexpensive and efficient means of controlling the 
malaria mosquito, especially useful in waters so 
choked with vegetation that fish cannot reach the 
larvae. _ The Paris green, mixed with some fine 
dust, is thrown into the air as shown in the picture. 
When it settles on the surface of the water it 
poisons the larvae of the malaria mosquito. Un- 
fortunately it does not harm the larvae of other 
mosquitoes the 
facts about hook- 
worm disease are 
fairly simple and 
easy to under- 
stand. Even an 
illiterate person 
may with the aid of charts, pictures, microscope, and 
oral explanation follow the course of the tiny, burrowing 
larva as it makes its way from the soil where it has hatched
-P-A-G-E-43
  PUBLIC HEALTH 41 
from an egg, through the skin of a man into the blood, which 
carries the parasite into the lungs. From there it penetrates 
to the throat, is swallowed into the digestive tract, and at 
last burying its hooks in the walls of the intestine, clings to 
its host, impoverishing his blood and robbing him of vi- 
tality. The eggs which the worms lay pass out to infect the 
soil and to start another life cycle. The method of admin- 
istering a vermifuge by which the parasites may be elimi- 
nated is simple. The worms themselves may be put under 
the microscope to convince the sceptical. This device, to be 
sure, is not universally successful. In the remote regions of 
a foreign country, for example, a doubting observer refused 
to admit the actu- 
ality of the squirm- 
ing organisms. “At 
the cinema,” hesaid, 
“I see lions and 
tigers, but they are 
not really there.” 
Not only the cure, 
but the prevention 
of hookworm disease 
through sanitation 
and latrines can be Since its organization in 1913, the International 
made clear and con- Health Board has conducted campaigns for the 
ghee . relief and control of hookworm disease in 39 goy- vineing. Experience  ernmental areas 
with anti-hookworm 
campaigns in many countries has proved that the disease can 
readily be used as a means of educating the public in the 
possibilities of preventive medicine. 
In the year 1922 the International Health Board had a 
part in hookworm control activities in 22 governmental 
areas in the United States, the West Indies, Central America, 
South America, and the Far East. Since 1911 the Board 
has co-operated in 69 states and countries. In 54, control 
measures were carried out; in 15 others only surveys were 
made. The policy of the Board in this work has been: 
(1) to undertake control measures only on the invitation of 
  A Hooxworm Dispensary IN CEYLon
-P-A-G-E-44
  42 ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
a government which (2) bore from the first at least a small 
part of the expense, and agreed (3) to take on each year an 
increasing proportion of the cost until it finally (4) assumed 
entire responsibility for the continuance of the project. In 
order to measure the progress of control the Board in the 
last three years made re-examinations of school children in 
66 counties in the Southern States and compared results 
with those of the original surveys, which were made between 
1910 and 1914. On the average a reduction of 47.5 per cent 
was shown. In one county a decrease of 94 per cent had 
taken place; in several, over 80 per cent; in only one was an 
increase disclosed. 
Simple and well-understood as hookworm control may 
seem to be, the fact is that new knowledge is constantly 
leading to the adoption of new methods. The Board’s staff 
in the field constitutes in a true sense a body of research 
workers who are always on the alert for information and 
improved 
methods.

  problems of 
sanitation, treatment, and education. Important field 
studies in Trinidad and Porto Rico show that hook- 
worm larvae cannot travel far through the soil and co not 
live more than six weeks. This localizing of infection and 
self-sterilizing of the soil have afundamental bearing on the 
problem of sanitation. 
THE COUNTY AS A HEALTH UNIT

of the public that it has ceased to be a separate project in

the United States and has become one item in a larger 
undertaking organized as a task of local government. Two 
hundred and sixteen counties in this country and six similar 
areas in two states 
of Brazil now have 
full-time county 
health depart- 
ments. This rural

ing nurses 1n homes units is the well-baby clinic for the examination of 
and schools, medi- infants and children of pre-school age and the in- 
daltesninationrat struction of mothers in child hygiene 
children, sanitary inspection, special clinics, and by 
health education for old and young. The typical staff is 
made up of four whole-time workers—a health officer, a 
nurse, a sanitary inspector, and a clerk. The usual cost of 
this service is about $10,000 per year. Many populous and 
well-to-do counties spend more; a few get on with less. 
Comparisons of relative declines in urban and country 
death-rates in recent years, the contrast disclosed by physical 
examination of city and country children, and studies of 
sanitary conditions on farms, all revealed disquieting ten- 
dencies. The idyllic myths about the pure water of the old 
oaken bucket, the salubrious country air, the invigorating 
exercise of bucksaw, spade, and hoe, had to be rudely 
revised in the light of facts. The health program is only one 
item, but an essential item, in the national effort to make 
country life wholesome, happy, and rewarding to the millions 
who produce the food and staples of the whole population. 
During 1922 the Board gave money to the health budgets 
of 163 counties in the United States and of six counties in 
Brazil. In most cases the Board’s share in budget and
-P-A-G-E-46
  44 ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
responsibility is being gradually transferred to state and 
county. The gradual spread of the county health unit 
idea is based upon the sound principle of local support with 
only partial and usually temporary aid from central de- 
partments and voluntary agencies. There is a temptation 
to impose from above a system and to maintain it by large 
government subsidies or private gifts. Up to a certain point 
such stimulus and guidance may be useful but the danger 
is that the project will not take root in the local life. In a 
democracy permanent progress depends upon the slow 
process of convincing whole communities and getting them 
to recognize an activity as a collective duty. The Board 
seeks not to take the place of government agencies but to 
help them educate their constituencies to recognize that a 
given health project is desirable, feasible, and economically 
possible. 
PROMOTING INTERNATIONAL HYGIENE 
Not only is the scientific basis of preventive medicine an 
international product, but the application of it has called 
for increasing co-operation among the countries of the 
world. The first European conference to consider health 
problems was held in 1851. Twelve nations were repre- 
sented. Concerted measures against cholera, plague, and 
yellow fever were adopted. Thereafter at intervals of a few 
years other congresses were called to insure better team- 
work in preventive medicine. In 1902 an International 
Sanitary Bureau was established in Washington by the 
Pan American Union. Finally in 1908 a permanent Inter- 
national Office of Hygiene was established in Paris under 
the auspices of 13 nations. Voluntary associations have also 
a part in this common battle against disease. The League 
of Red Cross Societies, with headquarters in Paris, includes 
public health activities in its international program. The 
medical congresses already mentioned have had an important
-P-A-G-E-47
  PUBLIC HEALTH 45 
bearing on the spread of public health knowledge and prac- 
tice. The work of the Rockefeller Foundation which is 
described in this Review lies largely in the field of inter- 
national hygiene. 
The most significant development in this movement is the 
recent creation under the League of Nations of a Health 
Organization which has the direct support of 52 nations 
and the sympathetic co-operation of the United States. 
The new body has reached a working agreement with the 
International Office of Hygiene in Paris and will doubtless 
have cordial 
relations 
with the In- 
ternational 
Sanitary 
Bureau. The 
program of

conditions for sailors on shipboard and in ports, co-opera- 
tion with League mandatories, with the Commission on 
Opium, and with the International Labor Office. 
The International Health Board has made appropriations 
to the League of $344,440, to be used over a period of three 
to five years in a demonstration of the feasibility and value 
of an international epidemiological service and an inter- 
national exchange of health officers. The first of these 
interchanges of health officers has taken place. Sanitary 
officials of Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Jugo- 
slavia, Poland, and Russia to the number of 21 met in

Brussels October 8, 1922. After a series of lectures, con- 
ferences, and demonstrations the officers visited various 
health districts in Belgium. Then they went to Italy, where 
a similar plan was carried out. The whole program lasted 
for about ten weeks. It is expected that these interchanges 
between different countries will take place three or four 
times a year and will promote efficiency and a sense of 
professional comradeship across national boundaries.

Through its fellowship plan the Foundation provides for both men and 
women an opportunity for study in the United States and other countries to 
fit them for leadership and technical efficiency. These fellowships promise 
to be one of the most important means of promoting international co-opera- 
tion in preventive medicine and medical education 
Foundation are providing advanced training for men and 
women who are preparing themselves for careers in these 
fields. During 1922 the total number of fellowship holders 
was 237. Of these, 164 were appointed directly through 
departments of the Foundation, while 73 were selected and 
supervised by special committees of the National Research 
Council. The list does not include 105 fellows studying at
-P-A-G-E-49
  PUBLIC HEALTH 47 
the Peking Union Medical College, nor bourses for 157 health 
visitors in France and for 7 French nurses in London hos- 
pitals. The International Health Board granted 79 fellow- 
ships, the China Medical Board 63, and the Division of 
Medical Education 22. Twenty-three countries were 
represented in these three groups, as follows: China 64, 
Brazil 20, Czechoslovakia 16, United States 12, Poland 10, 
Canada 8, Philippine Islands 4, Australia 3, Austria 3, Hun- 
gary 3, Nicaragua 3, Syria 3, Colombia 2, Japan 2, Jugo- 
slavia 2, Siam 2, Ceylon 1, Costa Rica 1, England 1, Mau- 
ritius 1, Mexico 1, Peru 1, Salvador 1. Of the 73 American 
fellowships administered by the National Research Council, 
29 were assigned to chemistry, 26 to medicine, and 18 to 
physics. From its inception in 1915 to December 31, 1922, 
431 fellows have studied under this fellowship plan. 
The fellowship policy of the Foundation aims at flexi- 
bility, selection, and specific preparation. No fixed number 
of fellowships is assigned to any one subject or country. 
Only candidates of exceptional promise are chosen, to whom 
positions in government or institutional service have been 
assured on the completion of their studies. The Inter- 
national Health Board, in helping to create institutes of 
hygiene in Prague and Warsaw, grants fellowships for the 
training of the staffs of the new schools. In the same way 
the China Medical Board prepares Chinese to assume 
teaching responsibilities in the Peking Union Medical Col- 
lege and other schools in China, and the Division of Medical 
Education will educate future professors in the reor- 
ganized Royal Medical College, Bangkok, Siam. The 
Foundation’s experience shows that progress in its chosen 
fields is limited chiefly by lack of capable, well-trained per- 
sonnel. The fellowships are being used to overcome this 
obstacle. 
WORKING THROUGH NON-GOVERNMENTAL 
ORGANIZATIONS 
The plan of co-operation with governments has been em- 
phasized. The Foundation also works with voluntary
-P-A-G-E-50
  48 ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
institutions and organizations of many kinds. From time 
to time temporary committees are created for special tasks. 
To these and to more permanent organizations the Founda- 
tion makes contributions for specific purposes and for limited 
periods. Occasionally aid is given for a test of some project 
with the understanding that if it proves successful it will 
be supported by funds from other sources. During the year 
1922 the Foundation has co-operated directly and through 
its Boards with the following agencies which work in the 
fields of medical education and public health: 
French Health Agencies. The International Health Board 
in withdrawing its antituberculosis commission from 
France has transferred to the Comité National de Défense 
contre la Tuberculose and to five nurse training schools 
certain functions and temporary appropriations. Since the 
commission began its work in France in 1917, it has co- 
operated in the establishment of more than 300 dispensaries, 
provided special courses for 228 doctors, helped to train 289 
health visitors, carried on educational work in 65 depart- 
ments, and expended a total of $2,119,945. 
Committee for the Study of Nursing Education. Under the 
auspices of this Committee, named in 1919 by a conference 
representing all phases of opinion on the problem of nurse 
training, a thorough study of the functions and education 
of both bedside and public health nurses has been made by 
Miss Josephine Goldmark. The Foundation called the 
original conference and paid the expenses of the survey, but 
did not participate in the work and is not responsible for the 
recommendations, which may be summarized as follows: 
(1) the public health nurse should have a training equiva- 
lent to, but not identical with, that of the bedside nurse; (2) 
present standards of knowledge and efficiency should be 
maintained; (3) a subsidiary grade of nursing service should 
be provided, under careful restrictions; (4) the status, equip- _ 
ment, and teaching personnel of the nurse training school 
should be improved and the pupil nurses relieved of hospital 
drudgery; (5) the course should be shortened from three
-P-A-G-E-51
PUBLIC HEALTH 49 
years to 28 months; and (6) university schools of high grade 
for the training of leaders, i. e., teachers and administrators, 
should be developed. 
Committee on Training of Hospital Executives. Appointed 
at a conference called by the officials of the Rockefeller 
Foundation, this Committee asked Dr. Willard C. Rappleye, 
now superintendent of the New Haven Hospital, to make a 
study and prepare a report. 
This was published in April, 
1922. It shows (1) the 
need, as a basis for the 
training of superintendents, 
of an understanding of 
the place and functions 
of the modern hospital; (2) Beng be :

Committee on Dispensary Development, New York City. 
Appointed by the United Hospital Fund and supported by 
the Foundation, this Committee has sought to (1) demon- 
strate improvements in dispensary service, (2) increase the 
interest of the medical profession and laymen, and (8) 
stimulate financial support for new projects. Plans for 
co-operation with the Presbyterian Hospital were developed, 
field studies have been made, local stations for health 
examinations established. The outstanding feature of this 
Committee’s program is: 
The Cornell University Pay Clinic, which undertakes to 
furnish a high grade of medical service at fees which can be 
met by individuals and families unable to afford the usual 
private rates for the medical service which their conditions 
require. The clinic aims to be self-supporting except so far 
as teaching requirements for students are concerned. In 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  50 ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
the year ending October 31, 1922, 22,536 different individuals 
paid 114,108 visits to the clinic. During the first ten 
months of the demonstration 719 physicians referred 1,110 
patients to it. While the point of complete self-support has 
not been reached, it is believed that with some readjustments 
in plan and rates the budget can be balanced. The need and 
demand for service of this kind have been demonstrated. 
National Committee for Mental Hygiene. Besides con- 
tributing to the general budget of this organization, the 
Foundation made special appropriations for the support of 
surveys and uniform statistics of mental deficiency and men- 
tal diseases. 
Hospital Library and Service Bureau, Chicago. A small 
contribution was made to this agency which disseminates 
information with regard to hospital construction, equip- 
ment, organization, administration, relation to the com- 
munity, and so forth. 
National Research Council, Washington. Certain fellow- 
ships supported by the Foundation are administered by 
special committees of the Council (see page 46). The 
Foundation is also contributing through the Council for a 
transition period to the budget of the Concilium Biblio- 
graphicum of Ziirich, which it is hoped will become a part 
of a comprehensive international bibliographical service. 
American Medical Association. The Foundation shares 
with the Association the annual deficit involved in the 
publication of a Spanish edition of the Journal of the Ameri- 
can Medical Association for circulation in Spanish-speaking 
countries. 
In fulfilment of ten-year pledges made in its early years 
appropriations were continued to certain institutions whose 
work no longer falls within the scope of the Foundation’s 
program. ‘These appear in the list of appropriations for 
1922 on page 58.

appeals made to the departmental agencies within their own 
fields. The lists of individuals and organizations whose 
requests have been declined either by the officers or the 
Executive Committee are laid before the trustees, but it 
does not seem courteous or just to make these details 
public. The Foundation has consistently adhered to the 
policy of declining to make gifts or loans to individuals, to 
invest in securities which have a philanthropic rather than 
a business basis, to assist in securing patents or aiding 
altruistic movements which involve private profit, or to 
support propaganda which seeks to influence public opinion 
on social, economic or political questions.

The balance of more than seven millions carried over 
from 1921 included refunds on appropriations of 1922 and 
previous years which were not all called for. Every effort 
is made to forecast the 
sum needed for each activ- 
ity in a given year, but 
it often happens that the 
entire amount set aside is 
not used. At the end of 
the year such unexpended 
remainders are returned to 
thetreasury. In the aggre- 
gate these refunds amount 
toaconsiderablesum. The 
income for 1922 approached 
nine millions, but even 
  “Tur WuHo.e Story in a Tin Can” 
“The Ankylostome’” (The Hook- 
worm), one of the ubiquitous Fords, has 
been of great service in the hookworm 
campaign in one district of India. 
Throughout the East, as in many other 
parts of the world, the automobile 
speeds up the work of the hookworm 
campaigns. A field unit carrying with 
it all necessary educational material can 
give lectures and demonstrations these combined resources 
wereinadequate. The trus- 
teesvoted therefore tospend 
six millions from the princi- 
pal funds. Thus the total 
amount available for dis- 
bursement was more than throughout the day and evening, and 
return to administer treatments the fol- 1 z twenty - two millions, of lowing day in the same villages 
which almost sixteen mil- 
lions were paid out. Of the remainder, nearly four and 
one half millions were mortgaged by outstanding obliga- 
tions, leaving almost two millions for use in 1923 in 
addition to the income for that year. Of the sixteen 
millions disbursed twelve millions were for buildings and 
endowment, and four millions for the operating or current 
expenses of the institutions aided. A table on page 56 
gives an analyzed statement of the total expenditures of 
the Foundation for its first ten years, ending December 
31, 1922. On pages 58 and 59 are summaries of expendi- 
tures for the year 1922 and of funds and property.

PUBLIC HEALTIL 53 
“‘THE WELL-BEING OF MANKIND 
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD’’ 
The foregoing pages have described the movement for 
scientific medicine and public health from an international 
standpoint. It must be owned that there is today a sug- 
gestion of irony in smooth phrases about co-operation, 
understanding, and good-will among the nations. Suspicion, 
distrust, detraction, hatred, and threat of war are all too 
prevalent in the relations of the peoples of the world. 
Scientific comradeship and common tasks of hygiene seem 
almost negligible as bonds of unity. But the difficulty of a 
task is no excuse for not attempting it. Because it is not 
possible to predict the early dawn of a millennial peace, 
there is no good reason for not taking steps which seem to 
lead toward even a remote era when nations may substitute 
generous rivalry for deadly conflict. To stimulate world- 
wide research, to aid the diffusion of knowledge, to multiply 
personal contacts, to encourage co-operation in medical 
education and public health are the means by which the 
Rockefeller Foundation seeks to be true to its chartered 
purpose, which is to promote, not the exclusive prosperity 
of any one nation, but “the well-being of mankind through- 
out the world.”

contributions to many American medical schools. The Foundation has at the initiative of 
that Board joined a it in pledges to medical schools of the universities of Chicago, Colum- 
Bee and Iowa. To December 31, 1922, payments have been made only on the pledge to 
icago.

  Im connection with an early gilt the Founder reserved the right to designate charities, within 
the chartered purpose of the Foundation, to which a part of the income should go. This 
right was formally relinquished in 1917, since which time no payments on account of such designation have been made. 
°The gift to Wellesley, as most of the others included in the classification “miscellaneous,” was 
made in the Osh years of the Foundation before the present policy of concentrating upon 
definite fields of activity had been adopted. Gifts to educational eaten phi the United States are a part of the program of the General Education Board, which i: 
Pare iey corporation; they are not now regarded as within the scope of the Rockefeller 
‘oundation. 
  Nore: In addition to figures reported above, the Foundation has paid out to 5] pecially, desig- 
nated charities income amounting to $4,850 annually on funds held for th he time being 
in trust for Mr. and Mrs. Rockefeller. The residuary estate of Mrs. Rockefeller received 
by the Foundation, amouodod to #487, 689, has been pads out in full in appropriations to 
the General Education Board, the Young Men’s Christian Association, and the Fifth 
Avenue Baptist Church of New York City.

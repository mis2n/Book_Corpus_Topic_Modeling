PREFACE. 
In this volume we have purposed to provide rote songs for Kinder - 
garten and the lower Primary Grades. We desire, first of all,to provide 
songs which the child will take joy in singing, and second,to lead him 
through song into a more conscious emotional relationship with the 
life he finds about him. The nature songs have heen written with 
this in view. We believe that folk-songs and folk-tales have a pecu- 
liar value and adaptability to child-life. Unfortunately the child of to- 
-day is in a way to miss this influence. He may be housed and fed and 
clothed in a more sanitary manner than formerly but he misses the lul- 
laby, the bed-time tale and Mother Goose at Mother's knee. The result 
is a large class of children lacking in rhythmic sensibility, in keenness 
of imagination, in power of emotional expression. 
Believing, as we do, that the great storehouse of folk-tale and folk- 
song holds food of unique value for the childs development, we have in- 
corporated in this book many settings of Mother Goose jingles,and trans- 
lations or arrangements. of folk- songs and games of other peoples. In 
arranging many of the games it has been thought wise to change the idea 
of the game while keeping its form. Many of these old round-games were 
played originally by grown men and women,and therefore the constant 
references to courtship, love, marriage and the like. In such games we 
have tried to substitute childish ideas while keeping the form of the game. 
Many of these games, such as the’ ‘Ferret? > “When I was a Farmer” 
etc. and the guessing and finger- games can be played as well in anor- 
dinary schoolroom as in a Kindergarten circle. 
Where, herein, music or words are accredited to others than our - 
selves, the work has been done by childrentrained along the lines which 
we have out-linad in“Hlements of English Verse?and“The Elements 
of Musical Expression) both published by Clayton F. Summy 00.,

  SECOND PREFACE 
Mediaeval France developed the game-song. Mediaeval England borrowed from 
France and Colonial America borrowed from Mother England, so the songs and games 
which have delighted children of the three countries for generations have the authority 
of tradition behind them. ‘Time has proved them, and youth today responds to their 
appeal as surely as in the olden time. 
Originally these game-songs were enjoyed by grown men and women, and many 
of them were, in reality, courting games. The songs were always simple, often with 
much repetition, and the method of play so obvious as to need little explanation. 
The games divide themselves into certain fixed types; the chase, the choosing 
of a partner for a dance or promenade, a guessing contest, etc., etc., and in many of 
them dramatic impersonation plays an important part, as the Old Witch in Chickery- 
crany-crow. 
In this book the method of play in these old games has been adapted to childish 
ideas, keeping the elements which have proved so popular for generations, such as the 
chase, guessing, and dramatic impersonation, and eliminating the features connected 
with the idea of courtship. ‘Thus the games become practical for children in kinder- 
garten and lower primary grades where-ever room for play is available. In Kinder- 
garten they will be played in the circle. In primary grades in any recreation space 
available—even the school-yard would serve in good weather. Some of the games, 
such as ‘‘How Many Miles Is It To Babylon’’ may be played in an ordinary school- 
room with desks by using the aisles for marching»and the free space in front for the 
“‘pull away.’’? In playgrounds where there is organized play under a leader these 
game-songs will be found especially useful.

  Ba DIRECTIONS FOR PLAYING GAME SONGS 
BAA-BAA-BLACK SHEEP. PacEl. TypE—A CHASE. 
One child impersonates the Black Sheep, the others join hands and rotate in a 
circle about him. The circle sings the first question to him and the Black Sheep 
sings the reply, designating as he does so, or at the end of the verse, a child to 
be the Master, the Dame and the Little Boy) These go inside the circle for 
the second verse, while the Black Sheep runs around the outside of it. At the 
end of the verse they must break through the clasped hands of the circle and 
chase the Black Sheep. ‘The one of the three who first touches him is in turn 
the Black Sheep and the game continues. 
HOW MANY MILES IS IT TO BABYLON? Pack 8. TypE—A CHoosING GaME AND TEST 
COMBINED. 
Select two children to be head-couple. They form an arch with their joined, 
uplifted hands. The rest march under this arch. The marching children sing 
the first question, and the head-couple the reply. Repeat this order on the second 
question and answer. All sing on: 
“Tf your heels are nimble and light 
“You'll get there by candle-light”’ 
returning to original order for final question and answer. At the end of verse 
the arms drop, enclosing a child, who is led one side to choose, out of hearing, 
one of the two things selected by the head-couple to symbolize themselves respect- 
ively, as: ‘‘strawberries or cherries’’ or ‘‘blue or pink.’’ According to his choice 
the child takes his place behind one of the Leaders and the game goeson. When 
all the marching children have chosen sides, they form in line behind the Leaders 
and ‘‘ pull away’’ to test the strength of the sides. ‘The side which succeeds in 
pulling the Leader of the opposing side over the ‘‘line’’ (a line drawn between 
the Leaders) wins the game. 
LITTLE MAID, PRETTY MAID. Pace 4. TypzE—A CHOOSING AND MARCHING GAME. 
Line up the girls and boys facing each other. If the lines are not equal, some of 
the girls or boys, as the case may be, must take the role of the other sex. During 
the playing of the prelude the boys run across to the girls’ line and choose their 
partners. Each boy now stands directly in front of his partner. Boys sing first 
question, bowing politely. Girls reply, curtseying. Boys offer arm, or hand if 
preferred, on: ‘‘Shall I go with thee?’’ Girlsrefuse on ‘‘No, not now’? but take 
offered hand, or arm, at the end of the verse. The head-couple (i. e. at the end 
of the line) now lift their joined hands and the couples march under, singing the 
second verse antiphonally, boys and girls. At the end of the second verse repeat 
the music for a march, which may be taken through any of the figures used in 
marching, by twos, fours, eights and back to twos again, etc. If it be desired to 
play this like a round-game, let the final march bring back the couples to two 
lines facing each other and begin as before.

AROUND THE CHRISTMAS TREE. Pace 6. Typz—A CHoosinc GaME. 
Let the children number down the line one-two-one-two, etc. 
Form a circle with the tree at center and dance around it on the first verse. At 
end of second verse let all the No. 1 children go to the tree and select a paper 
cap, a paper chain, or some such gift and bestow it upon some No. 2 child. Re- 
peat the music while the couples thus formed join hands and dance to their seats 
or about the room. 
DANCING SONG. Pace 7 Typz—‘‘FoLLow My LEADER.” 
Choose a Leader. 
The first verse is sung while the circle turns, using a skipping step. At the 
words: ‘‘Spread wings,’’ etc., the circle breaks and the children follow the Leader, 
using the arm-motions which imitate the flying of abird. At the end of the 
second verse the Leader returns to the place of the circle and the circle is re- 
formed. 
HEY-DIDDLE-DIDDLE. Pace 8. TypE—CHoosiInG GAME AND CHASE. 
Select the Caf and the Dish and put them in the center of the circle. The 
circle rotates while singing the song and the Caf and the Dish choose the 
Fiddle and Spoon respectively. These go outside the circle while the 
Cat and Dish remain within. The song is repeated, or the music may be 
repeated only, while the Cat and Dish break through the clasped hands of 
the circle and chase the Fiddle and Spoon respectively. During this chase 
the Caf may not touch anyone except the Fiddle nor the Dish anyone exkept 
the Soon. These latter, when caught, become the Ca/ and the Dish in 
their turn, and the game goes on. 
  CHICKERY CRANY-CROW. Pace il. TypE—CHasE. 
This isa very old game. Sometimes the Buzzard is substituted for the Witch. 
It is played thus: One is chosen for the O/d Hen, one for the Old Buzzard or Old 
Witch, and the rest are the Chickens. The Witch, (or Buzzard) is at the center 
and the rest circle about him while singing, the Witch (or Buzzard) pretending 
meanwhile to build a fire at center. At the end of the verse the Witch replies 
any hour. ‘The final question, ‘‘What is the time, Old Witch?” is repeated in a 
‘speaking voice by each child in turn in the circle, the whole being sung as many 
times as there are children, thus-— 
Child —‘‘What is the time, Old Witch!”’ 
Witch—‘‘Half-past ten.”” 
The ring now halts and the following dialogue takes place: 
Hen—‘‘Old Witch, Old Witch, what are you doing?’’ 
Witch—‘‘Picking up sticks.’’ 
Hen—‘‘What do you want the sticks for?’’ 
Witch—‘‘To build a fire.”’ 
Hen—‘‘What are you building a fire for?” 
Witch—‘To broil a chicken.”’ 
Hen—‘‘Where are you going to get the chicken?’’ 
Witch—‘‘Out of your flock.’’ 
C.F.S. Co. L. & L.
-P-A-G-E-9
  All run, the Witch gives chase, the /Yen tries to get in the way, but may not take 
hold of the Witch. When the Witch has captured a child all return to the circle, 
except the captured child, who is out of the game. The game then begins again 
till all are captured. 
MISTRESS MARY. Pace12, TypE—A CHOOSING AND MARCHING GaME. 
Select a child to be Vary. 
Mary takes center and the others circle about her on first singing. At end of 
verse, Mary chooses different children to be the flowers named, letting Peony and 
Poppy name the boys and Sweetfea and Rose name the girls. Two facing lines 
are now formed, putting boys on one side and girls on the other. (If an especial 
effect be desired, it may be obtained by using caps made of tissue paper to look 
like the flowers named.) ‘The song is now repeated while the boys choose their 
partners and, by couples, the line follows Wary, who leads. They must imitate 
everything which Wary does,—skip when she skips, walk when she walks, etc. 
HICKORY DICKORY DOCK. PacE 14. TypE—CHoosINnc AND CHASE. 
Select a child to be the Mouse. The others circle about him singing. At the 
end of the first verse the W/ouse selects a Clock. The Clock remains inside and the 
Mouse goes outside the circle. At the end of second verse the Clock breaks through 
the clasped hands and chases the Mouse. ‘The Clock then becomes the J/ouse and 
the game continues. 
TRIPPING WE GO. Pace 19, Type—For1ow-my-Luaper. 
‘This may be played in two ways. | 
First: Start one singer singing and skipping as Leader, start No. 2 following him 
at third measure, No. 3 at fifth measure, etc., until all children are in line, or,— 
Second: form children in three lines. Start No. 1 Line at beginning, No. 2 Line 
on third measure, and No. 3 Line on fifth measure. If desired, these three lines 
may each havea prescribed line of march which combined with the other two, 
will make a pleasing design. 
TICK-TOCK. Pace 20. Typz—IMITATION. 
Draw the children up in two facing lines. Each child puts his left arm behind 
him and usesjhis right fora pendulum. No. 1 Line begins, suiting action to the 
words, and No. 2 Line follows, using same action. At the last repetition of the 
song they may turn and march double file to their places. 
THE TAILOR. Pace 21. Typx—IMITATION. 
This is played like ‘‘Tick-Tock,’’ except that the children are seated on the floor 
cross-legged and imitate the motions of a tailor. 
SCOTLAND'S BURNING. Pace 22. Typx—Imrration. 
This is played by placing a chair for ‘‘Scotland’’ and starting off first, second and 
third voices in their order. The line must ‘‘ follow-the-leader’’ who, in passing 
the chair each time, pretends to ‘‘ pour on water.’’ The division of the voices 
may be arranged as desired.

as sung. When the Farmer’s Wife succeeds in touching the J/ice they are out of 
the game. 
WHEN THE REGIMENT. PacE 26. TyPE—MARCHING SONG. 
Mount the Flag-dearer on a chair, which then becomes the Reviewing-stand. If 
desired the rest may wear paper soldier caps and carry drums, etc. Appoint a 
Drum-Major who can be depended on to keep the line in step. March the line 
past the Reviewing-stand, unfurling the flag at the words ‘‘Shake out the flag.”’ 
Every child must make the accepted military salute to the flag in passing. The 
march may be simple or elaborate as desired.

THE FARMER. Pace 86. TyPpE—IMITATION. : 
Select some for Horses, some for Drivers, some for Farmers and some for Reapers. 
Toy reins may be used if desired. During the first six measures let the Horses 
and Drivers start off. On ‘‘Scatter the seed’’ start the Farmers after them, imi- 
tating the motion of sowing. Let the Reapers follow, imitating the motion of the 
scythe. All follow in line to the place designated as the AZi//. 
THE MILLER. Pace 88. TypE—IMITATION. 
‘The J/iller is mounted on a chair, which represents the 7/7. Two boys stand- 
ing below him, imitate with their hands the action of the Grinding-stones, one 
being the upper and the other the lower stone. The others represent the J///- 
wheel, and run in single file in a circle around the Miller ai center. The Miller 
may sing the main part of refrain alone, or other boys may be delegated to sing 
with him. 
THE COOK. Pacx 90. Typz—IMPERSONATION AND MARCHING. 
Two lines facing, boys in one and girls in the other. Allsing. The boys remain 
without gesture, representing the ovens. The girls have appropriate gestures for 
each action described in the song. On ‘‘Dainty loaves,’’ etc., the girls march for- 
ward to meet the line of boys. Each takes the hand of the boy she comes face-to- 
face with and they turn and march to places. 
This cycle should be played consecutively to give the child the unified idea. 
FLY AWAY. Pace 100. Typ—E—FoLLOw-My-LEADER. 
Appoint a Leader. 
The first eight measures are sung dancing in circle, then the Leader breaks away 
and the others follow, imitating him in the motion of flying. At the end of the 
song the Leader designates to each the place where he is to ‘‘go to sleep.”’ 
Notr:—The general action of these songs is modeled on the old methods of play- 
ing folk-games. A valuable work in this connection is ‘‘Games and Songs of Ameri- 
can Children’’ by William Wells Newell, published by Harpers. Much of the action 
formerly used in these song-games was related to courtship, as the games were for- 
merly played by grown-ups. We have tried to keep the action, while substituting 
more child-like motives.

He took the gray goose by the sleeve, 
Said he, Madam Goose, and by your leave 
Till take you away without reprieve 
To my little ones home in my den-o.”

He took the black duck by the neck 
And swung her all across his back, 
The black duck cried,“Quack! Quack! Quack!” 
With his legs hanging dangling down-o. 
5 
Then old Mrs. Slipper Slopper hopped out of bed, 
And out of the window she popped her head. 
“Run! John, run! the grey goose is dead 
And the fox is off to his den-o.” 
6 
Then John went up to the top of the hill 
And blew a blast both loud and shrill, 
Said the fox,Thats’ very pretty music-still 
Id rather be home in my den-o” 
vi 
At last the fox got home to his den, 
To his dear little foxes, eight, nine, ten, 
Said he, weve in luck, here’s a zood fat hen 
With her legs hanging dangling down-o. 
8 
Then he sat down with his hungry wife, 
They did very well without fork or knife, 
They never ate a better meal in all their life 
And the little ones picked the bones-o. 
In the old folk songs the verses must be adapted to the tune as there is great freedom in in

Directions for play:- A piece of yellow ribbon is used for the golden band. The leader stands in 
the center of the ring and the others turn about him singing. When he sings “A bow I shall tie” 
he ties the ribbon on the arm of some child in the circle. The leader returns to the center and 
closes his eyes while the chosen child hides outside the circle behind the backs of the other chil- 
dren. The leader seeks her, and when he finds her breaks through the circle and chases her a- 
round the circle while the others clap their hands. The one chosen then becomes the leader.

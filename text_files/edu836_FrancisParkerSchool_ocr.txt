PREFACE 
The faculty of the Francis. W. Parker School has undertaken 
to publish a YEAR Boox. It is not intended to take the place 
of the school catalogue. Its function is entirely different, since 
_it will not attempt to describe the work as a whole, but only such’ 
parts of it as seem to the faculty worthy of consideration as 
educational data. Each issue will emphasize one or more of the 
basic principles in education. In this first book the discussion of 
theory will be minimized, and almost all the space given to detailed 
deseriptions of experiments which have been approved by the 
faculty. These examples are not, however, in any case considered 
to be perfect or model school activities. Many of them are neces- 
sarily incomplete. Whenever it seems useful, the struggles and 
mistakes involved in a piece of work are described quite as fully as 
the successful parts of it, since often it is in this way only that an 
experiment can be measured and judged at its true value. 
It is fitting that the first book should. strike the keynote 
upon which the work of the school is based; that it should demon- 
strate clearly the belief of the school that education is essentially 
a social process, Therefore, all the examples given in this issue 
describe activities vitalized by impelling social motives. The best 
organized and most effective social stimulus in the school is the 
Morning Exercise. It gives life and significance to much of the 
elassroom work. It creates social unity and purpose. It would 
seem, therefore, that the first Year Book, if it is to emphasize 
especially the social aspects of the school life; should deal with 
the morning exercise. But it was decided by the faculty that 
if this feature of the school were treated adequately it would fill 
the entire space of the book, and it seemed better to make the 
first number more varied in character. The second number, how- 
ever, will probably describe and illustrate typical morning exer- 
cises and such allied topies as school plays, festivals, and special 
day exercises. But whatever the contents of the book may be, 
there will be a sincere attempt on the part of the faculty to 
picture as vividly as possible groups of children engaged in an 
everyday process of growing in social usefulness.

ORIGIN AND AIMS OF THE FRANCIS W. PARKER 
SCHOOL 
The origins of the educational trend of which the Francis W. 
Parker School is a part are so various that one cannot appropriate 
from among them those that belong to this School. The quality 
that, perhaps more than any other, determines the kinship of the 
Parker School is its holding its educational principles as the basis 
of its existence. That quality is a privilege of educational in- 
heritance. : 
Every one who has ever brought forth a thought how to better 
the education of the race is really one of our forbears, for that 
thought is our life blood. 
Our immediate ancestor, who is truly responsible for our ex- 
istence, is the educator for whom the School is named-——Francis 
W. Parker. He caught the inspiration of real education and he 
brought that living force, in bringing his life. work, to Chicago. 
Then, out of a sense of need for Chicago and with wide co- 
operation, came other efforts that furthered his—and from those 
efforts evolved two institutions—the School of Education and the 
Francis W. Parker School. 
It is safe to say that the moving power towards the establish- 
ment of this School was the belief that the enrrent general process 
in the education of our youth contains much waste of the inner 
human values which we sum up in the word character—that it . 
squanders much. of the best for the sake of the attainment of the 
less good——that the prime aim of a real education must be to con- 
serve and develop these finer values—that no good purpose can be 
conserved by their neglect and disintegration—and that. the usual 
educational institution is so hampered by the weight of ignorant 
demand and blind conservatism that is laid upon it by a dominat- 
ing public that where it would, it seldom can be free to take such 
steps as might even seem very sure ones towards a better edu- 
eation. 
In this ground of the original need of starting this School was 
found the prime rock of its foundation—freedom to carry out such 
educational policies as should, in its judgment, further a truer 
education.

6 Francis W. ParKER SCHOOL 
Based, then, upon freedom of action in shaping its courses, 
the Francis W. Parker School has reared its educational super- 
structure with certain essential features which determine its form 
~-the principles below its performance. These are built with the 
bricks and the mortar, the line and the trowel of constant. per- 
sistent, thorough work, which alone can bring ideals into a living 
actuality. . 
The shape and proportions and character of this educational 
structure are best portrayed by dwelling upon some of the archi- 
tectural features which determine its personality as a creation. 
In its plan, the growing child is taken as its charge in his 
triple nature—body, mind and spirit-—and the principle of the 
School maintains that none of these integral parts of his life may 
be injured or neglected. 
In its triple responsibility, it is impossible to say whieh part 
of life the School holds as most essential. 
In its ideal, the body must be held to be the support of the 
whole of life and the first necessity is to foster and create an 
ample physical foundation. To this end, the arrangement of the 
school working day is studied to adjust the various kinds of ac- 
tivities to the right period of the day and the right relation to other 
activities in respect to mental and physical fatigue. To this end, the 
largest possible amount of definite physical training is allotted to 
the pupils—and to this end, provision is made for out-door play 
space and for out-door play periods for all sections of the School. 
In the School’s ideal, the mind must receive, during the years 
of formation of habit and of power, the training that will fit it to 
grasp problems in their entirety and essence, to reach conclusions 
with vigor and clearness, and to attempt solutions with determi- 
nation and perseverance. And towards the up-building of such 
power, all of the mental training of the School is daily and hourly 
directed. , : 
In the School’s ideal, all of this power would be but sounding 
brass and tinkling cymbal, if the spirit governing it looked not 
towards the light. So it is sought that every influence of every 
part of the School work shall stimulate the child’s growth spirit- 
ually—and if any part of it led his spirit downward, instead of 
upward, it would be cast out as a failure in the one region that 
must be held sacred—which no influence must endanger-—his 
spiritual growth.

Year Book 7 
In this edifice, which calls itself a school, but more rightly 
might name itself a life, there are two great towers that stand like 
the towers of a cathedral confronting him who enters in search of 
what truth he may find. These dominate his consciousness of the 
whole—forming the keynotes around which he groups all of his 
impressions as the work itself verily groups itself around them. 
They are: the development of the right attitude of the individual 
to self, as related to others; and the development of the individual’s 
initiative in all of his own processes. 
The School holds that the motive of the individual’s activities 
is a dominating factor of importance to his activities—as vital in 
importance as is breath to life; and that the motive of work must 
not be the advancement of self as against another, nor yet for the 
benefit of self alone, but must be for the furtherance of one’s own 
powers and possibilities as a factor for all. 
To make this aim an actuality, competition is ruled out as a 
force in the school work, personal aggrandizement is done away 
with in every form and in its place is‘ brought in the social motive 
as an ever present, powerful, active force, inspiring and produc- 
ing in all the pupils the best that in them lies. 
The School holds that nothing is done unless the mind within 
does it. Processes plastered on by another’s activity, though they 
may adhere under the pressure for a time, do not affect the growth 
of the mind but may be rather a waste, both of time and power, 
inasmuch as they may lead the mind further along the path of in- 
activity and inane acceptance of another’s work to take the place 
of one’s own and thus become steps which must be retraced before 
one’s own work may be done. In the field of intellectual work, 
this path is a subtle one to find for the pupil, for each cannot, with 
use, reconstruct wholly all the steps of advanced civilized thought 
and do over all of the world’s discovery of processes. It is the art 
of the teacher so to lead the way that civilization’s contribution 
to each individual may be appropriated by a process that is his 
own and goes to the making of a real self, instead of the creation 
of a parrot of what has gone before—a process that is inner and 
consists of mental feeding, assimilation and growth, instead of a 
process that consists of the putting on of external layers—a 
process that produces thought power, not merely the power to re- 
produce others’ thoughts.
-P-A-G-E-9
8 Francis W. Parker ScHOoL 
In the still more important field of the acquisition of self- 
control, the same principle holds. No discipline produces growth 
which only restrains by any external force, whether that is of 
physical control or of fear of external happenings. 
Growth being the prime result aimed for, therefore, all rules 
and all disciplinary measures for the disregard of them have as 
much relation to the pupils’ own judgment as the essential regu- 
lating of the school life will allow—and it is not too much to say 
that the direct relation to their judgment is held at all points. 
These two principles of the contribution, rather than the ag- 
grandizement of self, and of the initiative essential to all real 
work, might, combined, be termed the right selfhood: self, not 
dominating as a goal for endeavor; self, choosing, directing and 
maintaining endeavor at all points. The true and inner—as 
against the artificial and unreal—accomplishment of this great pur- 
pose for every individual is the fundamental aim of the work of 
this School. 
Passing in under the two lofty spires, one finds distinctive 
features within. 
Immediately one is confronted, as if with an altar to man’s 
upward progress through work, with the belief that the hand of 
man is the immediate upholder of the brain—that they are so 
close in co-operation as to be almost in a union—that in their edu- 
eation, the action and reaction is so immediate and constant that 
the benefit of one is the benefit of the other. In the early years, it 
ig the hand that ‘contributes most to the brain. Later, the rela- 
tion is reversed and the developed brain power contributes con- 
stantly to the ability of the work of the hand. The belief of the 
School is that the two should be co-ordinated in training. All 
through the school years, hand work is brought into close connec- 
ticn with intellectual work wherever possible, to reinforce and 
vivify it and to give the intellectual work of every pupil direct re- 
lation to his own constructive powers. 
Another distinctive feature—as of a richness of color and de- 
tail—is the belief that every growing mind may, with the right 
principles of teaching, be brought into living touch with the riches 
of history and of nature, in such contact that the individual may 
enter into some parts of the kingdom of the world and possess them 
as his own. And, also, the belief that such possession of the world
-P-A-G-E-10
Year Book ‘ 9 
may be the avenue for the achievement of the technique of read- 
ing and writing—and, indeed, that all of the processes to be 
mastered for technical skill may be allied with the whole of school 
life instead of being left as segregated, unrelated spots of half- 
awake activity which are never quite joined to the personality of a 
pupil’s work. 
Thus we see the daily course of the daily round of school, in- 
stead of being set apart as a time given over wholly to a routine 
preparation for some other sphere of living, is itself an opportunity 
for living. 
From the kindergarten upward, we see realms of nature taken 
out of the region of the book and made territories of discovery 
and of practical appiication by the doing of processes and the 
grappling with the problems of the human mastery of animate and 
inanimate nature. We hear pupils giving us, in rare quality, music 
of the masters and interpreting to us, in fine form, thoughts of all 
the ages, in reading and in drama. We see periods in history made 
real by being associated with work in science and with handwork, 
with literature and with dramatic work—-we see pupils inhabiting 
Greece and reproducing in story and in play its spirit of art—we 
see pupils building anew their own city—we see pupils traveling 
with the great explorers over the surface of the earth——-and, as 
they come nearer to their own citizenship, we see them construct- 
ing civics of their own making—and we see the powers thus de- © 
veloped used for the benefit of all. 
In short, we see that the school life is a preparation in being 
. itself a foretaste of a rich world of fact and fancy in which one 
may live fully and do abundantly. 
One learns, as he proceeds, that through the whole edifice 
runs—like the proportion and measurement and balance of the 
cathedral plan—the high ideal of quality and power to be at- 
tained through these educational steps, and one learns that fine 
quality and high power may be the outcome and are not too much 
to expect. 
Within, the service begins when the children break forth in 
their expression—in the overflowing of the thought life developing 
in them. The forms of their expressions are as various as the in- 
dividuals. The spontaneity and variety of these are the crowning 
test of the School’s work. They come pouring forth in every con-
-P-A-G-E-11
10 °- Franois W. Parker ScHoou 
ceivable shape—and the School holds these productions of brain 
achievement, of hand achievement, of physical skill, of literary 
outpouring, of dramatic grasp, of musical joy and fineness, and 
above all, the expressions of self-control and self-contribution that 
are its constant inspiration—these, the School holds as its real life. 
From work which contains the voluntary outgoing of the 
mind and spirit, inspired by a motive which does not end in self 
but which is, at all times, uplifted and ennobled and deepened by 
an underlying, unconscious purpose of usefulness to a greater 
whole; from work which brings the individual into contact with 
the wealth of the ages from which he draws living interest and to 
‘which he gives the gratitude of an inheritor; from work which 
leads the individual to establish his own relation to the achieve- 
ments of the race by adding the power and wealth of his own hand- 
work in some service worthy. of it; out of such a setting of work 
comes as a flower from the soil, rather than as a garment put on, 
the discipline that real education strives for, the discipline of the 
mind and the heart that comes alone from real power within. 
Do we mean that the Francis W. Parker School succeeds at all 
times in all these directions equally? Certainly not. But in setting 
forth its aims, we set forth the proportions and shape of its plans 
into which it is constantly and more fully completing its structure. 
It is only.its serious attempt to reach for. and work towards 
such ideals that brings it to the community to speak of them-—-the 
purpose of such speaking being but to obtain moral support and 
encouragement to help it to go forward, to bespeak correction and 
suggestion where such may arise for its still greater help and 
speeding in the right direction, and to contribute what light it may 
to others seeking the same educational goals. 
St. Paul’s statement that he died daily must have meant more 
truly that he was born daily. That side of his statement would 
apply most truly to our School—for with hearts and minds set to 
the future and to each dawn, every day brings new revelations of 
ways and of depths and of heights in education.
-P-A-G-E-12
THE SOCIAL MOTIVE IN SCHOOL WORK 
In common with many teachers, we of the Francis W. Parker 
School hold certain educational principles as important. We be- 
lieve that self-actuated work causes the greatest gain to the pupil; 
that training in initiative is a child’s great need; that in his own 
interests we often find educative opportunity; that freedom, with 
a balancing responsibility, is the best condition of moral and intel- 
lectual growth; that real experience with actual material is an 
essential of learning; that opportunity for varied expression is 
necessary to right education; that for purposes of development 
children must be treated as individuals and not as a group; that 
one of the most effective and wholesome motives of work is the 
social motive. | 
The special significance of ‘the social motive lies in its being 
the controlling principle in social organization everywhere. Its 
establishment as an impulse in school makes of work there a real 
and worthy thing, converts school activities into earnest living, 
creates and trains for mature society the sine qua non of its © 
existence—people of social conscience and social power. There is 
no experience more enervating to the soul and to the intellect than 
continual working under artificial stimulus. On the other hand, 
the social motive is one of the most ennobling of all true springs 
to action. Nor does social motive here mean a consciously philan- 
thropic purpose, but rather the feeling that one does not and 
eannot work alone; that whatever one does is a single unit of a 
large pattern that is being built by many contributors. Under 
such circumstances work is judged indisputably by being put to 
the proof of use. Reward and punishment alike come with no 
flavor of injustice or favoritism, but with a purifying and invigor- 
ating truthfulness. Thus to work under ennobling incentives, to 
be disciplined by hard tasks, to see one’s results used with a 
high impersonality, gives to struggle a meaning, to success 4 joy, 
to failure a cleansing power, that no smaller motive can furnish. 
But few school children are working under these inspiring 
influences. School work today is culpably wasteful of child energy. 
It is not training young men and young women for social service. 
Moreover, pupils have not gained mastery, even, in those forms 
il
-P-A-G-E-13
12 Francis W. ParKER ScHOOL 
of education for which so much young life is sacrificed—they 
cannot read, write, and spell creditably. Teachers have yet to 
learn that thoroughness and accuracy and skill result from pur- 
poseful effort rather than from dull repetition. It could not be 
otherwise. “The dead-level monotony of doing set tasks hour after 
hour, day after day, for years, with no immediate interest or 
purpose, can have but one result—only the exceptionally strong 
or the selfishly ambitious come from the grind retaining any 
measure of mental vigor and power, ana even these best products 
of educational factory methods have no sense of duty or respon- 
sibility towards others. They know nothing of the happiness 
which is rooted in useful service, The schools and the homes in 
which there are no social responsibilities and duties, produce the 
snobs, the burdens, and the parasites of society. 
What is the remedy for all this waste and failure? It is 
true that the school cannot reproduce the complex conditions of 
society. It should not fit for any precise set of social conditions, 
but we believe that it should attempt to train in every child the 
. habits, tastes, and qualities which society will always need—self- 
eommand, resourcefulness, power of independent thinking, fine 
discrimination, whole-hearted love of labor, the habit of sharing 
activity with one’s fellows for the benefit of all. We believe that 
the best remedy for present evils is to fill our children’s school 
lives with wholesome social stimuli, with small but vital social 
undertakings which demand activity of all kinds and expression 
in all forms, which appeal to children of different ages as being 
-delightful enterprises. Drudgery, disagreeable tasks, hard work, 
the pupils will soon recognize as the necessary price of true success. 
They will. work cheerfully, when the reason for it seems to them 
worthy. Efficiency of many kinds will result. Knowledge will be 
eagerly sought and assimilated through use, the need for drill as 
the means of getting required skill will be appreciated, the drill 
periods will be vitalized by purpose, and much waste time elimi- 
nated. Such work requires frequent discussion, with few class 
recitations and the least possible amount of non-educative book 
memorization. This theory does not minimize the usefulness of 
the study of books, it merely insists that their true value be made 
clear to the children. We believe that manv schools are ready 
to join forces in seeking to break the traditions that hamper 
teachers and children alike. It is for this reason that we wish to
-P-A-G-E-14
YEaR Boox 13 
contribute, yearly, our material, however crude it may be, to 
illustrate the results to children when working under natural 
and educative stimuli. : - 
. Necessarily, in each piece of work described, more than the 
social tenets of the school are involved. In fact, almost all of the 
principles mentioned as important in the first paragraph of this 
article are constantly exemplified. For instance, in every case, 
whether it be the composition of a simple bit of musie for. a May 
Day song, or the building of a small house for social gatherings 
on the playground, the work is self-actuated, in that each child 
feels deeply responsible for the thing undertaken. He understands 
that its suecess depends wholly upon himself and his fellows. The 
stimulus to initiative is direct and immediate. Training in it 
eomes naturally under the spur furnished by anticipated joy in 
‘achievement. The children’s own interests, tastes, abilities, and 
previous experience are the controlling factors. Each day en- 
larges experience and brings real discipline. Emotions are aroused 
which give vitality, worth, and force to expression. The whole- ‘ 
some spirit of give and take is cultivated, and a respect for the 
strength and ability of others comes inevitably. In many cases 
the work is so varied that there is room for all kinds of ability, 
and every type of child has opportunity to do his best. Those 
who lead in constructive imagination or in dramatic presentation, 
may be obliged meekly to follow a leader in the shop activities. 
In the atmosphere of freedom and responsibility surrounding these 
social enterprises, self-control and other moral qualities are devel- 
oped through the demands for them. The narrow consideration 
of self is pushed to the background for the welfare of the project, 
since ‘the child himself’ realizes that he must work in the place 
where he can work best. The judgment of the group is nearly 
always just, and verily no examination marks, no artificial rewards 
or praises, could equal. it as an incentive to good work. 
What is the place of the teacher in this social activity? It 
may seem that the children are left entirely to the mercy of their 
comrades. Nothing could be further from the truth. The tax 
upon the teacher’s wisdom and energy is obviously greater in some 
of the pieces of work described, in this volume than would be the 
case in ordinary school practice. But the compensation, also, is 
greater. The teacher, as well as the child, is living a life rich in 
possibilities for growth and happiness. He is responsible for the
-P-A-G-E-15
14 Francis W. Parker ScHoou 
conditions which surround the children, all of which must be 
adapted to stimulate and use the varying abilities of his group. 
The slow and weak children must be given full opportunities for 
growth without loss to the active and strong. In spite of the fact 
that more than one kind of ability is recognized, the teacher’s 
skill is often taxed in providing for each his full opportunity for 
growth. New demands arise when the child acts under freer and 
more natural conditions. The teacher must meet more than the 
mere academic needs of his class; he must be quick with all kinds of 
understanding and sympathy; he must, above all, keep the heart of 
a child, if he is to deal adequately with the every-day emergencies— 
the deep, sudden discouragements, the frank selfishness, the over- 
flowing joyfulness of childhood. The teacher, then, may be an 
artist under whose inspiring touch human beings grow in strength, 
in good fellowship, even in righteousness, He should ‘be the 
servant of the true God, and if his vision is clear, his faith strong, 
and his heart devoted, he may lead his band into the ‘‘high place’ 
and be permitted: to look into the Promised Land, knowing that 
if those who follow become worthy they shall surely enter it— 
a land noble and beloved, free alike to all peoples, needing above 
all young men and young women who are efficient, happy, and 
self-dedicated to the service of humanity.
-P-A-G-E-16
THE SPIRIT OF GIVING AS DEVELOPED 
AT THANKSGIVING AND CHRISTMAS 
The demands of good citizenship require that the school grad- 
ually develop in the child a growing social consciousness. The 
self-centered individual of the kindergarten and primary grades 
should become, as the school years pass by, more respectful and 
appreciative of the rights of others and more sympathetic and 
tolerant towards those of various temperaments and conditions 
of. life. 
To realize this development in the pupils there should be 
provided, in increasing amount throughout the years of school 
life, opportunity for the child to think less of himself as an in- 
dividual and more of the community as a whole, of which he forms 
but a single unit. Conditions calling for unselfish social service on 
the part of the pupils should be consciously created by the school; 
service which has a co-operative and community interest. These 
opportunities should be given, (a) in the class room, (b) in the 
school community as a whole, (c) in the larger community outside 
the school. This means that the interest in social service on the 
part of the pupil should gradually expand throughout the school 
course. At first his social horizon is bounded by the walls of his 
individual class room, then there dawns a consciousness of duties 
and responsibilities to the school community. In the later years 
of the high school the wider relationships and responsibilities 
outside the school come into view. 
The standpoint should gradually change from one of selfish 
interest in society for the sake of what it can contributé toward 
individual. pleasures to a realization of the duties and responsibili- 
ties to society for the sake of greater pleasure and benefit to all. 
Opportunity for social endeavor within the school community 
is provided in abundant measure by the needs and activities of 
class room and school. The need for contact with social activities 
_and conditions outside the school is not so well recognized, nor so 
abundantly supplied. Christmas and Thanksgiving, however, pre- 
sent an unique opportunity for this larger social service, possibly 
4 greater opportunity than at any other time of the school year, 
and one which schools as a rule have not used to the best advan- 
15
-P-A-G-E-17
16 Francis W. PARKER SCHOOL 
tage. It is believed that by the methods we have used in this school 
our pupils have been helped to develop character along co-opera- 
tive and unselfish lines. Our endeavor in handling questions of 
sharing and giving, such as arise at Christmas and Thanksgiving, 
has been to create a sympathetic and respectful attitude on the 
part of the pupils toward others in less fortunate circumstances. 
The extent to which participation in such work can be carried 
on varies with the age of the pupils. It is evident that but little 
ean be done in a direct way with children of the lower grades. 
As the child grows older, however, there should be opportunity, 
under wise guidance, for more intimate contact with some of the 
problems of relief. This is especially valuable during the more 
or less care-free years of the high school period. “The emotional 
period of adolescence is a suitable time in which to develop a 
right attitude toward this work. The emotions are then more 
easily aroused, although the average high school pupil does not 
eare to show his feelings. The spirit of helpfulness and sympathy, 
backed by proper planning on the part of the pupil, and a vigor- 
ous expenditure of muscular energy, will do much to fix healthy. 
impressions which will last through future years. The endeavor 
has been to present situations needing such help as the pupils 
themselves can render. This arouses emotions, and an outlet for 
these emotions is provided through physical activities. Too fre- 
quently emotions of this natural sort are aroused without adequate 
thought to ‘the proper expenditure of mervous and muscular 
energy. We must not lose sight of the fact that ‘‘the gift without 
the giver is bare.’’ . 
Preper attention to questions of giving and sharing during 
the child’s school years should result in developing the right atti- 
tude toward charitable work and an intelligent interest in move- 
ments for civic betterment. During the high school period what 
is done at Thanksgiving and Christmas should be coupled with 
systematic study of civics and economics. In this way responsi- 
bility for the conditions which make charity and philanthropy a 
necessity in our modern society is brought back to the individual 
and an interest in bettering conditions is aroused. This will do 
- much to correct the popular attitude toward charity, which will 
be seen as a temporary-necessity brought about by wrong modern 
conditions; an attempt to restore justice to those who have un- 
fortunately suffered through transgression of laws, either through
-P-A-G-E-18
Yuar Book 17 
acts of their own, or through the acts of society. An attempt 
should be made to show that’ ideal conditions would insure to 
every one a justice and equality which would not make necessary 
our present methods of relief. . 
Aside from developing the proper attitude toward charitable 
endeavor, both on the part of the individual and of society, the 
gain to the pupil in democratic ideals is a valuable factor. Truer 
standards for measurement of character are placed before him 
when he gains a glimpse, often through the tactful suggestion of 
teacher or charity worker, of sterling character in less fortunate 
individuals who are struggling bravely in the face of adverse 
conditions. 
-In the following pages are illustrated methods by which our 
school has tried to realize some of the possibilities above indicated. 
The Spirit of Thanksgiving in the School 
The spirit of Thanksgving differs somewhat from that of 
Christmas. At Thanksgiving thoughts of relief of the more ele- 
mental needs, such as food and clothing, are uppermost. At 
Christmas, however, while these are present to some extent, they 
are overshadowed by the thought of providing joy and good cheer, 
mainly through less material means. Naturally Christmas is the 
time when the joyous spirit of childhood can with the greatest 
pleasure enter into such work. So it would seem at first glance 
that the contact with the material needs of the Thanksgiving 
season would be such as should not come within the experience 
of childhood. This need not be so. The younger children, of 
course, should not be overburdened with the problems of the 
poverty and distress of others, but there is much that can be 
done without actual contact with these conditions. With the 
elass room teacher and settlement and charity worker as interme- 
diaries, each class in the school becomes for the time being, a re- 
lief and aid society for the assistance of a small group of people, 
usually a family in which there are several children. 
To secure the co-operation of the parents, a circular letter 
is sent to all the members of the Parents’ Association to invite 
their assistance in the work. 
The first step consists in securing information of a trust- 
worthy nature concerning the family to be helped. This is usually 
furnished by reports, written or oral, from settlement and charity
-P-A-G-E-19

workers.* In some instances, however, the teacher and a few 
pupils visit the homes in question, generally in company with a 
friend of the family, the charity worker, who is intimately and 
sympathetically acquainted with their problems. This closer con- 
tact brings in the personal element, which is desirable and has 
been found to be possible under proper direction in the upper 
grades of the high school. Very often it may be the first oppor- 
tunity of a pleasure-loving, thoughtless girl of high school age, 
shielded and nurtured in pleasant and eomfortable surroundings, 
to get a glimpse of ‘‘how the other half lives.’’ Let it not be 
understood that any ‘‘case’’ which comes within the scope of the 
- organized charity worker would be suitable for such a visit. Both 
the receiver of the gifts and the giver are considered. Thought 
should be given to avoiding conditions which would present harm- 
ful influences and to selecting those where present need is plainly 
apparent to the young investigator, and which offer opportunities 
for such endeavors as are within his power. A. hint or word of 
explanation dropped by one who is familiar with the history of 
the conditions, will fall on fertile ground. It is needless to say 
that the boy or girl returns from such a visit in a much different 
frame of mind, less patronizing and more sympathetic and demo- 
eratie in spirit. . 
From reports gathered from these sources the elass hag data 
for discussing the various needs of the family. With the aid of 
the class room teacher, such articles of food and clothing are ob- 
tained as will best serve these needs. Frequently, after class dis- 
cussion, each pupil is delegated to provide for one individual. 
Thus he pictures to himself ‘‘Martha, aged 9’’ or ‘‘Johnnie, aged 
6,’’ and sets about to select a complete outfit of good serviceable 
garments for the coming winter. Often this will mean trips to 
other rooms in the school to see what is available, the school thus 
becoming a clearing house for these useful gifts. Serious and 
thoughtful discussions are often overheard regarding size, fitness 
*Talks to the school by leaders in relief and philanthropic work have 
been a great help in showing the needs for relief and putting the minds of 
the children in. the right attitude. The following talks have been given at 
various times: . 
“Some Phases of Relief Work in Chicago,” by Mrs. Gertrude Howe 
Britton of Hull House. . . 
“The Big Brother and Sister League,” by Miss Vittum of the North- 
western Settlement, : : 
“The Story of the Immigrant,” by Dr. Graham Taylor of Chicago 
Commons. 
Such addresses do much to quicken the desire of all the children to be 
of social service.
-P-A-G-E-20

and condition of garments. Contributions of money are devoted 
to many important needs, a part being used for the repair of shoes 
which have been brought in. Often a month’s rent or a ton of 
coal is provided to tide over an emergency. In most cases a Thanks- 
giving dinner is sent. For the sick, special delicacies are in- 
eluded. 
On the day before Thanksgiving all is activity. Hammers 
are busy nailing up boxes of provisions, Sheets of heavy wrap- 
ping paper and stout twine are in great demand, for by two 
o’cloek all the packages, duly labeled, are to be ready in the lower 
hall for distribution. The value of this appeal to the physical 
activity of the child cannot be emphasized too strongly. The 
emotions. aroused in the class room discussion would, fail to reg- 
ister lasting impressions on the brain were it not for the abundant 
opportunity to handle and wrap up articles of food and clothing, 
tie bundles, nail up boxes, and fill barrels and baskets until they 
tax the strength of the young worker to lift them. Thus he is 
giving of himself in a most effective way. Compare the vivid 
impressions thus created with those ealled forth. by the ordinary 
stereotyped appeal for donations to ‘‘give to.the poor,’’ an appeal 
which results merely in bringing articles of food and clothing 
from a plentifully supplied home. The value of this endeavor 
should be measured by the amount and quality of personal effort 
on the part of the pupil rather than by mere quantity of material 
things. : a / ‘ 
When the bundles are gathered together ready for distribu. 
tion, there are volunteers to assist in loading wagons and other 
conveyances. Routes have been mapped out and directions care- 
fully prepared so that no mistake may be made in locating ‘‘third 
floor rears’’ or basement tenements. Here again is opportunity 
for lessons in democracy and the proper spirit of giving. The 
guide or teacher can many times call attention to conditions from 
which the pupils who are assisting cannot fail to draw their own 
conclusions. This may be done by chance remarks without the 
slightest evidence of pointing a moral, but that the lesson ‘‘goes 
home’’ is shown in many ways; sometimes by the silent, thought- 
ful attitude of an otherwise thoughtless, talkative boy after, a 
visit to some dark basement lodging, or by the remarks of admira- 
tion called forth by evidences of thrift and cleanliness. The 
patronizing attitude is, we believe, entirely overcome.

The School Shop and the Christmas Spirit 
The following plan of utilizing the school shop has been usec! 
as a means of developing a broader spirit of Christmas among 
* children, dealing with altruistic motives rather than the selfish 
and personal, and using co-operative rather than individual meth. 
ods. The constructive interests have been used as a basis, and the 
play element recognized by introducing the favorite character of 
Christmas, Santa Claus. 
In every household in which there are or have been children, 
there are countless toys, dolls, books and games in various stages 
of dissolution and disrepair. Many of these have outlived their 
usefulness in that particular household, but with the addition of 
a little spare time and ingenuity, together with a touch of color 
to brighten them up, they would still make most acceptable Christ- 
mas gifts to many a child in poorer circumstances. To utilize 
this repair work as a feature of our manual training a ‘‘Santa 
Claus Annex Shop’’ was established. 
It was suggested to some of the children that such toys could 
well be repaired in the school. Notice was sent to the parents 
that the school would undertake to put into good condition such 
toys as could be furnished. These toys would then be given to 
settlements in more needy parts of the city for distribution. 
The next step was to present the scheme to the pupils of the 
whole school in a ‘‘Morning Exercise.’’ Upon reaching school 
one morning, the pupils were confronted with the following notices 
prominently displayed on posters in the main hall. 
WANTED—WANTED—AT ONCE

(Signed) SANTA CLAUS. 
P. S.—This is my busy season, and I have appointed Mr. Wahlstrom 
superintendent of my Annex Shop at the Francis W. Parker School. Par- 
ticulars may be obtained from him or from any of tha teachers in said 
school. 
Applications should be in by December 1. 
The following is a stenographic report of the morning exercise 
which came later in the day. 
MORNING EXERCISE—Santa Claus Annex Shop 
: Tuesday, Nov. 29 
Mr. Wahlstrom: 
“How many people here believe in Santa Claus?” 
(Almost every hand in the school raised—with a background - of 
broad smiles). 
Mr. Wahlstrom: 
“Santa Claus is a pretty real person to us. As we get older I do 
not know what happens, but we are sometimes a little bit afraid to own 
our friendship or say we believe in him. As we get a little older still, 
we begin to know him by another name—sometimes it is ‘The Christmas 
Spirit.’ 
“JT think the other night I must have had a visit from Santa Claus. 
It was pretty late and most of you must have been sound asleep. He 
had a nice scheme and wanted to know if I would help him out. He 
said he was very busy, and that there were a lot of people whom he 
could not get around to see if he did not have a little help. You all 
expect a visit from Santa Claus Christmas morning—I know I do. 
“This was his scheme—he wanted to know if we could not organize 
an Annex Shop and help fix up some things he could use at Christmas 
time to send around to some little folks not quite so fortunate as you 
are. You have already brought in a few things we can fix up, but we 
should like more. 
“You probably noticed the want ads in the hall this morning, ask- 
ing for helpers in different lines of trade. 
“I am sure: there are plenty of veterinary surgeons in the school
-P-A-G-E-24
Yrar Book 23 
who know all about the insides of the Teddy Bears, and doctors who 
know how to sew on dolls’ heads. And there are lots of good painters 
in the school and all sorts of mechanical: people who can take a toy 
and see what the trouble is and fix it up. We shall need help from 
everybody. Some of the high school boys and girls who have had metal 
work are expert with solder and they can solder pieces together for us 
when they are broken loose. 
“Now, if you have read the rules carefully, you will see that Santa 
Claus has promised good wages and good hours. The regular hours are 
going to be two afternoons a week, after school—on Wednesdays and 
Fridays. Santa Claus is a pretty systematic sort of person—if he were 
not he would be entirely swamped. Here are some of the cards that 
he has asked the Seventh Grade to print, 
“The first is to be like a shipping tag. Every toy is going to have 
a number, and this will be put on this card, with the name of the ar- 
ticle to be repaired and the different things to be done to it. 
  
      
   “This will keep the inspectors and superintendent pretty busy. The 
directions are to be written pretty carefully, and we shall need good 
inspectors and good foremen. This ticket will be tied to the article 
and then it will be ready for someone to start to work with it, 
“Santa Claus believes in uuious. He has not yet succeeded in union- 
izing the whole world, but he hopes to. And he is going to have a union 
card for all the workers in the Annex Shop. It will read:
-P-A-G-E-25
24 Francis W. Parker ScHOOL 
  
  “Of course Santa Claus will not be able to sign all these in per- 
son, but he will expect the inspectors and foremen and the people in 
charge of this factory to sign for him. . 
“The next thing we must have in this factory will be a time card. 
Each person working in the factory will have one, whether he is a 
painter, a mechanic or a surgeon—no matter in what department he 
works—and the inspector will check off the time. 
  “We have noticed that he promises good wages and good hours. 
But Santa Claus does not have very much cash at this time of the year, 
and so he is going to pay by check. Here is a copy of his check:
-P-A-G-E-26
  “These can be cashed at any time at Father Time’s Bank of Dis 
count. Father Time will pay these checks without protest. 
“Now, as to the rate of wages. Of course the workers in some de- 
partments will have more skiil than others, but Santa Claus thought it 
would be well to make the rate of wages uniform. For every hour’s 
work he is going to pay five happy days, and those happy days you can 
cash at any time when you need them. You can add them on to a long 
life, if you see fit. That is the best kind of pay; that is the kind of pay 
that Santa Claus himself takes out for his work, and he certainly is long 
lived and enjoys life and looks healthy whenever we see his picture. 
So I think the pay is very good. 
“Now what we need is good workers, good ‘inspectors, and good 
foremen. Here are some of the things on these tables that have been 
brought in, and I might show you the kind of work that will need to 
be done. 
“This is a Teddy Bear who has lost his voice. I do not know whether 
he can be cured or not. 
“Here is a book that.must go to the Book Repair Department. 
“Here is a pair of horses that seem to have run away. If we can- 
not find their wagon we will hitch them to something else. 
“Here is a telephone out of order. I think that can be fixed up by 
the high school boys who are studying physics. 
“Here is a hen who has run her legs off. We ought to do something 
for her. 
“Here is a horse without a tail. We shall have to turn this over to 
the hospital, 
“Heré is a good boat that needs a mast and some sails, a bowsprit, 
and a new coat of paint. 
“Here is a bank that does not work. 
“Here is a piano without any legs—a grand piano at that. I think 
that might go to the music department later to be put in tune. 
“There is another department that will be pretty busy later on. 
That is the Wrapping and Packing Department. We shall need a great
-P-A-G-E-27

number of boxes for that. I wish every one in the school would look 
around at home and see what empty paper boxes he has that he can bring 
in and turn over to this department. Then we can get some pretty pa- 
per and fix these boxes up and make nice packages of them.” 
Miss Cooke: . 
“Last year the teachers had the privilege of seeing the things when 
they came in and then again when they were ready to be sent away, 
and it was as if a miracle had been wrought. There is one thing, how- 
ever, that I should like to add. I should like to be appointed receiver 
of something else. It seems to. me that every boy and girl in Chicago 
ought to have a good Christmas. There are many little girls in the city, 
I know, who do not have a single doll, and many little boys who never 
had a toy to play with. Some of you, I know, have a great many books, 
and a great many dolls, and a great many toys. It seems to me that 
we ought to add a Sharing Department to all these others, and I should 
like to be receiver. If any of you have a doll that you really care about, 
but would like to have some other little girl care about it, I should 
like to have you bring that in and mark it, ‘A gift that I should like 
to share.’ I should like to have these things brought to my office.” 
Each of the departments was presided over by a larger pupil 
or a teacher as a foreman and inspector. The many things to be 
done were classified. This plan furnished a wide range of processes ~ 
in many varied materials and a splendid outlet for the ability 
and ingenuity of pupils from the first grade up to the eighth grade 
and high school. The processes varied in difficulty from mending 
eard-board boxes, pasting labels, painting ‘‘scuffed’’ and battered 
toys, to soldering and tinsmithing, repairing clockwork locomo- 
tives and steam engines. : 
In addition to the regular time announced, pupils were al- 
lowed to give other spare time; and in some cases, when a class 
had finished the work planned in the regular shop period, the 
class time was devoted to the work. 
When the first appeal was made for toys, atties and store- 
rooms were ransacked and the accumulations of years, possibly, 
brought in. It is possible that after a year or two the supply will 
diminish. Attention ean then be turned to manufacturing new 
toys, such as dolls’ beds, tables, chairs, games, etc., holding to the 
same factory basis and subdivision of work. The pupils appreciate 
the value of this method when the time is limited. Each pupil, 
instead of performing all the processes, would do the work he was 
best fitted to do. It would also be well to introduce labor saving 
devices, templates, ete.,.to increase the efficiency and speed of the 
workers.
-P-A-G-E-28

In addition to the toys the numerous books and games fur- 
nished abundant field for activity. Some of them were in per- 
fectly presentable condition, but by far the greater number were 
in need of attention, and some could be redeemed only by much 
careful work. The foremen and inspectors of the groups were 
usually high school pupils, but back of them, as general helper 
and advisor, were one or more members of the library force. 
These teachers demonstrated what could be done for books, and 
provided the materials to work with. As in the case of the toys, 
a ticket was filled out specifying the kind of repairing or clean- 
ing demanded. The kinds of repairs which the pupils could do 
    
were: removing the marks of soiled fingers from the covers and 
pages with powdered pumice stone; replacing loose leaves with 
Success Binder; putting a new piece of cloth on the back of a 
book and over the covers; mending torn pages with transparent 
gummed tissue paper; pasting down a fly-leaf to cover some un- 
sightly writing on the inside of the covers; and sometimes even 
making an entirely new cover for a small book, fastening the 
pages into the covers with double-stitched Success Binder. Books 
in which the sewing was much loosened were cast aside as be- 
yond the possibilities of our skill and allowance of time. Such 
books were utilized for scrap books. To save time and confusion 
the repair equipment was kept on a certain table together with 
a pile of books previously examined. Then if a child arrived
-P-A-G-E-29
28 Francis W. Parker ScHOOL 
early in the morning, he could fill in his spare minutes with some 
repairing. - 
The work upon games is very much. like that required on 
books, so that the two may well be in the hands of one depart- 
ment. The boxes containing the games must often be cleaned 
- and mended. It must also be ascertained that all the parts of 
the game or puzzle are present. . 
With these arrangements, one year, six pupils and one teacher 
cleaned and repaired about seventy-five books and thirty games 
in the brief three weeks between the Thanksgiving and Holiday 
vaeation. Probably about twenty hours were devoted to the 
work. AIL such repairing is simple and may readily be done by 
pupils from the sixth grade on through the high school, if they 
have been taught to use their hands. 
This work does not appeal to the aesthetic sense, but rather 
to thé interest of the child whose love of order is strong. The 
joy of making things clean and presentable must be sufficient 
to enable one to disregard the stickiness of the glue, the flying 
pumice stone, and tedious erasures. It has chanced that among 
the volunteers for this department there hava been some of this 
description, and it was a joy to see them work. 
A simple mending outfit consists of: 
1 pint flexible glue. 
1 brush for same. | 
¥ ib. powdered pumice stone. 
¥% dozen rolls assorted colors and widths silk-finish cloth. 
¥% dozen rolls assorted widths double-stitched binder. 
2 clamps for holding books which have been glued. 
Some boards to place under the clamps to keep the sides of the book 
even. 
- Pieces of muslin or cheesecloth for applying the pumice stone to 
covers and pages. 
Some Hardmuth and kneaded erasers.* 
The repair of the dolls proved quite an art and enlisted the 
help of many of the high school girls and some of the teachers. 
  
*The flexible glue, double-stitched binder, and silk finished cloth may be 
obtained from Gaylord Brothers, Syracuse, New York, who will gladly send 
any one desiring it their catalogues of library supplies, in one of which are 
directions for rebinding books, 
If some Success Binder, adhesive parchment paper, or gummed onion- 
skin, and a box of powdered pumice stone’ were in every school room and 
the children made acquainted with their possibilities, and expected to keep 
their own books and those supplied by the school in good order, it. would 
pe a very efficient factor in cultivating a regard for property, one’s own or 
that of the public, which is so commonly lacking to-day.

YxEsr Book 29 
From the collection of severed arms and legs, and with the aid 
of glue pot, needle and elastic, many a doll which might have 
been thought well nigh incurable was restored to almost pristine 
freshness. Some of the older girls who had outgrown their dolls, 
brought in miniature wardrobes which, when: freshly laundered 
by the children, were used in dressing the dolls. 
  Meanwhile pasteboard boxes of all sizes, shapes and kinds, 
in which the toys and dolls were to be packed, had been accumu- 
lating. These were carefully looked over and cleaned in the 
same manner as were the books, the children selecting their boxes 
and decorating, after their own fashion, with pictures, bits cut - 
from wall papers, or bright colored papers. If the boxes were 
too unsightly to be made pretty by decoration, or needed rein- 
forcing at the corners, they were completely re-covered—gilt, 
silver, bronze, gray, red, ete., as a child might choose. Children 
of the second, third and fourth grades worked in this depart- 
ment, and they filled some of their boxes with several pages of 
dolls and dresses cut from the Lapres Home JourNAL and Goop 
HOovusEKEEPING, rolls of erépe tissue paper of different colors, also 
bronze, gilt, and silver paper together with a tube of library 
paste, for dressing the paper dolls. : 
One of the classes had made a set of doll’s beds. Making the 
mattresses and pillows, with the sheets and pillow cases, proved 
fascinating work of which the girls were duly proud, especially 
the mattresses which were stuffed and tufted in a truly workman- 
like manner.
-P-A-G-E-31

As mentioned above, the shop time of a class is frequently 
devoted to this form of work. Thus, one year, the pupils of the 
first grade decided that instead of making a doll house to play 
with in school they would make it for the children of one of the 
hospitals. Instead of one large house of several rooms to stand 
on. the floor, it was decided to make individual rooms—libraries, 
bed-rooms, kitchens, dining rooms, that every child might have 
one on his bed to play with. Each pupil chose the room he wished 
to make—sawing, planing and nailing the boards into oblong, 
shallow boxes of uniform size, with one side open. Windows 
were cut in the ends and moulding nailed on the outside for 
casings. One boy cleverly suggested adding two pieces of wood 
to the bottom of the house which would support the weight so 
that it might not rest on the invalid. These supports were put 
‘on with hinges and could be folded under when building together 
to make one house. Furniture was made of wood. White enamel 
was chosen as the most sanitary paint for both houses and fur- 
niture. The sixth grade made the wall paper, curtains and bed- 
ding, and the second grade made small rugs in appropriate 
colors, 
Another year a Noah’?s Ark and many games of dominoes 
were made. The Ark was built in the manual training room and 
looked as near like the original as first grade children could make 
it. The animals, two of every kind, were painted on paper, cut 
out and nailed by the feet to small pieces of wood whieh-sup- 
ported them. Noah and his family were produced in the same 
manner. The dominoes were cut out of double faced cardboard, 
red and white, with the correct number of dots marked on each 
one with soft lead pencil. A box and cover of red cardboard 
_ Was made to hold each set.

The second grade scrapbook party was the outgrowth of a 
parents’ meeting at which the mothers asked for some definite 
part in the Christmas work. It was decided that they should 
make at home simple, durable cloth books of various shapes and 
sizes. The cloth was double for each page and twelve pages con- 
stituted a book. All the children: of the school were asked to 
contribute pictures. On the appointed day the mothers and chil- 
dren spent a social hour together in the grade room arranging and 
pasting the pictures in the books, Which made attractive gifts for 
the Crippled Children’s Hospital. Before going home the chil- 
dren served simple refreshments which they had prepared. 
In preparing for the Christmas work, as mentioned above, 
a Morning Exercise is devoted each year to developing the proper 
spirit of giving and sharing among the children. One year this 
consisted of a very effective reading of Tolstoi’s excellent story 
“Where Love is There is God Also.’’* 
The next day the Morning Exercise on the Christmas Toy 
Shop was given as reported stenographically on a previous page. 
As mentioned in that exercise, an appeal was made also to the 
children to bring in some of their real treasures, which they still 
cherished, the intention being to see what response would be made 
to an appeal which would involve the element of real sacrifice, 
namely, the giving away of some toy which was still dear to the   
*In order to gain the assistance of the home in our work along this 
line the following letter was, last year, sent to the home. 
“To Patrons and Friends of the Francis W. Parker School: 
“The school is this year making a greater effort than ever before to impress upon the children the beauty of the Christmas spirit. The children 
have heard Tolstoi’s story, ‘Where Love is, There God is Also,’ and through- 
out the month we hope to keep before them the essential meaning of the Christmas season—that it is a time of kindly feeling towards one’s fellows. We should be glad if not one child saw any of its unlovely features—hurry, 
worry, ostentation, perfunctory giving. We wish them to feel that a gift is nothing, unless genuine affection prompts it; nothing, unless into it 
the giver has put a part of himself. His’own work is, of course, the best, 
but at least careful, thoughtful selection is indispensable. This means that a child should be allowed to give very few gifts. 
“We believe that you will agree with us that Christmas ‘lists,’ by 
means of which the parents meet large responsibilities for him in a busi- ness-like way, have no rightful place in the child’s growing years, if we 
are to preserve the true spirit of Christmas giving. We are very anxious to 
have no Christmas gifts given in the school which are in any way forced 
or suggested, and the school collections for presents often have this result. 
We ask you to codperate with us in having the children understand that if they have not the time or inclination to give in the right way Christmas 
gifts in the school, what they really can give of themselves in helpful 
influence, in service, is even more appreciated and often represents more 
genuine giving. 
“We hope that it will be understood that we want to help and _ en- courage in every possible way the true spirit of giving, but we want to 
remove those artificial incentives to universal exchange of Chrtstmas gifts which mar this season of goodfellowship and place upon children the pre- 
mature burdens of adult responsibility. Let us keep our children simple and natural.and genuine, and, protect them as long as possible from the 
sophistication which certainly has no place in their Christmas festival.”

young heart. The response was very gratifying, in fact it was 
so generous that it might be suspected that baser motives than 
those of unselfish sacrifice prompted the response. That this was 
not the case, however, and that the motives were genuine was 
evidenced many times and’ frequently corroborated by the home. 
For instance when a little girl came hugging to her bosom two 
dolls which bore traces of much loving care, and handed them 
over with the remark that ‘‘they just had to go to the same 
mother,’’ it was evident that she was parting with one of her 
most beloved treasures. There is no question that the simple 
story of the shoemaker in Tolstoi’s tale was bearing fruit. 
The value of the Santa Claus Toy Shop was manifested in 
many ways. Aside from the thought of working for others which 
was at the bottom of the scheme, the feeling of goodfellowship 
which pervaded the work was most noticeable. The kindly and 
sympathetic interest of the older boys, who filled the role of in- 
spectors and foremen, in the struggles of the younger people in 
some difficult piece of repair work, helped to unite the school. 
High school boys ‘‘renewed their youth’’ and also discovered 
some interesting applications of their recent physics experiments 
‘while investigating the ‘‘innards’’ of some mechanical toy. The 
children of primary grades were busy with paste pot and shears, 
and it would be hard indeed to recognize in the gay and festive 
results of their labors the commonplace cardboard boxes which 
had been brought. in for the packing of the finished produet.. 
Although there was a spirit of play in the work it was in- 
teresting to note the seriousness with which the pupils entered 
into it. The lengthening column of figures on the time card was 
eagerly watched, and the pay check at the end was as highly 
prized as though it represented actual cash. Of no small value 
was the insight into industrial organization, and subdivision of 
labor, which was appreciated by even the youngest worker. And 
underneath it all was the joyous spirit of Christmas, the knowl- 
edge that the work was a labor of love, in order that.some one 
less fortunate might have his share of Christmas joy.

“INVESTIGATION LANE” 
  
Have you forgotten the tin can telephone that you and: Alice 
put up between your houses, or the unescapable bear traps that 
you and Fred contrived and never put to test? Or do you recall 
with most delight the house that you and the boys built in the 
tree? To engender and foster the spirit of such high enterprises 
as these is the lofty mission of Investigation Lane. To the eye of 
the soul it is the home of freedom, the land of unlimited possi- 
bilities, while to bodily vision it is a much littered and properly 
segregated slice off one end of the playground. Here he who will 
may come during the half hour’s play time at noon and build his 
heart’s desire. There is a pile of boards, there are nails and ham- 
mers and hatchets and saws and spades and pick-axes in the tool 
house, and there is a faculty overseer who may serve as umpire, 
arbiter, suggester, rescuer, so far as in her lies. 
Three years ago the reservation was opened up to all ‘‘who 
had anything they wanted to make.’’ There was not a rush to 
occupy the territory. Indeed, until the hint was dropped, ‘‘Why 
not a cave?’’ the land lay desert. Then the spade was thrust in, 
the cave-fever spread, and the world was honeyecombed. To the 
subsequent impatient wail of the overseer, ‘“‘Isn’t there anything 
to do but dig caves?’’ there was no answer except more caves. 
The most interesting one consisted of a large square hole with a 
tunnel leading to a smaller well, which was to serve as a secret 
entrance. This was an enterprise of some fourth grade boys. 
There were also three other plain, unvarnished holes, and a big 
square well dug by the third graders which reached the proud 
depth of eight feet, and, according to the prospectors, actually 
touched water. At the well and the big cave the boys rigged up 
pulleys and ropes and devised an elaborate system of signals for 
hoisting the dirt in pails. 
In the later part of the cave era, a tribe of hut builders in- 
vaded the land and began the first hut—the’unpromising ancestor 
of a numerous progeny. All these pioneers came from the ranks 
of the third, fourth, and fifth grades, and were mostly boys, 
though a few of the girls enjoyed the feel of the spade in the 
yielding earth. But no hand ever wrote ‘‘Finis’’ to the history

of that first year. At the end of school the cave yawned un- 
roofed—the lean frame of the hut was left’ naked to the elements 
—and the walls of the dry well crumbled in. 
‘Next year the unnatural parents of these progenies looked 
askance upon them. For a few weeks there was intermittent dig- 
ging in the big cave, but soon it was deserted. Then there en- 
tered squatters from a lower grade and took possession of cave 
and hut, and work began with a will. A group of three fourth 
grade boys continued the big cave; a few mild third graders 
placed themselves under the masterly leadership of .a fourth grade 
tyrant and dug down until a buried bed spring, not to be denied, 
barred further passage. Then they roofed the hole over and sat 
in speechless pride in the damp gloom, or even knelt and made 
improvements, for the low ceiling prevented uprightness. They 
built a fireplace of brick and cooked bacon and occasionally ate 
lunch in their retreat. I say they did these things, but really no 
Helots ever had less freedom. One day I saw three of the fol- 
lowers standing around the entrance and gazing wistfully within. 
‘“Why don’t you go down?’’ I asked. ‘‘Jaeger isn’t here,’’ they 
said. ‘‘What of it?’’ I queried. ‘‘He said he’d punch us if we 
went down when he wasn’t there,’’ they replied. Yet under 
Jaeger’s tyranny the arts flourished, and an interesting breed of 
boys developed; for later in the year, after the cave had gone the 
way of all childish interests, these third graders built a fort with 
ingeniously barred windows; organized themselves and chose a 
king and tried occasional battles with the fourth grade, shutting 
their captured into the fort. This stronghold was a flat-topped 
house, about five feet long, four feet high, and four feet wide. T 
helped to put up the frame, but after that the work went quite 
independently under one of the ablest and gentlest kings that 
ever ruled—sovereign not by right of might and loud voice but 
of brains and quiet kindness. : 
A large fourth grade group, in the midst of wrangling and 
backbiting and toppling dynasties, had dug the masterpiece of the 
Lane. Their eave had a real stairway leading down, a trap door, 
_a fireplace that did not smoke overmuch, a floor, a seat, hiding 
places for provisions, and a roof high enough to allow some of the 
owners to stand upright. Protected by a trap door and a secret: 
password and a chaperoning teacher, the group often lunched 
grandly here. But after living in the cave for a few weeks, even
-P-A-G-E-36

its enthusiastic makers began to feel that fresh air and day light 
and room to stretch legs might be pleasant. A hut above ground, 
and the hidden cave as keep! But the difficulties of building on 
the somewhat unstable floor did not promise the perfect structure 
of which the boys were dreaming. They were glad, therefore, to 
be offered an unfloored shed which they might improve to their 
liking. They put in a floor and a partition and a window, changed

Note, also, the Battlements and Totem of the Silver Wolves, 
the shape of the door, built a folding table and two long stationary 
box benches, dignified by the title of ‘‘lockers,’’ and papered the 
interior. Their evidence goes, ‘‘Liaying the sleepers level was the 
hardest thing, and do you remember the time we tried to work and 
were frozen out?’’. This room, when completed, really seated 
eleven boys and five guests of manly proportions, and still left 
enough space in the middle to give to the builders a proud feeling 
of commodiousness. As the hut neared completion, plans were 
conceived to build a roof garden. There were visions of greenness 
and shade where the members might luxuriate ‘‘like gods together,’’ 
and look down upon the ball game’ while they ate their luncheon. 
But bloodeurdling tales of disturbing neighbors, stigmatized as 
“toughs,’? who would’ consider this elegant structure, towering 
above the protecting playground fence, as a target for stones and 
other missiles, altered the plan to an arbor before the door. This

seed within it. That the gourds did not grow and the grass never 
sprouted, did not impair the pleasure. 
Meantime, some of ‘the girls of the fourth grade had acquired 
title to the unfinished hut of the year before. They worked at it 
half-heartedly and intermittently, with spasms of, unhappiness 
because one child was ‘‘bossy’’ and another was lazy. But when 
all the girls of the grade were gathered into a club, the hut- 
building gained new vigor. The ‘‘Nymphs’’ they called them- 
    
FIRST HUT OF THE KNIGHTLY BROTHERS 
selves, because they ‘‘thought it would be lovely to live out in the 
woods like nymphs, and not have to live in houses, and not have 
to do things like people.’’? But these inconsistent nymphs, never- 
theless, must have a house. They completed the main wing of the 
old shack, putting in a window with a suriny southern exposure, 
and added an L. The original hut had been built over a secret 
cave entrance. By. mere change of name the girls now converted 
this hole into a cellar, where they actually did store a peck of po- 
tatoes. The hut disappointed the children’s dreams when it was 
up, especially when compared with the boys’ palace, but as the tall 
ones crouched under their roof, they would say, ‘‘I don’t care if 
it is a little low, we built it all ourselves, and most of us can stand 
up in it.’’ They hung the walls with blue paper cambriec, and
-P-A-G-E-38
Year Boox 37 
were delighted because it ‘‘brightened the hut up so.’’ They 
_ bought a little wood stove, and planned to cook lunch in it, but the 
Fates were not propitious. The stove smoked, the roof leaked and 
made figured tapestry out of the spotless cambric, the weather 
turned warm, and ventilation was not. Yet they owed a great 
deal to the hut, and they paid it in love. As a group, at the be- 
ginning of the year, they had-been rather too restrained and lack- 
ing in initiative, with an unblessed tendency to keep their clothes 
clean, But-six months’ experience with refractory boards and tar 
paper and shovels and dirt had converted them into sturdy daugh- 
ters of the soil. . 
Their most vigorous and joyful piece of work was the making 
of a garden about the hut. Now, the soil of Investigation Lane is 
the last word in sterility, so when the Nymphs decided to have a 
garden, they had to skin black soil off more fertile places and 
earry it over to make a layer on their yard. It was back-breaking 
work, but they stuck to it like heroines. A friend gave lilac 
bushes, lilies-of-the-valley, irises, golden glow, tiger lilies, and an 
alanthus tree. These the girls laboriously planted, and they made 
beds around the hut and sowed nasturtiums and morning glories 
and covered the whole yard with grass seed. Then they sprinkled 
the garden faithfully every day, and we had visions of an oasis in 
our desert. They marked off little curved paths, and went to the 
lake shore one afternoon and got two heavy wheelbarrow loads of 
gravel to cover the walks. Under the shade of the alanthus tree 
they wanted a cement pool for fish and swamp plants. Upon sug- 
gestion, however, we bought a galvanized iron wash tub instead. 
Near the end of the year the girls planned to give a luncheon 
for the graduating class of the high school. They had enough 
ideas for a presidential banquet. The hut was too low; they must 
have a picnic on their lawn, but the grass had refused to grow, 
and the chickens had scratched up their flowers. Everybody 
agreed that ‘‘it looked horrid.’? An investigating Nymph dis- 
covered a little neglected sod in' the old garden, It was a treasure 
trove. Five play periods the children spent scalping the place and 
sodding their yard as far as grass and time allowed. On the final 
day, hot weather drove our party to the park, but everything was 
very successful, the guests were appreciative, and the club was 
happy. 
All these activities had been carried on by groups of volunteers
-P-A-G-E-39

actuated by springs within themselves. But two other pieces of 
work were done that were inspired by class study and were im- 
pelled and regulated by the grade teacher. The second grade, 
worshiping at Crusoe’s shrine, built a cave, furnished it with chairs 
and a ladder which they had made in the sloyd shop, and thrust 
into their lofty pile of excavated earth a very model of Robinson’s 
own calendar device. The first grade, even in the ancient days 
before the incorporation of Investigation Lane, had begun a brick 
playhouse. Foun courses they laid, firm and strong, arid then that 
early first grade passed away, leaving a relic and a dream. The

spreading a genealogical tree as the Cathedral of Cologne. 
During the second epoch of the history of the Lane, there- 
fore, the race had stepped up from caves to huts, and whereas at 
the end of the preceding period institutions had been left in a

state of incompleteness and incipient decay, this age could point 
with pride to four finished and solid structures. © 
The next year opened auspiciously. On almost the first day 
of school, some of the Knightly Brothers (the group of fifth grade 
boys) came to me with the glad tidings that they were going 
to build a new hut: the old one was too little. Of course, the old 
one was quite good enough, but the sad thing about it was that it 
was finished. After some parleying, we were granted a certain 
length of the open shedg im the playground. With the help of the 
elass teacher and the manual training teacher, careful planning 
began, being done mostly in recitation time, with weekly reports 
and investigations at the club meetings. At the boys’ wish, the 
new house was to be much more carefully done, than the old one; 
with more of an eye to beauty.. The floor was to be brick, the 
lining was to be decorated wall board, the table and benches were 
to be of good design, bearing the club monogram. This is evidence 
that rough and ready methods do not necessarily engender Jow 
ideals of workmanship and permanent bad habits of construction. 
The more carefully planned and more accurately executed man- 
ual work, done in regular school time, is doubtless the safeguard 
against such ill results. In order to earry out their ambitious 
plans, the boys obtained the help of the shop teacher and the use 
of the regular handwork periods. That is, the Lane had originated 
a scheme that was finally lifted up to the higher level of super- 
vised hand work. When the cluh figured out the cost of the lumber, 
the piled up dues of last year shrank to comical insufficiency, and 
the boys began casting about for methods of earning money, for 
which building operations must wait; for the club forcibly rejected 
a suggestion that they should begin and pay for their materials as 
they could. Indeed, some boys waxed quite eloquent upon the dan- 
gers of running into debt. Some of the ways and means suggested 
had a weird tinge of mature slack morals, like a raffle and a tag 
day, but the club finally settled upon making jig-saw maps and 
eandy at home, and accepted Mr. Wahlstrom’s offer that, in their 
manual training periods, they should make key-racks for sale. 
They also spent many recesses, carrying lumber under contract to 
the school at ten cents an hour. Their assets finally aggregated 
over forty dollars, enough to buy all their materials. The new hut 
now stands complete—an evidence, I think, of somewhat unusual 
social stability and intensity of purpose.

Long before the end of the previous year, the fourth grade 
girls had become dissatisfied with their hut, and during the last 
week of school we had held a meeting to consider plans, and had 
adjourned to look over the ground. Emily, casting a critical eye 
at the poor, crumpled, tar-paper thing, had said: 
“JT think there is one thing we ought to be careful about, and that 
is the architecture. I never have cared for the architecture of our hut.” 
  
  “I NEVER HAVE CARED FOR THE ARCHITECTURE OF OUR HUT” 
Some one else had said: : 
“The trouble with this one was that we didn’t plan it before we 
began it. I think we ought to make some plans.” 
Alma had paced off the ground, and told how she thought the 
hut might be built, and Christina had cried, 
“Oh, that’s perfect. You come walking up the steps here, and here 
you come into one great living room.” 
Emily had said, . 
“Sometimes I. like my idea and sometimes I don’t. Sometimes I 
think it would be nice to put a partition across and have a bed room, 
so that when we want to sleep here all night we’ll have a room.” 
During vacation, two of the girls had met at school, and had 
made sketches of the hut and had got an estimate on the lumber. 
It needed a goodly sum. At that time they had many plans for 
raising the money—to do needle work, to print a book of cooking 
recipes that the girls themselves had used, to write a Greek story
-P-A-G-E-42
Year Book 41 
and have it published, to give an opera and charge admission. 
And, indeed, at the County Fair, held in the school yard early the 
following year, the Club had needlework and sachet bags and 
blotters and candy ready for sale. But the other ambitious ideas 
had evaporated, and they adopted Miss Cooke’s suggestion of sell- 
ing candy before luncheon. With few failures or interruptions, 
the girls made and sold candy once or twice a week for five months, 
and accumulated in the treasury about thirty-two dollars, and it 
is their proud boast that they have earned every cent of it, where- 
as the boys had dues. So much energy went into this candy mak- 
ing that little remained for actual building of the hut or ‘“‘bunga- 
low,’’ as the new structure is termed. The old shanty, however, 
was torn down, and the premises made tidy, and a plan for the 
new house was drawn up. For various reasons, partly, I suspect, 
because this birth of their brains seems°a bit discouragingly 
prodigious, the Nymphs deferred’ “the actual building until -the 
next year. 
The fort builders of the previous period, under their old time 
king, began straightway to make improvements. They enlarged 
the building and made benches (upon which no one ever yet has 
-had time to sit); they added a porch on the south; they” built 
battlements ‘around the edge of the flat roof, erected a watch tower 
at one corner, and made a snow- pall eaiinon to frown through a 
port-hole, but the snow inconsiderately melted, before its completion 
and it has lain inactive, Inside the hut a dark ‘and: gloomy prison 
was partitioned off. ‘The fort finally threatened completion, and 
I trembled for its fate, since the fun is to the maker, and the 
finished thing is dead and uninspiring. Such is the melancholy 
history of all the works of Investigation Lane. But the imp of 
invention saved the day for the fort by inspiring some one with 
the magnificent idea of a secret tunnel for escape in time of war. 
_ That stirring expression, ‘‘In time of war,’’ is constantly upon our 
lips. Life is one long, excited preparation, against the enemy, who 
has not yet appeared. Only once has there been battle, when the 
Silver Wolves engaged the Knightly Brothers with snow balls, and, 
according to the report of the Wolves, worsted them. I came upon 
the victorious army marching around the grounds in single file, 
with tin pan beating and their totem proudly borne before. _ An- 
other great enterprise that oceupied the end of the year was a 
drawbridge, spanning the hole beside the fort, romantically known
-P-A-G-E-43
42 Francois W. ParKER ScHoou 
as ‘‘The Ravine,’’ which in reality is the sad ruin of the long de-. 
serted Crusoe cave. ’ 
Two groups formed themselves among the girls of the: fourth 
grade, and their first move was to clamor for names. Trolls and 
Persephone’s Field they chose. The Trolls began building a house 
with a cellar. The cellar must not be forgotten. Trolls, doubtless, 
would be quite impossible without underground works. Perse- 
phone’s Field is on stilts, and one needs a ladder to mount to the 
  
  THE SILVER WOLVES AT THE DRAWBRIDGE 
floor. It is occasionally spoken of as a temple, though not by out- 
siders. Both these structures lean upon the sturdy shoulder of the 
tall tight-board fence that encloses the playground. A tin-can 
telephone between the house and the school, a Chinese railroad from 
tool shed to house for carrying tools, and a rope ladder for as- 
cending to their dwelling, are some of the yet unrealized dreams 
of Persephone’s Field. ~ 
It must be understood that the Lane is a happy-go-lucky 
place, with everything done by rule of thumb or by no rule at all. 
There is a rooted objection to drawing a straight line, or using a 
square or tape. The favorite method of measuring is to nail the 
board on and then saw off what sticks out. It evidently is felt
-P-A-G-E-44
YEAR Boox 43 
that cracks in the wall are aids to ventilation. The hatchet takes 
the place of the plane, when worse comes to worse and a board 
must be trimmed off on the edge. The length of time required to 
do things is unbelievable. A little girl will need one whole work 
period to find a board and saw it off; or, perhaps, even, she must 
let it stand over until the next day. I once found a Troll in tears 
because the superintendent had relieved her of her job, for the 
reason that ‘‘she had been three days driving one nail.’’ Yet 
people are rarely discouraged at the slowness of things. I marvel 
at their blitheness. , 
A disappointing feature of the work in the Lane is the lack of 
varicty—caves and huts—huts and caves. To be sure, a few chil- 
dren have come occasionally to play with the hose and running 
water. They have dug irrigation ditches and canals, made ex- 
periments in river action, constructed islands, and modeled land- 
scape. Now and then we have had bonfires and toasted cheese and 
apples and broiled bacon, and there in the historic garden of the 
Nymphs. But ideas seem to be epidemic rather than individual, 
although inside the general notion of hut or cave there are all 
sorts of personal inventiveness. Yet why do not groups start fire 
engine departments, make stilts, kites, teter-totters, build snow 
forts, toboggan slides, railroads? The truth of the matter seems to 
be that they need the inspiration that material and example sup- 
ply. Here is exemplified once more the old fact that children are 
imitators. The overseer plans another year to build a pair of 
stilts for herself, and to make a brave attempt to use them in the 
April slush, with the hope that some one will adopt the plan and 
better it. She means also to fill one end of the Lane with fascinat- 
ing wooden boxes, and to coax some girls over to play house with 
them, so liberating a new breed of bacteria in the community. This 
role of unrecognized inoculator seems to be the right one for the 
overseer, and she considers it chiefly her business to keep her hands 
off after she has once made a suggestion and finds it not adopted. 
There must be something wrong with the idea in such case. It 
must be too fussy, too apparently slow, not sufficiently interesting, 
without evident. reason. Occasion sometimes forces other rolés 
upon her. She has had to hold up the group leader’s hand in ex- 
pelling lazy or lawless members of the Lane; she has had to act as 
peacemaker between warring factions; her advice is repeatedly 
sought in matters of construction. When interest has lagged, and
-P-A-G-E-45
44 Francis W. Parker ScHOOL 
dissolution has threatened, she has turned to and sawed and ham- 
mered as fast as she could in order to give some slow project a 
push towards completion. ‘‘Oh, how much we have done today,’’ 
the surprised and gratified members have said at such times, and 
discouragement has taken to flight, and a new and enthusiastic 
interest has held the field. Indeed, it is evident that the reason 
the Lane projects have especially prospered with certain grades 
is that the class teachers here have lent their support. Not much 
help is needed—time to hold meetings, the borrowed dignity of 
mature recognition, a suggested plan for dividing the work, per- 
haps, a little oversight of luncheon arrangements. Nor is such in- 
terposition a contravening of the value of this self-actuated and 
socialized proceeding. The younglings have been self-developing; 
the alma mater merely takes them on her back once or twice and 
instructs them how to fiy. 
Groups are very different in their manner of working. A 
few have been quarrelsome and noisy—such have done best when 
definite jobs have been assigned to individuals at the beginning of 
the period. Often the overseer has had to establish military rule 
for a time’ and superintend the work herself. But generally group- 
chosen heals, with the help of occasional suggestions, have solved 
the problem. Some groups consciously elect heads according to 
a definite plan; in others, the leadership falls without deliberation 
upon a natural manager. He rules mildly or despotically, ac- 
cording to his character, until a new claimant for power arises. 
Then comes revolution, but I have never detected a drop of bit- 
terness at such times. A fourth grade group, in telling their 
reminiscences of the previous year, related with glee how they had 
had war and had deposed King Alfred ‘‘because he was always — 
saying things and getting us into trouble,’’ and his one-time 
majesty smilingly demurred, ‘‘Oh, we didn’t really fight; it was 
just talk.’ The strongest leaderships so far have developed 
among groups of boys. Often the girls have gone on successfully 
without a distinct head, recognized or unrecognized. But gener- 
ally, the exigencies of the work itself demand that some one shall 
have the general plan in mind and see that the necessary things 
are being done at the right time. Moreover, nailing is a favorate 
occupation, and where there is no superintendence it frequently 
happens that the market is glutted with knights of the hammer 
and a panic in sawed lumber ensues. Such crises have taught
-P-A-G-E-46
Year Boox 45 
"several groups the economy of choosing a director. The Nymphs 
during their first year repudiated the notion of having a president, 
saying, ‘“We don’t need anybody to boss us,’’ and they felt pride 
in their equality and independence, a pride that grew stronger 
as the boys repeatedly expressed their scorn of this unofficered 
condition. But at the very beginning of the following year they 
elected a president and secretary and treasurer, as a matter of 
course. Was this in imitation of the boys’ much vaunted practice, 
or of the immemorial custom of the fifth grade literary society, 
or was it a re-discovery of the fact that for economical operation 
a social group needs a head? 
The Lane people always speak of their activity as work, never 
as play. Not that they feel abused ; for they enthusiastically choose 
this work instead of the alluring games that are going on in other 
parts of the playground. But it: seems to sound more important 
and serious than skipping rope or playing ball. Most children, 
however, desire an occasional change. Some groups that are well 
organized decide regularly to work and play on alternate days, or 
in some cases, individual members choose regular days off. Large 
companies have divided themselves into two gangs, and these 
gangs have worked alternately. When especially enticing weather 
ealls to snowballs or marbles, or ‘‘association,’’ a group will decide 
on a vacation. Sometimes people just come when they like, but 
this generally breeds complaints among the more regular habitués, 
and at such times there often results a general dissatisfaction in 
the whole thing, and the entire troop deserts until some quicken- 
ing spring forces them to sunny, free-and-easy pottering, and they 
flock to their old haunts with all troubles forgotten. Indeed, 
“‘winter and rough weather’’ are our worst enemies. 
The personnel of the Lane and the motives of the frequenters 
are interesting. A few children are there because they are natural 
mechanics, and their fingers are always itching to handle tools. 
Without these people the Lane could not exist. It is they who 
do the picturesque and interesting things that endear the Lane to 
the hearts of the frequenters. The leadership generally falls upon 
these children, even though they may not be good executives; for 
people with the more managing gift, unlighted by mechanical in- 
genuity, prove unfit leaders in building a house and planning me- 
chanical jobs for eager saws. Riots and mutinies and the de- 
pendence of the ungifted keep hammering at the inventors, and,
-P-A-G-E-47

behold, they at last evolve into social executives. Some children 
ensconce themselves in the comfortable Lane because they are of 
the type that does not enjoy vigorous organized games such as 
mostly go on in the playground. Perhaps they are physically lazy 
or afraid of being hurt. This class does not furnish very useful 
members of the building trade, of course, but they are happy in 
the Lane. Other children’s distaste for games is due to the fact 
that they are temperamentally gentle and individualistic. These 
people often develop from hangers-on into efficient workers and 
very pleasant group members. Often, moreover, the very con- 
ditions of the Lane labor unearth latent tendencies, and a passive 
child will develop into a mechanic and inventor. Others are there 
because they are social creatures and like to be with their friends, 
or like to belong to self-governed groups; even, sometimes, because 
they are ambitious of being leaders. The grade lines are very 
strong, and there is generally a feeling of liking to have in the 
group all the boys or girls of the class and no outlanders. This 
has its regrettable side, I think. It would be pleasant to see boys 
and girls of various ages working together. But I suppose one 
mustn’t risk losing caste by fraternizing with one’s inferiors. 
Moreover, its early habitués have given the Lane its character and 
trend, and it would be kicking against the pricks indeed to try to 
introduce more mature and finished projects. Yet it would be 
worth while, surely, for eighth grade boys to be installing water 
wheels or devising a system of irrigation for the garden or build- 
ing kites or supervising a fourth grade job or putting up a tele- 
phone for some little girls. 
Perhaps the most interesting thing about the Lane is the 
social phase, for the work is distinctly group activity and every 
group independently develops some characteristic social form. 
The groups generally organize themselves as ‘‘clubs,’’ and their 
indoor meetings become as interesting and as significant as their 
outdoor work. At these meetings many schemes are evolved—some 
quite feasible, other hare-brained and never-to-be-realized, and 
for that very reason, perhaps, altogether charming. As example 
of these clubs, let'me rehearse the tales of the Silver Wolves and 
the Knightly Brothers. 
The Silver Wolves 
Early in the year, the fort-builders became ambitious to wear 
a name. A social consciousness had grown, and they seemed to
-P-A-G-E-48
- Year Book 47 
feel themselves a united organization. Therefore, they craved a 
: visible sign of this solidarity. During their life in the third grade 
and their study of early trappers, many of them had contracted a 
real affection for animals, and the names which sprang to their lips 
were Gray Fox, Black Bear, Red Lynx, and the like. The one 
chosen was Golden Wolf—I do not know on what grounds, unless 
those of euphony. A little ingenuity and a key-hole saw turned 
out a lifelike totem, but when the artist came to buy the gold 
paint ‘‘the man sold him silver paint instead,’’ and the name of 
the club was changed to Silver Wolf to match the totem. So doth 
accident shape great events! A new boy had come into the class, 
a boy of unusual initiative and mechanical ingenuity. He rev- 
eled in the work of construction, but enjoyed himself most when 
he could go on alone, untrammelled by less expert advice. Gradu- 
ally, however, as he saw ‘the group acting, social ambition seized 
upon him, and he decided to be leader. My unpracticed eye missed 
his delicate kind of log-rolling, but he was soon elected president. 
The title of ‘‘king’’ worn by the leader of the previous year had 
dropped unnoticed out of memory. Under the new head began a 
period of varied activities. An imitation wireless aerial added 
dignity to the fort. A bell was installed, and a system of danger 
signals invented. Notice was occasionally posted up calling meet- 
ings of the Silver Wolves, whereat the president was to ‘‘give a 
lecture about a secret alphabet.’’ A scheme of passports was de- 
vised, so that no enemy might steal into the fort. At the weekly 
meetings the president subjected the members to an examination 
on the alphabet. Those proving unprepared were summarily set 
to studying, and at the next meeting proved the efficacy of the 
president’s reprimand. All these plans were fun in the making, 
and received very serious attention, but most of them proved un- 
necessary frills and after a little fell away and left the good, solid 
labor of construction as the real interest. Under this new leader 
the meetings were unusually dignified and earnest, and a great 
deal of business was rushed through. At one meeting he announced 
that the elub would now proceed to make a rule book. ‘‘Every 
boy write some rules, and when he is done come over to this side 
of the room.’’ Dead silence, and slow-moving of pencils. As soon 
as one declared his work finished, the president inspected the paper, 
checking those rules that he approved, and scratching out others 
with a ‘‘That’s no good.’’? His dictum was waited for with bated
-P-A-G-E-49
48 Francis W. Parker ScHoon 
breath, and his approval received with a proud smile. Inspection 
finished, the president said, ‘‘Now we will vote on them.’’ He 
read one rule, ‘‘How many boys want that?’’ All hands up. 
“‘That’s passed.’’ Another was read. ‘‘How many want that?’’ 
All hands up but one. The president repeated, ‘‘How many want 
this rule?’’? The insurgent hand was still impassive. The Presi- 
dent—‘‘I am waiting for Mather’s hand.’’ That brought it, and 
the rule was passed. There was no break in unanimity from that 
on. The following are the rules adopted: 
RULES 
We trust in these laws, and hope that every boy will obey them. 
1. The president must keep all boys at work except on play days. 
2. The president must Keep all boys out of the girls’ huts. 
8. The whole club shall have cone play day a week. 
4, Boys must not play while at work. . 
5. Boys must not carry nails in their pockets. 
6. Boys must mind their president. 
7, Boys must always put away tools. 
8. No snow-balling in the Lane while work is going on. 
9. The president may be elected for two terms. These for two weeks 
ata time. 
10. There shall be no snow balls made of ice. 
The overseer felt restive under this tyranny, and upon occa- 
sion inserted a surreptitious lever to begin its overthrow and start 
democratic thinking. ‘‘I am going to do so and so,’’ the presi- 
dent would say, in an expansive moment of gossip. ‘‘Have you 
asked the boys?’’ the overseer would inquire. A somewhat dis- 
gruntled ‘‘No,’’ in response. ‘‘Well, of course they must decide,’’ 
and the matter was always duly brought up at the meeting, but 
a noteworthy fact is that no suggestion of the president was ever 
rejected. In strict accordance with the rule, however, at the end 
of his second term, a new president was elected. He was a boy 
who had never before evinced any power as a leader, but he had 
evidently been drinking in wisdom duririg the rule of the despot. 
Moreover, the great responsibility of leading the club quickened 
the results of the unconscious teaching of the former president, 
and the lad developed into an able head, lacking somewhat the 
coolness and poise and foresightedness of his predecessor, but mak- 
ing up for the lack in his willingness to learn, for the former 
president found it hard to keep his hands off and frequently took 
over the reins momentarily when the meeting grew a bit ineffectual.
-P-A-G-E-50

Evidently the overseer was wrong in regretting the stern and un- 
democratic rule, for the boys had learned businesslike methods of 
conducting a meeting and carrying on the work of construction. 
For the rest of the year things went on with great vigor and 
economy of time and effort. It seems perhaps a little less romantic 
than the earlier days of kings and revolutions, but surely there is 
nothing much better than efficient democracy. 
The Knightly Brothers 
At the beginning of the year before last, there was little of 
the milk of human kindness in the boys of the fourth grade. They 
were unusually selfish, quarrelsome, and given to bitter feuds 
among themselves. This eternal hostility evidenced itself even in 
recitations, where the majority. would never listen with patience to 
the opinions of the outcasts, and on the playgrounds the ostracized 
ones were persecuted after the pleasant manner of ten-year-old 
boys. Moreover, the play ideals of the majority were not fitting 
to their age, leaning to an aping of bigger boys and a scorning of 
simple, childish play. In an attempt to counteract these unde- 
sirable tendencies, I suggested a club to include all fourth grade 
boys to do some work needed for the school. The suggestion was 
accepted with avidity, and numberless meetings were held after 
school to consider name, motto, watchword, and vows. (The ‘‘work 
to be done for the school’’ could wait, indeed, is still waiting.) 
It is not to be believed, the amount of discussion needed to settle 
these matters. One cause consisted in there being no tendency to 
override the minority. When a unanimous vote could not be ob- 
tained there was always a new suggestion or an attempt to com- 
promise. A spirit of earnestness and friendliness grew up during 
this long series of meetings, where discussion was very free and 
earnest, and where the club gradually took on an all-absorbing 
significance. The fact that vows and motto were to be secret 
quickened the joy. Be it understood, however, that from the very 
beginning it was determined that all club matters were to be freely 
discussed with fathers and mothers and club advisor. From them 
there were to be no secrets. There was a knightly tinge to the 
ideals, primarily suggested by the club advisor for didactic 
purposes, but the interest in knights evoked in the third grade 
caused the boys eagerly to accept and adopt the idea. They finally 
settled upon Knightly Brothers for their name. At first some of
-P-A-G-E-51
50 Francis W. ParKer ScHoou 
the boys wanted to keep it a seeret. They seemed to feel that it 
would be pleasant to hug the name to them in private, but the 
argument of the inquiring girls of the class finally influenced them 
to blazen it abroad. The girls said, ‘‘I should think you would 
want to have your name known and make it famous.’’ The dis- 
cussion of the vows was very serious. Concerning one which was 
suggested and which seemed a difficult one to keep, a certain boy 
said, ‘‘Are we supposed to keep these vows forever?’’ The whole 
elub assured him that they were, whereupon he shook his head and 
said, ‘‘I don’t think we ought to have that one.’’ They told hia 
that if he kept it for several years, as long as he belonged to the 
elub, he would get into the habit, and do it all his life. The small 
number of vows finally accepted is no index of their suggestive- 
ness to club members, or of the many early candidates and the 
long and searching discussion. The-vows were inscribed in a club 
book, together with the signatures of the members, and a ceremony 
of ‘‘taking the vows,’’ was devised. 
Near the end of the year one of the boys broke a vow, and 
there were two solemn meetings to consider the matter. It was de- 
cided to exile him from the club. The recreant took rather a 
hurt and defiant attitude. I was much interested in the patient, 
kindly manner of the other members as they attempted to assure 
him that they “didn't feel hard toward him,’’ ‘‘that they wanted 
to do him good.’’ They decided to watch him for a week, and 
“Gf he did better’’ to take him back. Meantime he must give up 
his pin and not enter the club house. During the week his attitude 
changed (some pedagogic pressure was brought to bear) and he 
was reinstated with solemn rites. This exile seemed rather excit- 
ing and interesting to the other club members, evidently, for one 
day at luncheon, when no grown persons were present, they con- 
ceived the diabolical plan of making every member break the vow, 
threatening that any one who refused should be hit on the head 
with a bat. This matter came to the ears of the club advisor, and 
she dropped some remarks about the disgrace of the club and 
called a special meeting for the next day to consider what should 
be done. By that time the joke had fallen away from the matter, 
and the boys most deeply implicated, of their own accord and in a 
very earnest and reasonable manner, said that they ‘‘were sorry’’ 
that they ‘“‘had forgotten themselves ;’’ that they were ‘‘all fooling 
and didn’t think what they were doing;’”’ that they were ‘‘sure
-P-A-G-E-52
Year Book 51 
Rot one of the boys would ever do it again.’”” And yet they 
thought it wise to inflict a punishment, and devised one and put 
it into operation. Since this happening, whenever the K. B.’s 
have hungered for some stirring emotional experience, they have 
voted to take the vows over again on the ground that. they are not 
living up to them. : 
Meetings were being held every Friday afternoon. A presi- 
dent, secretary, treasurer, club-keeper, assistant keeper, and club 
_ advisor were elected. Upon one boy’s pointing out that ‘‘It would 
. be good experience for a boy to be an officer, because when he 
grows up he will be in clubs, and then he will know how to act if 
he has been an officer of the K. B.’s,’’ it was decided to change 
officers (the club advisor excepted) every month. At these meet- 
ings little was done except to plan the manual work that was going 
on in the Lane. This handiwork, this having something big and in- 
teresting to do, something that needed every boy’s help, was the 
salvation of the club, the engrossing and unifying interest. The 
necessity of buying things for construction, purposes was re- 
sponsible for the levying of weekly dues of five cents. These dues 
added much to the dignity and importance of the club, and the col- 
lecting of them became the great event of the week. A few other 
important matters, however, were now and then considered—light 
ing the house with electricity, a hiding place for the key of the 
treasure box, the history of the club, letters to absent members. 
Designs for pins were presented, and one was adopted. Before 
the work on them was well started, the father of one of the boys 
presented silver pins to the club. The children were delighted, and 
I saw the home-made product going to wreck, and lent my influence 
to vescue it. It was at last tacitly agreed that no boy might wear 
the silver pin until he had made his brass one: Many of the early 
decisions of the club were arrived at by this method of informal 
understanding, but later, when the boys felt more practiced in 
parliamentary law, they always refused to follow any suggestion 
not regularly brought up in meeting and passed by vote. ‘‘Every 
boy has got to have a chance to say whether he likes it or not,’’ 
was their reason for such action. 
At noon, for several weeks, all of the club members except 
two had luncheon in the hut. There were weekly committees to 
earry over the food and dishes, to serve, and to clean the hut, and 
they did their work well and cheerfully. Either the club advisor
-P-A-G-E-53
52 Francis W. Parker ScHoou 
or some invited guest from the faculty was always present at these 
luncheon times, but one morning, after several weeks, the boys 
said rather sheepishly, ‘‘We were thinking of eating alone once.’’ 
I agreed. But that afternoon they reported that ‘It didn’t go’ 
well without some grown person. We’re too loud,’’ and they 
never wanted to repeat the experience. The pleasure they took in 
this eating in the hut, and in watching the big boys’ ball games 
between bites, is not to be understood by any comfort-loving grown 
person. Two or three. times bad weather or accidents forced them 
into the lunch room, and they came back to the hut full of pity 
for the unfortunates doomed to that limbo. ‘‘I don’t see how they 
can eat there,’’ ‘It’s so noisy,’ “‘Oh, how different it is in the 
hut,’’ were some of their remarks. 
The second chapter of the club history closes with the com- 
pletion of the new hut. The last year was not an entirely tranquil 
and perfect one. The boys were troubled by their inability to live 
up to their vows. Teachers now and then caustically remarked 
that they wished that ‘‘The K. B.’s considered that their vows, 
whatever they were, applied to recitation times.’’ Some of the 
upper classmen introduced the serpent into our Eden by dubbing 
the club a ‘‘sissy club,’’ and by inventing derisive names for our 
initials. Inside our own borders, too, rebellion lately threatened, 
because cliques had begun again to form, and because the ‘‘promi- 
nent ones were always elected for everything.’’ But the boys met 
the new conditions bravely, and many of the hard problems have 
been already solved. I believe, in fact, that these were growing 
pains, Certainly, these boys are now a friendly, united group, in- 
dustrious, socially minded, with clean honorable ideals, in spite of 
the shortcomings of their practice; and except for one boy, in- 
terest: in the club has never lagged. 
Now, what does all this amount to, this half hour’s handwork 
a day and this half hour’s meeting a week; this planning o’ days 
and dreaming 0’ nights; this expenditure of twenty-five or thirty 
dollars a year for lumber and nails? ‘Well, that very power which 
society eraves in its members is surely developed—power to grapple 
with the situation, to think originally and constructively, to take 
things as we find them and to make the best of them, Or do -you 
deny that any thinking goes into the making of a roof that will 
stand sturdily under the trampling feet of marauding neighbors, 
or to make a six-inch board fit a three-inch, space, or to stop cracks

against the rain, or to invent a secret language or to codify rules 
of behavior, or to design and to make wearable club pins. More- 
over, these things are going on under real social conditions. Peo- 
ple learn how to lead and they learn how to follow. Co-operation, 
social thinking, get worked into the blood. Time has not yet shown 
whether the Lane helps develop gangsters or civic reformers, 
but the tendency is surely toward an appreciation of the mean- 
ing of social organization. This is, of course, a normal human 
hunger, this taste for social grouping. It evinces itself among 
boys the country over in the gangs which complacent observers 
of boy-life used unreservedly to praise as contributing to the so- 
eial education of their members, but in which thoughtful people 
now see much menace to morals. The groups of Investigation 
Lane are these gangs with the menace removed by the presence of 
a supervising elder and by the insistent demands of manual work. 
Satan has a hard task ‘finding mischief for busy hands to do, be- 
cause perforce, the brain is busy at the same time. I believe, too, 
that digging and sawing while the heart sings, that seeing a be- 
loved structure grow under ‘one’s own laboring hands, tends to - 
engender, or at least to adumbrate, a spiritual realization of the 
meaning and beauty of work, to initiate one into that labor-loving 
brotherhood to which Morris and Carlyle belong. -Perhaps, how- 
ever, to see such a lovely flower of so mature a growth in these 
erude enterprises of unstable childhood is only an evidence that 
we are looking at things through the magnifying and rose-colored 
spectacles of a pedagogue. But on another point I have no doubt. 
That is the all-pervading joy that this work creates in many chil- 
dren. It is not of the light, surface type that effervesces in a 
pienic or in some gay piece of mischief or in most games, but a 
more serious, deep-rooted gladness, nurtured by successful effort— 
effort of sufficient breadth and vigorousness to eall into play a full 
share of mental and bodily power—effort self-actuated, effort that 
one feels to be a worthy self-expression, blessed by the acceptance 
and commendation of one’s comrades, It is a joy of mind as well 
as body, a stimulating enthusiasm that quickens and emotionalizes 
all activity, that puts a glory into life.

DRAMA 
  
I. The Function of Dramatic Expression in Education 
Our modern life is tending to absorption; it is a world of books 
to be read to oneself, of plays to be looked at, of pictures to be 
seen, of lectures to be listened to, of music to be heard. Most of 
us spend our days gathering in: we have no time or reason to act 
out. So our natural impulses to express die; our outlets of ex- 
pression become choked. In our schools we now recognize the 
consequent dangers to mentality, and we are teaching our children 
to paint, to draw, to model, to sew, to cook, to sing, to dance, to 
construct, in order that thinking shall be more vivid and true, 
that mind may acquire a usable stock of real thought material. 
There is, too, a somewhat more subtle danger in this continual 
inhibition of the impulse to express. We who have no powers of ex- 
pression often feel ourselves imprisoned, baffled. There comes to 
us, for instance, that one perfect spring day that lights the fires of 
eestacy within us. If we could sing, if we could dance, if we 
eould play a violin, if we could chant poetry, we should burst 
into expression, and the joy that is bubbling in our hearts would 
flood our whole beings and refresh the very roots of our natures. 
But we can only stand and gaze and.are of necessity dumb. Some- 
thing breaks and dies within us, and we turn to our work ¢m- 
bittered and a-hunger. Or perhaps the spring gladness, not to be 
denied, drives our unpracticed feet into their only dance measure, 
a clog, and our intractable voices to a shout. The ugly unfitness 
of the result shocks the joy back to its lair, and we awake disil- 
lusioned and disgusted. I have an idea that with training in 
artistic expression a good deal of the hobble-de-hoy celebration 
of New Year’s eve and Halloween could be turned into fairly 
beautiful singing and mumming and dancing. Perhaps with a 
little help our animal spirits might boil over into something of 
the type of the old Greek chorus or the Morris dancers, and we 
all should feel the better for it. The expressive man moreover, is 
the socially useful man—open to appeals, contributing of himself, 
influencing his fellows. He can even serve as interpreter and spokes- 
man for the dumb and so relieve a little the oppressiveness of 
their enforced silence. And without facile expression among us, 
54
-P-A-G-E-56
Year Book 55 
and more yet, without the quick, responsive emotion that is the 
child of expression, national art, and high national art standards 
are impossible. For the salvation of our individual souls, and of 
the social soul, we must keep emotion and expressiveness alive. 
The play is but one means of self-expression, but it seems 
‘to me one of the most satisfactory for us teachers. For one 
thing, it gives a more varied training to the individual than does 
sketching or dancing or singing; for it demands graceful and inter- 
pretative use of the body, it requires good manipulation of the 
speech organs, and it trains the ear and the mind to an apprecia- 
tion of literary beauty. Nor are these fictitious values of acting. 
Ihave heard a girl’s very slovenly and all but unintelligible mumble 
quite transformed into nice articulation when she was impersonat- 
ing a gracious queen. I remember a slouching, furtive-mannered 
lad who as Ulysses bore himself like a king and won the respect 
of his mates. I saw an eighth-grade boy make what seemed to 
me the effort of his life in trying to loosen his jaw and open his 
mouth and control his breath for the purpose of making intel- 
ligible a much loved part in a play. Of course it needs more 
swallows than that one to make his summer, but if they were 
lacking it was the fault of the teacher and not a shortcoming in 
the power of drama. Another advantage of the play is that few 
other kinds of work produce such joy in the workers, Among 
children under the supersensitive and self-conscious adolescent age 
I do not remember one who has not chanted paean during all the 
hard work of a play :—and to create happiness is, I take it, one 
right educational aim, It is a harmless gratification to a teacher, 
moreover, and one rarely granted her, to have her children produce 
something that unprejudiced outsiders can really enjoy. Their 
paintings are, after all is said and done, not things of beauty; 
their mothers could improve on their stitches; their modeling is 
almost an eyesore, but people actually do enjoy their plays. And 
besides, the product is temporary; it does not stand up brazenly, 
to shame its producers after a year’s growth. 
Drama is, too, an inherently socializing force. Every child 
recognizes that the play without the audience is bare. Acting is 
expression definitely for some one and to some one. There is, 
even, a social something in the air that, answers to the actor’s 
effort. He feels interest radiate from the house, and it is his 
thanks and reward. Moreover, the cast is essentially a team, work-
-P-A-G-E-57
56 Francis W. Parker ScHOoL 
ing together toward the right presentation of their idea. The in- 
dividuals are subordinated to the accomplishment of the group 
purpose, and more or less consciously so.’ An eighth grade girl 
said, in connection. with her part in a recent play, ‘‘I have always 
felt that the audience was watching me, and seeing all the mistakes 
I made. The practicing of the play has shown me that the audi- - 
ence is not watching me, a separate one, but is watching the whole 
as a picture. They are thinking of the play, not of me in the 
play.’’ 
A large part of morals, besides, lies in the perception of the 
fact that every human action is the result of some motive or 
other; that people differ, but that there are reasons for that dif- 
ference. Drama (no matter how rudimentary) is a presentation of 
that fact of actuating motive, is character study, is elementary 
psychology—a guide to one’s own behavior and to sympathetie 
understanding of one’s fellows, ‘‘You ought to swallow your 
anger,’’ I heard a fourth grader advise a turbulent classmate after 
the enacting. of the quarrel scene between Agamemnon and Achilles. 
The very vividness and specious reality of a play, combined with 
the apparent absence of personal preachment, emphasizes the moral 
points as few other art forms do. We feel as though we had seen 
a bit (and a well selected, well pruned bit) of real life, or as 
though we had passed through an actual experience of our own. 
Acting or seeing a play. is, indeed, a vicarious way of getting 
experience, and experience is the best teacher. Here is the final 
speech of a play, that during rehearsals sank into the hearts of a 
whole fourth grade, as many equally eloquent sermons had failed 
to do. A little orphan girl has changed into a princess, and her 
peasant foster father says: ‘‘Here is the plate from which she ate 
and the cup from which she drank! She is a princess! Tis a 
sign, wife, that we must be careful what we say and do, for who 
knows how many of the folks we meet may be royal?’ 
It is an inspiring thing to be dealing with an impulse so 
deeply rooted in human psychology as this dramatic one. I am not 
so prejudiced as to think that one play will regenerate a lost 
soul, but I do believe that the most potent agency in mental and 
moral growth is a broad development of the powers of expression, 
and that one of the most usable and effective of these forms is 
the dramatic. , 
The school stage and the professional stage are things quite
-P-A-G-E-58
Year Boox 57 
separate, I am sure. The professional aims, I hope, to give an 
artistic performance, but at any cost it must be a successful one, 
for it takes applause and money to make the dramatic mare go. 
Whereas, in school plays, the performance is the thing of all 
things least important. What we watch for there and gloat over 
when we see it, is growth in the actor—a freeing of the bound 
wings of imagination, perhaps; the tapping of a secret reservoir 
of emotion; the quickening of human sympathy; the birth of joy 
in a small cramped soul; the establishing of wholesome interests ; 
the opening of ears to beauty.of words and tones; down to the 
improvement of speech and carriage. One hardly imagines a 
professional stage manager choosing an actress for Rosalind be- 
eause that particular woman needs to be taught to be happy and 
gay. Neither does he often, we surmise, pick out a shiftless, de- 
jected failure to play Mercutio, in order that the social use of 
his one accomplishment of skilful fencing may put his self-respect 
on its feet and so invigorate his whole life. Nor would he deliber- 
ately put on a mumbler for Brutus, in order that the purity and 
dignity of the language and the joy of acting might stimulate 
him to weleome the drudgery of learning to speak properly. Doubt- 
less he does not, either, choose his play beeause it is the one best 
fitted to feed the starving souls of his cast—Julius Caesar to 
satisfy the balked political ambitions of his men, the Land of 
Heart’s Desire to give his feminine star an opportunity to express 
her vague, adolescent nostalgia for a universe different and nobler, 
and so to hearten her up a bit. But ‘these are the things we 
teachers must continually do. -Is.our Titania fat and clumsy and 
squeaky voiced? What cares the gratified teacher, if the child, 
notwithstanding, has learned to see fairies where before were only 
street cars and smoky bricks? Our aim is to educate, not to 
gain applause. It is the world our children ‘‘carry around under 
their hats’? that we are concerned with, not the impression they 
make upon the public. 
The best kind of play for children will conform to most of 
the artistic requirements of mature drama. There must be an 
interesting plot, and it must be worked out on the stage, not bé- 
hind the scenes; there must be an element of suspense, that climaxes 
and is satisfied near the end of the play; the dialogue must be of 
sufficient amplitude and grace to cover the bones of the plot; the 
persons of the play ought to be conceived of as characters and not
-P-A-G-E-59
58 Francis W. Parker ScHOOL 
as stalking horses for the events. But there are other essentials 
of a child’s play as distinguished from the mature drama. The 
characters must have no subtlety, but must be splashed on in 
black and white; the situations must be clear cut, with no possible 
equivgcation as to right and wrong; for we cannot afford to run 
the risk of our untrained auditors becoming confused. The plot 
ought to work out happily, so that we shall have a gratified sigh 
and feel that ‘‘all’s right with the world.’’ Children rebel against 
the lugubriousness and uncertainty at the end that we grown-up 
people often relish. 
The form of the play seems to me of great importance, on 
account of its relation to thinking and to effect. The form must, 
of course, vary with the ages of participants. The all but unpre- 
meditated mimicry and pantomime of the kindergarden and pri- 
mary grades is the best means of preserving the happy, unconscious 
expressiveness that is natural to little children. And even artistic 
fitness demands that babies shall play like babies, with all their 
natural abandonment to joy; with all their inconsequence and lack 
of sustained attention. We must not, by demanding over-much 
finish, stultify the expressiveness of children, whose analytical 
powers have hardly begun to develop. 
Playing house, or fire engine, or conductor; acting out of 
. fairy stories as they themselves plan, with chairs for a house, and 
a desk for a cave, is feeding digestible food to the dramatic 
impulse, strengthening it in a habit of expressing itself. A con- 
sciousness of fuller representation than they themselves are cap- 
able of would be cultivated, if little children took simple parts 
now and then in bigger children’s plays. To be a fairy to an 
eighth grade girl’s fairy queen must wholesomely raise the standard 
of finish for a first grader. Would it not be good for us, teachers 
and children, to act plays together? In the Ecore Des Rocues 
this is the usual custom. 
In the intermediate grades, children allow less erudity in 
their vehicle of expression than they permitted in the first grade. 
They have begun to glimpse character ; they love beautiful language, 
and a critical attitude toward their own creation and other 
people’s has grown up. There are added to the kindergarten play 
a more sustained plot, some differentiation of character, less hurry 
in the telling of the story, and an attempt at beauty of language. 
But the children have little sense of general form. Their scenes
-P-A-G-E-60

will flit from place to place ad.absurdum, and will be most un- 
staisfyingly short, so that the entre-actes will consume as much time 
as the play itself. I once helped a fourth grade to make a play 
of Ulysses which required ten minutes to present and had seven 
acts, strung all the way from Lotus-land to Ithaca. It seems to 
me wrong to allow such looseness of structure. It means loose 
thinking on the part of the makers of the play, insufficiently 
sustained effort in the actors, and a confusion and lack of vivid 
impression in the audience. And if a curtain is drawn between 
acts, there is a yet more disastrous effect in the nervous excite- 
ment that always seems to result among children from this magic 
act—the audience goes to pieces. One interesting method of begin- 
ning to draw away from this loose form is to have more than one 
stage. This corner of the room is the castle yard; that one is the 
interior of the church, here ig the river bank; actors move from 
the court yard to the church and back again as need is. The 
audience only turn their heads, and the play is continuous to its 
- climax. But a little farther on, why not try the plan of molding 
the play into one act, as often as we can? This seems to me a 
most desirable solution of the problem. It conduces to vividness 
and chasteness of effect and to closeness of thinking. It compels 
attention in the audience and preserves illusion. It is the very 
essence of simplicity. Why should we not adopt a literary form so 
perfect in itself and so well adapted to our conditions? Add to its 
traditional unities a few other characteristics, and we shall have a 
well fitting dramatic garment for our immaturity. Let us, for one 
thing, have a mob, when we can. It is very useful. It expands 
the cast and gives opportunity for many children to act. It is 
a cloak under which shy people may very freely express them- 
selves with the comforting delusion that they are not seen. 
We shall succeed better, too, the further removed our play is 
from mere talking dialogue, and the nearer it is to pantomime. 
Amateur acting is surer to ‘‘get over the footlights’’ if the climax 
ig dependent upon the slash of a ‘sword rather than upon heroic 
speech. It is safe from the point of view of effect, and from the 
opposite view of actors’ comfort and training, for child’s play, 
to be full of business—-real business—not artificially devised stage 
movements—setting a table, putting on a cloak, sweeping, shaking 
hands, lighting a candle, paying money, handling of real or imagi- 
nary materials. But the material and the handling must be neces-  
-P-A-G-E-61
60 Francis W. Parker ScHooL 
sary to the presenting of the plot—not something dragged in to 
supply movement. The speeches of a child’s play, too, ought to 
be short and very simple, almost conversational. So we get 
natural, interpretative rendering. A long speech, in itself unfit- 
ting because it is unchildlike, besides overburdens the young 
actor’s memory, and by throwing him into the limelight induces 
self-consciousness, , 
Another matter that we must have an eye to and another 
thing in which primary and grammar grade plays differ is plot. 
Plays for older children must be possible to human action. Imagine 
people of the eighth grade acting ‘‘Three Billy Goats Gruff!’’ But 
it perfectly fits little children. I saw the bridge made out of a 
kindergarten table, with a chair at each end for steps. Whether 
it was goats or children that crossed and outwitted the ogre, the 
pleased audience did not care. But even at the lower end of the 
grade ladder we must recognize that there are things that ought 
* not to be acted. A story dependent for meaning and climax upon 
a magic act loses credence by being played. Cinderella is much 
better heard than seen. It is a similar mistake to try to impersonate 
things not impersonable. I read of the prize instance of this 
error. In a play that occurred by the sea, several children aimed 
to represent waves by lying down upon their stomachs and oc- 
casionally thumping the floor. Many plots, moreover, are narra- 
tive and not dramatic. A really dramatic plot is in essence a 
climax, while narrative plot is development. For example, the 
point of the story of ‘‘Robert of Sicily’’ is a gradual change in 
Robert’s character.. The process of this slow change we cannot 
show in drama—merely the conditions before and after the change. 
Whereas, the alteration in Achilles’ action after the quarrel is 
dependent upon one swift, visible event—the death of Patroclus, 
We must present only those subjects that will gain by dramatic 
presentation. In our enthusiasm for the play, we must not for- 
get that the story is an effective kind of teaching and a beautiful 
art form and that oral reading, as distinguished from acting, is 
a compelling manner of expression. 
My experience has been that children act best the plays that 
they themselves have made; for the quality of the acting depends 
in great part upon the vividness of the imagery, and of course 
one knows one’s own creations better than other people’s. We 
always give best expression to an idea that springs from a back-
-P-A-G-E-62
YEar Book 61 
ground rich in experience and association, an idea that carries 
from that rich background an aura of emotion. So children that 
are studying Greeks put into the action of a Greek play some- 
thing that they cannot give to a milkmaid play, and the best 
knights for a drama are the boys who are modeling castles, reading 
King Arthur, wearing armor every day. The further advantages 
of the children’s making their own plays are obvious. It reacts 
upon the subject matter which is serving as dramatic material by 
enforcing a reviewing, analyzing, weighing, correcting of it. Chil- 
dren who have made an Achilles play know their Iliad much 
better through that act. Such composition takes a high place, too, 
in English training. The importance of the play to the children’s 
minds sets a high standard of ‘judgment, quickens imaginative 
speech, and stimulates the effort after satisfying form. ‘‘It sounds 
too funny,’’ ‘‘It sounds too common,’’ or ‘‘too modern,’’ I have 
heard children say of a suggested speech. Thereupon began more 
vigorous creation under this helpfully searching criticism. The 
whole creative and artistic faculty at such times is set a thrill; 
all forms of art activity are likely to improve. There is a new 
glamour thrown upon music and drawing; the children make songs 
for their plays, and our teachers of music find that these are among 
the best of their original times. Their verses occasionally develop 
touches of beauty. In the making of plays we run a chance, 
moreover, of uncovering some new dramatic material. In a class 
of mixed nationalities, might we not tap, perchance some native folk 
tales, or at least a folk belief of feeling, that not only might create a 
good play, but might stir a family or a neighborhood into joyful 
expression? And if we are making our play, we can make it 
fit our stage, our numbers---even the individual needs and capaci- 
ties of our actors. If we have only one entrance, we will make our 
play in accordance; if we have no window, we will not have any 
one looking out of it. The eritics tell us that the great dramatists 
have followed this course and are great because of it. 
I have been describing a very simple play—one act at its 
best; such movement, speeches, ideas, as children can evolve; a 
thing eduéatively and pleasingly crude; fitting its childish actors. 
How shall such a play be presented? Again I want to emphasize 
the fact that we are considering plays by and for children, with 
an educational purpose, not plays for the professional stage, whose 
aim is to make money. We shall find our children corrupted by
-P-A-G-E-63
62 Francois W. ParkER ScHOOL 
that extravagant, gaudy, clap-trap kind of drama; we shall have 
to stiffen our backs considerably, to stand for simplicity against 
that baleful influence. In schools where there is no assembly hall 
and no stage, these theatrical dangers are largely eliminated, but 
so are several tremendous advantages. In the Francis W. Parker 
School, we all, from kindergarten to high school, meet four days 
a week for a'‘twenty-five minute period. It is a hearth-fire meeting 
—the strongest force in binding the separate classes into a whole 
—the most socializing power in the school. Here we sing, read 
poems; tell stories; perform experiments; review class work in 
science, geography, history; and act plays for mutual entertain- 
ment and instruction. To have such an audience to play to isa 
remarkable stimulus to effort and, increases the pleasure many 
fold and strengthens the social purpose of expression. Many 
schools, I know, have such meetings more or less often. It is in 
plays given under such circumstances that temptation lurks. We 
begin to hanker after finish, Of course we must have costume— 
don’t they always have it at plays down town? Moreover, chil- 
dren love to dress up. Of course we must have artificial lights-~ 
it is more fun, and the effects are better. Scenery?—to be sure, 
all theaters do. And in a little while we are plunged into aping 
the extravagant professional stage, forgetting that we are none 
of us satisfied with the inartistic, spectacular emphasis that we 
find there, forgetting that we are teachers and not commercial 
managers, and that therefore our aims are quite different. 
The usefulness of costume is double—to convey atmosphere 
and picture to the audience, and to help the actor to cast off his 
own everyday personality and to assume that which he is pre- 
senting. Under what conditions does costume really do this; and 
when, rather, do we adopt it merely because it is easier to follow 
established convention than to combat it with reasoned belief? 
For one thing, your actor must feel at home in his clothes. A 
suit of armor struggled into at the last moment will almost cer- 
tainly make a young knight uncomfortable, physically and mentally. 
He ought to live in armor, play in it, study in it, go about his 
everyday tasks in it for weeks before a play. is thought of. In 
our fourth grade for instance, where we study the Greeks, each 
child has a Greek costume, and early in the year he learns to put ~ 
it on alone. After that, whenever he feels so disposed, he will slip 
it on for an afternoon’s session, or a play period, or a rehearsal,
-P-A-G-E-64

until it seems almost as natural to wear Greek as American clothes. 
Then there is no disagreeable consciousness of bare legs and arms 
when he appears costumed as an actor, but instead a joyful ‘free- 
dom of movement and a play of spirit. This situation can oceur 
at its best only when the drama has grown out of a full back- 
ground which has been building up slowly through a long period 
of class work. For another thing, is your mock costume suffi- 
ciently true to the intention of the real one to represent it honestly ? 
Can your peasant really work in his peasant’s blouse, or would 
it split at the seams under a slight stress? Is your knight’s 
shield sufficiently strong to ward off a wooden spear thrust? For 
it is sentiment rather than vision that you are appealing to in 
the audience, and feeling rather than actuality that you want 
to ereate for your actor. A sword that has been through the 
Spanish war, buckled around a gingham shirt and hanging beside 
every-day knickerbockers will more truly inspire a knightly spirit 
than a whole suit of cardboard armor. A hawk’s feather that 
your hero really found at the sand dunes, when thrust into a 
school eap, will easily turn anybody into a Robin Hood. The 
very spirit of adventure and the wildwood oozes from it. So it is 
suggestiveness rather than historical accuracy or completeness in 
costume that we need. I saw some first graders act Old King Cole 
with the greatest truthfulness, with nothing to suggest a regal ~ 
court except a gorgeous red cloth hanging from the king’s should- 
ers and upheld most grandiosely by two pages in twentieth century 
petticoats and Russian blouses. 
There is, I believe, a third matter which we must keep in mind 
eoncerning costume. Is it helping to preserve that simplicity of 
taste which is every child’s birthright, and which is necessary 
to the creation of right artistic standards in our public? This 
third: consideration I believe to be the most important of all. To 
see plays all the way from Mother Goose to the Merchant of 
Venice acted without any theatrical props such as custume and 
scenery is good for all of us. It pares the drama down to its 
real essentials—interest of plot, beauty of language, truthfulness 
of impersonation. It throws the actor upon the essentials of act- 
ing—beautiful speech, interpretative gesture, truthful conception 
of character. These essential things stand up bare and signally, 
and we can see them. Our imaginations, too, aré left free to 
picture more lovely drapery and more beautiful trees than any
-P-A-G-E-65
64 Francis W. ParKER ScHOoL 
eostumer and scene painter could make. And we must not forget 
to give young imaginations room to grow. Ever present and in- 
sistent material cramps them. Let us keep in mind for the stage 
the maxim that Morris would have us follow in furnishing our 
rooms—to have the fewest possible things, only the necessary 
things, and to have them chastely made and arranged, with no 
cross purposes of line and color. Let us imagine a fireplace where 
“we can, let us have one straight bench instead of three turned 
chairs. This simplicity has an artistic value of its own, and it 
better fits the erude acting of our child players. 
After all, the greatest value of the play is not in the final 
performance, but in the rehearsals. The pedagogic usefulness of 
this final performance lies in its furnshing the motive,—the 
education comes in the previous training. Here every member of 
the elass gets his opportunity to express himself. The conception 
of the play must become a class concept, must grow through in- 
dividual contributions. One reads a speech, and another objects 
to the interpretation and shows how he believes it ought to be 
given. One invents a bit of action; another takes it up and 
earries it further. There arises a discussion as to the motives and 
attributes of a character. So in every child’s mind the play is 
clarified and vivified, and the power of analysis and apprecia- 
tion is developed. And in the training again, we must remember 
that the result we most desire is not the pleasure of the beholders, 
but growth in the actor. To that end we must strictly abstain 
from showing him how to act. We must, instead, help him to 
think. ‘‘How would Achilles feel when he answered Agamem- 
non??? we ask. ‘‘Then how would he look if he was angry?’’ 
“What do you do when you are angry?’’ An actor ought to say, 
perhaps, with joy and astonishment, ‘‘She is a princess!” but he 
bungles it because he does not feel the situation. In a moment 
we could show him how to say it and ‘‘get a hand,’’ but instead 
of this primrose path,*we must follow the thorny, tortuous trail 
to his inmost thinking. ‘‘When you last saw her,’’ we say, ‘‘she 
was in rags, she was tending sheep, she was hungry, she drank 
from a broken eup. Now, how is she dressed? She is living in 
‘a great castle, she has servants to wait upon her, she eats from a 
plate of gold. Think of her as she was yesterday. Do you see her? 
Think of her as she is to-day. Now, what do you say to that?” 
And so, many times, and in many different ways, always only

loosening the soil for ideas.to grow,.never forcing the blossoms 
or twisting the branches. The best rehearsal, in fact, is one 
where the thinking is so constructive that the business and the 
dialogue change under the creative interpretation of the actors. 
It is only in the mechanics of technique that we have any right to 
give rules or examples for imitation and there we all ought to 
be trained to do it, and we ought to. do it religiously. We make 
it a matter of life and death to teach right grammatical construc- 
tion and then allow that grammatical English to be murdered by 
all manner of horrible speech-—nasal tones, swallowed syllables, 
slurred consonants, monotonous pitch; and we allow interpreta- 
tive gesture to die a painful death under smothering awkwardness 
and self conscious inhibition. I believe that voice culture is as 
much the business of a common school teacher as is grammar cul- 
ture, or arithmetic training. And I suspect that the same thing 
is true of expressive use of the body. The play furnishes at once 
the stimulus for such drill and the opportunity for exercise of the 
skill acquired. Here is the opinion of an eighth grader on this 
matter: ‘‘The other great help to me from having taken part in 
this play has been in my speaking. Lately I have noticed I do not 
have to be reminded so often to speak louder and plainer. It 
seems to have made ‘a lasting impression on my mind that. it 
would be terrible not to make everyone hear in the exercise, and 
it certainly is just as bad not to make people hear in your own 
room as in ‘an exercise.’’ 
_ Such close and conscious study as this we cannot expect, we 
do not desire, in primary plays. Little children act purely for the 
fun of acting; older ones think of the audience. In consequence, 
there is a necessary difference in the amount of preparation pos- 
sible. The play in the first grade is a thing of the moment. Who 
will be Little Red Riding Hood? Who will be the Wolf? Where 
shall the Grandmother lie? Now on with the play! There can 
be no discussion of what the Grandmother shall say. If we must 
have a word on that subject, we shall have to get it by thrusting 
a speech into the Grandmother’s mouth while the play is pro- 
ceeding. Whatever criticisms we need to give must be given con- 
structively and in bits, scattered thinly among many performances. 
Nothing must defer the joy of acting—not the learning of lines, 
nor the elaborating of dialogue, nor the perfecting of speech. 
And yet I think that even here we ought to allow no slipshod
-P-A-G-E-67

work. By sharp but stimulating criticism, applied as I have just 
suggested, we ought to insist that a whistle shall sound as much 
as possible like a locomotive whistle; that when Little Boy Blue 
wakes he shall rub his eyes and stretch and yawn like‘a real little 
boy waking up; that is, the children ought to be growing daily 
in aceuraey of observation and in truthfulness and completeness 
of expression. . 
In a grammar school, and in every grade of it, there is place 
for many kinds of dramatics. In the second grade, during a read- 
ing lesson about lumbering, two boys come up to the front, take 
hold of the ends of the saw, sway back and forth with a ‘‘Z-z-z,’’ 
“Z-2-2,’’ give a wise upward look, and step back, calling ‘‘ Timber !’’ 
and watch the great tree crash to earth. It is over in a minute, 
a mere employment of the motor and visual senses to deepen an 
impression. At morning exercise a boy from a primary class runs 
in with a crook in his hand and cries out to a little girl, who is 
busily sweeping, 
“Up, up! ye dames, ye lasses gay! 
To the meadows trip away. 
Tig you must tend the flocks this morn, 
And seare the small birds from the corn. 
Not a soul at home may stay: 
For the shepherds must go 
With lance and bow 
To hunt the wolf in the woods today. 
‘‘Leave the hearth and leave the house 
To the cricket and the mouse: 
Find Grandam out a sunny seat, 
With babe and lambkin at her feet. 
Not a soul at home may stay: 
For the shepherds must go 
With lance and bow 
To hunt the wolf in the woods today.’’ 
Then the lad is off, and the girl in pantomime places a chair 
for the hobbling grandam, tenderly puts a doll into the old woman’s 
arms and is gone. If children are studying Greek sculpture, they 
play a game of posing as this or that statue for their fellows to

guess. If fifth grade pupils are reading about Vikings, they cut 
the description from one of the most dramatic stories, so throwing 
it into dialogue, and read it orally. An eighth grade reads Julius 
Caesar and acts scenes of it in a corner of the room. An older class 
studies As You Like It and gives it out of doors in well planned 
costume, <A sixth grade girl makes a fairy play and gets together 
a group of children, who rehearse it by themselves after school, 
and play it for their classmates. A grade together work out a 
dramatic presentation of a story they have been reading and give 
it to the whole school. A group makes a May Day play and chooses 
a queen from the high school and attendants from the primary 
grades. Poets volunteer from everywhere, several grades dance 
around the May pole, and the whole school sings. Such festivals 
as this, combining several modes of expression, sweeping every- 
body into it, quickening the whole school into gaiety and co-opera- 
tion and good fellowship, seem to me the most socialized type, 
the most broadly stimulating and the most paying form of school 
dramatics. What occasions shall we choose for it—Thanksgiving, 
Christmas, Memorial Day, May Day, Arbor Day, Hallowe’en? They 
must be the occasions which at once most deeply stir the emotions 
of children and which are most worthy so to do. Such festive 
celebrations will, I believe, do much to further social solidarity, as 
well as artistic expressiveness and well being. When municipalities 
are awaking to the socializing power of the festival, it behooves 
the schools to lend a hand. . 
Il. The Setting and Costuming of a Play 
The eighth grade children chose to give the Nativity Play at 
Christmas time. From their study of the text they formed pic- 
tures in their minds of the arrangement, action, and background, 
aceording to their understanding and appreciation. They were in- 
terested when they found-out that the subject of the Nativity 
was so generally used by artists, especially in mediaeval times, 
and they eagerly studied many reproductions of the paintings— 
studied the costumes, background, composition, and detail. They 
were interested in the different ways in which the artists ex- 
pressed the same story, and in the symbolism used in many of the 
pictures. As a general thing, they liked the realistic ones; such 
as Corregio, Hoffmann, Bouguereau, and Lerolle. Very few liked 
Burne-Jones and Del Gardo at first, but later the class found them
-P-A-G-E-69
68 Franois W. Parker ScHoou 
most helpful and suggestive. These children very generally un- 
derstood and appreciated the best expression of this story, be- 
cause, with the motive of presenting the play, they analyzed the 
many expressions of the same ideal and made the effort to choose, 
adapt, and re-create, and thus to find adequate expression for 
themselves. This is what some of the children said about the 
pictures: 
“When Mr. Merrill read the Christmas play to us, we thought of 
it at once as a beautiful picture, In planning the play we studied the 
pictures of the mediaeval artists. The pictures of the mediaeval ar- 
tists were religious pictures, and many of them were of the Nativity. 
It was part of the people’s religion in those times to make beautiful 
paintings. The very earliest ones did not show much skill, but they 
were more beautiful because they were so sincere. Later they improved 
in technique but lost in sincerity. In this picture of Fra Lippo Lippi’s, 
there are peacocks on the roof, because they are symbols of immor- 
tality.” 
“I have the picture called, ‘The Holy Night,’ by Correggio. The 
picture is very sweet and beautiful, and yet so simple. We must keep 
these simple ideas in mind in the planning of our stage. I like the 
way Christ’s gifts are laid before him. I think the shepherds ought to 
have some kind of a rod in their hands—something like the shepherds 
in the picture.” 
“Madonna with the Angelic Choir, by Del Garbo. 
I think that the Madonna, baby and angels are very graceful and 
sad looking. . 
“The Nativity, by Doré. 
I like the expression on the faces, 
“The Nativity, by Hoffmann. 
I like the sweet and holy appearance of the Madonna and angels, 
“Brown’s Worship of the Magi. 
The costumes of all the figures are very good. The positions are 
equally as good. The manger is very suggestive.” . 
Sketches were made by the children of suitable costumes for 
each character, and eolor schemes, in water colors, were worked out, 
showing the grouping and proportion of the colors. By experi- 
menting, the children found out that the proportion of color affects 
the beauty and harmony of the picture, and must be carefully 
considered. In most of the costumes, at least two colors were 
used. Should an equal amount of gold and of purple be used for 
the first king? Or, in case of one of the Marys, should tan or 
brownish-green predominate? These questions had to be con- 
sidered in relation to the other costumes on the stage at the same

time and to the background and lighting. The making of these 
color schemes proved a difficult task, but the results were interest- 
ing, and many were beautiful and practicable. This work cer- 
tainly represented much thought and concentration, and developed 
taste and discrimination as well. It also showed a growth toward. 
the suggestive rather than the realistic standard, which we believe 
is educative and broadening,—for realism is expensive and in- 
effective and leaves no opportunity for the development of the 
imagination. We had much discussion, many good drawings and 
color schemes, and, finally, with the best suggestions and the help 
of the teacher, a color scheme and sketches were decided upon for 
each character. This is what one of the children said about plan- 
ning the costumes: 
“In planning our costumes we had to think a good deal about the 
material and color of each one. We wanted every color to be beautiful 
and all colors to harmonize. We tried to have the colors symbolic of the 
temperament and station in life of the character impersonated. There- 
fore we had a costume of royal blue and white for Mary. Royal 
blue and white are symbolic of purity, innocence and faith. We dressed 
Joseph in, gray, because that color is symbolic of meekness. The shep- 
herds wore skins, because the story tells us they were simple people. 
Purple and gold are symbolic of royalty, so we use these colors for the 
Kings. We had poplin and chiffon for Mary’s costume, because these 
materials fall in soft folds.” ‘ 
The Nativity Play opened with the two women talking by 
the roadside. A simple gray-green curtain was used to suggest 
the landseape, and the costumes were in tan and brownish-greens. 
Then there entered from opposite directions, the three kings, in 
purple and subdued reds, with gold and rich trimmings; and the 
three shepherds dressed in homespun and skins. They met at 
the stable door, which was represented, or suggested, by the gray- 
green curtain. When the door was opened by Joseph, it revealed 
a rough manger and Mary seated beside it. The soft blue and 
gray of this simple group gave the unifying note of color to this 
picture. The three kings on one side, and the three shepherds on 
the other, made a beautiful picture, and when Joseph and Mary 
were added to the group, it was a harmonious and complete compo- 
sition. 
It is our purpose, in this study with the children, to develop 
in them an appreciation of the beauty of simplicity. We expect 
the setting to stimulate and develop the artistic sense and the im-
-P-A-G-E-74

agination of the children, both the actors and-the audience. In ~ 
the first place, the children presenting a play should have a definite 
picture in mind, including the dramatic situation, background, and 
costume. The background should be simple—a curtain is best 
when possible, because it allows the actors and audience a chance 
to give the emphasis to the acting without distractions. Too often 
lines and colors in the background divide the groups and spaces 
on the stage and break up instead of unifying the picture and 
action. : : 
Some plays demand a more realistic setting—doors to open 
and windows to. look out of. But these should be arranged to 
meet the demands as simply as possible. Naturally, children pre- 
fer a realistic setting. How shall we help them to improve and 
broaden their taste? We should plan to use suitable curtains and 
screens often, for we have found that if the colors are. suggestive, 
subdued, and beautiful, and the children are led to compare the 
simple setting with the more realistic, and to judge of the effective- 
ness, before long they express a preference for the simple setting. 
But they must get used to it and form the habit of using their im- 
agination before we can expect this result. 
If the play is historical in nature, and if its purpose de- 
mands true historic representation, the children should learn about 
the costumes of a period, but it is not necessary nor always ad- 
visable to set and costume such a play with historical accuracy. 
When the idea is great or universal enough, the undivided atten- 
tion can be given to making the setting artistic, and the question 
is one of composition in line and color—always keeping in mind 
that the important use of the setting is to help express the idea. 
In brief, these are the important things to work for: 
I. ‘Elimination of everything unnecessary to the expression of the 
idea, 
. It Beautiful color scheme—sympathetic, suitable, harmonious, prac- 
tical.’ 
Ill. Simple, quiet background—a curtain or screens if possible, of 
a subdued color—greenish, to suggest a forest or exterior; bluish, to 
suggest night; gray or brown, to suggest an interior. Or, if a more real- 
istic setting is necessary, the background should be very subdued. 
IV. Suggestive rather than realistic costume when possible. This 
depends uvon the choice of the play.

III. Faculty Discussions of School Plays 
From the beginning the Francis W. Parker School has been 
committed to the policy of developing expressiveness in its pupils 
by training them in various arts. The particular value of each 
mode of expression, especially of the drama, has been, however, a 
moot point. There were many individual and group discussions on 
the subject, but as a faculty we had, up to two years ago, come 
to no definite conclusions upon it. At that time four people 
formed themselves into a voluntary committee to study the drama 
as a factor in education. This committee succeeded in arousing, 
upon the part of every member of the faculty, a vigorous interest 
in school dramatics. Questions of suitable subject-matter, manner 
of presentation, stage setting and costuming, and the relative 
values of home made and ready made plays were discussed, as well 
as the deeper question of the effect of plays upon actors and au- 
dience. 
At one faculty meeting every one was asked to state what he 
considered to be the values and dangers of the play. The follow- 
ing lists were jotted down as the suggestions were offered : 
Values of the Play 14. Acquisition of information. 
1, Development of social con- 15. Broadening of literary ac- 
sciousness, quaintance,

Before the next meeting, these lists were put into the hands of 
the faculty, with the question, “What kind of play and what kind 
of presentation will tend to preserve these values and to avoid
-P-A-G-E-76
Yuar Boox : - 5 
these dangers?’’ By the end of this meeting, we had reached a 
pretty good common understanding of our beliefs as a faeulty and 
our attitude toward the question of school dramatics. As the ap- 
proaching summer vacation prevented any further discussion at 
that time, a new committee was appointed for the following year, 
to formulate a statement of our dramatic creed, both for the sake 
of defining our thoughts on the subject and for the purpose of 
establishing a standard for school dramatizations to which we 
could all subscribe and with which we could all try to make our 
productions accord. : 
During the following year the committee, after many meet- 
ings and much discussion, submitted a list of requisites for a 
school play. It follows: 
Requisites for a School Play 
1. That it shall be calculated to inspire, instruct, entertain or 
amuse both actors and audience, and to develop them in the ways in- 
dicated above. 
2. That it shall be suited in idea and presentation to the age and 
character of those presenting it, to the size and nature of the audience, 
and to the place in which it is to be given. 
3. That it shall have a central idea, and this idea not only one 
worthy of dramatic expression, but also one which gains a greater force 
from dramatic presentation than it could obtain from any other sort of 
presentation, from being presented through any other medium, 
4, That the character of the play, together with the occasion of pre- 
sentation, shall determine the elaboration of staging and the audience 
to be invited. 
5. That properties, costumes and scenery shall be excluded except 
where they are necessary to convey adequately the idea of the play. 
6. That whatever the idea, it must always be presented as clearly 
and as beautifully as the ability of the actors and circumstances of pre- 
sentation will permit. 
This list proved inadequate to express the belief of the faculty 
in dramatic matters, and the teachers suggested many additions 
and alterations.. All this material was again worked over by the 
committee, and a final compilation was adopted by the faculty as 
a fairly satisfactory statement of the school’s ‘‘Dramatic Creed.’’ 
At least, it is the best form that we have yet achieved. 
The Purposes of School Plays and Dramatizations 
1. To afford to the dramatic instinct, through the use of an organ: 
ized and artistic form, an opportunity for expression directed toward the
-P-A-G-E-77
76 Francis W. Parker Scnoou 
fullest development of the social self. An organized form is one that 
shows the relation of cause and effect and brings out the relative im- 
portance of conditions, events or characters. An artistic form is one 
that is beautiful in conception and presentation, and is adapted ‘to its 
purpose, 
2. To give to children, through the focussed perspective of good 
plays, a broader conception of the working out of ethical forces than their 
own limited experiences could afford them. This broadening comes from 
really living in the experiences of the play, and the result is a permanent 
strengthening, ennobling or enriching of the character. 
3. To train and develop in imagination, in breadth of sympathy 
and understanding of human nature; in subordination of self to the 
whole; in depth and command of emotion; in ability to express an idea 
by means of speech and action, which implies fine enunciation and pro- 
nunciation, beautiful use of the voice, and good bodily control; above 
all, in concentration, without which those things are impossible. This 
training can be acquired through various forms of expression, but most 
vividly through dramatic art, because it uses simultaneously more senses 
than does any other fornr of.art. 
It will be understood that these values accrue not only to the aetors, 
put in a lesser degree to’ the “assisting audience.” 
4. To give opportunity to shy and reserved children” to express 
themselves, under the cover of a different personality, more freely than 
they could do in their own personality. To discover and wisely to de- 
velop individuals possessed of unusual native ability in the creation 
or interpretation of drama, so that such gifted individuals may early 
realize the possession and learn the true use of the power that should 
in time enable them to make a real contribution to our national dramatic 
art. 
5. To establish: (a) An ideal of what dramatic presentations should 
be in content, literary form, and staging; and (b) a sound basis for 
judging dramatic performances. The creating of such standards in the 
minds of our young people will be a safeguard to the individuals in the 
present and to the tendency of American drama in the future,

Carlyle, with his doctrines of the necessity and the honor.and 
the beauty of work; Morris and the Arts and Crafts people, with 
their modern demonstration of the need and the possibility of 
beauty in the every-day, serviceable things, of life; Tolstoi, with 
his demand that we must take no account of beauty which can- 
not be felt by the most ignorant man; and the Socialists, teaching 
on the one hand that every man ought to have the stimulation and 
the opportunity for expression in forms of beauty, and on the 
other that the services of the artist should be socialized, like the 
other work and play of the world,—are all preaching es- 
sentially from the same old text: ‘‘Thou shalt love thy neighbor 
ag thyself.’’ In the terms of the present day social consciousness, 
the text means that, if you want beautiful things for yourself, you 
must do your share toward bringing them to some one else who 
wants them, or, perhaps, only needs them; that, if you have the 
power to bring beautiful things into the world, you must see that 
they are of a kind to be loved by more than a few artists like your- 
self. 
The Florentine painters and the mediaeval eathedral-builders 
have shown us that democratic art—art understood and loved by 
the whole people, belonging to the whole people—is no more de- 
pendent upon the inspiration of. the great genius than it is upon 
the socially-stimulated imagination of common men, who, working 
to the best of their ability to embody their dreams in forms of 
beauty, gain thereby the power really to appreciate the gift of the 
uncommon man. And I believe that the American music which 
shall one day be evolved from the unification of the two sources 
of beauty—the extraordinary power to express and the ordinary 
power to appreciate—-is to be one of the nation’s great spiritual 
assets. Can music in the school be made to contribute in any de- 
gree to this new type of socialized art? 
Our school sets out deliberately to be a democracy, in which 
each individual may reach his best development in fulfilling his 
responsibility to the school community. It proposes to provide, 
a7 .
-P-A-G-E-79
78 . Francis W. Parker SCHOOL. 
by its very organization, constant opportunity for the social in- 
eentive in every activity of the curriculum, so that there may be 
movement towards wider. fields of experience than the merely in- 
dividualistic motive ean find out. Such an organization provides 
a basis for genuine expression in beautiful forms. The teachers 
of drama, art, music, modeling, and printing are enabled to direct 
their efforts so that the subjects are kept from being merely ends 
in themselves. They. serve some definite purpose which adds to 
the intrinsic joy of the result a sense of pleasure in the participa- 
tion of others. They are made an organic part of the school life. 
It is this recognition by the school of music as a social func- 
tion which determines the best elements of our music study. 
There is a steady, quiet joy to be seen frequently in a group 
of children who are living under the influence of a grade teacher 
wise enough to know what responsibility means in the terms of 
child-character. If she have the ability to plan work in a way 
that tends toward right character-forming, and can conduct each 
child safely through the moral crises in which he constructs his 
social standards for himself, the result is a kind of freedom, and 
at the same time an orderly joyousness which make favorable eon- 
ditions for expression in forms of beauty. 
An emphatic demand for music in the year’s important school 
events is one of the traditions of the school. A feeling of re- 
sponsibility is established in the children, making them - flexible, 
sensitive, and full of the spirit of good work; it gives them the 
“‘team’’ idea on a large scale. The fecling of doing something 
toward a large community end stirs them deeply at times, and 
brings about in the chorus-singing emotional experiences impos- 
sible in small groups working for slighter ends. Jt stimulates 
the power of personal control through long, trying rehearsals— 
both the unmusical and the musical children needing patience for 
different reasons. In the high school, it affords the unmusical and 
those who are over-eager about credits, the One adequate reason 
for keeping a non-optional, non-credit course in a crowded eurric- 
ulum. It gives both types their interest in doing the best. work 
possible to them, since they have the satisfaction of being useful, 
if only in slight measure, in an enterprise of considerable moment 
to the school; indeed, it forms the teachers’ best basis of rela- 
tionship with such children. A child can hardly have a more use- 
ful experience than that of throwing himself body and soul, at
-P-A-G-E-80
Yzar Book 19 
some personal cost of strength and patience, into an undertaking 
in which the spiritual ideals of the community are expressed, and 
his individual skill brought to its highest point—the whole in-. 
spired with a common feeling of value, and a common joy in the 
result. This happens perhaps five or six times during the year 
in our chorus singing, and it is by far the most useful contribu- 
tion of music-study to the school. 
The motive constantly held before the various classes in the 
regular lessons is a social one. The steady -concentration of the 
children through weeks of practice upon details of chorus sing- 
ing, during the times when other interests press hard upon them, 
shows a deeper, more effectual motive than that of-vanity in the 
suecess of a school exhibition. (It may be remarked here that 
applause for the children’s singing, excepting at school ‘‘recitals,’’ 
ig never permitted.) Motives other than the social one no doubt . 
enter in, but shallow motives do not produce the unmistakable 
quality of genuine expressiveness. The ideas suggested to the 
~ classes are such as these: 
' The chorus needs high, clear tones; the sopranos must work 
on that point. It needs good chest-tones; the seventh and eighth 
grade boys must provide a pleasing alto part that can be relied 
upon. The tenors, weak as they are, must rise to the needs of 
the chorus, as far as possible. The basses must work for a quality 
and an expressiveness which will fit them for singing with the 
flexible sopranos. The fifth and sixth grade boys must learn to 
use their voices better, so that they shall not spoil the soprano 
quality. The chorus needs each one’s very best, and even the 
little children learn to make an almost perfect attack in helping 
to sing a few simple songs and hymns in morning exercises. 
Besides these contributions to the ensemble singing, various 
groups are arranged to work upon the kind of songs especially 
adapted to them. The boys from the fifth through the twelfth 
grades learn a four-part chorus for Lincoln’s birthday; the girls 
sing most of the May Day music; the little children sing to each 
other, and occasionally to the older ones; each’ class prepares a 
song for the school recitals about twice a year; volunteer quar- 
tettes work outside of school hours and are especially useful in 
the luncheon-room singing. 
The feeling for music as a necessary and valuable part of 
life in the school community must be cultivated before the chil-
-P-A-G-E-81
80 Francis W. Parker Scnoou 
dren can have the best disposition towards the careful, steady 
drill necessary for progress on a basis of personal freedom and in- 
itiative. 
In the minds of the children when. they first come to us, music 
generally has the adventitious character of an entertaining ac- 
eomplishment. They must find out the serious possibilities of 
musical experience through pleasure in singing and hearing much 
good music, It is a simpler matter to build up the new mass of 
experience for them when the community is put upon a basis which 
at Christmas ‘time calls for a spiritual service rather than an 
entertainment, and when commencement is made one of the most 
serious days in the whole school year. 
But serious music is not like a new language which has to be 
learned, for of course children love all musie which possesses any 
vital qualities whatsoever. It is as easy for them to enjoy Reinecke, 
Taubert, and Schumann, or fine, dignified anthems and choruses, 
as the latest popular dance music, and it is by providing the 
community spirit with a medium of expression which proves its 
own genuineness through the years, that an understanding and a 
feeling for great music is gradually brought about. 
With the youngest, as well as the oldest children, emphasis is 
placed upon the social possibilities of the music work. In the 
kindergarten, where the children react in a direct and complete 
way to the suggestion of giving pleasure to others, no further mo- 
“tive is necessary for the purposes of the teacher; but the joy of 
contributing to the important matter of morning exercises is an 
added incentive to exactness of attack and steadiness of attention 
in following a leader. All of the primary grades feel the im- 
portance of helping the older children in morning exercises when- 
ever that is possible; but their real center of interest lies in ‘‘re- 
hearsal’’—twenty minutes long—in which each grade assists in 
the little unison choruses, or presents songs prepared in the separ- 
ate classes. Rehearsals have grown to be a factor in the develop- 
ment of the feeling that singing can have a wider usefulness than 
the music-room affords. Working simply for good singing ‘as 
such does not produce as good results, The children learn to know 
and care definitely about distinctness of utterance, beauty of tone, 
and other details of good song singing when these are put before 
them as means of making the song more beautiful for presenting 
to others.

We want the fifth and sixth grades to enter the wider life of 
‘ the upper school in every profitable way. They attend all morn- 
ing exereises and the weekly rehearsals, learn all the hymns and 
songs for those occasions, and assist as sopranos in the ‘‘big’’ 
choruses. This is a serious and important business to them, and 
is especially useful for the boys. They must learn, to sing as ac- 
eurately and follow a leader as well as the high school does. They 
Must sometimes learn hymns and choruses far beyond the range of 
their present experiences, and it has a sobering and steadying in- 
fluence upon them—a direct effect of codperation with the older 
children in their maturer enterprises. Sometimes the music is 
beyond them from the vocal point of view, but the spiritual gain 
most certainly offsets that’ disadvantage. . 
The children from the seventh to the twelfth grades attain a 
serious interest in their part of the singing in the school. Many 
boys, whose weak, unstable tone-production and narrow range 
make it difficult for them to sing, and whose instinct is against 
emotional expression, find, nevertheless, much work that satisfies 
them in the alto or tenor parts of the hymns and four-part 
choruses; and from that they often gain a foothold for advance in 
voice training and the other necessary technical and theoretical 
work of the group. 
The girls’ study proceeds, on the whole, with the naturalness 
‘which comes of their sweet voices, their normal instinct to express 
emotion in singing, and their conscientiousness. The feeling of 
their importance to the school singing is strong, and all the drill 
and study incidental to the preparation of ‘‘recital,’’ music for 
morning exercises or special celebrations, is undertaken with mo- 
tives adequate to produce musical results, even when a large pro- 
portion of the girls are more or less unmusical. They feel more 
strongly about good: singing than the boys do; they are notably 
more amenable to the suggestion of social opportunities; and their 
pleasure in their own accomplishment, while in many cases it has 
a personal phase, is enlarged by the fact that the singing of their 
-group is of prime importance to the suecess of the school. 
The texts of songs are extremely important in the develop- 
ment of singing as a social function. In the primary grades, the 
children sing about sheep, or reindeer sledges, or garden flowers, 
at the appropriate moment. In the case of the older children, the 
choice of song-texts depends, for the greater part, upon their
-P-A-G-E-83
82 Francis W. ParKER ScHooL 
wider, more highly generalized intellectual and emotional in- 
terests, Choruses, hymns, and secular songs which express our 
common consciousness of interdependence, are rather rare. Some of 
the noblest hymns are regarded by the children with distaste; 
those which teach dogma definitely and unavoidably must be 
omitted, with a few notable exceptions. Most of the present-day 
attempts to express ethical or religious sentiment in a very modern 
way, fail to reach down into the depths of our common convie- 
tions on the eternal questions of right and wrong, life and death. 
Either music or text, or both, fall short of our common needs. 
We are sometimes obliged to overlook deficiencies in literary 
beauty in a text, but the music must appeal to the children in a 
vital way. Correlation of the music of a program with the sub- 
ject is illustrated in the following commencement exercise, the 
topie of which was ‘‘Citizenship.’’

Another phase of correlation is represented by such an in- 
stance as that of the Jacobite period in eighth grade history. The 
Jacobite ballads prove a treasure for the whole upper school. They 
led in one case to the singing of other Scotch ballads and interest 
in the pentatonic scale. Also four ‘‘Scotch’’ songs were written 
by the children, two of them in the pentatonic scale,—at their 
own suggestion. 
A tenth grade boys’ class once took up a short study of relig- 
ious music of the Reformation period. They went to a Catholic 
church, where the music was the best to be heard in the city. A 
breviary was borrowed, and the rules for singing Gregorian trans- 
Jated from the Latin, and a morning exercise given in which the 
music of the undivided Church and that evolved by the Protestants 
were contrasted to the best of the boys’ ability. They sang the 
following program, with help from other groups on the chorale, 
which was sung in the original rhythm as given by Grove. 
Historical Program of Church Music 
Note—In the sixteenth century, a great change took place in re- 
ligious music. The program to be given this morning is for the pur- 
pose of showing some ‘of the changes in church music brought about 
by the Reformation. 
The first group of songs illustrates the music of the undivided 
church. Luther's great hymn, “Hin’feste Burg,” shows the new type 
of hymn which the people sang in the Protestant churches,

There are many times when we want the children to com- 
pose tunes. We believe that they need to have the experience 
of feeling out the relation between a beautiful text and appropri- 
ate musical setting; but it has always required the special emo- 
tional quality which comes in a situation having social outcome 
to make the ordinary group of children, musical and unmusical, 
devise anything but the tritest little imitations. Some of the 
musical children who can compose’ more tunes that they or the 
teacher can take the time to write down, gain confidence in their 
own gifts for the first time after receiving the respectful atten- 
tion of a group of their peers. 
The best melodies produced in the school, whether by indi- 
viduals or the usual groups of from two to ten, have been composed 
under some condition or set of circumstances in which the al- 
truistic attitude was plainly in evidence. This was true of a very 
good ‘‘sentence’’ (a simple form like the response to prayer used 
in Protestant churches) composed by seventh and eighth grade 
boys for a memorial service for a schoolmate. The text had very 
special associations in the boys’ minds. In another instance a 
spirited class 'song was written by the Senior Class of girls for 
their party; some charming songs for the little children by high 
school girls; a remarkable melody, intended for a school song, 
by a ninth grade boy; and another for basses by two ninth grade 
boys; and a series of very attractive ones for a morning exercise 
by groups between the fourth and twelfth grades. 
The dramatic work often requires the help of the music de- 
partment. A Christmas play needed the services of a special 
quartette of musical high school pupils; ‘‘As You Like It’’ was 
provided with two songs; in the play of ‘‘Hansel and Gretel’? in 
German, two musical children sang the folk songs as arranged in 
the open score of ‘‘Hansel and Gretel;’’ the French classes often 
need help for their little dramatic games and songs. . 
Plays develop intense interest, which goes over into creative 
music-thinking; in fact, the best two melodies composed in’ the 
school thus far, ‘‘Hellas,’’ and ‘‘Twirl and Turn,’’* have been 
the direct outcome of plays in which there was great freedom of 
initiative and highly stimulated imagination. 
If our country ever develops a national mode of expression

in music, it will be largely because music teachers learn the value 
of socializing musie for children, of surrounding them with oppor- 
tunities for feeling the inspiration of giving pleasure, as well as 
getting it, suggesting continually the community point of view. 
The methods by which they arrive at this will be as numerous as 
the schools themselves,—and first of all, the schools will need to be 
socialized; but the love of beautiful music, together with the free 
development of the creative instinct in all the children, will be 
the corner stone of the new art. 
II. Original Composition 
The social motive, under the best conditions that we can pro- 
vide, is scarcely discernible in the first two grades, but in the 
third grade and upward it becomes a conscious factor. It is felt 
very strongly, especially when a whole grade is working as a group 
on the composition of an original melody. 
It is conceded in other lines of work that the development 
of initiative for the furthering of the social motive is essential, 
and that the child who is taught to think independently is far 
more valuable to the community than the one who merely acts 
upon the suggestions of others. This is equally true in music, 
Melody writing is just as essential for the development of 
initiative in the musical life of the child as active work in all 
other lines. He is compelled to draw from his own knowledge of 
succession of intervals, of form and of rhythm, that which will make 
a musical whole. He realizes now for the first time that what he 
has been accumulating all these years is his to use. I am going 
to give a brief resumé of the original work of the primary grades, 
as here one can follow the growth of the child’s initiative. Melody 
writing is not essential from a composition standpoint, in the 
primary grades, as at that age the child’s ability for unique, origi- 
nal expression cannot be great except with the musically gifted. 
But freedom is felt, and ability will grow with the frequency of 
creating. 
One cannot say enough on the importance, harmonically, of 
original work. Each child hears, even though unconsciously, the 
musical setting for his own melody, and in playing the accompany- 
ing chords the teacher is told very frankly whether her interpreta- 
tion coincides, or not, with his conception. The children’s activity 
and interest are not confined to the class room. The majority of
-P-A-G-E-88
Year Boox 87 
pupils use their new power at home, composing melodies, many of 
which are brought to the school for the teacher’s inspection. It 
ig as natural for the child to create music as it is to sing, and 
we believe that, if encouraged, it would not only open up another. 
joyous field for the child, but it would solve many problems for 
the teacher in stimulating interest, and permanently establishing 
the different music values in the child’s mind. 
Melody writing is as absorbing to the boys as to the girls. 
They enjoy the feeling that here is an expression of their own. 
It stimulates their interest in song singing, and to the efforts of 
others from now on is attached greater significance. Each song 
is an original conception, like their own. 
Unmusical children, in primary grades, are apt to bring out 
the most original and musical melodies, They are not hampered 
by form, and can take liberties in the way of jumps in the scale, 
which the children who have a deep seated feeling for form would 
not dare indulge in. Form is not to be depreciated, however, as 
these same unmusical children who have not imbibed some of it 
by the time they reach the upper grades, bring forth work which is 
chaotic and worse than useless. 
We do not believe in beginning melody writing in the kinder- 
garten. They have not accumulated enough material of the type 
they: can understand and utilize. They are also too conscious as 
yet and unused to the school room, to express their own ideas with- 
out shyness. So the work is begun with the first grade. 
Here no shyness exists. A short line or sentence with a defi- 
nite rhythm is given them, and before the words are fairly ut- 
tered, the children respond. Their minds seem to work automati- 
cally; they are not hampered with the desire for originality, they. 
merely want to make a tune, for which they draw from the simple 
kindergarten melodies and from all the knowledge unconsciously 
accumulated. There are many noticeable points in the work with 
this grade,—perfect unconsciousness and spontaneity, no apparent 
expenditure of thought, and the perfection of melodies in both 
rhythm and form. As a rule the unmusical children recognize 
their own melodies more quickly than do the musical ones. This 
is quite natural, as the effort is greater and the impression con- 
sequently more lasting, whereas with the musical ones, numbers 
of different settings flit through their minds in rapid succession, 
all of them pleasing and none of them (with a few exceptions)
-P-A-G-E-89
88 Francis W. Parker ScHoou 
lasting. Each melody given, however, is perfect and shows a 
thorough grasp of the material assimilated. 
In the second grade work the results are not so satisfactory. 
This is easily accounted for by the fact that the children are be- 
coming conscious of more complicated intervals and rhythms. Their 
note songs contain longer phrases, and the ideas are more com- 
plex. Consequently their own work has lost in confidence. It is 
in the transitional stage,—the endings are not always sure, the 
phrases are less perfect. However, the pupils are beginning to deal 
with more intervals, and though in a confused state, their work 
shows a broadening of musical experience. 
In the third grade work the musical balance is regained, and 
they are able to use confidently the new ideas they have assimi- 
lated. The text is lengthened, a whole stanza is now given, and 
as a rule the balance of ideas is from a musical standpoint, per- 
fectly expressed. Thought is truly expended in trying to obtain 
the most appropriate setting for the given text. Any musical 
idea which ig not rhythmieally perfect, or does not end on the 
tonic, is instantly recognized and rejected by the children. Each 
child now concentrates on one idea and. begins to mold it even. 
in his mind again and again till it is truly satisfactory to him- 
self. Of course, this fixes his idea permanently so that he now 
recognizes his own melody whenever it is played. 
Tho children of the fourth grade are the best thinkers. They 
enjoy grappling with problems. For instance, nothing else de- 
lights them so much as the composition of two-part exercises. Here 
is a problem to solve—-the thinking out of two independent voices 
which, when sung together, will sound smooth and pleasant to the 
.ear. Their critical faculties are highly developed; their constantly 
broadening experience with newer, unique harmonic progressions is 
thoroughly understood and put into use. 
In the preparation of a Greek play, two fifth-grade boys one 
year evolved a chant for the setting of a long original poem on 
the deeds of Odysseus. They started by repeating the poem clear. 
ly, marking the rise and fall of their voices and the importance of 
certain words. They went to work at it’as they imagined the primi- 
tive Greeks to have done. As they recited the poem they drew on 
the board a eurving line showing by the relative height of the eurves 
the rise and fall of their. voices, and the relative importance of 
certain words. In this manner each line of the verse was analyzed
-P-A-G-E-90
Yrar Book ' 89 
and developed from the inflection of the voice, into a definite 
melody. The result is not what could, by any possibility, be 
termed beautiful, but is interesting, has form and a good melodie 
basis, and has been a profitable experience for the boys, as well as 
the teacher. 
A reaily remarkable little melody was conceived by a fourth 
grade through great interest in a fairy play which they gave, and 
the song, which is a pixie spinning song, shows an unusual amount 
of originality of conception. Three fairies assemble at night, and 
in secret, in the humble home where dwells the little girl Rosa- 
dew, noted for her gentle disposition and unselfish: deeds. Here 
they spin a garment of wondrous hue for the little girl, and sing . 
a song in praise of her true loveliness, as they spin. The play had 
a great influence on the fourth grade, and every child in the class 
was eager to have a share in the making of a melody for the words 
of the fairy song. In all they spent one and one-half periods on 
it, every member of the class working at great tension. They said 
the poem again and again, they thought it, felt it, acted it. A 
spinning wheel was brought up to the music room and put in mo- 
tion to help in the feeling and rhythm. They were unanimous in 
wanting the song to give the impression of a spinning wheel in 
action. Hence the first two measures,—‘‘Twirl and. Turn,’’ and 
the repetition. After much subdued humming one child thought 
out this musical idea which was instantly seized wpon by the rest 
of the class with great enthusiasm. It was fairy-like and, so said 
the children, very characteristic of a spinning wheel. 
‘Now that the start was made, suggestions for the following 
lines came flooding in. One phrase after another was written on 
the board, criticized, rejected, till the class found the one which 
suited the words and the music of the preceding line. This process 
was gone over with every line, each child contributing his musical 
setting and good-naturedly and impartially rejecting it for the 
one he considered better than his own in expressing the right idea. 
The repetitions used in the song were not done unconsciously, 
nor for lack of new ideas. They were conscientiously thought out, 
and used because, according to the children, certain ideas needed 
repetition. Especially in the last two lines is this true. Many 
melodies were given and put on the board for criticism, but none 
of them satisfied the children until finally one child, with radiant 
face, suggested the spinning motif, and the children immediately

adopted the idea and sank back satisfied in the knowledge that the 
song now sounded complete, as they themselves expressed it. Thus, 
a perfect form was established through their own initiative, and 
one of the loveliest of their efforts was brought to a. close. 
At another time these fourth grade children were much inter- 
ested in a play of Achilles which they had made. One act opened 
with Achilles and Patroclus sitting in their hut, to whom entered 
an embassy from Agamemnon with the purpose of inducing Achilles 
to return to the army. It was necessary for the two friends to be 
engaged in some activity that should show them unhappily idling 
away their time while their comrades were at war. Many possibil- 
ities were suggested—cleaning armor, playing a game, telling a 
story, singing and playing the lyre. In a press of other business 
the matter was temporarily dropped, until a little girl came one 
morning with the following verses which she had made at home 
quite alone: 
Oh, I’m thinking of Hellas, 
Of faraway Hellas; 
Where the green fields are lying, © 
Where the sunlight is dying 
On the far-stretching hills of my Hellas. 
Oh, I’m thinking of Hellas, 
Of far-away Hellas; © 
Where the cattle are lowing, 
Where the waters are flowing, 
O’er the wide, sun-lit fields of my Hellas, 
My far-away Hellas, 
When these lines were read to the class they were received 
with breathless approbation. It hardly seemed possible to the 
children that one of themselves could have made anything so 
lovely. ‘‘The poem was perfect. That was just the way Achilles 
would feel. It had such a lonesome feeling. But it must have a 
tune.’’ And so a few from the class, not only the most musical 
ones, but the ones most deeply stirred by the beauty of the verses 
and the situation, set about making an air. They worked in an 
atmosphere of high exaltation because they felt that they were 
handling something entirely fit and beautiful, and something that. 
they had almost seen created, and beeause in the background loomed. 
the play that they had made and that they loved.

II. Work with Children Backward in Music 
Children who are unable to take an active part in the music 
of their grade lose interest when they find that their best efforts 
fail to add to the success of that class. The child who sings in a 
monotone, even if he be unconscious of the effect, will sooner or 
later be discouraged by his neighbors and by a teacher unable to 
give him the individual help necessary to correct what in most 
eases is remediable. It is natural that a child who day after day 
gets no reaction from musical expression should occupy his mind 
with other things during the music period. A social responsi- 
bility can hardly be expected from children who feel that they 
ean be of no help in a class or school activity. But if we find the 
special help necessary to enable them to sing in even one song, 
we have established a basis for renewed effort. Children coming 
from schools where no music is taught or from other similar en- 
vironments, are severely handicapped by their lack of technical 
training, and by becoming suddenly a member of a community 
which has a repertory built up slowly and with special associa- 
tions for each song. 
It often becomes necessary to separate from the large class 
children who are backward, and to give them the individual help 
such an opportunity affords. Indeed, this is imperative in order 
that they may acquire skill enough to be of value to the community, 
and thereby gain consciousness of a social responsibility. The first 
step toward helping children who are unable to do the music work 
of their grade, is to determine the initial cause of that inability. 
We realize that the most marked cases with which we deal prob- 
ably are results of various conditions and not stmply one cause 
which we can remove or overcome. The very nature of music 
allows the greatest range and number of causes, involving, as it 
does, simultaneously, time, rhythm, pitch, and emotional expres- 
sion. Children may have marked musical ambitions and be pre- 
vented by some physical defect from taking the active part they 
desire, or, on the other hand, they may have every muscle and 
cartilage in promising proportion, but lack co-ordination or aes- 
thetic sense. We find, also, children who do not sing, because ~ 
their lives have been almost entirely without active musical ex- 
perience. But we are inclined to think that the seriousness of 
hereditary unmusical taste is overestimated; that children of un-
-P-A-G-E-95
94 Francis W, PARKER ScHOOL 
musical parents are probably unmusical chiefly through environ- 
ment. The entire absence of music in the home may of course 
have caused to be left out that part of the mental equipment ae- 
quired by most people during childhood in the average family. 
Another and very different type of special pupil is one resulting 
from an atmosphere of ragtime and popular songs. This type is 
parallel to the one in literature where the experience has been 
limited to cheap fiction. It is also as easily corrected by the use 
of music of real value. The children who are products of an 
atmosphere of low standards crave and understand music which 
produces a physical reaction only, but they ordinarily recognize, 
when the fact is pointed out, that this is not its whole purpose 
and value. Several of the older children of the school who have 
made demands for ‘‘lively music’’ have spoken when ‘‘off guard’ 
of some popular music as ‘‘only ragtime,’’ or have said, ‘‘of course 
the words don’t amount to anything.’’ These special cases in which 
we have to build up an appreciation of music are almost entirely 
among new members. The greatest number who require special 
help are children whose powers of concentration are weak, or who 
have failed to realize that the mastery of technical work requires 
hard thinking. A child who has failed to become familiar with 
the small amount of special knowledge necessary to sight reading 
cannot go on with his class in what must be a large share of their 
work, and rapidly loses interest and retards the progress of all. 
Older children who come to us unprepared to do the musie work 
of their grade often have to experience a change of mental atti- 
tude when they find that sight reading involves a system of sym- 
bols and mathematics which they have connected with music in a 
vague way only. The written language of music, with its clefs, 
signatures, ete., which has grown up and developed with the art, 
must seem to the person without experience or interest a very 
intangible and illogical sort of arrangement. 
Cases of physical inability to sing are rare and usually tem- 
porary, although many minor difficulties are remedied after refer- 
ence to.a physician or parents, It is: sometimes evident that the 
physical ear is imperfect; in which cases we are obliged to admit a 
different standard, saying perhaps, that part-singing will not be 
practicable. The physical difficulties during the changing period 
of the boys’ voices varies somewhat in individuals. During the
-P-A-G-E-96
Year Boox 95 
present year only one boy has been excused from singing on this 
account. : . 
The separation of a class into groups as defined by their 
ability to read at sight has so far seemed the most successful way 
of helping the poor ones and allowing the better ones to advance. 
One of these special groups made up from the fifth and sixth 
grades, contains boys who have had special help for nearly three 
years. Jn the fourth grade they lacked interest and, with one 
exception, made almost no progress during that year. During the 
past year they were reading at sight as well as the rest of their 
grade. The fact that they have been in a group by themselves and 
could claim more of the instructor’s help has in itself been a lead- 
ing factor in their improvement. Then, too, they were spared the 
discouragements incident to working with boys whose endowments 
easily enabled them to work more rapidly. The first year was 
largely spent in acquiring a knowledge of the rudiments of sight- 
reading. Their present ideal; which has furnished motive for this 
year’s work, is that they shall have learned, by the time they are 
basses, to read any music at sight. They have been able to under- 
stand that the music of the school as a whole is limited largely by 
the ability of the bass and tenor sections. This group of boys has 
grown to have a pride in their skill in sight reading and song 
singing. Their delight in a jolly song is what we believe that of 
a normal boy should be, and could undoubtedly be produced with 
any such group where the opportunity for individual work is - 
possible. 
A group of girls from these same grades, who have had about 
the same amount of special work, show far less initiative and 
growth along the technical side. This is partly owing to. the far 
inferior intellectual quality of the group at the beginning and a 
lack of the friendly spirit which has characterized the group of 
boys and caused them to help each other, 
Complete tone-deafness we almost never find. The lesser de- 
grees of what we ordinarily term tone-deafness vary from inability 
to change the pitch to correspond with an instrument or voice, 
to the child who can, with great effort, follow the melody for a 
limited time only. We have made various experiments to de- 
termine, if possible, a remedy for this condition. One boy who 
seemed to be a well nigh hopeless ease, because he was unable to 
produce a given pitch, was allowed to sing any tone he could and
-P-A-G-E-97
96 Francis W. Parker SCHOOL 
then the instructor approached that tone scale-wise on the piano. 
He was then able to continue with the piano, following accurately 
any simple interval the instructor chose to play. The mental im- 
agery was thus helped out and gave us something on which to work. 
After a few short periods of this kind of éxperiment this boy was 
tried again at reproducing tones at random, this time having him 
listen carefully to strong tones on the grand piano and at the 
same time touch the instrument and get close to the vibrating 
string with the top of the piano raised. He soon noticed an im- 
provement and seemed to experience an awakening. The pleasure 
of having accomplished this much increased his enthusiasm and it 
was not long before he announced that he could sing a song with 
the class. He has gone on from this to be fairly independent and 
is practically up to average in sight reading and part singing. 
When there is average intellectual power and a reasonable interest, 
the child who ordinarily sings in a monotone evidently needs only 
experience that will bring to his mind an intensely vivid sense 
of pitch. 
An experiment in teaching a few boys the rudiments of piano 
playing gave success in this intensifying of pitch imagery, and at 
the same time eliminated the self-consciousness accompanying voice 
work. Where the motor co-ordinations were poor, it served a use- 
ful training in control. As an opportunity for the stimulation of 
interest, a short piano lesson once or twice a week has without, 
- exception been beneficial. In some cases the interest may begin 
with mere curiosity or an ambition to play ragtime, and in most 
cases the interest is a passing one, but it always serves a useful 
purpose. 
Study of the individual, his grade activities and his home 
environment, leads to the determining of underlying causes for 
deficient work, and points out the special treatment necessary to 
his ease. We have to discriminate between the really musical 
child, who will give to a phrase a true musical turn, and the child 
who craves merely the activity and skill necessary to play an 
instrument. Aside from cases of permanent physical or mental 
disability, experience shows that although individual help does 
not make musicians, it at least enables children who would other- 
wise cease active musical expression to take intelligent part in the 
work of their class in the school,

  Printing is distinetly a social art. Setting type and striking 
off numbers of impressions presupposes, in the first place, a com- 
munity to read what is printed; and in the second place, that the 
information printed is of value to this community. Because of 
this, printing is one of the best forms of handwork which it is 
possible to introduce into the schools. It provides fertile ground 
in which the developing social consciousness of the pupil may 
grow and strengthen. More than this, it provides conditions in 
which this consciousness is not merely allowed to grow, but is 
forced to develop and bring forth the fruit of service. The boy 
or girl whose first thought is a selfish one soon has his selfishness 
’ satisfied. There is very little which he can print for himself alone. 
The labor involved in setting the type does not justify a limited 
output. Personal cards and letter heads are usually first thoughts 
(this gratifies the child’s pleasure of seeing his name in print); 
but the satisfaction is, after all, a small one, and the pleasure in 
satisfying the needs of others than himself soon appears as a 
greater one. So he turns to bigger fields. He looks for a commu-. 
nity whose needs he can serve. The school proves to be an unfailing 
and insatiable market for his endeavors. The type of pupil whose 
selfish traits are strongly intrenched, however, does not heed this 
appeal as quickly as his more socially conscious fellows. Im- 
mediate friends and kindred also must be plentifully supplied 
97
-P-A-G-E-99
98 Francis W. Parker ScHoon 
with personal cards, book plates, letter heads, and labels of varicus 
sorts, more or less needed. But at length this market is glutted, 
and he is, perforce, compelled to turn to the school community for 
an outlet for his labors. As the field reached by his printed pro- 
ducts gradually expands, his pleasure in service grows stronger. 
The joy of printing something of value to the whole school is 
much greater, he finds, than the slight, selfish satisfaction which 
he formerly gained for his work. 
This reacts on the pupil in other ways. A boy’s interest in 
his community increases in proportion as he feels he is a necessary 
part of it. Give a boy a piece of printing which he understands 
is an urgent necessity in the school and, see the responsibility which 
he shows in shouldering the work. He feels that this is no tread- 
mill, copybook task which he has before him, but fulfills a real 
need, and the eagerness with which he approaches it emphasizes 
only too vividly the lack of more such motives in what he does at 
school. Report cards, blanks, letter heads, spelling lists, calendars, 
notices, labels for the shelves, arithmetic blanks, etc., are only a few 
of the many things of which the school is in constant need. Many 
times during the year is the opportunity provided of contributing 
to the needs of the school community. It may be that notices are 
needed to post in various parts of the building. A special exer- 
cise is to be given, for which there must be programs. Certain 
blank forms are needed in the office, A class in arithmetic wants 
commercial forms with which to carry on their business transac- 
tions. Lists of words may be needed for the spelling lessons in the 
lower grades. Labels for the library shelves, short stories for the 
primary grades—a thousand and one things, ara constantly clamor- 
ing to be set in type and ‘‘published.’’ The usable nature of his 
printed products (for these compare very favorably with commer- 
cial work) emphasizes to the pupil the fact that he is a produc- 
tive asset of no small value to his community, rather than a mere 
absorbing parasite. 
Consider what this means to the other subjects in the school. 
The use of problems in arithmetic or spelling lessons or composi- 
tions which have been written and actually published within the 
walls of the schoolhouse is more stimulating than if the same 
material were found in the stereotyped texts. Dr. Dewey: says that 
“the pupil should be saturated in the spirit of social service.’’? In 
printing, the only danger is that he may be entirely swamped.
-P-A-G-E-100
Year Boox 99 
Aside from providing the pupil an opportunity of being a 
valuable unit in his community, printing carries with it .many 
other values to the pupil who is engaged in setting type and run- 
ning the press. 
On the side of English, the advantages are so apparent that 
they need hardly be mentioned. Suffice it to say that punctuation, 
division of words, and spelling receive greater attention when cold 
type metal is concerned than when themes and composition are the 
medium. <A printer’s stick is more unyielding and inflexible than 
the margin of a theme paper. <A careless mistake, involving per- 
haps the resetting of a whole paragraph, often carries more weight 
-than a stroke of red ink in an essay. Webster is more frequently 
consulted at the end of a line of type, to settle the question of 
syllabication, than in, the case of the indefinite margin line of a 
composition. 
The art training gained from intimate contact with printing 
is considerable. Every piece of printing involves questions of art. 
The fact that five hundred or more copies are to be made which 
will be permanent reminders of the amount of effort a pupil puts 
into his work will prove a strong incentive for him to do his best. 
Color harmonies in ink and paper provide opportunity for develop- 
ing good taste. Selection of paper stock to suit the work is an art 
problem. Printing may be done on the cheapest Manila paper, 
and still be artistic, if it fulfills its function. A paper of delicate 
tint and fine texture would obviously be out of place in a blank 
which is to be handled much and is to serve a temporary need. 
In our school the seventh grade devote their handwork time, 
eighty minutes per week throughout the year, to printing. This 
is about as low in the grades as the technical processes involved 
ean be handled to advantage. Deftness of fingers, rather than skill 
and strength of hand, is required. This makes printing a suitable 
form of handwork in this grade and one into which the girls enter 
as well as the boys, often with a greater degree of success. The 
problems presented after individual needs are satisfied usually take 
the form of the printing of blanks or other matter of use to the 
grade itself. It may be that while the form is still set up a teacher 
from another grade, struck with the convenience of these blanks, 
asks that they be printed for her grade also. Then come other 
demands, and the young printers are kept busy. for several weeks 
supplying the wants of the various rooms. This marks the dawn
-P-A-G-E-101
100 Franois W. Parker ScHoot 
_of a wider sphere of usefulness. From supplying the needs of 
smaller groups, the class turns to the needs of the school as a 
whole, perhaps the words of a song for morning exercises. Three 
or four hundred are printed and put into immediate use. This

  that his effort is not put forth for some far distant end. The 
greatest difficulty lies in the fact that the need is often so urgent 
that the shortest possible time must be allowed. 
At first, when the technical processes are many and new, and 
the mastery’ seems difficult, the problems are simple and large type 
is used. Then as skill inereases and the jobs become more pre- 
tentious, the desire to attempt some big project grows stronger 
and usually results in a co-operative effort on some booklet of verse

or other reading matter which has grown out of the grade work. 
Or the desire may be to print and illuminate holiday cards for 
Thanksgiving, Christmas, or Easter. This furnishes opportunity 
for dwelling at some length on the history of printing, with its 
many fascinating legends of the monks and monasteries. During 
the past year the class planned a series of morning exercises to 
illustrate the history of printing. These they hope to give next 
year. They will present: in costume a series of scenes showing the 
interesting stages in the development of printing, from the primi- 
tive methods up to the modern. 
The ‘‘Parker Weekly’’ is a paper issued entirely by the pupils. 
They do the writing, editing, composition, proof-reading and press 
work. It came into existence as the progeny of the longer estab- 
lished ‘‘Recorder.”? Much of the so-called ‘‘news’’? which was 
printed in the ‘‘Recorder’’ was more or less ancient history by the 
time the quarterly issue appeared, and when it was remarked that 
a weekly paper could take care of this news and much more, and 
thus leave more space in the ‘‘Recorder’’ for the longer literary 
articles, the suggestion was taken up with enthusiasm by the edi- 
tor of the ‘‘Recorder’’—-a senior boy. He mustered one or two 
other pupils to assist him, and the initial issue made its bow one 
Monday morning before the surprised pupils. An editorial called 
‘attention. to the place and, value of such a paper, and asked for 
eomment from pupils and teachers. There was much discussion 
of the matter. It was pointed out what it would mean to under- 
take such a work and make it successful. There were many even 
in the faculty who doubted whether a school as small as ours could 
successfully manage such an undertaking. But a few of the pupils 
“had confidence. Their enthusiasm was contagious, and others 
volunteered their assistance. Thus the new paper was established. 
The first year was a trying one. The workers were féw and there 
were those among their classmates who confidently predicted fail- 
ure, but determination won the day, Gradually building on their 
experience, an organization has been perfected which comprises 
an elaborate subdivision of labor. Reporters, editors, and proof- 
readers take care of the English; one group of pupils set the type, 
and an entirely different group distribute it after the printing is 
done. Certain boys have the responsibility of the press work. The 
habit formed of regularly meeting an obligation each week and 
fulfilling some duty or task, such as distributing ten lines of type,

THANKSGIVING 
This year the School was able to provide 47 
families with clothes, fuel, and Thanksgiving

mended, all the shoes will be taken to a center where people who need them may come to be fitted. 
The sizth grade contributed the profits of thier candy sales, $ 7.11, to the Thanksgiving fund: the Knightly Brothers and Nymphs gave $1.31 and 80 cents respectively, which they received for thize key-racks: the sale of chrysanthemums on Wednesday brought in $ 1.90; Miette Brugnot contributed $1.31 which she received for some toys she sold at the County Fair; and the Fleure de Lis gave 60 ceats, which was all the money their treasury contained as only 60 words of English have been spoken #0 far.

or setting up a stickful for the coming issue, is valuable—all the 
more so, since it is a voluntary task, not imposed by a teacher or 
impelled by the knowledge of credits gained for graduation, or 
marks at the end of the month, but by the feeling that it is a 
service to the community. 
Such a paper, edited and published by the pupils is a valuable 
factor in uniting the school. Here the literary type of pupil, who 
delights in writing, and the boy who ‘‘likes to feed a press,’’ have 
a common interest. In many schools these two types of pupils, 
the one literary and the other mechanical, have little in common 
and lose interest in one another, thus leading to a separation into 
distinct classes in the school. The common interest in the paper 
helps to preserve the democratic atmosphere of the school. Pupils 
from the seventh grade through the high school are active in the 
work of the ‘‘Weekly.’’ Hach year the eighth grade pupils, fresh 
from the printing experience in the seventh, step out into the 
ranks of the workers. Thus, though the seniors are leaving, there 
is a constant replenishing of the staff each year, and the amount 
of work for any one pupil is not excessive. The seventh grade, 
novitiates in the art, are usually enthusiastic supporters of the 
““Weekly’’ by the middle of the year. 
The paper is issued on Monday morning, and records the 
happenings of the previous week, with a schedule of events to 
come. The greater part of the composition is done on Thursday 
and Friday, and the type is distributed on the following Tuesday 
and Wednesday. The press work is done on Saturday forenoon. 
Pupils are allowed to use vacant periods during school, but most 
of the work is done outside of hours. That the Parker ‘‘Weekly”’ 
is an important factor in the life of the school is shown by the 
eagerness with which it is scanned on Monday morning, and by 
the frequent references mada to it during the week. 
The ‘‘Recorder’’ is issued four times a year, and occupies an 
entirely different field. The contents are not so largely news, but 
stories and longer articles. The writing of these proves a valu- 
able motive for the work of the English classes. Ulustrations and 
cover designs are provided by the art classes. The editing and 
managing of the ‘‘Recorder’’ is done by high school pupils, but the 
typography and press work the pupils have no share in. For this 
reason there are not so many people intimately connected with the 
actual work of getting out each issue as is the case with the   
     
-P-A-G-E-105

““Weekly,’’ and the interest in the ‘‘Recorder’’ is confined mainly 
to pupils in the high school. 
‘Now a few words regarding equipment. With the many values 
inherent in printing, no school can afford to be without its press. 
Let not expense or lack of room be given as an objection. The 
initial equipment need not be expensive. Let a moderate equip- 
ment be provided to serve as a ‘‘nest egg,’’ and to this may be 
added more material as the pupils and the school find that the 
needs arise. The pupils themselves suggest ways of meeting this 
expense by the sale of Christmas and Easter cards, calendars, and 
booklets. The ‘‘Weekly’’ has provided a considerable part of its 
equipment from funds received through subscriptions, besides pay- . 
ing its running expenses. A special room for printing, though an 
advantage, is not a necessity. In our school the regular woodwork- 
ing shop does duty as a print shop. <A folding bench top for the 
time being converts the work bench into a printer’s stand; the 
cases of type are stored in compact steelrun cabinets, which are 
economical of floor space. Together with the printing press (an 
eight by twelve Gordon), the equipment does not take up over 
twenty square feet of floor space. Surely these conditions are not 
prohibitive. . 
II. Printing in the Seventh Grade 
Varied experiments in the way of printing a monthly school 
paper and pamphlets and small books fostered a growing belief in 
the value of printing as an important socializing factor, as well 
as a form of manual training in school life. This school decided 
to test its worth by introducing it into the seventh grade curriculum. 
This particular place was chosen first because in the earlier grades 
the children are more individualistic in their tendencies, most of 
them choosing to make what they may call all their own, while in 
the seventh grade the social instinct or community spirit becomes 
distinctly manifest, and as the product of the printing art is 
pre-eminently social, printing should satisfy them as a manual ac- 
tivity ; second, because it would be valuable to give an opportunity 
to apply practically where its function is paramount the child’s 
understanding and control of formal English (which has by this 
time become fairly efficient); third, because the children of that 
age delight in tasks demanding absolute mechanical accuracy, skill 
and delicacy; fourth, because the history course arouses an inter-
-P-A-G-E-106
Year Boox 105 
est in the art of printing and bookmaking as developed in the 
Middle Ages. 
In the beginning of the year the school has many minor needs 
which can be supplied by the ‘‘apprentice printers.’’ The seventh 
grade seek out, and sometimes take orders a year in advance for such 
work as the printing of name lists used in checking up work, ete.; 
texts for Thanksgiving and Christmas music; letter heads for dif- 
ferent departments of the school; labels of all kinds; reprints of 
newspaper or magazine clippings for use in class room work; origi- 
nal problems to supplement the arithmetic text books; games 
for younger children; ete. The varied experience gained in such 
matters as choice of type, typesetting, arrangement on paper, 
choice of paper and ink, locking up press work, ete., creates an 
enthusiasm and prepares technically for the larger problems which 
follow. These larger enterprises, however, do not crowd out the 
smaller kinds of work of which the school is in constant need. 
This work, which is later done almost independently by the chil- 
dren, includes all kinds of notices, invitations, programs, bill heads, 
Christmas toy shop tags and pasters, danger and warning signs, 
all forms such as deposit slips, checks, drafts, receipts, ete, (some 
twenty in number), used by the seventh grade business firms in 
their play bank, and the setting up of copy for the ‘‘Parker 
Weekly.”’ 
The manner in which the boys and girls announce the dis- 
covery of a want somewhere in the school, the initiative with which 
they plan and follow up a piece of work, their insistence on 
promptness, their impatience at delay and their just wrath at 
irresponsibility and errors on the part of less fortunate members 
of their group, are genuine indications of the importance which 
they attach to this work. Perhaps more convincing than any of 
- these is the care with which they organize themselves for work. 
‘‘Paul should do this part, because he can do it best: and very 
fast.’—‘‘We need this part first, so it must he done by someone 
who does not make mistakes.’’—‘‘Must I always do this part be- 
cause I know how?’’ ‘‘No, But this time because we need it. Some- 
‘time, when it doesn’t make so much difference, you can change.” 
— ‘Last time vou promised to stay, to run the press, you forgot, 
and we got behind. We think you had better give your turn to 
someone else.’’—‘‘Let us print the rules we learn about print- 
ing, so that the boys and girls who forget and ask the same question
-P-A-G-E-107
106 Francis W. Parker ScHoou 
twice can answer for themselves. We can give these rules to the 
next grade, too.’’—‘‘But it takes too long to look in the book for 
a rule when we are setting up.’-—‘‘Then don’t forget!’’—‘‘If 
they don’t need us in the ball game, we could finish running off 
this page after school tonight, so that we could bind in the shop 
period tomorrow and hot have to wait until next week.’’ 
Each year printing and illuminating of appropriate Thanks- 
giving, Christmas, and Easter cards has been a valuable prepara- 
tion for the larger piece of. work which every class has selected 
to supply some community need. JIlumination of the printed page 
offers a rich opportunity for free and conventional art work; for 
the exercise of imagination, judgment, taste, and inventiveness in 
the use of form and color. To illuminate festival cards beautifully 
is just as satisfying to the eager artists as illumination of books, 
which requires too prolonged effort. The problems involved are 
of the same type, only fewer in number. The arrangement of the 
printed matter on the page is planned always with a view toward 
the problem of decoration, the aim ‘being to allow the greatest 
possible freedom. Where the text requires a conventional form 
of decoration, the place to be illuminated is indicated and limited, 
as seen in the accompanying illustrations. Expressions of deep 
pleasure and delight and earnest appreciation of one another’s 
work are frequent accompaniments of exhibit time, when all the 
works are gathered together and the critics spy the more original 
ideas or the skillful application of an old one; or when the illustra- 
tion is a true addition to the idea of the text rather than a mere 
embellishment; or when the meaning of a drawing seems obscure 
on first examination, and on closer inspection reveals a bit of 
symbolism. 
In class discussions the children say such things as these: 
‘‘Does every card you see take as much thinking as ours do??’— © 
“Do printers hire artists to make their plans? The cards I see 
down town are not very beautiful. Sometimes the paper isn’t 
good.’’—‘*We ought to sell our ecards in stores, too.’’—‘‘Mother 
keeps our cards for book marks, because she thinks they are good 
enough to save.”’—‘‘See this piece of paper I found, isn’t it fine? - 
T never looked much at paper before, but now I always notice every 
piece.’? : : 
When one class chose to make a school calendar the boys and 
girls insisted that it should be colored, for, as they said, ‘‘The

little children won’t like them if they’re not colored.’’ Then the 
outline was printed by the use of a plate, because of the great 
number of copies that would be needed.. The color was applied 
by free-hand work. This kind of work, as well as the binding of 
small pamphlets and books, has led to having a ‘‘factory day’’ 
several times in tha year. On factory day, factory methods are 
employed, and the division-of-labor process is a new and vital in- 
terest. One booklet is bound before the class for an example. The 
operations, including every necessary movement, are carefully 
counted. The workers arrange themselves so that the folders pass 
material to assemblers, assemblers to inspectors, inspectors to sew- 
ers, needle-threaders to sewers, etc., until every step is provided 
with workers and inspectors. As soon as the faster workers are 
discovered, the laborers on certain tasks are increased and they 
re-arrange themselves according to the skill necessary for each kind 
of work, Things move along smoothly, until some one says, ‘‘Could 
I change work with somebody? Do people in a factory have to 
do the same thing all day?’’ All these questions are later taken 
up in the class room, where they are discussed more intelligently 
than could have been done without a background of experience. 
During the time since printing was introduced into the seventh 
grade, several small books have been made. The first was a collec- 
tion of favorite quotations from Morris’ ‘‘Sigurd the Volsung.’’ 
The children had committed long passages to memory, and on copy- 
ing them for future enjoyment, had found the writing laborious. 
They suggested printing some of the tales, and when a choice had 
to be made, were surprised at the number they must include. 
Next followed the thought of connecting the passages with a 
simple, terse outline of the thread of the story, The writing of 
this became the problem of the literature class, and in the book 
these connecting thoughts were printed in a bold type. Numerous 
illustrations (zine plate) were added, the product of the art class. 
The finished book contained some forty pages. The intimate rela- 
tion between the literature and the art is shown by the illustra- 
tions below which are initial letters used in some of the chapters. 
About one hundred and fifty copies were then illuminated for 
special uses. So from small beginnings the book grew, and now each 
class reads it with great pleasure. A few copies are left to cir- 
eulate every year, and they are always returned with comments 
sush-as ‘Do you think we could make a book like that??’-—‘‘That
-P-A-G-E-112
YeEar Book 111 
grade must have had many good workers in it.’’—‘‘I wish I could 
buy a book like that; I like the story. We ought to set it up 
again.’’ : : 
The second book was a collection of four poems known to most 
of the children of the school. It was called ‘‘Four Famous Rides’’ 
and consisted of Browning’s ‘‘How the Good News was Brought 
from Ghent to Aix,’’ ‘‘Paul Revere’s Ride,’’ ‘‘Sheridan’s Ride,’’ 
and ‘‘The Diverting History of John Gilpin.’’ Only the eover 
page was decorated. This. book, though used by individuals and 
grades, has never been of special interest since the work on it 
was completed. Its contents can be committed to memory after 
repeated readings and do not appeal to any large and varied 
interest. 
   THE VOLSUNG KING THE FEAST-HALL THE WERE-WOLVES 
More worthy seemed the collection of morning exercise read- 
ings, made another year. The school, as well as the printing class, 
helped in choosing poems. Considerable study of a rich mass of 
suggested material emphasized in this case the importance of print- 
ing only such matter as has a truly permanent interest and. value. — 
This in turn resulted in a deeper respect for the book itself, for 
which nothing but the best paper and type would do. 
This year a memorial, in the form of two very beautiful 
Arundel prints, ‘‘St. Francis Preaching to the Birds’’ and ‘‘The 
Interior of Piccolomini Library’’ at Sienna, were presented to the 
- school. This led to a study of St. Francis, in preparation for a 
memorial service. After the exercise, the children suggested print-
-P-A-G-E-113
112 Francois W. Parker ScHOOL 
ing the material so that all the friends of our one-time comrade 
might have a copy, and as one child said, ‘‘Because we think 
everybody ought to know as much about St. Francis as we know. 
If we like him so well, other people would, too.’’ 
  FRANCISCAN FRIARS 
“Tf we print that book, it must be very plain, because St. 
Francis said that larks were an example to us because their clothes 
were plain, like to the carth.’’—‘‘Could we have paper that would 
be like the plain brown clothes of the Franciscan friars??? We 
succeeded in finding just such a paper,—dull soft, and felt-like. 
During some of the discussions came these words: ‘‘St. Francis 
wishes his monks to work for the people in the fields, and to sing 
to them and cheer them on. Some of us tell how to do every- 
thing, but we don’t help to do it.’’—‘‘We have found some mis-
-P-A-G-E-114
Year Boox 113 
takes in almost every book that we have looked at. Could we 
make a book without an error?’’—Teacher: ‘‘ Perhaps no book 
of ordinary size has ever been typographically correct.’’—‘‘If many 
people look at the ‘proof’ could we succeed? Let us try.’’—‘‘Let 
us send some copies of our book to the church in Assisi.’’ On see- 
ing a notice about a new work on St. Francis being published in 
Leipzig, the children suggested sending some copies there. As soon 
as our proof sheet appears, eritical eyes eagerly seek to discover 
what might mean an imperfection in the book. Personality many 
times disappears entirely in the effort of the group to produce an 
  ST, FRANCIS AT CHRISTMAS-TIME 
ideal piece of work. The children classify the errors as ‘‘careless 
mistake,’’ ‘‘mistake because he didn’t know the rule’’ (‘‘should 
have inquired’’), ‘‘accidents,’’ ete. Following are some comments 
from the shop: ‘‘How many lines did you set up without a mis- 
take today ?’”’—‘‘Next time I will look out for the punctuation in 
my copy.’’—“‘If I play a note wrong on the piano, it only lasts 
for a second, but if I leave out a letter or a comma, it spoils the 
whole thing and everybody sees it.’—‘‘I didn’t think spelling 
mattered much until I began to print. Now I look at a word and 
Jearn it the first time.’’—‘‘So do I. I have learned more spelling 
from printing than I ever knew before.’’ Later, this child was
-P-A-G-E-115
114 Francis W. Parker ScHoon 
questioned by the teacher, and said, ‘‘I learn more words when 
I set them up, because I have to think about each letter quite a 
little while. First I see it in the ‘copy,’ then I look for it in the 
’ type case, and then set it in my stick.’? Teacher: ‘‘Would writ- 
ing a word over and over do just as well?’’—‘‘No, because when I 
print it, it has to be right, and when I write it wrong I can do it 
over again.’’ (Next year each child shall set up his own spelling 
list.) ‘‘I don’t think I know enough about commas. Could we 
learn. more about them?’’—‘‘In setting up for the ‘Weekly’ we 
have to say everything in a very few words, so as to have room for 
all the news, but it would spoil our book to do that; it seems too 
business-like.’’—‘‘We think we ought to print more than three 
hundred copies.’”,—‘‘But two pages have been distributed.’’ 
—‘‘Then we must set them up again. Let us print five hundred.’’ 
—A slight. mistake was made in cutting the cover paper. Next 
day one child secretly told the teacher that she had brought money 
for more, so that we might have the covers as they had been 
planned; she would earn in the summer the money which her 
mother advanced. This with no word to the others except from 
the teacher that some one had donated more paper. 
In every case, the amount of initiative, the enthusiasm, the 
richness of ideas, the carefulmess in work, the respect and regard 
for the finished product, the observation and appreciation of the | 
work of others, the gain in unselfish endeavor and modesty, have 
been exactly commensurate not only with the effort expended but 
with the inherent value of the product. The printing of a school 
paper can be interesting as a form of manual activity and an expres- 
sion of school loyalty and patriotism, but it cannot create a love 
for the beautiful in the world of books, and a sense of the bound- 
less gratitude man owes to this art. The experience with print- 
ing in this school hag shown that it has a distinctive place as a 
means of giving to the children a genuine and dignified regard 
for the worth and beauty of books, and the art of printing and 
decoration; of creating ideals of social effort and responsibility; 
of raising the children’s standards of the way to work and the prod- 
wet of work; of teaching correct use of language, spelling and 
punctuation. It has shown that these results are most effectually 
and quickly obtained when the subject matter has true literary 
value, when it appeals to the older children and to grown-up 
people as well as to the younger; when the opportunity is given
-P-A-G-E-116
YEar Book 115 
to add @ personal touch to the printed page by way of illustra- 
tion, illumination, to insure a permanent interest or value in the 
product of the press; when the commercial side, cost of materials 
and income from sales, is kept as much as possible in the back- 
ground, so that it may in no way interfere with the natural ex- 
pression of ‘the highest ideals of work, the beauty of the product, 
and the attitude toward others in thoughtfulness and generosity. 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
CARE OF THE CHICKENS 
Today it is generally conceded by parents and teachers that 
the care of animals is an educative activity for children. In our 
school we have made the experiment of letting second grade pupils 
care for chickens, and have found the work to ‘react favorably upon 
the children’s mental and moral attitude. For one thing, their 
innate interest in animals as pets has become the motive power 
in acquiring the knowledge that a real concern in the animals’ 
welfare demands. At one time our class-work for a week centered 
about the best method of keeping the litter out of the water pan. 
The group discussed plans and made drawings; children went 
home and constructed models; these models were studied and 
criticized by the group; and when finally a satisfactory one was 
chosen, the making of the article was turned over to an individual 
pupil. We have seen habits of kindness inculeated in children by 
their consideration for the chickens. Boys and girls have said, ‘‘f 
won’t eat my apple this reeess; I will give it to the chickens for 
green food.’’ Children have grown, too, in habits of carefulness. 
One child said: ‘‘If you spill the grain all the way to the run, 
we'll have rats.’’ Pupils have developed a feeling for orderliness 
when put in charge of the chicken pantry where things had to be 
neatly and conveniently arranged and labeled. The class has be- 
come more trustworthy under its responsibility for the chickens’ 
comfort. If they forgot to open the hen house door, for example, 
the chickens had to roost. in the run all night and had their combs 
nipped. We have seen heedless children acquire forethought. 
Many of them formed the habit of standing and turning over 
in their minds the number of different articley they had to gather 
together before they left the building for the chicken quarters— 
keys, pails, seraps, excelsior, sulphur, egg-shells. Children have 
grown keen, too, in the power of observing things. ‘‘The hen’s 
comb was a good eolor today,’’ one would remark. And we have 
seen initiative grow strong. One boy of his own accord brought 
charred sticks from a bonfire and broke them up to save buying 
chareoal. We have seen unselfishness develop. <A child who had 
been told by the teacher that he might have the much prized privi- 
lege of taking the egg to the Principal, answered, ‘‘No, we have 
116
-P-A-G-E-118

planned that Ned should deliver the egg toaay.’’ And best of all, 
the care of the chickens has introduced into our children’s lives 
new joys. Every day is full of expectancy. And when baby chicks 
come, the joy is supreme. A boy who was ill said, ‘‘I must go to 
school today, because the chickens will hatch.’’ But every common 
day had its delights—the gathering of eggs, the holding of them 
in one’s hands, the seeing of the difference in color and size, the de- 
livering of them to appreciative customers, the giving to friends 
who were sick, the proud feeling that one was the member of a 
great industry, and that something of his own had market value. 
And perhaps the joyous appreciation of the real value and signifi- 
cance of an egg was growing in the mind of the child who re- 
marked, ‘‘I think that an egg is the most wonderful thing in the 
whole world.’’ 
In their homes, children are often allowed to take care of ani- 
mals, but do not always reap the benefits that we think our second 
grade class did. Indeed, they sometimes fail so utterly that they 
are rather harmed than helped. This result is due not to their lack 
of interest, but rather to the fact that a child’s judgment is too 
immature adequately to solve the many complex questions that 
arise, Therefore, his pet suffers and he becomes callous. He needs 
here the same direct supervision and systematic instruction that 
are usually given to his other school undertakings. : 
An eighth grade class could take care of our chickens with much 
less expenditure of the time and energy of both pupils and teachers 
tharf are needed in the second grade, but we believe that this caring 
for animals ought to come early in a child’s life; for although he 
has an instinctive impulse to observe the needs of animals, and even 
to help, yet, if he is not early assisted to form a habit of acting 
upon this impulse, a passive idle curiosity takes its place. More- 
over, a very little child seems to have a closer kinship with dumb 
animals than older people have, and as he observes their needs and 
ministers to them, a right feeling and a genuine sympathy are 
cultivated. : 
One spring, five or six years ago, the children of the second 
grade received from a little girl out west an express crate contain- 
ing two bantam chickens. In the course of time other children gave 
hens of the ordinary barn yard breeds, until the school accumulated 
a respectable flock. A year ago last fall it was decided to make the 
eare of these chickens an important feature of second grade work,
-P-A-G-E-119
118 Francis W. PARKER ScHooL 
and it is the purpose of this report to state how it has been the 
means of creating an opportunity for wholesome out-door activity. 
In approaching the subject with the new class, the children 
were told that for several years past it had been the custom for 
the second grade to have the fun of sharing with the janitor the 
eare of the school chickens, and that this privilege was now offered 
to them provided they wished to enjoy it. The opportunity was ac- 
cepted. Then an effort was made to impress upon their minds the 
seriousness of their responsibility and to this end the children and 
teacher together worked out a simple code which read something 
after this fashion: 
Our chickens have life. 
In the city they cannot range the fields to find food. 
They depend upon people. 
‘We must not let them suffer. 
‘We must never forget them. 
‘We must be trustworthy. 
The questions of suitable food, proper care, and the best way 
to carry on the new work were next discussed. It was agreed. that 
the scraps left from our hot luncheon, with grain of some kind, 
constituted a good food. It was decided, also, that the pupils 
should take turns in caring for the chickens. Two children, ac- 
companied by a special teacher, should feed them every day at one 
o’elock, observe their needs and condition, care for the hen house 
and chicken run, and when this was done write a report of their 
experiences to read to the class upon returning to the class foom. 
' From the first experience the children came back hot and ex- 
cited. There had been no time for writing. With unmistakable 
emphasis they declared that the chickens were in a bad place and 
that feeding them was a hard job, for the grain was locked in the 
tool house; the run was a wet, muddy place in which to work; the 
feed pans were dirty; and the janitor had the only key to the 
hydrant. While one child hunted for the janitor to get the keys, 
the other tried to clean the hen house, which was low, damp and 
dark inside. But he said he was unable to do this because it was 
too muddy for him to crawl through the doorway and he could 
not manage the rake from the outside, then he added, with dis- 
gust, that the moment the food was placed in the run, the old 
rooster with a flap and a bound, landed with both feet in the mid- 
dle of the pan. But the children were delighted with the variety
-P-A-G-E-120
Year Book _ 119 
and size of the flock; for there were five cunning bantams, seven 
‘big hens, a fine black rooster, two half-grown game chickens, and 
four little X-ray chicks, one without a tail. 
For two reasons it was thought best not to keep such an as- 
sorted flock during the winter. In the first place two second grade 
children could not carry food and water for such a number, and 
secondly we wanted to be business-like and if possible sell enough 
eggs to pay for the expense of keeping the chickens. So homes were 
found in the country for the bantams and X-ray chicks, Before 
many wecks passed, cock fights became so frequent that we had to 
    
dispose of our young game rooster. We traded him for a well be- 
haved pullet, or ‘‘bullet,’’ as the children at first insisted upon 
writing in their reports. 
About the middle of November our permanent flock was moved 
into a large new house, as the old quarters had been condemned by 
the class. Unfortunately the children had no part in the planning 
of the new house. This was left to the superintendent of buildings 
because the house had to be finished before cold weather set in and
-P-A-G-E-121
120 Francis W. Parker Scxoon 
because the carpenters, a group of fifth grade children, worked on 
it only during their play periods. But the class planned the new 
run. Several boys staked it off, dug holes for the posts and helped 
with the painting. In addition, the children planned during science 
periods and made in the manual training shop the following articles 
for use in the new quarters: , 
(1) <A food trough into which the rooster could not jump. 
(2) A protection for the watering can. 
(3) A movable roost. 
(4) A portable droppings board. 
(5) <A double compartment self-feeding grist hopper. 
(6) Two nests made out of grocery boxes. . 
The children found the ‘planning of these articles great fun, 
for their parents became interested and helped them work out draw- 
ings and ecard board models. The teachers consulted United States 
Poultry Bulletins, and from books showed the class pictures of 
model fixtures. While the plans were under discussion, one of the 
children invited the grade to visit the Annual Land Show to see an 
excellent miniature poultry exhibit from which they got practical 
points concerning not only fixtures but ventilation and foods. When 
finished, the articles were examples of sincere but quick, rough work. 
The children used them daily and when a hopper fell apart some- 
body in the class mended it, or when the mending stage was passed, 
cheerfully replaced it. It would have been a simple matter to buy 
_ all the necessary articles but the purpose was to make the children 
resourceful, and in this way a real practical problem was furnished 
for each new class. 
About the middle of October the children began to bring in 
feathers that they had found in the chicken quarters and about 
the school premises. The little girls kept them on their desks, 
played with them at recess, and used them to decorate their dolls’ 
hats, After the process of moulting had been explained, the boys 
became collectors too, and from the number, color and character of 
_ the different feathers found, they speculated as to when the white 
hen or the game hen would begin to lay. But during most of the 
fall, feathers were gathered instead of eggs, and food bills ac- 
cumulated . 
During the winter term, class work centered about questions 
of food and methods of feeding. Tests to find the contents of dif- 
ferent foods were made during cooking periods. The following

paper written by one of the children states the result of a test for 
starch and gluten, and shows how these points were worked out in 
class: 
Edward. Monday, Feb. 8th, 1912. 
Why We Changed Our Chicken Food. 
Right after Christmas vacation Percy told us the chickens were 
too fat to lay eggs. So of course we wanted to know what the mixed grain 
had in it ta make our chickens so fat. These were the things that we 
found in it—corn, wheat, oats, buckwheat, sunflower seeds, kaffir corn, 
egg shells, charcoal and flower seeds. We are not feeding so much corn 
any more. We made an experiment with them (corn, oats and wheat) 
and we found there was more gluten in oats and wheat than in corn, 
so we have more oats and wheat. We are sprouting oats now. We 
put some out this morning, : 
Another very serious problem of the winter term was the plan- 
ning of a device which should prevent the water from freezing. 
Many poultry men use a specially constructed lamp for this pur- 
pose, but such a solution was not to be considered where small 
children did the work. So after much planning they settled upon 
a device which they called the ‘‘fireless heater.’’ It was a strong 
grocery box packed with excelsior. A space was left in the middle 
for a tin box which contained a heated fire brick. In the center of 
the cover the children cut a 4-inch hole, and over this opening 
they set the zine water fountain containing fresh, warm water. 
This device was suecessful, for the heat from the enclosed brick 
kept the water. from freezing during the coldest days. The care of 
the fountain was intrusted to a committee of two who served for a 
week. Though the task had to be done before school, it was con- 
sidered a great privilege, for with it went the fun of egg gathering, 
which by now had become a sure pleasure. 
Each day the number of eggs was recorded with the names of 
the persons to whom delivered, and on Fridays, during the number 
periods, bills were made out, presented and collected. After all 
accounts were settled with the office, the surplus money was glee- 
fully counted into the chicken purse to be used for some social pur- 
pose. This year the class bought flowers for the May Queen’s 
crown, and planned to buy from the Knightly Brothers of the fifth. 
grade a small loom of simple design, in this way adding to the 
second grade textile equipment.

To the outdoor work at the chicken quarters the spring pro- 
gram adds garden planting, which is also done with reference to 
the needs of the chickens. The following reading lesson on the 
‘subject of Green Foods includes the use made of the vegetables 
raised by the children: 
The farmer’s chickens range the fields. 
They find the grass and blades of growing grain. 
Often the chickens slip into the farmer’s garden. 
Oh, how they feast upon the young vegetables! . 
Our chickens cannot range the fields. 
We raise vegetables for them in our garden. 
We raise beets, cabbages, peppers and sunflower seeds. 
Sunflower seeds contain oil. 
When the chickens are moulting, we give them sunflower seeds. 
Sometimes we hang vegetables up in the run. 
The chickens have to jump for them. 
Jumping is good exercise for chickens. 
Sometimes we chop the vegetables into small pieces. 
Then we mix them with luncheon scraps, 
Our chickens are always hungry. 
They soon ate all the vegetables we had raised. 
Then our mothers helped us. 
We brought from home lettuce and cabbage leaves, celery tops and 
apple parings. 
Next we sprouted oats in boxes.
-P-A-G-E-124
Year Book 123 
The class together composed the following paper on ‘‘Sprouted 
Oatg’’: 
How Our Chickens Like Sprouted Oats 
We get a box and put a little soil in it. 
We scatter one-half cup of cats on the soil. 
Then we sprinkle half a cup of luke-warm water on the oats every 
morning. 
It takes one week for the oats to grow four inches high. 
Then we bring them to school and feed them to the chickens. 
The minute we get into the run, some of the chickens jump onto 
the box before we get time to set it down. 
Sometimes they sit on our shoulders to eat the green sprouts. 
In about three minutes the green tops, the soil and the roots are 
all gone. 
Then another child takes the box home to sprout some more oats. 
Chickens like them, and green food is good for them. 
The daily reports given below are from last year’s records, and 
hint at other spring experiences: 
Starr. Thursday, March 4th, 1912. 
The chickens were very hungry to-day. 
The chicken feed will be gone in about a week. 
I took the water fountain to the work shop and scalded it with 
hot water and then I filled it with cool water. 
This must be done quite often. 
“Then I put it in the chicken-house. 
I seattered grain in the run. 
Ruth cleaned the droppings board. 
The air was not good in the chicken-house this morning; now it is 
warmer we had better clean it more often. We had better clean it in 
the morning and in the afternoon; it would smell better. 
Karl. March 20, 1911. 
Fourteen eggs. The chickens lay more eggs Sundays than Sat- 
urday. 
They usually lay six eggs on Sundays and on Saturdays they usually 
lay three or four. 
They ate out of my hand and I could pet them. 
We need a padlock on the bin and a new rope, 
The Kindergarten took apple-skins and the chickens ran clear across 
the yard and formed a circle around the Kindergarten; they were 
pleased, 
Ruth. Tuesday, March 19. 
No egg, but 3 this morning. 
We made a new nest. 
First I took all the old excelsior out and sprinkled some lime on : 
the bottom. Then I put the new excelsior in,

Florence. April 21, 1911. 
I fed the chickens one cup of chicken food. 
I got two eggs out of the nest, but I left one egg in the nest so the 
hen would be happy. 
William. 
The mother hen was cackling to get into the house. 
When we iet her in, she looked in the nest for the egg, and looked 
surprised because the egg was gone. 
Peggy. March 15, 1912. 
Three eggs! 
In the lime barrel there was snow over the lime, 
We cleaned the droppings board. 
We had to go through the deep snow. I could not open the door. 
Margaret had to open the door for me. 
Ned. January 5, 1911, 
We are going to keep the droppings in a box and put black dirt 
over them, 
We will sell them in the spring for the garden. 
Our Pantry 
Marion. March 6, 1912, 
There are cans . of things in our pantry—linseed meal, egg shells, 
laying tonic, bone meal, and charcoal. 
In the back row we keep an extra supply of foods. 
Soon I think we will have enough cans to put all the things in. 
I hope that the children will bring some more cans. 
Miriam. April 24. 
I found fourteen eggs. 
The pretty hen that was sitting got out and ate some of the pol- 
soned meat that was to keep the rats away. 
Louise. Tuesday, May 2. 
We have a ferret which will kill rats. 
It is in a big wooden cage. 
When he breathes he jerks. 
I found one egg. 
Both of the pullet’s middle toes are like a monkey’s toe, 
The sitting hen stayed off the nest box one-half hour, 
I gave the chickens three pans of water.

Dear Miriam:— 
We set our hen May 17 on 13 eggs. We fed her. She did not sit 
all the time; she got up sometimes to scratch herself and scratch. 
On June 5 she hatched three baby chicks; at first they could not walk, 
they just waddled. June 6, four hatched. With love,

A statement of the year’s work was made last spring for the 
June ‘‘Recorder.’’ Before it could be summarized the children had 
to understand the processes of adding and subtracting numbers of 
three figures. The following paper was dictated to the teacher by 
the children: 
Friday, May, 1911. 
Our Chicken Report 
The Second Grade is taking care of nine hens. Since October the 
ninth we have gathered 468 eggs. All the money we got from selling 
these eggs was $14.05. We spent $6.56 of this egg money for 300 pounds 
of chicken food. We bought with $2.07 of the money bran, oyster shells 
and charcoal, bone food, cabbage, lime, insect powder and sulphur, 
straw and setting eggs. We gave $1.30 to the Big Brother and Sister 
League. We spent altogether of our egg money $9.87 and have left 
$4.18. Miss Hefter is going to buy during summer vacation food for 
our chickens with the money that is left over, The reason we had a 
‘good deal of money left over was because Henry Carter gave us 100 
pounds of chicken food.

  “For many years it has been a eustom, a tradition, for every 
eighth grade to do something fine for the school, We, too, wanted to 
show our devotion to the school. We wanted to give it the best, the 
finest thing we could make.’’ So begins one of the eighth grade 
books, in which the children recorded their work in the spring of 
1911, upon The House. ‘‘The House’’ is what they call it, in large _ 
capitals, on the covers and title pages. 
At the outset of the work, Charles was appointed official photog- 
rapher. .And when, long after despair of ever sceing any prints 
had settled on our hearts, he did at length stroll in one morning 
with the finished pictures, the quondam carpenters seized paste 
pot and pen, as they had handled hammer and nails. Their 
chuckles as they mounted the pictures were a pleasure to hear. We 
might not notice the sagging roof beam in this one; but the boys 
who tightened up that roof beam and put in two sets of collar 
beams to strengthen it, have strong muscular association with that 
print. We might think this picture a representation of an un- 
finished shack, but the young workmen remembered how their hearts 
leaped the day the roof went on. Every picture called up memories 
of the good fellowship of the class, their pleasant banter of each 
other, their appreciation of good work, For it reminded them of 
aching muscles or of long hours of voluntary labor. Their books of 
mounted photographs, each with a few words of comment, were of 
course the merest side issue, intended only for their own pleasure. 
But we believe that they reflect the actuating spirit of the class, and 
therefore are quoting largely from them in order to give an account 
126
-P-A-G-E-128
Year Boox 127 
of this community project, which Mr. Wahlstrom worked out with 
the class as part of their regular handwork. 
As we reread the books, we could hear the children again, 
garly in the winter, eagerly discussing what they should do for the 
school. 
“In the beginning of the year,” says one book, “wa looked at all the 
things that other eighth grades had done for the school, and we decided 
to,build a house. We discussed many plans, but on the whole the house 
‘seemed:the best.” 
The house agreed upon, the chase was up indeed. If they were 
to build a house for the playground, they felt that it must embody 
their ideals of good taste. In the minds of their elders, it must 
improve these ideals somewhat, but that must wait. Every pupil 
thought he knew what constituted beauty in a house, and was bent 
on winning his twenty co-workers to his point of view. Sketch 
after sketch came in, photographs of their own summer homes, 
half-tones from magazines. ,Size and proportion must be de- 
termined, number of windows, placing of windows. Some of the 
books contained carefully worked out drawings by which the owners 
sought to convince the rest that leaded panes were a sine qua non, 
or easement windows, or a Dutch door. 
One of the best workmen among the girls dismisses this long 
discussion laconically. ‘‘We were busy,”’ she says, ‘‘making draw- 
ings of windows, doors, sidings, and different houses.’’ 
At this stage most of the books touch humorously on our con- 
tact with the city authorities. Stanford wrote to the Building Com- 
missioner, informing him of our plans, and inquired whether a 
permit was necessary. With its usual courteous promptness, the 
city hall informed us that we could not have a permit and should 
not be allowed to erect such a structure under any circumstances. 
It was first-hand information with a vengeance. The children had 
supposed that what they built was no one’s affair, and fire limits 
became a stern reality. Mr. Wahlstrom appeased the powers by 
what the children always thought was a time-ser'ving concession,— 
namely, calling our heart’s delight a ‘‘shed.’’ 
“Mr. Wahistrom,” says Waldo, “went down to-get a permit. In it 
the house is disrespectfully called a ‘shed.’ (Shame on that permit!) 
But we don’t think of that, and we call it the Club House. Mr. Hendry 
has been carrying the permit in his pocket in case an inspector should 
come, and ask for it. “Then” (apparently if the permit were not forth- 
coming) “the work would be stopped.”
-P-A-G-E-129
128 Franois W. Parker ScHOooL 
But they do not forget that slur upon their project, Mention 
of it crops up, here and there, along with pride in their progress, 
and appreciation of the devotion of people who worked early and 
late. 
“The house does not look like a shed today,” appears under one 
picture—a picture that would not perhaps awaken the same pride in 
your heart that it does in Margaret's. “Some boys have been working 
early in the morning and late at night. Some of the girls stayed to 
help with the roof.” 
Nothing shows more clearly the children’s feeling that this 
was a piece of genuine work than the hours they spent on it.

The class was divided into sections with a pupil as foreman 
of each. To every group a certain part of the work was assigned, 
such as shingling, sawing rafters, nailing battens. These assign- 
ments were changed from time to time, and the personnel of the 
groups shifted in order to give cach person experience with many 
processes. The pupils were directly responsible to their foreman 
who inspected their work, eriticised and helped them, and checked 
up their time cards at’ the end of the day. The time cards and 
foremen added dignity to the enterprise.

“March 23.—On this day the Eighth Grade Construction Company 
started operations on the magnificent Club House in the playgrounds 
of the Parker School. First we marked where the posts were to be dug; 
next, most of us dug holes, while a few sawed the posts. We were 
glad to get the house under way.” 
One afternoon a week, from 1:05 to 3:15 was the regular time 
set for the work, but overtime was the rule rather than the ex- 
ception. 
“April 10.—To-day was not a regular working day,” says Paul, “but 
a few of us went out” (after school, of course) “to get all of the piers 
ready, so that we could start right to work on the sills. We discovered 
that a few of the posts had been set in way off, so we had to dig them 
up and set them in right.” 
“June 1—As there are only two more regular working days, we 
will have to put in some extra hours. It was a dandy day to work— 
not too hot or too cool.” 
“At stopping time,” writes Caroline, “all the boys left but Victor 
and Paul. Grace, Gwen, Enid and myself stayed. We finished puttying 
the glass in the window frames. Enid and Grace left. Then there were 
four poor souls left to work, and so we worked on, watching the ball 
game in between times, and going back to our work with a sigh. Then 
there was a thrilling moment,—the score stood eight to eight, even 
innings, with one out and Lawrence up to bat. The pitcher threw a 
wild ball to first, the first baseman missed it, the man on third ran 
home, and made the score nine to eight in favor of the Frogs.” 
“June 1.—-Another busy day gone, and a lot done, but only Paul and 
Victor worked until five o’clock. Some of the girls, as was natural, had 
to take some little exercise jobs, like putting the glass in the window 
frames. But let me tell you, they would not have had them in to this 
day if it had not been for some enterprising boys in the group.” 
“June 6.—This was our regular working day. Waldo, Charles, Oswald, 
Victor and myself worked at shingling all afternoon, until about eight 
o’clock. We had our dinner on the roof, and we got about two-thirds of 
the west slope done, and the porch roof shingled. Shingling is dandy 
fun. Quite a few of the girls were glazing today.” 
“June 7.—To-day was Field Day, and so only a few worked in the 
afternoon. Charles Walker got here at 6:15 this morning to shingle.” 
“June 8.—To-day I got to school at 5:10, and finished the shingling 
on the west slope. In the afternoon the girls turned out in force, be- 
cause they all want new dreSses, and the easiest way to get them is to 
Spoil the old ones painting. A few of us boys were shingling, and these 
boys stayed until 8:45 and finished the shingling.” 
“June 10.—To-day was Saturday, and everybody was supposed to 
come early in the morning and work until the house was finished. At 
noon we were to get lunch—ice cream, lemonade, cake and sandwiches, 
We were so sure of finishing to-day that we had an article printed in
-P-A-G-E-131
180 Francis W. Parker Scwoou 
the ‘Parker Weekly’ that said the houSe was finished. We didn’t finish, 
but we would have probably done so if the people had come earlier and 
stayed later. But as it was, the majority of the class didn’t get around 
until about ten o’clock, and two of the girls, even, came just half an 
hour before lunch time, and after having lunch of course they suddenly 
remembered an important engagement, and‘so left. Then, too, what 
seemed to be little finishing touches a month ago now appeared as a 
good day’s work. We finished making the door, put the ridge board on, 
and worked on the floor. Battens had to be put on at different places; 
painting had to be done; more glazing; the hinges put on the windows, 
and several other jobs. In the afternoon we started painting the roof. 
The color is green, and it looks well on the house. Charles Pain, 
Charles Walker and Jack stayed late and painted the entire roof.” 
The spirit. of goodfellowship between boys and girls was very 
pleasant to watch. All were engaged in a piece of hard work. 
There was time for some good-natured banter, but no time for 
nonsense. Of course the children exercised their immemorial 
privilege of grumbling at each other, at the weather, and at Mr. 
Wahlstrom. 
“May 2—I was greatly disgusted,” says Jack, ruefully, “because Mr. 
Wahlstrom told me to plane the ridge pole, and it took me all afternoon. 
If he had used the buzz saw, it would have taken only a minute.” 
However much they jeered at each other, they were appre- 
ciative of hard work, devotion, energy, and enthusiasm. 
Many eighth grades have done for the school pieces of work 
of which they were justly proud, and which have been very useful, 
but ‘‘The House’’ embodied some special advantages, from the 
teacher’s point of view, as a piece of community handwork. One 
of these advantages lay in the fact that, hard as the work was, 
progress was visible. 
“And we haven’t much more to do now,” begins one hopeful com- 
ment, “only to shingle the roof and put on the battens and the aprons, 
and glaze the windows, and put them in the frames, and lay the floor, 
and stain the house, and paint the roof, and—well, it takes too long to 
tell the rest, so I will leave it out. But the house will be finished 
soon.” . - 
“To-day Sarah and Caroline put some of the siding on the south end 
of the house. We seem to be progressing rapidly. The weather is 
getting quite warm, but we seem to get a lot doue anyway.” 
“Today we have done great work. The house is springing up as if 
fire crackers were under it. It looks like a really truly house. The 
window frames are here, so we put one in just to see how it looked. We
-P-A-G-E-132
Year Boox 131 
are going to have a porch, so that the corner posts were set, but without 
ceremony, for we are common laborers and have to work by union time. 
We have no time for ceremonies.” 
“We got three sides up before we had to quit. That's going some 
for an afternoon’s work.” 
  
    
“April 25——A few of the boys dug the holes for the porch piers, 
while the girls put braces between the floor joists. Three of us sawed 
out the rafters, This took until about three o’clock. Then Jack, William 
and myself nailed the rafters on. It was a pretty good day’s work.” 
Often the tone of the comment shows that muscles, tired in 
the service of others, leave a kindly feeling for those others. 
. “To-day the house seemed to spring up. Three of the boys got up 
on the roof and put the roof beams on. Our house is the latest toy. 
The younger children seem to have a fine time climbing on it. We 
built the house for them, so we don’t care if they want to have fun,” 
This kindliness, in spite of the fact that the roof sagged after 
.the youngsters had had their fun, 
“May 17—Behold! Marvel! Wonder! Surprise! (Charles has 
snapped his camera just after the roof beams went up. We all share 
the joy Sarah expressed.) I say that is a house, and you deny it. There- 
fore, I will compromise with you, and say it is the skeleton of a house. 
I will tell you a Secret—a house is like a man; the skeleton must be 
strong. Now, three young and inexperienced carpenters put in the sills. 
Along came the foreman, laid a heavy hand on the said sills, and they 
all came down.” 
The other two girls also who engaged in the memorable strug- 
gle with the sills, still bore the sears when they came to mount 
their pictures. They both comment on it: 
“This was a memorable day,’ says Gwen, “Enid, Sarah and I were 
set to work on the sills. After each one had measured the length, 
to be sure it was right, we took turns in sawing them, When we looked
-P-A-G-E-133
182 Francis W. Parker ScHoou 
at them, we exclaimed in chorus, ‘How crooked they are’ The next 
difficulty was to make them fit. The nailing was the hardest. The 
nails had to be on a most undesirable slant. Gripping the nail with one 
hand and the hammer with the other, and bringing it down with a whack 
on your finger instead of the nail, were the joys of putting up these sills 
—only to tear them out again, for tear them out we did. When Mr. 
Wahlstrom saw them, with one blow of his hatchet he knocked them 
out. The next time was more successful.” 
“To-day the studs are up on all sides. We put the Sills for the 
windows in, but it was an undertaking. They had to be just so—just 
level and just to the right height. The nails that we had to put in were 
terrible. They almost wouldn’t go in.” 
But the sears that hard work leaves are honorable, if the work 
has in itself enough of inspiration. If this year’s task helped the 
children learn the priceless lesson that hard work is not synony- 
mous with drudgery, it paid for itself. There does not appear 
a shade of resentment for aching backs and blood blisters, broken 
nails and trying weather. 
“To-day,” says Eleanor, “was the hottest day you can imagine. The 
boys put half of the roof on in spite of the heat. The boys knew that 
we would have hot weather later, so they had courage.” 
Evidently, it is one of the three sufferers who put in the sills 
who says, with marked pride in their progress: 
“Now the siding is on all sides except the back. The sheathing 
for the roof is almost all on. It is so hot that we are trying to work 
inside, We put braces between the studs. They are almost as hard as 
putting in the sills.” 
Even such a thankless job as ripping out poor work gets only 
a slight groan from Paul: 
“Mr. Wahistrom discovered some bad places in the shingling, and 
Stanford, Eleanor, Grace and myself had to rip up the shingles and then 
patch it up right. That was awful! The staining was started to-day 
by a few of the girls. The color is brown and it looks well on the 
house,” 
Whether it ‘‘looked well on the house,’? was a matter of 
anxious concern to people who had put the house up from its foun- 
dation, There is no book that does not include memories of hard 
labor. If the reader will permit, we will turn back to the begin- 
ning of Eleanor’s book.

“We started to work on the house about the first of April,” she 
writes. “The first thing we had to do was to.mark off the foundation. 
The main point was to get the corners square. After the foundation 
was marked off, every one was to dig a hole for the cedar posts. The 
weather wasn’t warm, but we got warm digging. We got backaches 
also.” : 
  
    
Another of the same date says: 
“See the start of the house. The foundation is the most important 
thing. Our foundation was of cedar posts. We got the posts eight 
feet long, so we cut them in half, which was a mighty job. While some 
cut, the others dug. Now the holes for the posts are all dug, But oh, 
my, the four-foot holes were hard to dig! But such fun as we did have. 
The frame work is started. The sills are all on.” 
“Mighty jobs’’ were plentiful. Here is another: 
“May 16.—This afternoon was hotter than before. Stewart, Caro- 
line, Jack and I had to finish the roof boarding. Putting on roof boards 
isn’t so easy, for most of the boards were warped over an inch.” 
There is no doubt that the fun of building the house will 
always live in their memories. Those long spring afternoons out- 
doors were as full of joy as of labor. 
“We want you all to know what fun we have had building the 
house,” Eleanor said in the morning exercise. “We are very proud, 
pecause the handwork is to be exhibited in it. We hope that you all 
know of something, work or play, that you would like to do in your 
house.” 
Another child said, in the same exercise: 
“But besides the pleasure of giving to the school a testimony of the 
loyalty of the eighth grade of 1911, we have had the pleasure of doing 
the work. We can witness that there is no such fun as building a 
house.”
-P-A-G-E-135

Sometimes their happiness at the time they did the work is 
reflected in the spontaneity of the account a boy writes when the 
Velox Memorial of some special day’s labor is before him. 
=: “May '9.—The first thing we had to do to-day was to make the roof 
level at the ridge. Mr. Wahlstrom had a happy thought. He noticed 
that the walls bulged out slightly at the front and back, so he got a 
strong rope and tied it between the roof plates of these bulging sides. 
Then a two-by-four was put in between the ropes, and it was turned. 
This twisted the rope, and of course it was tightened. This pulled the 
bulging walls into plumb and also squeezed the ridge until it was 
straight. Patent applied for.) Of course it is understood that if you let 
your roof sag, you must also let the sides bulge out.” 
The longest and wordiest of all our discussions was over the 
siding, : 
“The peace movement is gaining,” Linus remarks. “The long war 
between the barn-siders and shinglers is over. It was settled by arbi- 
tration .(?)—anyhow, you don’t hear many complaints. Mr. Wahlstrom 
says things are going fine. Hurrah!” 
Such a reminiscence of a long struggle shows no scars—and 
we submit that after argument had been bolstered up by appeals 
to architects and contractors, by careful drawings, models: and 
pictures, the experience of changing one’s convictions, or of sub- 
ordinating one’s individual opinion to the general wish’ was in- 
valuable. Every piece of technical knowledge was interesting be- 
cause it was essential to their great end. 
“A lot of the children ran to Mr. Wahlstrom and said, ‘The roof is 
sagging. The roof is sagging in the middle of the roof beam,’ We had 
to cut collar beams and brace the rafters.” 
Sarah bursts into dithyrambs over one print that evidently re- 
minds her of a good day’s work, as well as an aching back. 
“June 1—See the wonders of to-day! See our window frames and 
panes. Some of us have turned glaziers instead of carpenters. With 
‘putty and chisels we go to work. First we knead the putty; then make 
tong coils out of it as if it were clay, and put it on a window pane and 
apply our chisels. That is the process of glazing.” . 
Here is another bit of technical knowledge which to their sur- 
prise they find is every carpenter’s rule-of-thumb: 
“Square Corners.—in order to make the foundation of our house, 
we had to see that the corners were square. We found a way that you
-P-A-G-E-136
YeEar Book 185 
could tell whether they were square or not. If you have a triangle, 
with the base 6 inches and the altitude 8 inches, what is the hypothe- 
nuse? The hypothenuse is 10 inches. So if you have a board 10. feet 
long, you can see if the corner is square. We took a cord that was 6 
feet long and ancther 8 feet. We made a corner out of it. Ther we 
put the 10-foot board across the corners, If the cord comes at each 
end of the board, the corners are square.” 
  The value of the work in technical drawing, which Mr. Wahl- 
strom gave them while the weather was still too cold for outdoor 
building, was obvious. They all mention it. 
“To build a house, one needs plans, so we went to work with a 
T-square and drawing board to make plans for our house. We made 
the floor plan, side elevations, front and back elevations. We made 
these drawings to a scale of one-sixteenth of an inch to an inch. After 
making these drawings, the construction of the house was plain to us.” 
“We made our plans before we started to work out of doors. As 
our pians were all finished, there was no delay talking about what we 
should do.” 
“We made the mechanical drawings, so that we could tell how 
the house would look before it was made. It helped us to solve some 
of the problems that we had to deal with.” 
“The Model.—Two boys made a small model, to show the. construc- 
tion of a frame house. It was built to scale, and when finished will be 
exactly like the real house. We used the model in making our mechan- 
ical drawings.” 
Board measure had more than its usual romantic interest, 
when we found that lumber was high and our allowance small.
-P-A-G-E-137
136 Francis W. Parker ScHoot 
“Board Feet.——We found that in order to figure up the cost of the 
lumber for the house, we should have to know what a board foot was, 
because all lumber is sold by the board foot. A board foot is 1 foot 
long, 1 foot wide and 1 inch thick. Lumber is sold per thousand feet. 
The price it is commonly sold at is $25.00 per thousand feet. To find 
the number of board feet, you multiply the length in feet by the width 
in feet, and by the thickness in inches. 
“Examples of finding the number of board feet: 
“2x%4—6 ft. long 4%x6x2—4 board ft.” 
There was an explanation similar to the foregoing in almost 
every book, accompanying the complete bill of lumber which every 
child worked out.

“After we put the sills on the posts, we started to put up the studs. 
First we marked off on the sills just where we wanted the studs. Then 
we took a piece of 4x4, the same length as the sill. We nailed the 
Studs to this piece of 4x4. Then we turned it up and nailed the other 
end of the stud to the sill where we marked it off in the beginning.” 
We learned something about shingling, besides its being 
‘‘dandy fun.’’ 
“June 5.—To-day a few of us boys started shingling the roof, but 
we did not get much. done, The first row had to have two layers of © 
shingles, one on top of the other, but the others have to have only one 
layer. We used a board for a marker. The shingles are to be laid 4% 
inches to the weather.” 
In short, a considerable part of the children’s pleasure in 
looking back over the quarter’s work seems to be in their interest 
in new processes. 
“It has really been great fun to build our house, and besides, we 
have gotten a knowledge of how a house is built. The house cost in 
the neighborhood of $175.00. Tomorrow we are to hold a reception to 
the Senior Class and their friends, in the house, just after the play.” 
They had every confidence that it would be used and loved. 
Margaret quotes Stevenson: 
“My house,” I say, but hark to the sunny doves 
That make my roof the arena of their loves; 
That gyre about the gable all day long, 
And fill the chimneys with their murmurous song. 
“Our house,” they say, and “mine,” the cat declares, 
And spreads his golden fleece on the chairs. 
And “mine” the dog, and rises stiff with wrath 
If any alien foot profane the path. 
And she goes on— 
“We call the house ‘our house,’ but that was only while we were 
building it. Now that it is finished, we want every one, from the kin- 
dergarten through the high school, to call it his house.” 
‘Another child does her best to express the feeling of the class 
about their work: 
“We want the house to stand as a symbol of what the school means 
to us, and what we would mean to the school. We want every little 
child to play in it, and feel that it is his house. We want the big people 
to hold their club and class meetings there, knowing that the house was 
built for them. We want the high school pupils to think it is a pleasant
-P-A-G-E-139
138 Francis W. Parker ScHoou 
place to spend their study periods, as the house was built for their 
enjoyment. We wish everybody to take pleasure in the house.” 
Class spirit of the most wholesome kind was an unquestionable 
product, and the earnestness is genuine with which one of them 
speaks for the class in the ‘‘Commencement Recorder.’’ 
“The eighth grade has built a house, It is our undertaking for this 
year, as eighth grades have always done something for the school. 
It has taken us many hours, which have been used with devoted zeal 
and energy. We have put into that house many things other than lumber. 
We have put into it school spirit and loyalty. It was a pleasure to work 
on the house and think that we were doing something that would stand 
for the eighth grade of 1911, and we want the school to consider the 
house as belonging to them.” 
  
The technique involved in building such a house is well within 
the capacities of eighth grade children; more so in fact, than many 
projects which are often attempted at the work bench. The fact 
that it is a sure-enough ‘‘job’’ with foremen, and that the work- 
men are handling standard sizes of timber and materials gives 
added zest to mastering the technique. Then, too, there is the 
consciousness of serving the community through a usable, necessary 
piece of work. There is hardly a community—no matter how small 
—or a neighborhood in a large city—no matter how crowded or 
eramped—which could not well utilize the efforts of a group of 
children in a similar project. Just to mention a few of the pos- 
sibilities, there would be the opportunity of building a shelter in 
a small park or playground; a club house similar to the one worked 
out might well be built at some distance in the country and used 
as headquarters for nature study excursions from the schools, 
where might be stored much of the apparatus which is taken along 
on each trip. The school garden or farm may need a tool house. 
The introduction of shop work in rural schools and small towns is 
often prevented because of lack of room. Let the class build such 
a small frame building on the school lot to be used as a shop, Or 
a group. of pupils could be taken into the country for a week or 
two, with tents, camping outfits, and tools, and combine with their 
vacation some useful work. The resulting cottages—one each year, 
perhaps—would prove of material assistance to the work of some 
Fresh Air Camp.
-P-A-G-E-140
Year Book 139 
The technique of house building and framing has long been a 
part of the manual training course in many high schools and tech- 
nieal schools. Usually this is taught by means of small models 
erected in the shop or on the lot—only to be torn down and the 
lumber converted into stock again. Many times these houses have 
been elaborately worked out to scale—plastered, painted and 
decorated. Think of the many opportunities that have been lost; 
of the criminal waste not alone of lumber and material, but of the 
fine stuff of which good citizenship is made. True the cold, tech- 
nical facts may have been brought forth and illustrated, but how 
much better to have added. to them the warm human element—the 
element of service and the knowledge of sharing in the useful work 
of the world. .

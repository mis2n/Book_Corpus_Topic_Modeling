HOW MURRUM SHUT THE TOY-CUPBOARD DOOR 
ONG! 
That is the old clock in the hall striking mid- 
night. A tall old clock with a round foolish face. 
He always looks surprised, though he ought to know per- 
fectly well what the hour is. “Dong!” he says. “An- 
other thirty minutes gone! Now, how did that happen?’ 
It is so still that the voice of the old clock can be 
heard all through the house. Upstairs, where the chil- 
dren are asleep; out in the kitchen, where the mice run 
to and fro on the floor—even outside on the doorstep, 
where Murrum, the black cat, sits in a square of moon- 
light washing his paws. 
Murrum is not so old as the clock, but he knows far 
more; in fact, he knows everything. He knows where 
all the birds’ nests are, and who just rang the doorbell, 
and what the family are going to have for dinner. He 
knows why the cream disappears and what happened to 
cook’s silver thimble and just where Boodles buried his

last hambone. He knows all these things and a great 
deal more, but he doesn’t go about chattering. He 
leaves that to the sparrows and the house-mice, who 
spread all the gossip between them. Murrum sits and 
washes his paws. 
The moonlight is white on the doorstep and Murrum 
is black, but there is a white patch just under his chin, 
and he has four white mittens. He washes and washes, 
down his nose and over his ears and round his ears, and 
while he washes he smiles. 
1? “T’ve fixed them this time!” says Murrum. 
“Fixed what?’ 
Murrum stops washing and stares down with his pale 
insolent eyes. 
It is Toad, the old night-watchman, with his brown 
wrinkled coat and speckled vest. He comes out from 
under the doorstep, blinks up through his gold spectacles 
and grunts. “Fixed what?” he says again. 
“Mind your own business!” says Murrum. 
“It is my business!” said the Toad. “Everything’s 
my business. I wish it wasn’t. I have too much to look 
after, that’s what it is! It keeps me on the hop the 
whole time. Dearie me, what’s all that noise?” 
There was certainly a commotion going on indoors. 
Bumping and thumping and clattering, and with it the 
queerest little shrieks and howls. Muffled noises, as 
though a number of small people were shut up together

in a box and were extremely angry about it. One voice, 
louder than the rest, that sounded like a very sad five- 
finger exercise. 
Murrum listened, his head turned to one side and 
one paw still lifted. 
“A fine rage they’re in, aren’t they! 
“That'll teach them to spoil my mousing!” 
“Dearie me,” said the Toad, “what have you been 
up to now? Who is doing all that squealing?” 
“Why, the toys, to be sure!” said Murrum. “A 
wretched noisy crowd they are, night after night pranc- 
ing and singing all over the house! The place isn’t fit 
to live in. There’s three nights now I haven’t caught 
a single mouse, with their carryings on. No sooner do 
I get to work and settle down, all in position, nicely 
balanced, than—bing! —in they start with their noise, 
and I have to begin all over again. It’s enough to make 9 
said Murrum. 
one a nervous wreck. But Ive settled them to-night. 
I turned the ee on the toy-cupboard door ea now 
they can’t get out.” 
The Toad pushed back his spectacles and scratched 
his head. “They'll be terribly angry!” he said at last. 
“Let them be angry!” said Murrum. “Who cares 
for that? What sensible people see in those things I 
can’t imagine! The best of them isn’t worth three hairs 
off a kitten’s tail. There’s that Anna, with her stupid 
face, and the rag doll, and Bulka, that you can’t so

much as look at but he starts squealing, and Harlequin, 
that thinks he’s so wonderful—a stupid lot, I call them! 
And as for that loose-jointed thing like a dog, that 
they call Poor Cecco, always poking about where he 
isn’t wanted, he’s the worst of the lot! Ugh! I can’t 
stand the sight of him!” 
“Still,” said the Toad, “you shouldn’t have locked 
them up in the cupboard. That’s going too far. You 
could be had up for that!” 
“I don’t care!” said Murrum. “I do what I like and 
I go where I choose! And now I’m off to keep my 
appointment!” 
And he gave a last look at his coat, all smooth and 
glossy, stretched out his ten white toes on the doorstep, 
and arched his back. 
Now all the while Murrum was talking some one 
had been creeping very slowly along the edge of the 
porch just over Murrum’s head. He had to move rather 
stiffly and carefully because he was all made of wood, 
and if he once let his joints rattle there would be a ter- 
tible noise. So he went gently—clop—clop—and when 
he reached the big flower-pot that stood just by the 
doorstep he folded his hind legs under him and lay 
down, with one ear cocked up, to hear what was going 
on. For Murrum hadn’t been quite as clever as he 
thought he was, and when he shut the toy-cupboard 
door Poor Cecco wasn’t inside at all.
-P-A-G-E-16
How Murrum Shut the Toy-Cupboard Door 19 
In fact it very seldom happened, as Murrum might 
have remembered if he hadn’t been in such a hurry, that 
Poor Cecco did get put away with the other toys when 
the nursery was tidied at night. Poor Cecco had been 
through many adventures and was well able to look after 
himself, and, being made of wood, it didn’t much matter 
if he was left out in the rain all night, so nobody trou- 
bled very much about him. And if any one did happen 
‘to want Poor Cecco the best sort of place to look for 
him, at any time, would be out in the garden or under 
the bureau or down behind the woodbox in the back 
kitchen. Once indeed he nearly got thrown on the fire 
by mistake, only Cook recognised him just in time. 
Sometimes he would disappear for days at a stretch and 
then turn up where you least expected him, in the 
laundry basket, or poked away under the sofa cushions. 
But with all his irregular habits he rarely came to grief, 
for he was the cleverest of all the toys. 
He stayed quite still now behind the flower-pot and 
listened to what Murrum had to say. 
“Ah, there’s nothing like being popular in society!” 
sighed the Toad. “Now, with me it’s work—work all 
the time!” é 
Murrum wasn’t listening. He came down from the 
doorstep, still stretching himself and yawning very deli- 
cately so .as to show the inside of his pink mouth. 
Standing in the moonlight, he began to make camels, 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
  20 Poor Cecco 
humping his back and waving his long tail from side to 
side while he admired his shadow on the ground. But 
just as he was nicely balanced on tiptoe, making the 
last and most beautiful camel of all,\/Poor Cecco wrig- 
gled out from behind the flower-pot, took a flying jump 
and landed, with all his joints rattling, right on Mur- 
rum’s nose! 
Murrum gave one terrible yowl and flew off down 
the garden path and over the wall, with his tail as big 
as a saucepan handle. 
Poor Cecco lay on the ground and laughed, all his 
four legs sprawling and one ear still cocked up. 
“Where did you come from?” asked the Toad, rub- 
bing his head, which Poor Cecco had narrowly escaped 
kicking. 
“Hinksman!”’ said Poor Cecco, which means: “I won’t 
tell you!” 
“I suppose you think that’s clever!” said the Toad, 
still rubbing his head, for he was quite annoyed, and 
moreover his spectacles had nearly dropped off with 
fright. “Respectable people hop on the ground, and 
don’t go dropping out of the skies like that. If you 
think you’re an airplane say so at once, and then at least 
one is warned!” 
And he turned his back and began to shuffle away along 
the edge of the flower-border. 
“Don’t be in such a hurry!” said Poor Cecco.

THE TREASURE HUNT 
ERE had been a fine racket going on in the toy- 
cupboard all this while. But by the time Poor 
Cecco had trotted round to the back of the house . 
and climbed in through the kitchen window, most of the 
toys had given up thumping and shouting and were sitting 
still there in the dark, tired out and very cross. Only the 
noise like a five-finger exercise still kept on. Poor Cecco 
could hear it quite distinctly as he poked his head through 
the kitchen window. “Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Uh- 
huh!” 
That was Bulka, the rag puppy. Bulka had been 
mended and restitched so many times that he had almost 
lost his original shape and he really looked more like a 
pin cushion than a dog. He always cried in tune—the 
tune of a five-finger exercise—which annoyed the rest of 
the toys so much that they would do anything rather than 
hear Bulka cry. The worst of it was that, being an ex- 
tremely sensitive person, he cried far oftener than there 
was any need to, whenever anything went wrong, for in- 
stance, or especially if his feelings were hurt; and then all 
the other toys were obliged to stuff their fingers in their 
2

ears and run away until Bulka was comforted. They sim- 
ply couldn’t stand it, but they had to stand it now, for 
there they were all shut up together and Bulka had been 
crying steadily for at least three quarters of an hour, ever 
since Murrum fastened the toy-cupboard door, and all they 
could do was to stuff their fingers in their ears as tightly 
as possible and try to pretend they didn’t hear him. 
But at the sound of Poor Cecco’s feet—clop—clop— 
along the passage and across the floor, Bulka stopped cry- 
ing at once, right in the middle of his tune, and his com- 
panions immediately unstopped their ears to listen. The 
toy-cupboard was quite low, built in next to the fireplace 
as in all proper houses, so all Poor Cecco had to do was 
to reach up on his hind legs and turn the button round 
again. 
Out they all tumbled, all talking at once and very ex- 
cited. First came Bulka, who had his nose to the crack 
in the door all the evening, and close at his heels came 
Tubby, who was a little bigger than Bulka and looked very 
much like him, except that her ears were longer and her 
eyes were rounder. Then Gladys and Virginia May, hand 
in hand, Gladys wearing a white satin petticoat and the 
wedding veil in which she had been married to Harlequin 
the week before, and which was really only loaned to her. 
Virginia wore nothing; all her clothes were in the wash. 
Next came Harlequin himself, all covered with spangles, 
exclaiming “Hey Presto!’ He looked quite fine if you
-P-A-G-E-21
  24 Poor Cecco 
half-closed one eye, so as not to see where the stitches were 
coming undone. After him came the Easter Chicken and 
\ the Lion and the wooden Engine, and then Anna the lamb, 
with a bell round her neck and the little green meadow, 
that she always carried about with her, fastened under 
her feet. Last of all was Ida, because she could never get 
up until the others had moved first. Ida’s last name was 
Down; she was flat and square, dressed in pink satin with 
a silk cord all round. 
All the small toys stayed in the bottom of the cupboard. 
They were already tired and had gone to sleep. 
“Now,” cried Poor Cecco. ‘What shall we do?” 
“Let’s have a picnic!” said Tubby. 
Harlequin wanted to punish Murrum, but no one knew 
where he was. Engine and the Chicken were talking to- 
gether, and as usual the Lion was flirting with Anna; they 
didn’t mind what was done so long as some one decided 
quickly. Ida thought it was time to have another wed- 
ding, but it was now Virginia’s turn to be married, and 
Virginia May refused. She had no wedding clothes, since | 
Gladys would not give up the veil, and the only person 
they could think of for her to marry was Bulka, whom she 
couldn’t endure. Meantime Bulka and Tubby were quar- 
relling because Bulka said that Tubby’s picnics were al- 
ways stupid and Tubby called Bulka a cry-baby. 
Anna said: “Well, if nobody’s willing to do anything—” 
Poor Cecco jumped up and banged on the table. “I 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
The Treasure Hunt 25 
know what let’s do,” he said. “Let’s go on a treasure 
hunt!” 
“What’s that?’ they all cried. 
“Tt’s got to be out of doors,” said Poor Cecco, explaining 
very rapidly, “and we take the express-wagon to bring it 
back in, and you find a place where some one has buried 
treasure and you dig it up and divide it. I’m going to 
do the digging.” 
“How do you find the place?” Harlequin asked. 
“There are lots of places,’ said Poor Cecco. “You 
measure the ground and then you dig. Generally it’s un- 
der a big stone.” 
Bulka remembered a big stone down by the end of the 
garden. There might be treasure there. But how could 
one tell? 
You couldn’t tell. If you knew beforehand, Poor Cecco 
said, then there was no sense in looking and it wouldn’t 
be a treasure-hunt. Any one might do that. But you had 
to have spades, and he sent Tubby to fetch a tin spade and 
a broken spoon that were in the bottom of the toy-cup- 
board. 
The express wagon had gone to sleep. He grumbled 
terribly when they woke him up. “I work all day,” he 
complained, “and at night I want to be quiet. I wish 
you'd think of something with a boat in it for a change!” 
But Tubby had returned with the spade, and every one 
climbed in, paying no attention to his protests. They
-P-A-G-E-23

26 Poor Cecco 
spread Ida on the bottom of the wagon first, and all sat 
on her to keep their feet warm. At the last moment space 
had to be made for the Money-Pig, who insisted on coming 
too. The word “treasure” was quite enough to rouse 
him up. 
“He thinks we’re going to find money, and he’s afraid 
he won’t get any!” whispered Tubby to Gladys, snuggling 
up close against her in the wagon. “He’s an awful miser. 
Did he give you a wedding present last week?” 
“He did not,” said Gladys. 
“When I marry,” said Tubby, spreading her skirts out, 
“T shall be married in Tubbyland and I shall have a Tub- 
byland wedding. Every one will give me presents. I   shall wear a long satin train and roses and a blue veil.” 
Bulka was staring gloomily in front of him. “You'll 
look awfully stupid!” he said. 
“Anyway,” said Tubby angrily, “I shan’t ask you! 
‘When is the wagon going to start?’ 
They were waiting for Anna, who, as usual, had a piece 
of string tangled round her wheels. Anna had to walk 
  alongside, for they wouldn’t let her bring her meadow 
into the wagon, and she refused to leave it behind. 
“Anna is so silly!” murmured Virginia May, watching 
Anna lift first one foot and then the other, very affectedly, 
while Poor Cecco got the string unwound. “It’s absurd 
to be so attached to a little piece of ground like that. It 
isn’t as if anything grew on it. She just likes to pretend
-P-A-G-E-24
  
The Treasure Hunt 27 
she’s an heiress and landowner, so as to make a wealthy 
marriage. But nothing will ever come of it, mark my 
word!” 
They started off—rattle—rattle—rattle—through the 
back entry and down the garden path. It was a very 
bumpy ride. The express wagon felt too drowsy to look 
where he was going. Moreover he was still quite cross 
and so didn’t mind how much he shook them all up. 
Rattle! Now they were going round and round the 
strawberry bed. At each turn the wheels lifted up, nearly 
spilling them out. Anna, who tried to keep pace with 
192 them, kept on tripping. “Stop!” cried Poor Cecco. “This 
isn’t the way!” 
But the express-wagon laughed a nasty laugh. 
“You woke me up for your pleasure,” he declared, “and 
now I shall go where I choose for mine! And I choose to 
go round and round the strawberry bed!” 
But in the end he grew tired of it and dumped them 
all, suddenly and unexpectedly, on a border of spring 
onions. 
Luckily the onion leaves were soft. But they smelt hor- 
tibly. Harlequin in particular was furious. 
“It’s the very last time,” he shouted, “that we shall en- 
gage you on any of our expeditions!” 
“Engage!” said the wagon. “Engage! That’s good!” 
And he rumbled back to the house, squeaking all the way, 
? “Engage!
-P-A-G-E-25
  28 Poor Cecco 
“I suppose really we should have paid him something 
on account,” said Virginia May. “But we never seem to 
have any money!” 
The Money-Pig kept quiet, which was rather mean of 
him, for every one knew he had all the money there was. 
Bulka had fallen on his nose in the onion bed, which 
was really fortunate, for he had just opened his mouth 
to cry when the wagon tipped over, but, lying face down- 
ward on the soft earth, he couldn’t do it. Now he picked 
himself up and repeated “Hurrah!” instead. 
A little way off, by the edge of the potato patch, they 
could see the big stone. 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
Chapter III 
HOW POOR CECCO LOST HIS TAIL 
T was a very large stone—larger even than Bulka had 
thought. It looked as if it had lain there for a very 
long time; almost as if it had always been there, and 
the potato patch and the garden and even the house itself 
had just grown up around it. There might very well be 
treasure there; it might even be a magic stone, by the 
look of it. 
“The first thing to do,” said Poor Cecco, “is to measure 
off the ground.” 
He began at once to measure it off in paces, five times 
his own length, counting the tail, and that brought him 
halfway down one of the furrows of the potato patch. 
There he found a little twig and stuck it up in the earth 
to mark the spot. 
“That’s five lengths,” he explained, “and now if we 
measure five lengths from here again, in a straight line, 
it brings us back to the stone, and that shows exactly 
where we’ve got to dig.” 
The others stood and watched him in admiration. It 
was all so perfectly simple and came out just right, only 
the Easter Chicken said: 
29
-P-A-G-E-27
  30 Poor Cecco 
“T don’t see why you need measure just to get back to 
where you started from.” 
“You’ve got to measure,” said Poor Cecco hastily, for 
he did not want them to start asking questions. “It’s 
got to be done like that, or it won’t come out prop- 
erly.” 
“Do you mean the treasure won’t come out?” asked the 
Easter Chicken. 
But Poor Cecco put him back in the Wooden Engine 
and told him to keep quiet. 
“I wish I hadn’t come,” said the Easter Chicken, snug- 
gling down inside the Engine. “I’m sure it’s going to 
be boring. Wake me up when you find the treasure,” he 
called out aloud. 
Tubby and Bulka began to dig, taking turns with the 
spade, while Poor Cecco dug with his paws. Showers of 
earth flew over his back; soon there was quite a hole. It 
was exciting work, but the dolls grew tired of looking 
on; they wanted to see the treasure at once, and that was. 
not possible. So they dragged Ida over to a more com- 
fortable spot and sat down on her to gossip. 
“Don’t you think Harlequin is handsome?’ asked 
Gladys. “I find there is something so distinguished about 
him.” 
“He is certainly good-looking,” said Virginia May, “but 
even you must admit that he has very little conversation. 
I never hear him say anything but ‘Hey Presto,’ and that
-P-A-G-E-28
  How Poor Cecco Lost His Tail 31 
is bound to become monotonous after a time, even when 
you are married to a person.” 
“I don’t agree with you,” said Gladys. “It is perhaps 
true that he seemed more intelligent before we were mar- 
ried, but that was probably due to shyness. He is ex- 
tremely elegant, and after all what more can you want?’ 
“Domestic life is boring,” said Virginia May, “and 
what’s more, it makes people stupid and conceited. I in- 
tend to keep my independence.” And she made a move- 
ment to smooth out her skirts, but remembering that to- 
night she had none, sat with her hands folded stiffly on 
her lap, staring out at the potato patch. 
“She is jealous,” thought Gladys. “That is because she 
has no wedding-dress, but what can I do? These things 
are arranged for one by fate.” 
Ida sighed. Romantic by nature, she was doomed to 
spend her life listening to other people’s confidences. No 
one ever thought of falling in love with her, and yet she 
had all the qualifications for an ideal wife. 
Anna now was different. Anna held her head high. 
She stood now in the moonlight, serene on her little green 
meadow, her two glass eyes, set almost on the top of her 
woolly head, staring of necessity straight up into the sky. 
It gave her a rather stupid expression, but the lion did not 
notice that. He thought she was beautiful. He thought, 
in fact, she was the most beautiful person in the world. 
“T adore you!” he said to her now for the hundredth
-P-A-G-E-29
  32 Poor Cecco 
time. “Leave this barren country and fly with me to the 
jungle.” 
“J don’t think I should like the jungle,” said Anna. 
“Every one tells me it is full of snakes. I could never feel 
at home there.” 
“How can you tell until you have tried?’ objected the 
Lion. “The jungle is a wonderful place. There is a green 
twilight within it, monkeys swing from branch to branch. 
There the birds have a thousand voices and the flowers are 
lovelier than the fairest dream. Fly with me, beautiful 
Anna, and we will be king and queen of the jungle for 
ever!” 
“Would I really be queen?’ Anna asked, for that in- 
terested her. 
“You shall be queen of the whole forest,” said the Lion. 
“A thousand slaves shall do your bidding and you shall 
wear garlands of flowers round your neck.” 
“T cannot abandon my meadow,” said Anna primly. “T 
have made a vow never to leave it.” 
“Oh, of course,” retorted the Lion, really losing his 
temper this time, “if you mean to spend all your life 
attached to a miserable bit of painted board, then there’s 
no use arguing with you!” 
And he turned his back on her in a great huff and went 
off to see how the treasure was getting on. Anna felt that 
she had pushed matters a little too far. She had no in- 
tention of settling down in the jungle, which she pictured
-P-A-G-E-30
  How Poor Cecco Lost His Tal 33 
as an overgrown bean-patch, but she liked to hear the Lion 
talk about it; he put everything in such a poetic light that 
it really sounded quite attractive. She wandered off now 
among the potatoes, hoping that the lion would change 
his mind and follow her, as he had done many times be- 
fore, but he didn’t. Anna was too proud to call him, so 
she blundered on and on, feeling that her evening was 
completely spoiled, and presently got lost among the po- 
tato vines for her pains, which served her right. 
Meantime, quite a large hole had been dug under the 
stone, but there was so far nothing to show. Bulka’s paws 
were blistered from digging; he was all for giving up the 
job and trying somewhere else, but the Money-Pig would 
not hear of this. The mere thought of treasure excited 
him, and as his legs were too short for him to dig himself 
he felt quite safe in giving orders to the others. 
“Remember,” he kept shouting, “I am the guardian of 
this treasure. I order you to keep on digging till you find 
ites 
“In Tubbyland,” Tubby began in her squeaky voice, 
“whenever there is treasure it’s always buried under big 
stones, and there’s heaps and heaps of it, and whoever finds 
it it belongs to all of them, and as soon as ever you start 
digging—” 
“Ym seck of hearing about Tubbyland,” said Bulka, 
sucking his paws that had begun to smart. “I wish Tubby- 
land had never been invented!” 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
34 Poor Cecco 
“Then if you say that,” said Tubby indignantly, “it’s 
just the same as saying you wish J had never been in- 
vented!” 
“T do!” cried Bulka. “I do wish you'd never been in- 
vented, so Hinksman!” 
“Oh! Oh!” shrieked Tubby. ‘“Bulka’s being unkind 
tome!” 
Poor Cecco had to stop digging. 
“Can’t you two keep from quarrelling for one evening!” 
he exclaimed. 
“Well, Tubby is so ucky!” said Bulka sulkily. 
Now “ucky” is the very horridest word you can use about 
anybody—you can tell from the sound how horrid it is 
—and things were likely to have gone very badly had not 
Harlequin suddenly had an idea. This did not happen to 
him often; up to the present he had contented himself with 
dancing about and saying “Hey Presto” while the others 
worked, which did not assist matters much, but he felt 
now that this idea was too good to be wasted. ‘ 
“Instead of digging the earth from under the stone,” 
he suggested, “why don’t we lift the stone off the treas- 
ure?” 
Poor Cecco scratched his head. “That’s not a bad idea!” 
“It’s what I told you all along,” put in the Money-Pig, 
“only no one listens to me!” { 
How to do it was the question. The stone was far too 
heavy to lift. All of them pushing together could not 
     
-P-A-G-E-32
  How Poor Cecco Lost His Tail 35 
budge it an inch. “We must get a lever,” said the Money- 
Pig. And then it was that Poor Cecco had his really bad 
inspiration. It all came out of trying to be too helpful. 
“If I put my tail under it,” he said, “we can use that 
for a lever and tilt it up.” 
“Hey Presto,” cried Harlequin, striking an attitude. 
Poor Cecco’s tail was of wood, like all the rest of him, 
but it was a fine strong tail, and in those days quite long. 
It was an easy job to poke the tip of it under the stone. 
Really it looked as if it would make a wonderful lever, 
and Poor Cecco himself was quite excited. “Now, all take: 
hold of it together,” he cried, “and when I say ‘ready’ you. 
must push as hard as you can!” 
And he took a long breath and planted all his four feet 
very firmly and said “Ready!” 
What really did happen? No one knew. But at the 
moment they all crowded together, holding on to his tail, 
and Poor Cecco took his long breath, and every one pushed, 
instead of, the stone rolling over as they expected there 
was a dreadful crack, and Poor Cecco’s lovely wooden. 
tail snapped right in half! 
That was a terrible moment! There was half of Poor 
Cecco’s tail broken off under the stone, and what was. 
worse, they couldn’t pull it out again. Not that it would 
have been much use to him if they had. Tubby gave a 
piercing shriek, Harlequin turned very pale and tottered 
as he stood, the dolls hid their faces, and as for Bulka, 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
36 Poor Cecco 
he burst out crying louder and more like a five-finger ex- 
ercise than ever before, and no one had the heart to stop 
him. They could only put their fingers in their ears and 
shake their heads and stamp. 
“Indeed it doesn’t hurt,” Poor Cecco was saying. 
“Bulka, dear Bulka, I'll buy a new tail to-morrow if you'll 
‘stop crying!” 
But Bulka refused to be comforted. His weeping 
swelled out on the breeze, loud and strong. All over the 
garden one could hear him, and all the potato bugs came 
running, wakened out of sleep, to know what the matter 
was. To Anna, however, lost among the potato vines and 
very miserable, it was a positive blessing. She lifted her 
head, stopped snivelling, and lumbered back, led by the 
sound, to where the others were gathered. 
“What has happened?” she began. “Have you found 
the treasure? Why is Bulka crying?” 
“Poor Cecco has lost his tail!” ‘. 
‘Then Anna had to cry too. 
*‘Hoo—Hoo—” they all lamented. “Poor Cecco has 
lost his tail!” 
“Where did he lose it?’ asked the potato-bugs, who 
after all are practical people. 
“He broke it off. Hoo—Hooo!” 
“Then why did you say he lost it?’ returned the eldest 
potato-bug, slightly annoyed. “Lost is one thing, broken 
another. We can’t do anything about that!” And the
-P-A-G-E-34
       How Poor Cecco Lost His Tail 37 
potato-bugs all humped their backs and crawled back to 
bed again. 
Now there must be an ambulance, and it was no use 
shouting for the express-wagon. He had been sound asleep 
again these two hours past. So they turned the Easter 
Chicken out of the wooden Engine and put Poor Cecco in 
that. His legs hung over the side; it wasn’t very comfort- 
able, but it was the best they could manage. Harlequin 
was to be the doctor. He was the tallest and could look 
quite wise so long as he didn’t open his mouth, and there 
was no need for that. Tubby and Virginia May would 
be hospital nurses and wear a red cross on their arm. They 
arranged it all, walking on either side the Engine to keep 
poor Cecco from falling out. It was almost as exciting as 
if they had found the treasure, and they had the added 
satisfaction of doing good to some one at the same time. 
So they walked home, Anna pulling the engine, and 
Tubby and Virginia on either side, and whenever they met 
any one on the road they put their handkerchiefs to their 
eyes and said: “Poor Cecco has lost his tail!” 
As for Poor Cecco, he got a ride home anyway, and when 
they reached the toy-cupboard they put him to bed in the 
dolls’ cradle and there he slept peacefully and Bulka sat 
by his side all night.    
-P-A-G-E-35
      Chapter IV 
BULKA AND POOR CECCO DECIDE TO SEE THE WORLD 
N the morning when Poor Cecco woke he had forgotten 
all about his tail. But he remembered it as soon as 
he jumped out of bed and stood up. It felt so funny 
without it. There was nothing to wag but a little stump 
that went to and fro very fast, like a clock with the pen- 
dulum taken off. 
“That’s not so bad!” thought Poor Cecco, and skipped 
over to look at himself in the glass. “Half a tail is better ‘ 
than no tail. Besides, many of the best people wear it 
that way!” 
It was quite early, but there was already light in the 
room. Long strips of sunlight came in under the drawn 
window-shade. All the toys were asleep. They were very 
tired from staying up so late the night before. 
“Now is the time to go for a walk!” said Poor Cecco, 
and he called to Bulka very softly so as not to waken the 
others. 
_ Bulka had fallen asleep with his nose on the edge of the 
doll’s cradle. But he woke up at once with a jump, rubbing 
his eyes. 
“We are going for a walk!” said Poor Cecco. 
38 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
Bulka and Poor Cecco Decide to See World 39 
“But how about your tail?’ Bulka asked. 
“My tail can very well look after itself,” Poor Cecco 
replied. “Besides, if we stay here the others will want to 
play at hospital, and that I can’t stand. Do you remember 
the last time Tubby had measles and Virginia pinned the 
bedclothes on her to keep them tidy?” 
Of course Bulka remembered. The pin had gone right 
into Tubby’s middle, and Virginia was quite annoyed be- 
cause she had to pull it out again. 
“This time,” Poor Cecco said, “we'll give them some- 
thing that won’t matter, to practise on!” 
So he fetched a stick of firewood from the box in the 
kitchen. They put it in the doll’s cradle and pulled the 
covers up close, and it looked quite like a real wooden 
person lying there. 
No one was astir in the house. Outside on the doorstep 
Murrum, returned from his wanderings, was sniffing round 
the milk-bottles. He gave Poor Cecco a surly look. 
“Now we know where the milk goes!” jeered Poor Cecco. 
But he had to dodge quickly down the steps and round 
the rain-water butt. Lucky for him that Murrum was feel- 
ing stiff and drowsy! 
The road stretched out, like a great ribbon reaching to. 
the ends of the world. The sun shone down, and all the % 
grass blades had gleaming tips. It was a fine day to set’ 
out for adventures. Presently a man overtook them, driv- 
ing a wagon piled high with hay.
-P-A-G-E-37

40 Poor Cecco 
“Do you want a lift?” he cried. “It’s lucky to meet one 
wooden leg, so four must be better still! Climb up on my 
wagon, and I'll take you into the town.” 
Bulka and Poor Cecco climbed up. The countryman 
cracked his whip, and away they went down the road. This 
was better than the express-wagon! The hay was as soft 
and springy as a feather bed. But one must take care not 
to fall off, and that wasn’t so easy; the wagon pitched and 
swayed like a ship at sea, and Poor Cecco had to cling tight 
with all his paws. As for Bulka, he just lay and bounced. 
That was a fine way to ride into town, with all the bells 
on the harness jingling and the wagon wheels a creak and 
the driver snapping his whip. The only trouble was that 
Bulka, long before they passed the last milestone, began 
to feel seasick. 
The driver pulled up his horses just past the bridge at 
the beginning of the town. 
“Now I must put you down,” he said, “for I have to 
drive on to the dealer and sell my hay. So good-bye, and 
thank you for your company!” 
And being a nice man, he reached out his arm and helped 
  them to the ground. 
By the end of the bridge’a blind man was sitting, with 
his back against the wall, dozing in the sunshine. Beside 
him sat a little black dog, keeping watch over a tin can 
that was placed there for pennies. There were only three 
pennies in it as yet, for it was still early and not many
-P-A-G-E-38
Bulka and Poor Cecco Decide to See World Al 
people had passed over the bridge. The blind man was 
very old, with a long white beard, and the little black dog 
was old too, and turning grey about the whiskers. But 
he was a pleasant-looking dog, and Poor Cecco, being a 
stranger in the town, thought it well to be polite to every 
one. So he said: 
“Tt’s a fine morning!” 
“It is a fine morning,” returned the little black dog 
without turning his head, “and fine enough for you who 
can run about and enjoy it! Not that I grudge it you, 
but it’s small pleasure to sit here day in and day out, and 
never a chance to stretch my legs a bit and see what’s going 
on in the world. No, we who have to work don’t get much 
fun out of life, and that’s the truth!” 
“Why do you have to sit there all day?” asked Poor 
Cecco. “Don’t you ever take a holiday?’ 
“And who'd look after my old man here, if I went gad- 
ding about?’ said the little dog. “I’m in charge of him, 
and he can’t be left to himself. He’s a good sort, so far 
as that goes, and I’m quite fond of him, but I don’t mind 
saying I’d like a change now and again. I fetch him out 
every morning and I take him home at night, and between 
whiles I must sit here and look after the pennies.” 
Poor Cecco peered into the tiny cup. 
“I should think the pennies could very well look after 
themselves,” he said. 
“That shows how much you know about it,” returned 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
  42 Poor Cecco 
the little dog. “It’s easy to tell you’re from the country, 
even if I hadn’t seen you ride up on the hay wagon! Still, 
I like the look of you, and I can’t say that of every one.” 
“Suppose I take your place for a while?’ said Poor 
Cecco, who was anxious to be friendly. “T’'ll sit here and 
watch the pennies, and give you a chance to walk about a 
bit and see the town.” 
The little dog stared at him. 
“That’s an idea worth thinking about,” he said. “But 
how can I tell you'll look after the business properly? I 
can’t have my old man robbed by any one who may come 
along.” 
“Leave that to me,” said Poor Cecco. ‘As for Bulka 
here, he’ll sit by and help me. Only take your head out 
of the collar and let me get mine in.” 
So the little dog pulled his head out of the collar, very 
carefully, so as not to waken the old man, and Poor Cecco 
slipped his head through instead. The collar was far too 
big, but he managed to prop it up somehow, and there he 
sat on the pavement, with the tin cup at his feet. 
“That’s a neighbourly act,” said the little dog. “I will 
do as much for you, some day. Now look pleasant, and 
above all, don’t forget to wag your tail for a penny! It 
pleases the people and draws custom.” 
And he strolled off down the road, very pleased with 
himself, stretching his legs and sniffing at all the corners 
like any fine gentlemanly dog of leisure.

  ‘O one before had ever seen a wooden dog that wagged 
its tail; it was as good as going to the circus, and the 
pennies rattled down. 
“That’s the sort of dog I wouldn’t mind keeping myself,” 
said the countryman.
-P-A-G-E-42
   
-P-A-G-E-43

-P-A-G-E-44
  Bulka and Poor Cecco Decide to See World 45 
The first passer-by paid no attention at all, but strode 
by in a great hurry without even looking their way. The 
second paused and stared, but just as Poor Cecco was get- 
ting his half tail ready to wag, he too passed on. But 
the third one stopped long enough to put his hand in his 
pocket and drop a penny into the tin cup, and thump went 
Poor Cecco’s tail on the pavement, just as the little black 
dog had told him. He couldn’t wag it sideways, for it 
wasn’t made that way, but he lifted it up and let it drop 
—bang—yjust like a door-knocker, and that did quite as 
well. 
“That’s a fine sort of dog you’ve got,” said the stranger, 
who had the look of a countryman. 
The blind man aroused, and nodded his head. 
“He’s a good enough dog,” he said. 
“And he won’t eat you out of house and home either, 
T’ll be bound,” said the man. ; 
“He eats what he can get,” returned the blind man, 
“but we must all do that.” 
“That’s the sort of dog I wouldn’t mind keeping my- 
self,” said the countryman. “I suppose you wouldn’t be 
wanting to sell him?” 
“No, I wouldn’t sell him,” said the blind man. ‘“We’ve 
been friends too long, and you don’t find a dog like him 
every day.” 
Poor Cecco thought the little black dog might well be 
pleased to hear that, for of course the blind man couldn’t 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
  46 Poor Cecco 
know that they had changed places. Other passers-by 
stopped, seeing the countryman standing there, and they 
too had pennies to drop in the cup. Soon there was quite 
a crowd. No one before had ever seen a wooden dog 
that wagged its tail; it was as good as going to the circus, 
and the pennies rattled down. One man put as many as 
three. And when they grew tired of staring and passed 
on others came forward to take their places. Poor Cecco’s 
tail went thump—thump—on the pavement; he could 
scarcely keep count any more and soon the cup was over- 
flowing. Those who had no more pennies put in dimes 
and nickels. Business was certainly flourishing. 
The old blind man had never known such a good morn- 
ing before. 
“Tt must be because the sun is shining,” he said to him- 
self as he heard the coins clinking in the cup. “Every one 
is in a good humour. Yes, it must certainly be a very 
sunny day!” 
In the middle of it all the little black dog came strolling 
back. There was such a crowd that he had to push his 
way between the people’s legs. 
“You've surely done well!” he said. “T give credit 
where credit’s due, and I’m sorry I called you a hayseed. 
I can see now you've got a head for affairs, and if you like 
to stay here and go into partnership with me and my old 
man we'll give you a share in the business and a corner 
to sleep in at night.”
-P-A-G-E-46
  Bulka and Poor Cecco Decide to See World 47 
But that didn’t suit Poor Cecco at all. He was tired 
of sitting still by now, and his tail was quite stiff and 
painful from so much thumping. He was glad enough to 
slip his head out of the collar and let the little dog take 
his place again. 
“Business is all very well,” he said, “but my friend and 
I came out to see the world, and I’ve only seen part of 
it as yet. Still I’ve learned now how money can be made, 
and that’s always useful if you happen to want it.” And 
he thanked him kindly and went on his way, though not 
before the little dog had insisted on Poor Cecco accepting 
four pennies, three for himself and one over for his friend. 
“Bulka will be pleased with this!” thought Poor Cecco. 
But when he turned round to look for Bulka, Bulka 
wasn’t there! 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  Chapter V 
BULKA GETS INTO TROUBLE 
HERE was Bulka? . 
When Poor Cecco changed places with the 
little black dog, and sat down on the pavement 
to wait for pennies, Bulka soon got very bored with sitting 
there beside him, and nothing at all to do. So bye-and-bye 
he got up, quietly, without saying a word, and strolled off 
along the sidewalk to see what there was to be seen. 
The bridge, like a great many other bridges, had water 
flowing beneath it. And a fete ine further on, not far 
from where the old man sat, a little path ran down a steep 
bank from the sidewalk to the water’s edge. 
Now Bulka loved water. He had often thought that 
he’ would like to be a sailor, in spite of the fact that the 
least rocking made him seasick. And he had never seen 
so much water as this before. In fact, all the water he 
had seen, up to now, had been in tubs and pails, or else 
in puddles on the garden path after a shower, and these 
were shallow and muddy, and always dried up just when 
the sun shone out and you didn’t want them to. But here 
was water, plenty of it, flowing along as freely as if*there 
48
-P-A-G-E-48
    Bulka Gets into Trodble 49 
were no end to it all, as indeed there wasn’t, and as soon 
as Bulka caught sight of it he became very excited. 
“Some one,” he thought, “has left the spigot running!” 
And he began at once to slide down the little path as fast 
as he could go, on his behind legs. 
In the pool under the bridge a number of ducks were 
swimming about; big ducks and middle-size ducks, and 
some little furry baby ducks, with flat yellow feet and 
eyes like drops of ink. They swam about in circles, dab- 
bling under the water with their bills, while a little way 
off, all by himself, an old drake with green feathers was 
asleep on the water, with his head tucked under his wing. 
At first the ducks took no notice of Bulka, and for a 
long time he amused himself by poking about on the shore 
by the water’s edge, getting his feet very muddy, and 
looking under all the stones. For if treasure really grew 
under stones, as Poor Cecco had said, here might be a very 
good place to find it. But nothing grew under these stones 
except fat pink worms, and one horrid black thing with 
pincers, which behaved very rudely and which Bulka did 
not like the look of at all. 
So after a time he gave up the hunt, as the things he 
found under the stones seemed to be getting worse and 
worse, and instead he sat down on a tuft of grass to watch 
the ducks. 
They were having a wonderful time, dabbling here and 
poking there, and every little while one of them would 
    
-P-A-G-E-49
  50 Poor Cecco 
stand right on his head in the water, with only his tail stick- 
ing out and his yellow feet paddling away at a great rate; 
it was amazing how they did it, and it looked so easy! 
Even the baby ducks could do it, as cleverly as their elders. 
It would be a fine thing to be a duck, Bulka thought, 
and stand on one’s head in the water, and almost before 
he knew it he was trying to do the same thing on shore. 
But it wasn’t so simple as it looked, perhaps because there 
was no water to keep him up, and the best he could do 
was to turn a sort of somersault and fall back each time 
on the mud. 
“Here, what are you trying to do?” called the ducks. 
“You won’t catch any worms that way!” 
“I'm not looking for worms,” said Bulka, feeling sud- 
denly shy when he found they were all watching him, but 
keeping up his somersaults none the less, just to show 
them that he didn’t care. “I don’t like worms!” 
“Don’t like worms?” cried the biggest duck, and all 
the little ones came crowding up at once to see this strange 
person who didn’t like worms. 
“Your head is too big,” said one of the younger ducks, 
after watching him for a moment attentively. 
“Come out here,” called another, “and we'll show you 
how to do it properly!” 
“I don’t need showing,” said Bulka. 
“Well, I call that a silly performance!” remarked the 
big duck after a while, and shaking her feathers she swam 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  Bulka Gets into Trouble 51. 
off to look for frogs across the stream. But the younger 
ones all stayed round, watching. 
“Come out into the water!” they cried. And the small- 
est and most impudent duckling of all called out suddenly: 
“T believe he’s afraid!” 
‘I’m not afraid!” returned Bulka, very red in the face, 
but still going on with his somersaults. 
“If you aren’t afraid why don’t you come out?” asked 
the ducks. “Coward!” 
This was more than Bulka could stand. He couldn’t 
endure being called a coward, so he took a flying jump then 
and there and landed right in the water where the ducks 
were paddling about. The water wasn’t deep, but it was 
quite cold, and tasted very slimy and muddy; a great deal 
of it went up Bulka’s nose and down his throat, for he 
had forgotten to keep his mouth shut when he jumped, 
and as soon as he poked his head above water to breathe 
one of the ducklings would catch him by his long ears and 
pull him under again. “Down you go!” they shouted. 
“Now stick your feet in the air!” 
It was a fine game for them, but poor Bulka, tangled 
up in the pondweed with his head under water, was very 
close to being drowned, and drowned he would surely have 
been had not Poor Cecco, who at that very moment was 
looking about for him on the bridge, heard one smothered 
squeal and poked his head hastily through the parapet. 
y2 “There’s Bulka in trouble again!” he exclaimed, and
-P-A-G-E-51
  52 Poor Cecco 
’ came galloping—clop—clop—down the little path to the 
stream. In a moment he was out among the ducks and 
had dragged Bulka away from them, not an instant too 
soon, and even then it was a hard tussle, for one of the 
ducklings had hold of Bulka firmly by the ear and wouldn’t 
let go. But Poor Cecco was a good swimmer, being. made 
of wood; he dealt blows about him right and left with 
his feet, and moreover it was no good trying to bite him, 
he was far too hard, and one of the ducks who did try 
it had toothache for a week after. So they let Bulka go, 
and Poor Cecco towed him back to shore and set him up 
in the sunshine to dry. He was covered with slime and 
pondweed, one ear had come unsewn in the tussle, and al- 
together he looked a miserable object, but he was glad 
enough to be back on dry land. And I’m ashamed to say 
that the first thing he did, when he had his breath back 
and had got rid of the water he swallowed, was to turn 
round and make a very rude and ugly face at the ducklings, 
who only laughed at him for his pains. 
While Bulka sat there drying off, and picking the pond- 
weed out of his ears, Poor Cecco set about looking for a 
boat. He wandered up and down the shore, and at last 
discovered a piece of plank big enough to hold the two 
of them safely, and with a hole at one end in which he 
stuck a branch of willow, with the green leaves still on 
it, for a mast. It looked quite elegant, and when he had 
dragged it down to the water and launched it there was a
-P-A-G-E-52
Bulka Gets into Trouble 53 
fine raft in which they could set out to explore the stream. 
The mast stood up bravely, the green leaves shaking in 
dhe breeze just like a real sail; Poor Cecco and Bulka 
took their places in the stern, and off they went, gliding 
easily through the water, To be sure there was no rudder, 
but Poor Cecco had already thought of that. He had a 
piece of shingle in his paws for an oar, and this he dipped 
first on one side and then on the other, and so managed 
to keep their vessel on its course. 
They could not make up their minds whether to go up- 
stream or down, but this was soon decided for them; there: 
was no choice but to follow the current, and this took them 
first of all under the bridge. They drifted past the ducks, 
who stopped scratching their heads with their toes to stare 
at them, very politely now they saw that Bulka was owner 
of a real ship and not to be taken liberties with any more. 
To be sure the most impudent duckling did swim after 
them, opening his bill, but Poor Cecco gave him a rap with 
the oar and very soon sent him about his business. 
It was quite dark under the bridge; green moss hung 
from the stones and water dripped down on them from 
the arched roof. It was like entering a long dark tunnel; 
all sorts of horrible things might be lurking there. No 
sooner had they left daylight than a terrible noise began. 
It was only a wagon rumbling over the bridge above them, 
but Bulka thought it was a real storm and began to get 
frightened. It shook and thundered as if the whole bridge 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
  54 Poor Cecco 
were going to tumble on their heads and little stones and 
lumps of earth splashed in the water about them. 
“We must turn back!” cried Bulka. But this they could 
not do; all Poor Cecco could manage was to keep as straight 
a course as possible in spite of the tumult, and very soon 
they shot out once more into the sunlight and open sky. 
Everything looked very dazzling after the twilight un- 
der the bridge; it was like coming out into a new world. _ 
Great dragonflies swooped to and fro, and there were red 
and white and yellow flowers blooming along the green 
meadow-banks. On one of the flat bronze leaves with 
turned-up edges like a tea-tray, that floated on the stream, 
a frog sat. He was banded green and yellow, with gold 
eyes, and as the boat drew near he gave a loud mournful 
cry and dived into the water. A spotted mud turtle lay 
sunning himself on a log; he did not move, but watched 
them with black unwinking eyes as they drifted past, his 
wrinkled neck half drawn within his shell and his horny 
toes outstretched. Cows were grazing in the meadows on 
either side, and a little white dog who was out chasing 
water-rats, ran beside the boat for a long time on the river- 
bank, barking. 
“Ah, if we only had some chocolate cake and peanut 
candy!” thought Bulka. 
But neither of them had thought to bring food, which is 
a great mistake on a voyage, for there were no shops along 
the river-bank, only grass and green rushes. 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
Bulka Gets into Trouble 55 
Still it was very pleasant drifting along, following the 
twists and turns of the stream. In some places the cur- 
rent ran very strongly, and Poor Cecco had to bend hard 
on the oar to keep the vessel from running ashore. Once 
they were caught in an eddy and very nearly upset. Cer- 
tainly one needed to be a good navigator. 
“We shall soon be on the other side of the world, at this 
rate,” thought Bulka, and he asked Poor Cecco: “Do all 
the rivers go to the same place?” 
“They all flow into the sea,” replied Poor Cecco, who 
had learned that much from an old geography-book. 
“Where does all the water come from?” asked Bulka. 
But that Poor Cecco did not know, so he changed the 
subject. “Let’s talk about roads instead,” he said. 
“Do rivers go faster or do roads go faster?’ Bulka 
wanted to know. 
Poor Cecco needed to think. “The roads go faster,” he 
said at last. “There is only one road and it goes all over 
the world and when it reaches the sea it has to turn round 
and come back again, and that makes it twice as long and 
so it has to go faster than the rivers to catch up.” 
“What happens,” said Bulka, “if they both get there 
the same time?” 
“Then they have to change places and start all over 
again.” 
“Td rather be the river,” said Bulka. He lay on his 
staring up at the sky with his round eyes. The sky

was very blue, with little white clouds racing across it 
like flocks of sheep. The water made a pleasant drowsy 
ripple against the boat, and Bulka began to get sleepy. 
His bath too had tired him out, and before he knew it 
he was snoring aloud. 
“That’s not such a bad idea either!” thought Poor Cecco. 
And he steered the boat into a little bay, right under the 
shade of some huge burdock leaves, and folded his legs 
under him and went to sleep beside Bulka on the deck. 
   
-P-A-G-E-56
Chapter VI 
THE STORM 
HEY must have slept quite a long time, for when 
they woke up it was nearly dusk. There was a 
storm coming on; big drops were already pattering 
on the burdock leaves, and it was one of these, tumbling 
straight on his nose, that roused Poor Cecco from slumber. 
He sat up, looked about him, and was just in time to 
push the boat further under shelter when the storm broke. 
It was raining now in good earnest. The wind blew 
strongly and black jagged clouds were racing across the 
sky. And at once the little rainpeople appeared every- 
where on the surface of the water, bobbing up and down 
and shouting. Bulka began to whimper and crept as close 
to Poor Cecco as he could. Soon the boat was rocking to 
and fro. The burdock leaves bent beneath the weight of 
moisture; little rivulets trickled down their broad stems. 
Before long the two friends were drenched through and 
through. 
They were so wet that the water ran out through their 
heels, and to make matters worse the stream itself, swollen 
with the rain, began to rise; great waves swept down it 
with a rushing sound, awful things were happening out 
57
-P-A-G-E-57
& 
  58 Poor Cecco 
there in the darkness and at any moment they felt the 
vessel might be torn from its moorings and carried away 
on the flood. 
“We must jump!” cried Poor Cecco, and seizing Bulka 
by the paw he leapt ashore. Only just in time, for at 
that very moment the raft began to sink beneath their 
feet and was lost. 
Bulka, who had never before been out in a storm at 
night, was afraid of the noise and darkness, and sobbed 
bitterly. To him it seemed that the whole world was 
sliding into the river, and they were about to perish mis- 
erably, in the wet and the cold. He lifted up his voice 
and wept, while Poor Cecco, still clutching his paw, 
dragged him up the bank to a place of safety. 
Here, pressed close against a decaying tree-stump, they 
waited shivering until the worst of the storm had abated. 
Somewhere they must seek warmth and shelter, but where? 
“You stay here,” said Poor Cecco, “while I go out and 
see what can be done.” 
But Bulka would not hear of this; he was far too fright- 
ened and miserable. So paw in paw the two ventured out 
together into the unknown darkness. 
The earth was sticky and muddy; it clung in lumps to 
their feet, and there were deep sloshy puddles everywhere. 
The weeds grew high above their heads, a dense forest. It 
was impossible to see one’s way. The rain was still falling 
steadily.
-P-A-G-E-58
The Storm 59 
Poor Cecco saw something shining in the darkness and 
ran towards it. ‘“There’s a light!” he cried. 
But it was only a tin can, battered, and shining in the 
wet. Near it lay an old boot. That was no help either, 
for it was soaked through and gaping at the toe. In any 
case there was not room for them both to creep inside. 
“If only there were a box,” thought Poor Cecco, “we 
could crawl into that and be sheltered till the morning.” 
But it is always the way with boxes, that however many 
there may be in the world one is never to be found when ? 
you most need it. 
There was nothing to do but keep on, but presently they 
found a path at least. It was not much of a path, but 
fairly plain to trace between the tall weeds, and it must 
surely lead somewhere, for that is what paths are for. And 
it did lead them presently, and after a very long time, to 
a tumbledown wooden fence. 
Poor Cecco stood and sniffed. 
“Tt smells like a house,” he said at last. “Yes, it cer- 
tainly smells like a house!” And he squeezed himself 
through the wooden palings and dragged Bulka after 
him. 
Here perhaps was the end of their troubles. A house 
it might be, but the question was, what sort of people lived 
in it, and that wasn’t easy to tell from the outside, espe- 
cially after dark. But while they stood there shivering, 
and wondering whether they should go to the door and 
   
-P-A-G-E-59
  60 Poor Cecco 
knock, there was a rustling among the bushes, and some 
one poked his nose out. 
Sure enough, of all unexpected things, it was the little 
’ black dog who took care of the blind man on the bridge! 
“Well, here’s a fine finish to your sight-seeing!” he ex- 
claimed. “Didn’t I tell you you’d do better to stay with 
me? It’s a good thing I was listening at the door, or you 
might have stayed here till morning. But my cottage is 
not far off, and there’s still a bit of fire to warm yourselves 
by!” 
“Do you live here?” cried Poor Cecco and Bulka both 
at once. 
“Indeed I don’t,” returned the little dog. “There’s a 
nasty old woman lives here, and she’d soon send you chas- 
ing with a broom if you go near her door after dusk! But 
follow me, and I'll take you where you'll be warm and 
dry.” 
So they squeezed through the palings again, the little 
black dog leading the way, and followed him—trot—trot 
—along the path, till he turned in by a clump of currant 
bushes, and there was the door of his cottage, with a fine 
beam of light shining out through the crack under- 
neath. 
The little dog barked twice, and the blind man let him 
in. To be sure he grumbled, but that was at the little 
black dog, because he had been obliged to open the door 
for him twice already that evening, and each time the
-P-A-G-E-60
The Storm 61 
rain beat in, and as he rightly explained, that sort of thing 
was bad for any one’s rheumatism. 
“He’s a rare grumbler,” said the little dog, “but don’t 
you mind him. He means nothing by it, and he’ll be asleep 
again in two minutes. And now make yourselves at 
home!” 
The blind man’s cottage had only one room, but it was 
warm and comfortable. The stove burned cheerfully, 
there was a bed in one corner where the blind man slept 
and another under the table for the little dog. On the floor 
stood a saucer of bread-and-milk, left over from the little 
dog’s own supper, which he said they might finish up and 
welcome; as for himself, he had all he wanted. 
While they were sitting round the stove, getting thor- 
oughly warm and dry, the old blind man took his fiddle 
down from the wall and began to play. It was wonderful 
how he drew the bow across the strings, and at once the 
music came out, capital tunes, one after another, that made 
one long to get up and dance. The little dog sat still, 
blinking; he had heard these tunes many times before and 
took no great stock in them, he said, one air was just like 
another to him. The blind man’s head nodded as he 
played, and his foot tapped on the boards. Presently 
Poor Cecco could stand it no longer. He jumped up, and 
seizing Bulka round the waist began to whirl him about 
the floor. It was a pity the little dog didn’t dance too. 
If Virginia May and Tubby had been there, what a won- 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
ee eee 
62 Poor Cecco 
derful time they would have had! It seemed too bad that 
they should miss this, when Tubby so dearly loved danc- 
ing, and the only music they could get at home was the 
broken musical-box, that would only play three notes and 
then stop. 
The blind man smiled; with his sightless eyes he was 
seeing again the old farmhouse kitchens in the country, 
where he had been such a fine dancer in his youth, and all 
the girls were proud to stand up beside him. But pres- 
ently his head drooped; his foot ceased to tap on the floor 
and he rose yawning and hung his fiddle up on the wall 
again. He was old and sleepy, and he wanted to smoke 
another pipe before he went to bed. 
And now there was a rap at the door, and the little dog 
pulled back the latch. It was Mrs. Greypuss, who lived 
next door but one. She had tucked her babies in bed and 
come across in the rain to learn what the festivity was 
about. 
“You're having a good time here,” she said. “I thought 
I'd step over a minute and join you, seeing the storm is 
nearly over!” 
So she sat down beside Bulka and Poor Cecco, who were 
still out of breath from dancing, and they chatted together 
while the fire died down in the stove and the old man 
nodded off to sleep, his pipe between his fingers; and pres- 
ently Mrs. Greypuss, who could never sit idle for long, 
took a needle and thread from the useful little pocket that

all cats wear in their ears, and sewed Bulka up where his 
stitches had come undone, so that he was all strong and 
ready for the morrow. 
“For who knows?” she said, ‘what further adventures 
you two are going to meet!” 
   
-P-A-G-E-63
      Chapter VII 
JENSINA 
EY had passed such a pleasant evening, once the 
storm was over, that it seemed a pity to say good- 
bye to the little dog again in the morning, and 
watch him trot off, leading his old man securely on a string, 
along the path to the town. He walked very jauntily, a 
few steps ahead of the blind man and a little faster, so 
that every now and then he had to pause and turn his 
head back, as if to say: “How slow you are this morning! 
We shall never get to the bridge and start business at 
this rate!” 
Poor Cecco and Bulka waited long enough to wave their 
paws at him at the bend of the road; then they turned 
their face towards the open field. But first they stopped 
to say good-morning to Mrs. Greypuss, who sat washing 
her face on the doorstep, with her three little kittens play- 
ing near her. The-old-woman-with-the-broom they did not 
see, but they were careful not to go too near her hovse, 
from which they could hear a great sound of sweeping and 
clattering of saucepans. 
The cottages where the little black dog and Mrs. Grey- 
puss and the-old-woman-with-the-broom lived stood on the 
64
-P-A-G-E-64
  Jensina 65 
edge of a big and very untidy field. The field was untidy 
because, being close to the road, and belonging to no one 
in particular, the dustmen had used it to dump all the ashes 
and tin cans and broken crockery that no one wanted to 
have about. But the weeds grew very tall and thick, to 
hide the untidiness that the dustmen made, and however 
fast the dustmen brought their loads of rubbish the weeds 
always managed to grow a little faster, so on the whole 
the field was not nearly as bad-looking as it might have 
been. 
And certainly all sorts of curious and useful things lay 
there, for any one who had time to look about—bits of 
old automobiles, and lamp-chimneys and oil-stoves, and 
cracked china plates with most beautiful patterns on them, 
and here and there a perfectly good boot or coffeepot— 
and all these things, having been thoroughly washed by 
the night’s rain, were displayed among the fresh green 
weeds like goods in a huge shop-window. Bulka in par- 
ticular, never having seen such attractive objects going 
to waste before, was continually wanting to stop and pick 
something up, and as the things he wanted were nearly 
all too big for him to carry, Poor Cecco had a hard time 
dragging him past them by the paw. And every moment 
Bulka kept exclaiming: “I’m sure Tubby would like that!” 
or, “‘Can’t we take this home to Gladys?” 
Presently, seated beside one of the largest ash-heaps, 
they met a little wooden doll. She was tidily dressed in 
.
-P-A-G-E-65
  66 Poor Cecco 
a check gingham apron, which she had made herself, with 
a pink mallow-blossom on her head, and was so pleased 
to see visitors that she jumped up at once when she saw 
them coming and clapped her hands. 
Her name, she told them, was Jensina, and she had 
been living alone on this ash-heap for weeks and weeks 
and weeks. She was an industrious little person, one could 
see at once, and had not wasted her time, for when she 
led them presently round the side of the ash-heap there 
stood a cosy little house which she had built herself, out 
of an old soap-box, and of which she had every reason to 
be proud. She had spread a bit of carpet on the floor and 
made a sofa to sleep on, and pillows stuffed with thistle- 
down, and she had hung the walls with scraps of wall- 
paper and fine pictures of tomatoes and peach-orchards, 
saved from old fruit cans. She had even a little kitchen, 
with plates and egg-cups and a real coffeepot, and all these 
things she had gathered one by one on the dump-heaps 
and brought home. Only the coffeepot, being too large, 
had to stand outside, but it looked very well there, and 
gave an air of hospitality to the place. 
While they sat on the sofa at her invitation, and break- 
fasted on some canned salmon and graham cracker which 
she had very luckily brought home just before the storm 
yesterday, the wooden doll told them her story. 
“From the earliest time I can remember,” she said, “I 
lived with a family of travelling gypsies. They were
-P-A-G-E-66
Jensina 67 
kindly, hard-working people, and I spent very happy days 
in their company. By day we travelled the roads in a 
cart drawn by an old white horse, and while the women 
and children worked at making brooms and baskets which 
they sold by the way, the men did odd jobs of tinkering, 
mending saucepans and pails for the farmers’ wives at 
different houses where we stopped, and in that way I saw 
a great deal of the country, besides learning much gypsy 
lore, and picking up several trades that are useful to know. 
At night, when the horse was taken from the wagon and 
turned out to graze, supper was cooked at an open fire by 
the roadside, and after that the family would gather round 
and sing songs and tell old stories, and though there might 
be little to eat every one was gay and happy. 
“In winter, when the cold weather set in, they joined a 
circus in one of the small towns, and found employment 
there, till the summer came round once more. I had won- 
derful dresses in those days, for my gypsy child would sew 
them out of scraps of silk and lace from the circus-riders’ 
costumes, that the old wardrobe women gave her to play 
with. It was a fine life with the circus, but I liked still 
better the rides in the old wagon under the open sky, and 
the evenings round the fire at night. 
“Yes, I was happy with my gypsies, and I should be 
with them now had not an accident happened. 
“One day the little girl left me lying too near the step 
of the wagon, and when the horse started I was presently 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
68 Poor Cecco 
jolted out and dropped by the roadside. Though I called 
for help no one heard me. There I lay till a workman, 
passing by, picked me up and took me home to his children. 
“They were kind children enough, but not so kind as 
my gypsy child; they could never love me so well, for they 
had other dolls of their own, and presently they gave me 
away. So I passed from hand to hand, each time faring 
a little worse, until the last family with whom I lived 
changed house. They did not trouble to take me with 
them, so I was thrown out here, with the rest of the house- 
hold rubbish, on the ash-heap. 
“Still, I don’t complain, for I am used to freedom and 
independence; all that I learned with the gypsies has stood 
me in good stead, and as you see I have not wasted my 
time.” 
“Indeed,” said Poor Cecco, looking about him, “you have 
made a very comfortable house here.” 
The wooden doll smiled, for to tell the truth she felt 
not a little proud of her house, and was glad of some one 
to show it off to. 
“Tt isn’t so bad,” she agreed, “and I must say there is 
always a living to be picked up in a place like this, espe- 
cially by one who has been taught to use his wits. I 
even thought of starting a store here, if only there were 
some customers. No, the only thing I have against it is 
the loneliness. Just think, you are the only visitors I 
have received in all this time, unless you may count the

‘SW NDEED,” said Poor Cecco, looking about him, “you 
have made a very comfortable house here!” 
Jensina smiled, for to tell the truth she felt not a little 
proud of her house, and was glad of some one to show it 
off to.

rats, who are really of another class—neighbourly, but 
rowdy in their habits and by no means to be trusted. In 
fact, they think nothing of dropping in here and helping 
themselves to whatever they choose, claiming that every- 
thing in the field belongs to them. I have thought many 
times of moving, if only for the sake of change. Besides, 
I come of a gypsy family, and that always makes it hard 
to stay in one place.” 
“Why don’t you join us?’ asked Poor Cecco. “We are 
out to see the world, and it would be pleasant to have an- 
other companion.” 
And Bulka, who all this while had been silent, licking 
the last of the canned salmon from his paws, said at once: 
“Yes, do!” 
Jensina agreed—she was really tired of living alone on 
the ash-heap—and being a person of action, at once set 
about packing up, with the help of Poor Cecco, those be- 
longings which she especially treasured. These were a 
green glass scent bottle stopper, the half of a broken silver 
brooch, the top of a catsup bottle which made an excellent 
drinking-cup and one other small object wrapped in silver- 
paper, which she would not show him. “For this,” as she 
said, “this is a secret which I dare not tell, even to you!” 
To these Poor Cecco added his four pennies, and then, 
taking off her frock for greater freedom in walking, Jen- 
sina tied the things up in it, making a neat bundle which 
Poor Cecco willingly offered to carry.  
-P-A-G-E-73
  72 Poor Cecco 
Meantime, Bulka, who could not resist poking about the 
ash-heap, had found a damaged string of blue beads, 
brought to light by the heavy rain, which would make a 
marvellous present for Tubby. They were almost em- 
bedded in the earth; he seized one end of the string and 
was just giving it a strong tug when a great grey rat poked 
his head from among the weeds. 
The rat, who looked very savage, began to twitch his 
nose and show his teeth, but Bulka clung to the beads 
manfully, although he was more than a little frightened. 
The rat came forward, sniffing the air, his whiskers twin- 
kling, stretching out his body and leaving his hind feet 
behind him as long as possible, in the way rats do when 
they feel uncertain. Suddenly the string of beads came 
loose from the mud; Bulka fell back, uttering a loud howl, 
and at that very instant the rat opened his mouth to bite. 
In the flash of an eye, it seemed, there were rats all about 
him—grey rats, brown rats, black rats—all with long yel- 
low teeth and snakelike tails. 
Bulka, clutching his beads, set up a shriek for help, and 
immediately Poor Cecco and Jensina came scrambling over 
the crest of the ash-heap. 
When she saw the rats Jensina for a second turned pale. 
“See,” she exclaimed, “they are blocking our way! 
They have been listening, they know that I am going to 
leave them and now they are sorry! Bark, Poor Cecco, 
$2 bark! It is our only chance!
-P-A-G-E-74
  Jensina 73 
And while Poor Cecco charged down the ash-heap, bark- 
ing as he had never barked before, Jensina snatched pieces 
of cinder and crockery from the ground and flung them 
at the rats with all her strength—so desperately that she 
very nearly threw herself after them. 
Even then the rats would not give way, until Jensina, 
seeing the fight was unequal, said: “Well, there is only 
one thing to be done. We must take our chance!” And 
raising herself on tiptoe and waving her arms, she called 
out several words in rat language, which she had learned 
during her stay in the field. 
The effect was instantaneous. The rats, with looks of 
amazement, horror and alarm, turned at once and rushed 
off through the weeds. In a second there was not one left 
in sight! 
The battle was over, but the friends were in sore plight. 
Bulka had been bitten twice, Poor Cecco was hoarse from 
barking, and Jensina had slipped on the ash-heap and 
rolled from top to bottom, grazing herself severely. 
“Horrid mean things!” she cried, rubbing her knees and 
picking up her bundle, which had come undone in the 
skirmish. “They think they own everything here, and that 
no one has any rights but them. I’m glad I am going with 
you, for now nothing would induce me to stay here any 
longer!” 
“At least,” said Poor Cecco, “they have gone now, so 
we have nothing to fear.”  
-P-A-G-E-75
  74 Poor Cecco 
“They have gone for the moment,” Jensina said, “but 
we must make haste, for I fear there is very little time to 
lose, and I shall be much mistaken if we have seen the 
last of them!” 
Sawdust was oozing from Bulka’s wound, but for once 
he didn’t mind; he had the blue beads for Tubby and that 
was all he could think about for the moment. Jensina 
bound a dock-leaf over the bite, declaring that this was 
the best cure for injuries, and then, tightly holding paws, 
they made their escape as fast as they could over the ash- 
heap, not feeling really safe until they had reached the 
edge of the road. | 
   
-P-A-G-E-76
Chapter VIII 
THE PURSUIT 
OOR CECCO wanted to take to the open country, 
P but Jensina was all for the road. She was used to 
roads, she said, and felt at home on them. 
“Are you afraid we can’t defend you?’ Poor Cecco 
asked. ; 
“It isn’t so much that,” said Jensina, pausing to brush 
the dust off her shoes, which, being painted directly on 
her feet, were extremely comfortable for walking. “Tt 
-isn’t so much ¢haf, as that there’s more life going on along 
the road. It seems years since I saw a wagon or an auto- 
mobile, and if we are going to bury ourselves in the wil- 
derness again I might as well have stayed on my ash-heap, 
where at least there was comfort!” 
It was plain that the incident of the rats had upset her 
more than she would admit. So the others took no notice 
of her snippiness, but walked along on either side of her, 
affecting to admire the scenery. 
There was very little passing certainly on this road. It 
was wide and bare and empty, and extremely hot, the sun 
by now being high above them, and not a cloud in the sky. 
Even the weeds along the roadside hung their heads. But 
75
-P-A-G-E-77
    76 Poor Cecc ) 
along the edge of the road, down in the ditch, ran a trickle 
of water. Not enough to launch a boat on, but there was 
plenty to cool their feet, and very soon Poor Cecco and 
Bulka had hopped down and were walking along in it, 
splashing merrily. It looked so cool that Jensina had to 
follow their example. Besides, as Poor Cecco said, in this 
way the rats would be unable to trace their footsteps. 
Jensina, like many another young lady, recovered her 
spirits as soon as she felt she was getting her own way; she 
sang snatches of songs and dances, and was altogether a 
most cheerful companion. Once in a while, on the road 
above them, an automobile passed with a noise like thun- 
der and the blowing of trumpets, and whenever this hap- 
pened Jensina scrambled hastily up the side of the ditch, 
her legs working like a pair of compasses, but she was al- 
ways too late to see anything but a vanishing cloud of dust. 
“T shall walk on the edge of the road!” she called finally. 
“It is smoother up here, and one sees far more!”’ 
So she walked along, tilting on her toes and turning 
her head from side to side as she went. But suddenly she 
came sliding in a great hurry down the side of the ditch 
again, very pale, her fingers on her lips. 
“Sh-sh!” she whispered. “The rats are following us! I 
knew they would!” 
“Where?” cried Poor Cecco. “Show me!” 
Stealthily they all three climbed up the bank and peeped 
through the grasses. There, sure enough, coming at a
-P-A-G-E-78
  The Pursuit 77 
steady pace along the road behind them, were two enor- 
mous rats. Even at that distance one could see their 
whiskers twitching and their eyes peering from side to side. 
At sight of them Bulka’s bites, which he had nearly for- 
gotten about, began to smart again. 
“We'll keep quite still,” said Poor Cecco, “and perhaps 
they will pass by and not see us.” 
So they lay down, as flat as they could, among the 
grasses, scarcely daring to breathe. But the rats must have 
known they were there. For as soon as they came within 
a few feet of where the three friends were in hiding they 
stopped short, puffing and blowing, and sat down in the 
road to consult. 
“It’s no use,” said Jensina, “they must certainly have 
seen us. They are policemen rats.” 
They were very fat rats, and elderly. They were hot 
and tired from coming so far along the dusty road. One 
of them, who was in quite a perspiration, began at once 
to mop his face and brush his whiskers, grumbling as he 
did so, and staring about him. 
Jensina was watching them intently. 
“I can’t hear what they are saying,” she whispered, “but 
at any rate they are not going to attack us now. The best 
thing is to go straight on, and pretend to take no notice 
of them.” And so saying, she rose to her feet, and hum- 
ming a little tune, began to walk away. Bulka and Poor 
Cecco followed, looking back over their shoulders.
-P-A-G-E-79
  78 Poor Cecco 
The two rats waited a little while. Then they too stood 
up, shook themselves, and resumed their steady trot. 
“This is very mysterious,” said Poor Cecco to Bulka, 
“and I begin to think that Jensina knows rather more about 
it than she is willing to tell us!” 
Seeing, however, that the rats made no effort to over- 
take them, but just trotted steadily along in the rear, he 
began to take courage. 
“After all,” he said, “we are three and they are only 
two. Let us put a good face on the matter, and be- 
fore nightfall we may yet manage to give them the 
slip.” 
So they kept on their way, chatting together, and affect- 
ing to pay no attention to the rats, who followed at a 
little distance behind them—pad—pad—twitching their 
whiskers and looking neither to right nor left. 
“At noon they sat down to rest in the shade of a lofty 
burdock, making a meal off some wild strawberries which 
Jensina discovered by the roadside. Not far from them 
the two rats also waited, panting, and not ill-pleased at 
the opportunity to rest once more and mop their foreheads. 
They, however, having no strawberries, could only sit and 
suck their paws. 
“They will soon get tired of this,” Poor Cecco said. 
But the rats showed no sign of giving up the chase. All 
that afternoon they followed on their track, and when twi- 
light fell, and Jensina glanced over her shoulder, it was.
-P-A-G-E-80
  The Pursuit 79 
only to see four green glowing eyes in the distance, fol- 
lowing like points of fire through the dusk. 
The three friends called a halt to decide what should 
be done. 
“We can’t spend the night on the road,” said Jensina. 
“At least,” she added, “not without a campfire.” For her 
gypsy instincts were still quite strong. 
The chance of making a campfire, with no matches, 
seemed very slight, but in this they were luckier than they 
expected, for Poor Cecco, who had been sniffing the air 
eagerly, suddenly exclaimed: “I smell burning!” 
Sure enough, on following him a short distance up the 
road they found, on a bare space of ground set about with 
juniper bushes, the remains of a fire which some passing 
tramp had lighted not long ago. The ashes were still 
warm, and by blowing on these Jensina, who understood 
such matters, soon had a nice little blaze started, while 
Poor Cecco and Bulka gathered twigs and straws for fresh 
fuel. 
It was cheerful to gather round the fire and see the red 
sparks flying up into the air, and the smoke curling away 
overhead. The only trouble was, they had nothing to cook 
by it, and now that darkness had fallen no one felt brave 
enough to venture out of the circle of firelight to look for 
food. In fact, though they talked loudly to keep up their 
courage, they were all three very nervous, and at each 
sound of a crackling twig, or the rustle of grass in the

distance, they looked at one another and drew closer to 
the blaze. 
But presently their fire began to die down. Suddenly 
it gave a last little flicker, and went out. Now indeed they 
were in bad plight! 
“This is getting beyond a joke!” said Poor Cecco. “I 
must study the situation!” 
And he went and lay down by himself at a little dis- 
tance, with his nose on his paws, thinking. 
Jensina and Bulka sat in the long grasses and shivered. 
Bulka thought of Tubby and the toy-cupboard, and he be- 
gan to feel very homesick. Big tears rolled down his nose, 
but he licked them up bravely as fast as they fell, so that 
Jensina should not see he was crying. The tears came 
so fast that he had to lick hard to keep up with them, and 
after a while this occupation in itself proved so exciting 
that he very nearly forgot his troubles, and when Poor 
Cecco returned he had just succeeded in catching the last 
tear of all on the tip of his red flannel tongue, while Jen- 
sina sat with her legs stretched straight out before her and 
her precious bundle on her lap. 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  Chapter 1X 
YOU ARE NOT INVITED 
“ce E must make dummies of grass,”’ Poor Cecco said, 
“and set them up, so that the rats will think 
they are us, and then we can escape before they 
find out that they have been tricked!” 
“They aren’t so stupid as all that!” returned Jensina, 
who was both tired and cross. 
“Very well,” said Poor Cecco, “if you can think of some- 
thing better perhaps you'll say so. I’m not anxious to stay 
here all night!” 
At that very instant an automobile, coming along the 
road, slowed down just by the spot where the three friends 
were seated. The driver got out and went forward to 
attend to his engine, and in the moment that his back was 
turned Poor Cecco made a hasty sign to Bulka and Jen- 
sina. Hopping forward, they were just in time to scram- 
ble on to the running-board before the driver returned to 
his seat and the car started on. 
“Where are we going?” said Bulka. 
“It doesn’t matter where we go,” Poor Cecco replied, 
“so long as we get away from the rats, and they certainly 
can’t follow us now.” 
81
-P-A-G-E-83
82 Poor Cecco 
“All right!” said Bulka. And being very drowsy, and 
tired out with the excitement of the day, he at once shut 
his eyes and went to sleep. 
When he awoke the car had stopped again, and Poor 
Cecco and Jensina, one on each side, were shaking him 
violently to make him open his eyes. 
“Oh, I thought it was morning!” said Bulka, as soon as 
he could speak. “Where are we? What are we going 
to do now?” 
“Sh-sh!” said Poor Cecco. “Keep very quiet and follow 
us!” 
Carrying the bundle, and giving a paw to Jensina, who 
was stiff and cramped from sitting so long on the running- 
board, he led them across the road and under a gate into 
an open field. 
“I don’t see,” said Jensina, staring about her, “why you 
brought us here!” 
Poor Cecco had no answer to make, for he did not know 
himself. The field was immense and mountainous and 
very lonely, lit by a slender moon rising above the hilltop. 
There were great mounds here and there, and twisted 
bushes that stood out black in the moonlight, like crouch- 
ing beasts. Everything looked strange and rather terrible, 
so that even Poor Cecco’s courage began to fail him a little, 
and he wondered whether after all it wouldn’t be better 
to go back to the road. But here they were, and they must 
make the best of it, come what might. And while they 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
     You Are Not Invited 83 
were still looking about them, wondering which way to 
go, there was a great whirring of wings, and something 
dark and huge swept down on them from the sky, striking 
at Bulka and rolling him over and over on the ground. 
Terror seized them; Jensina gave a shriek, but before 
Poor Cecco could spring to the rescue Bulka had picked 
himself up again, and there on the grass before them stood 
an enormous owl, rolling his eyes and looking exactly like 
a sulky cat. 
“How dare you!” cried Poor Cecco. 
“How dare I?” exclaimed the owl. “How about him? 
‘What business has any one to go about looking like a 
rabbit? I couldn’t tell! And besides, I didn’t hurt him.” 
“You did!’ squealed Bulka, finding his voice again after 
the fright. “You p-pinched me!” 
“Cry baby!” said the owl, contemptuously. He rolled 
his green eyes at them. “What are you doing in this field? 
You aren’t real rabbits, any of you! Let me tell you at 
once, that if you think you can come here under false 
pretences, and put other people out of business, you’re 
mistaken! I’m the Field-Marshal. I won’t stand any non- 
sense!” 
“We are travellers,” said Jensina shrilly, thrusting her- 
self forward. “We came by automobile, and we have just _ 
as much right to be here as you. We are looking for a 
place to spend the night.” 
“Spend it or keep it,” returned the owl. “It’s all one     
  
-P-A-G-E-85
  84 Poor Cecco 
tome. You can suit yourselves. But as for that person” 
—pointing with his claw at Bulka—“he’d better wear a 
label if he doesn’t want to get into trouble again.” 
’? declared Jensina, as the owl 
flapped heavily away across the field. “I can’t stand owls; 
they are all the same. Look!” she exclaimed, pointing 
across the pasture. “Something is going on over there!” 
Something certainly was going on. One of the many 
hummocks in the field was hung about with twinkling 
lights, green and pale and golden, and as they drew near 
they could see that these were countless glowworm lan- 
terns, hung artfully from the grass blades. The effect was 
both elegant and festive; the whole hummock was a blaze 
of coloured light, and beside the doorway stood a placard 
with the words: “Tnsufferable creature! 
GRAND FRATERNITY BALL 
Second Order of Moles 
YOU ARE INVITED 
  “A ball! We must go to this!” cried Jensina, who had 
lived so long in retirement that the mere prospect of a 
party made her forget all her weariness. “I adore danc- 
ing, but if it is a formal affair I suppose I had better put 
on my frock!” 
And snatching the tiaitidle from Poor Cecco she hastily 
unrolled it to get out her dress. She was so anxious to get 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  You Are Not Invited 85 
to the party that she could not even wait to have the frock 
fastened, but began hopping towards the doorway with 
one arm thrust through the wrong sleeve hole. “Let us 
in!” she cried, and pounded on the door with her fist. “Let 
us in! We want to dance!” 
The door swung open, and a mole, dressed in black 
velvet, stood on the threshold. He was plainly one of 
the ushers, for he wore a white flower in his buttonhole 
and pink kid gloves. 
“What do you want?” he asked. 
“We want to dance,” said Jensina, still struggling with 
her frock, which being hindside before, refused to go over 
her head. 
“Have you an invitation?’ asked the mole. 
“Certainly we are invited,” returned Poor Cecco, and 
he pointed to the placard. 
“Ah!” said the mole. Stepping outside, he turned the 
placard round so as to show the other side. It now read, 
in large clear letters: 
YOU ARE NOT INVITED 
  And without so much as a further glance at them he 
went back into the molehill and slammed the door. 
“Mean hateful thing!” exclaimed Jensina, ready to cry
-P-A-G-E-87
  86 Poor Cecco 
with disappointment. ‘Who wants to go to their old ball 
anyhow!” And pulling off her frock again she flung it 
away and sat down hard on the grass, looking very proud 
and sniffly. 
“Never mind,” said Poor Cecco. “I don’t suppose it’s 
much of a dance after all! When we get home, Jensina, 
we'll have a great ball and only invite whom we want, 
and there’ll be lemonade and a cake with icing, and you 
shall dance all night long!” 
But Jensina was not to be comforted so easily; her pride 
had been hurt, and moreover she could still hear faintly, 
through the closed door of the molehill, the scraping of 
fiddles and the shuffling of feet. So she continued to sit 
there, sulking on the grass, and to judge by her expression 
it was far wiser to leave her alone. 
As for Bulka, he was dropping with sleep, so Poor; Cecco 
propped him up against Jensina, with the bundle beside 
them, and set off alone to search for a night’s lodging. 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
Chapter X 
THE WOODCHUCKS 
ANDERING up the hillside, looking here and 
there, Poor Cecco presently came upon what 
seemed a very nice cave, warm and dry, and just 
big enough for the three of them, hollowed out at the foot 
of a tall rock. Here was luck certainly! 
Poor Cecco had always had a passion for caves, and 
this was quite the best cave lie had ever seen, and exactly 
the right size, whereas caves as a rule are apt to be either 
too big for cosiness, or else too small to get into, either 
of which is a serious fault. The sight of this one, he 
thought, would surely cheer even Jensina up, but as long 
as Bulka was already asleep, and Jensina probably 
wouldn’t come out of her sulks for another half hour at 
least, he might as well spend that time in making it still 
more comfortable. So he went out and began to hunt 
around in the moonlight for bits of moss and dry grass, 
enough to make a comfortable bed for all three. 
It took quite a little while before he had collected all 
he needed and sorted it out into heaps, the softest for 
Jensina, the next best for Bulka, and the hard bits and 
odds and ends for himself, as he could sleep on anything. 
87  
-P-A-G-E-89
  88 Poor Cecco 
When he had got it all together and carried it into the 
cave, it made such a pile that the cave itself seemed to 
look smaller, and Poor Cecco decided he might as well 
make a good job while he was about it, and hollow out 
the end a little more so as to have plenty of room to 
sleep in. 
While he was scooping busily away with his paws, sing- 
ing to himself and thinking how nice it would all be when 
it was finished, all at once he felt a torrent of loose earth 
raining down on his head; the wall of the cave on which 
he was working gave way at the same instant, and he fell 
headlong through. 
When he picked himself up, covered with dust and dirt, 
Poor Cecco found to his surprise that he was in a large 
and comfortable kitchen. A fat elderly woodchuck, with 
bushy white whiskers, sat smoking in a corner; his wife, 
with an apron tied round her enormous waist, was prepar- 
ing supper at the table, and from a bed in the corner three 
small woodchucks, equally fat, poked their heads out, each 
with a white nightcap on, to see what had happened. All 
five stared at Poor Cecco in astonishment and some indig- 
nation, for it is certainly not usual for a total stranger to 
drop in on one suddenly through the kitchen ceiling at 
supper time, especially when he brings half the ceiling with 
him, as Poor Cecco had unfortunately done. 
The old woodchuck took his pipe from his mouth and 
stared from the hole in the ceiling to Poor Cecco, and back
-P-A-G-E-90
  The W oodchucks 89 
at the ceiling again, unable to say a word, while his whis- 
kers bristled more and more, his eyes grew rounder and 
rounder, and his whole body swelled up as if he were going 
to burst. 
At last he recovered sufficiently to say, in a very angry 
voice: 
“Wipe your feet when you come in at the door!” 
This seemed to Poor Cecco unnecessary, considering he 
had come by the roof, but as he felt himself to be in the 
wrong, in any case, he began at once to excuse himself for 
_ his entrance. 
“Rubbish!” said the woodchuck. “No sensible person 
keeps their front door in the ceiling! When you don’t see 
what you want, ask for it, and don’t go blundering about 
like that!” 
Mrs. Woodchuck, who had said nothing all this while, 
but after one glance went on calmly slicing vegetables, 
now addressed her husband without looking up. 
“It’s all your own shiftlessness!” she said. “Didn’t I 
tell you a dozen times, if P’ve told you once, that if you 
wouldn’t hike yourself up there and do something to that 
roof before the bad weather set in anything was liable to 
beat in on us? But there you set, and if the house itself 
fell in you wouldn’t lift a finger except to blame some one 
else. Don’t talk to me about it!” 
Mr. Woodchuck, at this, seemed to sink down in his 
chair. He cast a timid glance at his wife, and hastily
-P-A-G-E-91
  90 Poor Cecco 
putting the pipe back in his mouth began to smoke again 
in great puffs. Mrs. Woodchuck, who had now finished 
slicing her last carrot, swept all the vegetables into a 
yellow bowl which she set down on the table with a slam, 
before turning to Poor Cecco. 
“Sit down, young man,” she said, “if you can find a 
place, and let me tell you at once we never subscribe to 
anything. I have no aches nor pains in my back, and we 
all bought new toothbrushes last week.” 
“I didn’t come to sell anything,” said Poor Cecco, rather 
bewildered. “I dropped in quite by accident!’ And he 
began to explain to Mrs. Woodchuck, who seemed the more 
sensible of the two, how he came to be in the cave, 
and about Jensina and Bulka, whom he had left behind 
in the field. : 
“Then in that case,” said Mrs. Woodchuck briskly, “the 
best thing you can do is to fetch your two friends and 
spend the night here, if the young lady isn’t too particular. 
We are simple folk and you must take us as you find us. 
We get along somehow. Luckily the farmer is keeping a 
better garden this year, and my old man gets a job when 
he can, but the lumber trade has been slack lately. The 
last few months I’ve had to take in washing to help out; 
to tell the truth the whole house is full up with it now 
and that’s why we’ve so little room. We've even had to_ 
move the beds into the kitchen, as you can see for yourself; 
I was thinking only to-day, I don’t see how I can possibly

Y tea-time Jensina had washed one hundred and thir- 
teen bundles of laundry, which was certainly, she 
thought, some help to her hostess, Mrs. Woodchuck. .. .

  The Woodchucks 93 
take in any more, do what I will, there’s no space left for 
it anywhere!” 
Looking about him, Poor Cecco saw that every corner 
of the room was piled with bundles of laundry, each tied 
up just as it had come from the owner; in fact there was 
very little space left anywhere, and he thought at once 
that Mrs. Woodchuck would do better, instead of taking 
so much washing in, to send some of it out again, and 
he told her so. 
“I know!” said Mrs. Woodchuck, untying her apron and 
rolling it into a ball which she flung under the table. “T 
know—I’ve thought so myself at times, but what can I 
do? There’s so much to look after in this house that I 
never get a minute, and besides—I hate washing. I was 
never brought up to it! And now,” she continued, “you 
had better go and fetch your friends and we'll have a little 
supper.” 
Mr. Woodchuck led Poor Cecco to the real doorway, 
down a passage so stacked with washing on either side that 
the woodchuck, being extremely fat, had great difficulty 
in squeezing past. “You see how it is,” he whispered 
hoarsely, pointing with his pipe. “We're being pushed 
out of house and home, and to hear the old woman talk 
you'd think no one did a hand’s turn but herself!” 
Poor Cecco ran down the hill, glad to be in the open air 
again. The ball was over; the lights were turned out, the 
placard taken in, and the door of the molehill shut fast.
-P-A-G-E-97
  94 Poor Cecco 
Jensina and Bulka were both sound asleep, leaning on 
each other’s shoulders; he had some difficulty in rousing 
them. Bulka in fact scarcely woke at all. He stumbled 
drowsily up the hill, dragging the string of beads to which 
he had clung through all his adventures, and when they 
reached the house Poor Cecco pushed him in at once, head 
first, among the baby woodchucks, who had pulled the quilt 
over their heads and were snoring soundly. 
Jensina, however, aroused when she found herself in 
the kitchen, and became quite lively. She gossiped with 
Mrs. Woodchuck, set the table, washed the dishes and 
brushed off the crumbs, and altogether made herself most 
agreeable. And then, weariness overcoming her suddenly, 
she stretched out on the floor and was immediately fast 
asleep. 
Poor Cecco, who was in no mind to give up the beauti- 
ful cave he had taken so much trouble over, went up and 
spent the night there alone. 
He was awakened by the smell of coffee, and the voices 
of Jensina and Mrs. Woodchuck, who were conversing in 
the kitchen below him, Mrs. Woodchuck saying: “For my 
part I like my coffee strong, and as for my husband, he 
will touch nothing but the very best acorns!” 
“That sounds like breakfast!” thought Poor Cecco, and 
he rose, stretched himself, and trotted round to the front 
door. 
Jensina, who was a born housewife, had been at work
-P-A-G-E-98
The Woodchucks 95 
early. The kitchen was swept, the beds made, and coffee 
steaming on the table. Mrs. Woodchuck had dressed the 
children, and being shortsighted, insisted on buttoning 
Bulka into the velvet jacket belonging to Ferdinand, the 
youngest woodchuck, who thereupon burst into loud howls, 
but the mistake was soon remedied. 
After breakfast they were prepared to start on their 
way, but Mrs. Woodchuck, who was a most hospitable soul, 
would not hear of this. She had arranged, she said, to 
invite a few neighbours in that evening to make a little 
party for Jensina, and it would be too bad to disappoint 
them. 
In return for her kindness Jensina immediately offered 
to lend a hand with the washing while Mrs. Woodchuck 
made her preparations for the party. So she set off for 
the spring, a bundle under each arm, leaving Poor Cecco 
and Bulka to bring as many more as they could carry, for, 
she said, one might as well make a good job of it. 
The spring was a little distance below the house, in a 
hollow set about with tall shady grasses. All that Bulka 
and Poor Cecco need do, therefore, was to stand at the 
top of the hill and roll the bundles down to her as fast as 
she needed them, which they did while Jensina spent her 
‘day kneeling at the edge of the spring, splashing merrily 
about and very contented. By tea time she had washed one 
hundred and thirteen bundles of laundry, which was cer- 
tainly, she thought, some little help to her hostess, and as

all the water in the spring was now used up it was as well 
to stop. 
So having hung her laundry neatly out to dry on the 
grasses, she smoothed her hair, dried her hands on a mullein 
leaf, and went back to the house to await the party. 
   
-P-A-G-E-100
       Chapter XI 
JENSINA’S PARTY 
E first to arrive were Mr. and Mrs. Weasel, and 
their friends the Chipmunks. Old Ezra Bunny 
came next with his family, and then the High- 
Hangers, who wore red waistcoats and were rather su- 
perior, Mrs. Fieldmouse, and the Opossums, who were new 
to the neighbourhood. They had just taken a house in 
the woodlot across the hill and were anxious to be thought 
well of, though many considered them humbugs. Then 
came Auntie Skunk and Uncle Billie Skunk and their four 
children, and by this time the kitchen was quite full. 
Thanks to Jensina’s industry most of the laundry bundles 
had disappeared, except a few which, arranged to look 
like sofas and chairs, did very well for the company to 
sit upon. Mrs. Woodchuck’s guests tried to appear po- 
litely unaware of the real nature of the furniture beneath 
them; only Mrs. Weasel, seeing a fragment of brown cal- 
ico peeping out, was heard to remark impulsively: 
“There’s my petticoat I’ve missed for three months! I 
do wish she’d send the things back if she’s ever go- 
ing to!” 
Acorn coffee was served, with nuts and carrot sand-

wiches, and then the babies of the party were all put to 
bed, not without some trouble, in an adjoining closet, and 
while the old folks settled themselves in a corner the danc- 
ing began. 
Uncle Billie Skunk played the fiddle, and old Ezra 
Bunny the concertina. Old Ezra wore a white shirtfront 
and a brown coat, rather untidy in the seams, and he had 
long yellow teeth that showed whenever he smiled. He 
had played for so many kitchen dances that he could call 
out the figures with his eyes shut. He waved the concer- 
tina over his head and stamped with his foot whenever it 
was time for the music to change. 
“First couples forward!” he called out. “Ladies in the 
middle! Swing your partners!” And while he stamped 
and shouted Uncle Billie Skunk, all in black, looked very 
solemn as he bent over his fiddle, but was really winking 
at the dancers all the time. 
“It’s a lovely party!” Jensina whispered to Poor Cecco 
as they whirled round the floor. “I’m so glad we stayed!” 
Jensina, in her gingham frock, and wearing the blue   beads which Bulka had lent her for the evening, was very 
much admired and enjoyed herself thoroughly. It quite 
‘made up, in fact, for her disappointment of the night be- 
fore. Among these simple people she found herself quite 
at ease, and behaved accordingly. She danced gypsy 
dances, sang songs and told fortunes, and in the intervals 
of the music had always a little group about her. Indeed,
-P-A-G-E-102
Jensina’s Party 99 
it was whispered before the evening was over that the 
eldest High-Hanger would have proposed marriage to her, 
had he not been already engaged to a distant cousin on 
the Woodpecker branch of the family. 
Bulka was also having a delightful time. He had made 
friends with the young Chipmunks, and they were enjoy- 
ing a dance of their own at the farther end of the kitchen. 
Not knowing the steps, they held hands in a ring while 
each capered as he chose in time to the music. Presently, 
Bulka, losing his shyness, grew excited. He pushed his. 
companions aside, and having cleared a space all to him- 
self on the floor, began to turn somersaults and stand on. 
his head. 
Poor Cecco attended to every one, showed new steps t¢ 
his partners, and in the intervals carried sandwiches and 
blackberry cider to the old ladies in the corner, entreating 
them to get up and dance with him. 
“His manners are perfect,” murmured Mrs. Chipmunk, 
“and he is so distinguished. He arrived with his party 
last night by automobile. They are making a tour of the: 
world. The young lady they say is of gypsy extraction 
and most talented; she told my fortune in the coffee-cup 
and it was quite surprising! I am to become famous and 
inherit a large fortune!” 
“Perhaps then she won’t need to steal other people’s nuts: 
in the Fall,’ whispered the field mouse to her neigh- 
bour. 
   
-P-A-G-E-103
  100 Poor Cecco 
Presently there was a knock at the door, and Mr. Wood- 
chuck hastened to open. It was the Iron Grenadier from 
the farm across the way. He had begun life as a door- 
weight, but losing his position and the greater part of his 
substance with it, by an accident in middle age, had since 
spent his declining years in the barn. He was old and 
very stiff, but on hearing that a party was to be given in 
honour of the strangers he came stumping up the hill, 
pounding on every door in turn and shouting enquiries, 
until at last he found Mrs. Woodchuck’s house. 
He was given at once the place of honour by the chim- 
neyside, with a mug of blackberry cider and Mr. Wood- 
chuck’s best pipe. 
“A bit of a bore,” Mrs. Weasel whispered to Poor Cecco, 
“and he shouts so loudly it’s quite dreadful at times, but he 
is a solid character, and we all feel proud of him!” 
Suddenly, while the enjoyment was at its height, and 
Jensina had just performed for the third time her most 
dashing gypsy dance, twirling on her toes and snapping 
her fingers, there was a strange and sinister scuffing over- 
head, accompanied by loud squeaks. And immediately, 
through the hole in the roof which Mr. Woodchuck had 
still forgotten to repair, something fell with a thud right 
at Jensina’s very feet. 
It was a large stone, with a piece of paper wrapped 
around it. Poor Cecco was the first to snatch it up, and 
when he had unfolded the paper this is what they saw:
-P-A-G-E-104
Jensina’s Party 101 
  GIVE BACK 
THE 
WRECCURE 
_ Instantly the music stopped. Every one crowded round. 
“What is it?” they cried. “What is it?’ Mrs. Chipmunk 
put her hand to her heart, and Bulka left off turning somer- 
saults and pushed forward to see what had happened. 
As for Jensina, when the stone fell at her feet, she stood 
for a moment perfectly still, as though turned to a statue. 
Now, at sight of the writing on the paper, she became 
deathly pale. 
“She is fainting!” some one cried. “Bring her water!” 
But Jensina controlled herself, and with a despairing 
look flung her arms round the necks of Poor Cecco and 
Bulka, who happened to be nearest to her. 
“Alas, my friends!” she sobbed. “Alas! It is I who 
199 have brought all this trouble upon you!
-P-A-G-E-105
  102 Poor Cecco 
199 
“Stop crying!” ordered Poor Cecco, who disliked being 
hugged in public. “Tell me at once, Jensina, what this 
means? For I think,” he added sternly, “you know more 
about this business than you told us, and I suspected all 
along you had something up your sleeve!” 
“Tt isn’t up my sleeve,” said Jensina. “It is—but stay! 
Who knows what ears may be listening? How much bet- 
ter if I had never deceived you, but told you the whole 
truth from the beginning!” 
“It certainly would!” said Poor Cecco, while Bulka, who 
hated to see any one cry except himself, uttered hastily: 
“Don’t be cross to her!” 
Jensina, however, had stopped weeping. Sitting down 
on the floor, and drying her eyes with the edge of her frock, 
she began: 
“When I first came to live among the ash-heaps where 
you. met me I was very lonely. For long weeks I saw no 
one to speak to. I’ve always been used to company, and 
little by little, if only to pass the time of day, I was forced 
to make acquaintance with the rats. They were the oply 
people living there, I was quite at their mercy, and I had 
to be polite. There was one among them, lame in the 
hind leg and better mannered than the others, who had 
been kind to me in the beginning, and he used to come 
sometimes of an evening and drink a cup of coffee at my 
house. It was from him I learned the few words of rat 
language that I know.
-P-A-G-E-106
  Jensina’s Party 103 
“Being too lame for active service, my friend—for I 
may call him that—was employed in the government, and 
he told me from time to time a great deal about the cus- 
toms and traditions of the rat people. Much that he told 
me was both curious and strange—in fact I think he talked 
a lot more than he should have done—and having a high 
position in the Secret Service he knew many things that 
are hidden from the ordinary rat in the street. Among 
other things, he told me of the existence of the rats’ most 
treasured possession, the Tooth of Grimalkin.” 
On hearing Jensina refer to the ash-heap country, in 
that matter-of-fact way, some of the company who had 
been foremost in admiring her during the evening, now 
turned up their noses; and began at once to look about 
for their wraps; but at the word “treasure” their curiosity 
got the better of them, and they sat down again, though 
not without some whispering among themselves, to which, 
however, Jensina paid no heed. 
“This object,” Jensina continued, “has been in the rats’ 
keeping for many centuries and is most jealously guarded. 
In times of peace its place is in the King’s treasury, and 
in war-time it is carried before them in public procession. 
It is said to have come into their possession in the time of 
the Mousades, when their hero slew the cat Grimalkin and 
bore back the Tooth in trophy. As long as they preserve 
this mascot, so the rats believe, no enemy can overcome 
them, but without it they would at once become powerless.
-P-A-G-E-107
  104 Poor Cecco 
No rat can gaze on this precious relic unmoved; few in 
fact ever have the chance to do so anyway, but my friend 
was among these few, and so he was able to describe the 
Tooth to me in complete detail. 
“Now I must tell you,” Jensina went on, considerably 
cheered by having an audience, “that in spite of their clev- 
erness the rats are really very careless. Their archives, as 
my friend admitted, are often kept in a terrible state; 
everything in disorder and they don’t even trouble about 
repairs. As one of their proverbs says, ‘Good is good 
enough.’ So it happened on the night of the great storm, 
which you will remember, when the sky broke and all the 
water came tumbling down, the cellars of the Royal Treas- 
ure were completely flooded, and it fell to the lot of one 
rat, the janitor’s brother-in-law, who happened to be on 
guard, to rush down, snatch the box containing the relic, 
and bear it to a place of safety. 
“Now, whether there was a hole in the box, which I can 
quite believe, knowing their extreme carelessness in such 
matters, or whether the guardian in his hurry carried it 
upside down, I don’t know. But on going for a walk first 
thing in the morning, to see what was washed out by the 
storm, the first thing I saw, shining on the path before me, 
was the famous Tooth of Grimalkin. 
“On the moment’s impulse I picked it up and hid it 
under my frock, meaning to give it back to my friend at 
the first opportunity. But when you arrived I was so over-

Jensina’s Party 105 
    
      
      
          
     
    
          
     
   
    
        
   joyed at meeting persons of my own rank once more that 
the Tooth went completely out of my head. 
“Later, I slipped it in my bundle, still meaning to leave 
it in some spot where it might be found. But the be- 
haviour of the rats, and their horrid attack on dear Bulka, 
at once altered my mind. Disgusted with them, I decided 
that they could hunt their tooth for themselves, but at a 
certain moment, seeing that the battle was going against 
us, and wishing to divert their attention, I was rash enough 
to call out in rat language: ‘Go and look after your pre- 
cious old Grimalkin Tooth!’ 
“You saw’—she turned to Bulka and Poor Cecco—“‘the 
immediate effect of my words! I admit it surprised me, 
for up to then I hadn’t really believed all I was told. But 
it was too late; the secret was out, and I was determined 
that, come what might, never would I give up that tooth, 
if only to spite them, and I hurried you away in the hope 
that we might yet outdistance their pursuit. But alas, no 
such luck!” 
“‘Ash-heaps, indeed, and picking up what doesn’t belong 
to her!” sniffed Mrs. Weasel aloud. “I always said the 
Woodchucks kept queer company! It’s time we went 
home, before there’s trouble with the police!” 
Fortunately Jensina didn’t hear her remark, but Mrs. 
Woodchuck did, and was rightly indignant. 
“You may go home, you stuck-up things!” she cried 
heartily. “And small credit to you! Your washing will
-P-A-G-E-109
  106 Poor Cecco ~ 
be returned to-morrow, and I’ll thank you to pay at the 
door!” 
Saying which she bustled them out, and the High- 
Hangers with them, before turning to Jensina and exclaim- 
ing: “Poor darling, with all the trouble she’s been 
through!” 
“It isn’t that I mind,’ said Jensina, dabbing at her 
eyes again. “Id go through it again to-morrow just to 
spite those rats, but it’s the trouble I have brought on my 
friends by my own pig-headedness. And now I’m in a 
terrible hole, for if I give the Tooth back to them for the 
sake of peace they'll only take their revenge on us, and 
as long as I keep it, so long will they pursue us and track 
us down, as they did to-night. Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” 
And she nearly broke down again. 
The Iron Grenadier seemed to have been asleep all this 
while, but in reality he had been listening attentively to 
all that Jensina said. Clearing his voice now, he began: 
“My dear young lady, this is a matter in which an old 
soldier’s advice may be very useful. In the first place, I 
have heard many times of this famous Tooth of Grimalkin, 
for the legend of it exists wherever the rat people dwell. 
Living in the barn I am in touch with what goes on, and 
I may tell you that up to now the Rat Government have 
kept their loss very secret, for no rumour of it has reached 
the rats in this part of the country. This is good news 
for you, as it shows that they dread exposure and realise   
-P-A-G-E-110
    
    ‘Jensina’s Party 107 
their helplessness, but for which they would have attacked 
you long ago. As long as you keep the Tooth you are 
safe; they may try to trick you and frighten you into giv- 
ing it up, but they will not dare to attack you openly. 
You have therefore a dangerous and most powerful 
weapon, and one you must use with care. To give it up, 
at this point, would be fatal, and very silly. You must 
keep it till such time as you may happen to need the rats’ 
help; then you can drive a bargain with them. Use pru- 
dence and all your wit, and have no fear that in such 
conditions as you impose, they will not keep their word. 
“And now it is time that we all took a little rest, and 
if you feel any nervousness, remember I am an old cam- 
paigner, and I shall have the greatest pleasure in stand- 
ing guard at your doorway all night!” 
And after gallantly kissing Jensina’s hand, the party 
having by now dispersed, he took up his station outside 
the front door and stayed there sternly, musket in hand, 
till the sun rose and the dew stood out in shining drops 
on his iron nose. 
 
-P-A-G-E-111

THE LETTUCE BOX 
HE best thing to do,” said Poor Cecco next morn- 
ing, when they had bidden the Woodchucks 
good-bye and were walking down the hill, “is to 
gohome. This life of adventure is all very well, but we 
have been away for a long time, and by now every one 
will be wondering what has become of us.” 
“Home!” shouted Bulka. “Hurray! Let’s go home!” 
And he turned a somersault at once. 
It was all very well to say, but how would they get 
there? It wasn’t so easy. For one thing, no one had the 
faintest idea, now, in which direction home lay. It might 
be East, West, North or South, but after taking so many 
turns and coming through so many adventures even Poor 
Cecco had lost his sense of direction completely. As for 
Bulka, he had never even troubled his head about any- 
thing of the kind. 
Poor Cecco thought and thought, and in the end he took 
a piece of stick, and finding a smooth bit of earth began 
to trace on it, as well as he could remember, the way they 
had come. It looked a queer sort of map when he had 
done, with stones and scraps of twig stuck in here and 
108
-P-A-G-E-112
  The Lettuce Box 109 
there to mark the different points of their journey, and 
certainly no one but Poor Cecco himself could have ex- 
plained it. 
“First,” he said, “we came down a road, and here is the 
bridge, and the old man, and those pebbles are the ducks 
—there ought to be more of them, but never mind—and 
that twisty line is the river. And then we crossed a field, 
only I can’t make that very well because it was all dark, 
but somewhere ¢here is the little dog’s cottage, and this 
is the ash-heap country, and that white stone is Jensina. 
And here is where the rats attacked us, and then we went 
back to the road again. Stop a minute—I must put the 
road further over; there isn’t room. And then we took 
the automobile.” 
Ah, the automobile! That was the real trouble. No 
one knew which way the automobile had gone. For one 
thing, they were half asleep most of the way. Certainly 
the automobile mixed everything up. If it hadn’t been 
for that, Poor Cecco was quite sure his map would have 
come out all right. 
“Let’s leave the automobile out,” suggested Bulka. 
“We can’t,” said Poor Cecco. “The automobile must 
have gone this way.” And he traced another line. 
“But it would have gone straight into the long grass!” 
Bulka objected. 
“Don’t be silly!” said Poor Cecco. ‘Can’t you see it’s 
only a map? The question is, where are we now?’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
  110 Poor Cecco 
“That isn’t the question at all,” put in Jensina, rather 
snappily, for she was getting bored with watching Poor 
Cecco stick in his twigs and stones. “I know perfectly 
well where we are now. I’m not an idiot! What I want 
to know is where we are going.” 
“Can’t you have patience?’ Poor Cecco exclaimed. 
“All you can put in a map are the places you’ve already 
been. That’s what a map’s for. No one ever heard of 
a map that showed the places people haven’t been yet. 
There’d be no sense to it.” 
2 “There’s no sense to this,” said Jensina, “so far as I 
can see! Look where you’ve put the river—just where 
Bulka’s going to step in it!” 
Bulka drew back, alarmed, but seeing only a line on 
the earth, stepped over it, and wandered off to look for 
huckleberries. Some one would have to find the way home; 
it didn’t trouble him. 
Poor Cecco folded his legs and lay down sulkily. He 
thought it was too bad of Jensina to be so critical when 
he really was trying his best. 
Suddenly Jensina sat up and thumped the ground. 
“Listen! Ihave an idea!” 
“Well?” said Poor Cecco, still sulky. 
“Do you know the name of your house?’ 
“What do you mean?’ asked Poor Cecco. “It’s just 
called the house.” 
“Do you know what house it is?” Jensina explained. 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
       The Lettuce Box 
“Of course I do!” said Poor Cecco. 111 
“Then if you can write what house it is,” Jensina cried. 
“And if we’ve got three pennies, we'll go back by R.F.D.” 
Poor Cecco pricked up his ears. 
“What's that?” 
“It’s a man in a car,” said Jensina, “and he rides up 
and down the world all day taking things where they have 
to go. He’s got to take them. And whatever you write 
the name of the place on he’s got to take it there.” 
“But why is he called R.F.D.?’ Poor Cecco asked. 
Jensina thought a moment. “R.F.D. means Rides For 
Dolls, of course,’ she returned, very superior. “Every 
one knows that.” 
“It might mean Rides for Dogs,” said Poor Cecco, who 
didn’t see why Jensina should have it all her own way. 
Just then Bulka poked his head up through the long 
grass. “Who’s going to ride?” he asked 
“All of us!” said Jensina promptly. “Dear me, Bulka, 
you do look a sight! Brush all that grass-seed off you, do, 
and Poor Cecco find a clean piece of paper, and we'll write 
the address.” 
Bulka had been hunting huckleberries in the pasture. 
He hadn’t found one, but he had found a great many other 
things instead—hayseed and dried leaves and bits of twig 
and burrs—which were sticking all over him, and while 
he sat down obediently and began to pick them off, one 
by one, Poor Cecco found a clean bit of pasteboard, from.     
 
-P-A-G-E-115
  112 Poor Cecco 
a cigarette packet some one had thrown away, and dipping 
a twig into blackberry juice he began to write, while Jen- 
sina locked over his shoulder. 
This is what he wrote, in a fine round hand: 
THE-WOODEN-HOUSE-WITH-TWO-TREES- 
IN-FRONT 
Left-hand corner of the road 
Going to Strawberryville. 
  It looked very well when he had done, but Poor Cecco 
was still a little doubtful. 
“Do you think he’ll find it?’ he asked. 
“Of course he’ll find it,” said Jensina. ‘“That’s what 
he’s for. And now we must go and wait by the letters- 
box.” 
So, Bulka being by now fairly tidy, Poor Cecco tucked 
the label under his arm, and with Jensina carrying her 
precious bundle they all three made their way under the 
pasture bars and back to the road. And sure enough, be- 
fore they had gone very far, there was a grey box on a 
post by the roadside with R.F.D. written on it, just as 
Jensina had said. 
“You see I was right!” she exclaimed. “Here is the
-P-A-G-E-116
  The Lettuce Box 113 
letters-box, and if you'll help me up all we’ve got to do 
is to sit here till the letter-man comes by.” 
Poor Cecco climbed up first, by the help of a vine that 
twined about the post, and with a little pushing and pull- 
ing they were soon all three seated up there, safe and 
sound, with their legs dangling over the edge. 
Jensina set up the flag, to be sure the letter-man would 
stop for them, while Bulka, leaning over, peered into the 
on 
“T don’t see any lettuce!” he cried. 
“Where?” Jensina asked. 
“In the box. You sazd it was a lettuce-box!” 
“Tt’s not that kind of lettuce,” explained Jensina. “I 
said letters-box, where they post the letters!” 
“There’s only one kind,” returned Bulka, offended. “I 
see the post all right, but there’s no lettuce. I’m hungry! 
Im going back to look for huckleberries again.” 
“You can’t!” cried Jensina, and she caught him by one 
leg just as he was getting ready to slide down. “You 
mustn’t be hungry, Bulka. We're going home!” 
At the word “home” Bulka ceased to resist, and sat down 
again beside them. For safety Jensina made him sit in 
the middle with the address label across his tummy, and 
then, taking a piece of pink string she had picked up by 
the roadside, she bound them all three firmly together, in 
case, as she explained, they might get separated on the 
journey.
-P-A-G-E-117
  
  114 Poor Cecco 
The three pennies, taken from the bundle, were laid on 
the letter-box beside them. It was agreed that Bulka 
should pay his own fare, while Poor Cecco would pay for 
himself and Jensina. Thus there was exactly one penny, 
belonging to Poor Cecco, left over. 
It was not very pleasant waiting there, for the sun beat 
down on their heads and the iron top of the letter-box soon 
became uncomfortably hot to sit upon; in fact it was al- 
most like an oven. Poor Cecco had the idea of picking 
some leaves from the vine that grew near, and with these 
they contrived parasols to keep the glare from their faces. 
“I wish the letter-man would hurry!” said Jensina, ex- 
amining her painted shoes, which were beginning to blister 
from the sun. 
Bulka was asleep, as usual. 
Presently, however, a little cloud of dust appeared far 
away on the road. It was the letter-man’s car, and at 
length, with much banging and rattling, it drew up be- 
fore them. The driver was a pleasant-faced man. He 
stared hard at the little party sitting, all tied together, on 
the top of the letter-box, and he scratched his head. 
“That’s a queer sort of a parcel!” he said. 
Still, the label was there, in Poor Cecco’s beautiful round 
handwriting, and the pennies were there, so he had no 
choice but to pick them up, which he did rather gingerly 
and set them on the seat beside him, after first licking 
three stamps and sticking them, one on Poor Cecco’s fore-
-P-A-G-E-118
    
The Lettuce Box 115 
head, one on Bulka’s forehead, and one on Jensina’s. 
Then the car went on its way, rattling and bumping, to 
the next letter-box. 
Scarcely had it started before two rats poked their noses 
from the tall weeds behind the post, and with one swift 
glance about them, set out on a steady businesslike trot 
along the road.

MURRUM’S REVENGE 
HAT had been happening at home all this while? 
When the others woke up in the morning they 
rushed at once to the dolls’ cradle, and seeing the 
stick of wood lying there wrapped up in the blankets, they 
had a great shock. It really looked as if something dread- 
ful had happened to Poor Cecco! Perhaps he had died 
in the night! But when they unrolled the covers and saw 
it was only a stick of firewood after all, and just another 
of Poor Cecco’s tricks, they were pretty angry. He had 
no business to go away and leave them like that, and 
worse still, he had taken Bulka with him. 
Poor Cecco often disappeared; they were used to that. 
Very likely he had just gone off early to get himself a 
new tail, to surprise them with. But Bulka was another 
matter; Bulka had never been known to go away before. 
Tubby in particular was very upset. She remembered 
how she had quarrelled with Bulka the night before, and 
called him a cry-baby. Now he had gone, and all her tears 
would not bring him back. 
All that day she sat in a corner, and thought of the 
terrible things that might be happening to him, one worse 
116
-P-A-G-E-120
  Murrum’s Revenge 117 
than another. Even Ida, with all her soothing ways, could 
not console her. If Bulka ever came back, Tubby thought, 
she would tell him how much she really loved him. But 
she couldn’t wait for that; she must write a letter, before 
she forgot all the things that she wanted to say, and after 
hunting about for a scrap of paper and a stub of lead- 
pencil she seated herself in a corner behind the coal-scuttle 
and began to write. 
Dear Burka: 
I love you and I sorry I called you a cry- 
baby and if you come back I will make you 
icecream and a cake with ammons on and 
Pll take you to Tubbyland 
Yours loving 
Tussy. 
That looked very nice, but not quite nice enough, so 
sticking her tongue out carefully she began again. 
Dear BuLKa: 
I miss you very much and if you come 
back I will make you a orange cake with 
icing and ammons on top and I love you 
and I hope you come back. there is no more 
nues at present with love from 
Tussy. 
The third was like this: 
Dear Burka: 
I love you more than the sky and more 
than the blue and when you come back I will

  118 Poor Cecco 
make you a cake with orange icing and am- 
mons and silver balls and you are not a cry- 
baby 
Tussy. 
PS TI love you more than Christmas and 
Easter and Fairyland 
By the evening Tubby had written thirty-seven letters 
and had used up nearly all the paper out of the wastepaper 
basket. She folded the letters very small and sealed them 
8.w.A.K. Where to post them was the question, but after 
thinking a little while Tubby decided what to do. She 
gathered up all the letters in her pinafore, and creeping 
up very quietly, she posted them all inside the Money-Pig 
while he wasn’t looking. 
Now she had no more paper, but the Easter Chicken 
settled that. He came running up, dragging a nearly clean 
paper bag which he had found by the pantry door. 
“Here’s paper, Tubby!” he cried. “I'll find you all the 
paper you want! I know where there’s a whole lot of it!” 
So, greatly cheered, Tubby settled down once more to 
her letter-writing. So deep was she in her task, clutch- 
ing the pencil tightly and with a tip of her tongue stuck 
out, that she never even heard the other toys calling 
her. 
They were going on a picnic. 
“Where’s Tubby?’ asked Anna, when Tubby didn’t 
answer.

  OWN the path he sped, to the big willow tree by the 
fence, and, climbing up the trunk, he dropped poor 
Tubby—plong—right down the dark hole in the middle. 
“Now we'll see,” said Murrum, “who’s master in this 
house!”
-P-A-G-E-124
     Murrum’s Revenge 121 
“Sh-sh!” returned Gladys. “She’s behind the coal 
scuttle, writing letters to Bulka.” 
Tubby heard this, but she made no sound, only turned 
very red and went on with her letter. 
“Well, we needn’t bother about her,” said Virginia May. 
“If she doesn’t want to come she can stay behind.” 
And they all set off, with a great clatter and shouting, 
as usual; all except the Easter Chicken and the Money- 
Pig, who complained of indigestion and wanted to sleep. 
No wonder, with all those letters inside him! 
The house grew very still and lonely, but Tubby didn’t 
mind. She sat and wrote; her pencil went scratch-scratch 
busily on the paper without stopping. She was writing 
Bulka all the most lovely things she could think of. It 
is true that her letters were all rather alike, but that didn’t 
matter; one can’t always be saying something different. 
She was having a wonderful time. And meanwhile the 
Easter Chicken ran to and fro, fetching Tubby all the 
scraps of paper he could find, and as soon as each letter 
was finished he went over on tiptoe and posted it in the 
Money-Pig. 
Ding-dong! chimed the clock, twelve times. A beam 
of moonlight came through the window. It moved slowly 
nearer, till it lit up the dark corner behind the coal scuttle 
where Tubby sat writing. A tear stood on her nose, for 
at that moment she was wondering where Bulka was, and 
the thought that something might have happened to him, 
and that perhaps he would never read the letters she had   
  
-P-A-G-E-125
      
  122 
written, was almost too much for her. But there was no 
use dwelling on dreadful thoughts, so she rubbed the tear 
off with her pencil and went on writing more busily than Poor Cecco 
ever. 
A shadow moved in the far corner by the door. It was 
Murrum, just returned through the kitchen window from 
his prowling. He caught sight of Tubby sitting there in 
the moonlight, and pricked up his ears. 
Murrum was in a very bad temper. Things were going 
from bad to worse. He had not caught a single mouse in 
the last three nights. He blamed this entirely on the toys, 
and for a long time he had been planning revenge. Only 
this very day he had gone his rounds, sniffing everywhere; 
there was just one hole in the room, he knew, where a mouse 
might possibly be, and as luck would have it that hole was 
exactly in the corner by the fireplace, behind the coal 
scuttle, where Tubby sat writing her letters. 
Murrum’s tail twitched angrily. It was too bad! There 
she sat, right in his way. “Stop rustling that paper!” he 
growled. “What are you doing there?” 
“T won’t tell you,” said Tubby, and her pencil went 
straight on—scratch—scratch—on the paper. 
“You're making a noise!” cried Murrum. “How dare 
you? Get out of my corner at once!” 
Tubby made no answer, though the Easter Chicken 
plucked anxiously at her skirt. Murrum’s tail was twitch- 
ing to and fro, and his eyes shone like green lamps.    
  
-P-A-G-E-126
  Murrum’s Revenge 123 
“Will you get out from there?” he hissed. 
“No,” said Tubby. “I won’t. So Hinksman!” 
This was more than Murrum could endure. He made 
one furious bound, and seized Tubby then and there by 
the neck. The Easter Chicken gave a piteous squawk, but 
there was no one to hear. In two jumps Murrum crossed 
the floor and was out through the kitchen window, with 
Tubby in his mouth. Down the path he sped, and across 
the parsley border to the big willow tree in the corner by 
the fence, and climbing up the trunk he dropped poor 
Tubby—plong—right down the dark hole in the middle!

“Now we'll see,” said Murrum, ‘“who’s master in this 
house!”

WHERE IS TUBBY? 
HE poor Easter Chicken did not know which way 
to turn. He rushed to the Money-Pig and shook 
him violently. 
The Money-Pig, who had seen everything that hap- 
pened, pretended to be asleep. He was really a terrible 
coward. 
“Leave me alone!” he grumbled. “What’s the matter?” 
“Tubby!” cried the Easter Chicken. “Murrum has car- 
tied off Tubby!” 
“Tl say she deserved it!” said the Money-Pig. “I can’t 
do anything, can I?” 
But the Easter Chicken continued to beat him with his 
wings, shouting: “Tubby’s gone! You must wake up! 
12 Murrum has stolen her! 
“Can’t you leave me alone?” the Money-Pig complained. 
“Isn’t it enough that you must be stuffing goodness knows 
what all down my back all day! It isn’t money, I’m sure; 
I never felt so sick in my life. If Tubby’s gone, good 
riddance! I’m not going to worry about her. Let me 
sleep, for goodness’ sake. Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” And 
he pretended to groan.

  Where Is Tubby? 125 
Just then the rest of the party returned from their pic- 
nic. They trooped in laughing, chattering and shouting, 
making such a noise that it was several minutes before 
the Easter Chicken could even make himself heard, though 
he did his best, running from one to another, flapping his 
wings and chirping piteously. 
“What’s the matter?” asked Gladys at last. ‘““What’s 
all this fuss? You should have been in bed hours ago!” 
“Tubby’s gone! Tubby’s gone!” the Easter Chicken 
cried. And he poured out a story in which Tubby, Mur- 
rum and the Money-Pig were so mixed up that Gladys 
could make out nothing at all. 
“Come here!” she called to the others. ‘““What’s he fuss- 
ing about, do you suppose? He’s got some silly idea in 
his head but I can’t understand a word of it!” 
“Tt’s Tubby!” he sobbed. 
“Well, what about Tubby?” asked Virginia May tartly, 
for she had been interrupted in a conversation with Har- 
lequin, and Harlequin’s conversations were rare. 
“Tubby has gone!” said the Easter Chicken. 
“Ts that all? Well, she’s gone to Tubbyland, I suppose! 
She’s done it dozens of times before,” said Gladys. “Noth- 
ing to get so excited about.” 
For it had long been Tubby’s habit, especially when she 
felt herself slighted, to retire into hiding in some spot 
known only to herself, and from which she would reappear 
later, telling every one, with a most superior air, that she 
f
-P-A-G-E-129
126 Poor Cecco 
had just been to Tubbyland—a habit which annoyed the 
rest of the Toys unutterably, for they none of them really 
believed her. 
“She’ll come back when she gets tired of it,” said Anna 
wisely. “Stop chattering so much. Little chickens should 
be seen and not heard!” 
“But she hasn’t gone to Tubbyland,” the Easter Chicken 
insisted. “I tell you she’s stolen! Murrum stole her!” 
“Now you're telling fibs!”’ exclaimed Virginia May 
severely. “You know you are always making things up. 
I don’t believe you.” 
“He’s had a nightmare,” suggested the Lion. “Go back 
to bed, Chicken, and keep quiet!” 
“But it’s true! It’s true! The Money-Pig saw him!” 
“T didn’t!” cried the Money-Pig hastily, for he was 
afraid of being blamed. “I was fast asleep. He woke 
me up. I’m feeling very unwell!” 
“Of course she’s gone to Tubbyland!” said Gladys. 
“She was always talking about it. Besides, no one’s seen 
Murrum for two days.” 
But at the word “Murrum” an uncomfortable chill fell 
on the party. However boldly they might talk when they 
were together, there was not one of them would have liked 
to meet Murrum alone, especially at night, unless it was 
Poor Cecco, and Poor Cecco was away. They shifted their 
feet and looked at one another uneasily. If only Poor 
Cecco were here this question would soon be settled. 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  Where Is Tubby? 127 
Meantime, if only to try and pacify the Easter Chicken, 
they began to hunt about for Tubby. 
They looked behind the sofa cushions, and under the 
sideboard, even inside the coal scuttle itself, but there was 
no Tubby to be seen. High and low they searched, calling 
her, but it was all no use. Now indeed they began to get 
alarmed. 
“She’s doing it on purpose,” said Virginia May, trying 
not to feel frightened. “It’s all because we made fun of 
her writing letters to Bulka.” 
“T wish Poor Cecco were here!’ said Harlequin sadly. 
And Anna began to snivel. “Things always seem to go 
wrong when Poor Cecco’s away!” 
No use wishing for Poor Cecco! They must do their 
best without him. All the rest of that night, led by Har- 
lequin and the Lion, they hunted and called. They even 
turned back the carpet and poked out the cracks in the 
kitchen floor with hairpins. There was no trace of Tubby 
anywhere, except a few torn scraps of paper behind the 
coal scuttle. 
It was a very dejected party that gathered in the toy- 
cupboard next morning. Never before had Tubby re- 
mained hidden so long. And though Gladys and Anna still 
maintained she had only gone to Tubbyland, the rest of 
them began to feel certain by now that something had 
happened. As for the Easter Chicken, he had sobbed 
himself to sleep long ago.
-P-A-G-E-131
  128 Poor Cecco 
The toys woke him up, for they felt that some one had 
to be blamed for the whole affair. 
“Why didn’t you stop Murrum?” they scolded. “You 
ought to have called us. You should have told some one!” 
“T told the Money-Pig!” 
“You didn’t!” the Money-Pig shouted, and immediately 
closed his eyes again and groaned. 
Certainly something had given him indigestion. But 
the other toys were too worried to pay any attention to 
his troubles. 
“You'll catch it when Poor Cecco comes back!” said 
Harlequin darkly. And the Engine and Anna and the 
dolls all cried: “Yes, it’s all your fault!” 
That didn’t frighten the Easter Chicken. All he cared 
about was rescuing Tubby, but the only thing he could do 
was to hop up and down and flap his wings. 
“Didn’t you even see which way he went?’ the Lion 
asked. 
“He went through the kitchen window. The Money- 
Pig saw him.” 
“If you say that again,” bellowed the Money-Pig, “TI 
shall certainly beat you! Some one give me a penny; I am 
going to be ill!” 
“Tt’s all the Easter Chicken’s fault!” they shouted in 
chorus. 
In the very midst of this confusion, there was heard the 
shrill toot of a horn, and a loud ring at the door-bell. 
Some one must be arriving in style! And while they won-
-P-A-G-E-132
    Where Is Tubby? 129 
dered, the toy-cupboard door was flung open, and in strode 
Poor Cecco himself, together with Bulka and a strange 
little person with painted boots and no frock on, whom 
they had never seen before. She looked very shy, and was 
carrying a bundle in her hand. 
“Hello!” cried Poor Cecco. “How is everybody? 
Hello, Harlequin! Hello, Lion! Hello, Anna! This is 
Jensina. We've been all over the world and now we're 
back again!” And he began kissing them all round. 
“And [ve brought some beads for Tubby!” Bulka cried, 
holding up his necklace for every one to see. “Nobody 
touch them! Where is Tubby?” 
All the toys were silent; no one wanted to speak first. 
Only the Money-Pig was heard to snore loudly. _ 
“Where is Tubby?’ Bulka repeated. “I want to see 
Tubby! Why isn’t Tubby here?’ 
And Poor Cecco, looking about him, asked with a sud- 
den sternness: “Where is Tubby?” 
The toys looked uneasily one at another, shuffling their 
feet, and suddenly they all burst into tears.

HOW BULKA GOT HIS LETTERS 
RE was a dismal end to a fine home-coming! 
Well the toys might weep; that would not 
help matters. Poor Cecco’s return, however, 
after the first few moments—in which he said very plainly 
what he thought—put new courage into them all. Now 
there was some one to organise the search and take matters 
in hand, and at once they became brave. The Lion stiff- 
ened up and was ready to roar; Anna stopped snivelling, 
and Harlequin squared his shoulders and went about once 
more saying “Hey Presto!” They ceased to blame the 
Easter Chicken, and instead began to talk of what they 
would do to Murrum. 
The real question, however, was to rescue Tubby, and 
this could not be done until she was found. Poor Cecco 
at once decided that they must divide into two parties, 
one to search the garden and one the house. This, the 
Lion pointed out, had already been done, but Poor Cecco 
wanted to make quite sure. So with Poor Cecco at the head 
of one party, and Bulka leading the other, they set out. 
Jensina remained at home, with Ida, Anna and the dolls, 
in order to become acquainted. 
130
-P-A-G-E-134
    How Bulka Got His Letters 131 
Now I would like nothing better than to tell how 
Gladys and Virginia May welcomed Jensina with the kind- 
ness due to a stranger and a guest, but unfortunately this 
would not be at all true. In fact, from the first minute 
they set eyes on Jensina they had made up their minds to 
snub her. This was partly due to jealousy, partly from 
the mere desire to show off and give themselves airs. As 
long as Bulka and Poor Cecco were present they were bound 
to be polite to her, but as soon as they found themselves 
alone they turned up their noses and set out to make her 
just as uncomfortable as they knew how. Anna merely 
simpered and looked affected. Ida alone was kind, but 
then Ida was always kind. No one took any notice of 
her. 
As for Jensina, the unaccustomed luxury of the toy-cup- 
board, and the new company among which she found her- 
self, naturally made her feel a little shy. She consoled 
herself, however, and kept up her sense of dignity by 
sticking out her tongue whenever Gladys and Virginia 
May were not looking. She was quite aware of their atti- 
tude, and would have much preferred to join Poor Cecco 
and Bulka on their search, but instead she had to stay at 
home and make the best of it. So she sat on the toy- 
cupboard sofa, which had only two legs and was propped 
up at the other end by an empty cotton-spool, while Gladys 
and Virginia May reclined on the cigar-box opposite and 
stared at her.
-P-A-G-E-135
    132 Poor Cecco 
“Are there many parties where you come from?” Vir- 
ginia May began in a languid voice. 
“There were two last night,” Jensina replied, “but I 
could only attend one of them.” 
“Indeed!” said Gladys, and the two dolls glanced at 
one another and sniffed. 
“T suppose you have all your clothes in that funny bun- 
dle,” Gladys remarked. “So quaint! I wish, Virginia,” 
she added, “that you would remind me to have the lock 
of my large trunk attended to, I may go visiting soon, and 
I couldn’t dream of travelling without it! I don’t quite 
know whether I shall wear my white satin or the pink 
velvet trimmed with lace. Harlequin says I look charm- 
ing in the pink velvet!” 
The trunk, as every one knew, did not really belong to 
Gladys at all. It had lain in the bottom of the toy-cup- 
board for ages with the lid half off and was full of broken 
china, while the white satin petticoat had only been loaned 
her for the wedding last week, and it was Virginia May’s 
turn to have it next. Virginia, however, chose to forget 
that she had quarrelled bitterly with Gladys over this gar- 
ment only two days ago, and clasping her hands she ex- 
claimed: 
“Oh, darling, I should wear the white! White is always 
so becoming when one travels, especially with a veil.” 
“T daresay you are right,” sighed Gladys, and she 
glanced again at Jensina.
-P-A-G-E-136
  How Bulka Got His Letters 133 
“Wouldn’t you like to take your shoes off,” she asked 
sweetly, “and rest your feet a little?’ 
Now Jensina couldn’t possibly take her shoes off, and 
both the dolls knew it. They were painted on, and while 
painted-on shoes are the cheapest and most comfortable 
that any one can have, they are also the sign of inferior 
social position. Both Gladys and Virginia had once pos- 
sessed real shoes—bronze paper shoes with buckles—but 
they had been lost long ago, and one of Virginia’s feet 
being broken off near the instep, she couldn’t have kept a 
shoe on even if she still had it; Jensina knew they were 
only trying to humiliate her, but she didn’t care; her feet 
were both unchipped and they served her quite well for 
walking. So she merely stared hard at Virginia’s broken 
toes and replied: 
“I never take my shoes off in company. I don’t think 
it is quite nice!” 
Both dolls turned very red. 
“T daresay she sleeps in them,” Virginia whispered in a 
loud aside, and Gladys returned: “We might lend her 
something to wear. Poor thing! I think I’ve got an old 
petticoat somewhere about.” 
“T’ve got a perfectly good dress of my own,” Jensina 
replied aloud, “and it doesn’t need washing either!” 
“Really!” said Virginia. “How strange! What is it 
made of ?” 
“It’s made of gingham,” said Jensina proudly.
-P-A-G-E-137
    134 Poor Cecco 
“Gingham!” murmured the dolls, and they both shud- 
dered. 
“Don’t you mind them,’ whispered Ida_ kindly. 
“They’re only jealous because you ve travelled more than 
they have. They’re quite nice when you really know 
them.” 
“They're stuck-up cats!” thought Jensina. “Thai's 
what they are!” 
She sat stiff and erect on the sofa, determined to keep 
silence, while the two dolls plied her with questions. They 
were curious, above all, to know what kind of a shop she 
came from. 
“I was never in a shop,” Jensina retorted at last. “My 
people had nothing to do with trade. If you want to know, 
I am descended from a gypsy queen!” 
“Descended is the right word!” said Virginia, while 
Gladys added: “I never knew there were gypsy queens.” 
“Then you don’t know much,” said Jensina sharply, and 
turning her back on them as far as she could she began 
to unknot her bundle and arrange its contents on the sofa 
beside her, while Virginia and Gladys stared inquisitively, 
whispering together. 
“It must be very romantic being a queen!” simpered 
Anna coyly, thinking of the Lion. It was the first remark 
she had made and Jensina turned to stare at her. 
“Why do you wear that bell round your neck?” she 
asked. |

“In case I ever get lost,” Anna replied, “so that I can 
always tell where I am, even in the dark.” 
“J shouldn’t think you'd get lost easily!” said Jensina. 
Anna did not know whether this was a compliment or 
not, so she merely simpered again. Jensina went on 
arranging her treasures, which made the dolls very curious, 
and Gladys leaned so far over Virginia May’s shoulder 
that they both lost their balance and tumbled off the cigar- 
box. To hide their confusion Gladys said instantly: 
“Let us have a little music! Anna, will you find the 
musical box?” 
This took Anna some while, partly because her eyes were 
so near the top of her head, partly because the musical-box 
itself was hidden under a pile of broken furniture and 
building blocks in one corner of the toy-cupboard. While 
she was still looking for it Bulka came in, followed by the 
Lion and the Easter Chicken. 
“Have you found Tubby?” the others cried at once. 
“Have you any news?” 
“Not yet,” replied the Lion hopefully, “but Poor Cecco 
and Harlequin are in the garden making a trap, and if 
only Murrum will step on it we might catch him.” 
“Have you had a nice time, Jensina?’”’ Bulka asked. 
“Wonderful!” replied Jensina, looking straight at the 
two dolls, who became more confused than ever. Anna 
had found the musical-box at last. It was round, with 
painted figures on it and a tiny china knob on the handle.
-P-A-G-E-143
  138 Poor Cecco 
Seizing this she began to turn, and immediately a little 
tune gushed forth. 
“Tum tum tum tumptity—ugh—ugh—ugh!” tinkled 
the musical-box, breaking off, as always, in something be- 
tween a cough and a hiccup. 
At the sound of these familiar strains, to which he and 
Tubby had so often waltzed in bygone days, Poor Bulka 
nearly broke down. “Stop it!” he cried, stamping his foot. 
“Stop it!” while Anna gazed in stupid surprise and the 
musical-box, which was far harder to stop than to set go- 
ing, continued obstinately in its refrain. 
“Stop it!” shouted the Money-Pig, aroused from his nap 
on the roof of the Noah’s Ark. “Must you make that hor- 
rible noise?” 
Jensina rushed to take hold of the handle, and as she 
did so the Money-Pig, leaning over to shout, caught sight 
of the penny—Poor Cecco’s remaining penny—lying with 
Jensina’s treasures on the toy-cupboard sofa. 
“There’s money!” he exclaimed. “T see it! Give it me 
at once!” 
“T shall not,” returned Jensina with spirit. “It belongs 
to Poor Cecco!”’ 
“He can’t take care of money! I need it! Give it me 
this instant!” the Money-Pig insisted. ‘No one can have 
money but me!” 
“Don’t you give it him!” advised the Lion. “You'll 
never get it back. He’s awfully greedy!”
-P-A-G-E-144
    How Bulka Got His Letters 139 
Jensina, who had no intention of giving up the penny, 
took a step back, startled by the Money-Pig’s squealing, 
while the Easter Chicken suddenly piped up: “Tl find 
you a penny if you'll tell that you saw Murrum stealing 
Tubby!” 
“T won't!” the Money-Pig bellowed. “I won’t tell you! 
Give me that penny at once!” 
It all happened in a moment! Jensina made a move- 
ment to protect Poor Cecco’s money, snatching it from the 
sofa; the Money-Pig gave a shriek, and in his rage he 
leaned so far forward that his hoof slipped, he lost his 
balance, and—crash!—he fell off the Noah’s Ark roof and 
was broken to pieces! ; 
There he lay in fragments on the toy-cupboard floor, 
and there, among the pennies, and the scraps of green china 
that a moment ago had been his ears and his snout and his 
fat bulging sides, lay dozens and dozens of folded notes 
of all shapes and sizes—a whole pile of them—each one 
addressed: “To Dear Bulka. In the Toy-Cupboard.’— 
all Tubby’s love letters that she had written so carefully 
and posted inside him! The wonder was that he had held 
them all up to now without bursting! 
There they were, plain for all the world to see, with 
“Dear Bulka” written in a big round hand on each one 
of them. ‘“Tubby’s been writing tome! Tubby’s written 
me a letter!” Bulka cried. He began to gather the letters 
up in armfuls, dropping half of them in his haste. 
 
-P-A-G-E-145

“Hurry up and open them!” said Jensina. “Perhaps 
they’re to tell us where she is.” 
“What’s this?” asked Poor Cecco, coming in from the 
garden, with Harlequin at his heels. “What’s happened?” 
Bulka had torn open one of the letters, and there he 
read: 
“Dear BuLKa: 
I love you more than everything and I 
will make you a big cake with ammons and 
Icing and Silver balls, 
Your loving 
Tussy. 
P.S. There will be candels on the Cake. 
“Tubby loves me!’ Bulka shouted, waving the letter 
over his head. ‘Tubby really loves me! She wrote it 
down!” 
“Show us!” cried the dolls instantly. 
“Indeed I won't!” said Bulka. “It’s only written for 
me, so Hinksman!”” And gathering all his letters together, 
—an enormous armful—he hastened off to read them all 
alone by himself in the garden. 
Jensina looked down at the green fragments that had 
lately been the Money-Pig. 
“Do you suppose he’s dead?” she asked Poor Cecco in 
an awed voice. 
“Very likely,’ returned Poor Cecco. “If he is we'll have 
a funeral, but there’s no time to see about that now. Come 
199 out, Jensina, and I'll show you my trap!   
-P-A-G-E-146
  
How Bulka Got His Letters 141 
Ida was the only one who felt sorry for the Money-Pig. 
Not that she liked him—no one had done that—but she 
had a naturally soft heart, even for disagreeable people. 
So she set about sweeping him up, as well as she could, 
and put all the best pieces in the doll’s trunk to wait till 
there was time for a funeral. 
She had just brushed up the last chip when Gladys, who 
had wandered off and climbed up to the front window to 
look out, returned in great excitement. 
“Anna—Ida!” Gladys exclaimed. “What do you 
think? I just looked out of the window, and there are 
two enormous grey rats sitting behind the flower-pot on 
the front porch!”

Chapter XVI 
IN THE WILLOW TREE 
T’S really time, now, that we heard something about 
I Tubby herself. 
Luckily Tubby was very soft, so when Murrum 
dropped her down the hole in the willow tree she only 
bounced a little, and didn’t hurt herself at all. 
When her first fright was over, and she was able to look 
about her, she found that she was in a large round room 
with very high walls. There was a pale greenish light in 
the place, which came from the decayed wood with which 
the inside of the willow tree was lined, and which shone 
in the dark; everything looked very clean and nice, and 
there was a soft thick carpet of earth and wood-dust un- 
derfoot. High up, through the hole in the top, she could 
see a big bright star. 
In fact, if Tubby had found this place for herself, in- 
stead of being thrown into it so rudely by Murrum, she 
would have asked for nothing better. All her life she 
had wanted a house of her own, and had she been free 
to choose, this was just such a house as she would have 
chosen. Certainly there was the fear that Murrum might 
come back, but there seemed no danger of that for the 
142 
    
-P-A-G-E-148
     
In the Willow Tree 143. 
present. For the rest, it was as roomy as the toy-cupboard 
and far more tidy. If Bulka were only here to play with 
her, Tubby thought, they could have a wonderful time; 
and thinking of Bulka she remembered the unfinished letter 
and the pencil which she had thrust hastily into her pocket 
when Murrum seized her. 
Taking it out, she sat down with her back against the 
wall, licked the point of her pencil well, and began to 
write: 
Dear BuLKa: 
I am in a funny place it is a house in a 
tree. Murrum brought me it is lited with 
green lites so no more at present. Hoping 
you are well your loving 
Tussy. 
P.S. I will make you a cake with ammons 
and Icing and Silver balls. 
When she had finished writing Tubby walked round and 
round the room looking for a place to post her letter, but 
she could see no crack or cranny large enough, and the 
walls looked exactly the same all round. So at last she 
gave it up, and feeling somewhat dizzy from walking in 
a circle so long she cuddled down in a hollow in the floor 
and shut her eyes. 
When she awoke it was daylight, and the sun was shin- 
ing in through the hole in the top of the tree. Tubby could
-P-A-G-E-149
  144 ; Poor Cecco 
see blue sky, with silver-green willow leaves waving before 
it, high above her. Little ants were running up and down 
the willow tree walls. She sat up and began to feel very 
hungry. 
Suddenly there was a whirr of wings, and a spotted 
woodpecker with a scarlet head flew down inside the tree. 
He looked very astonished. 
“Hallo!” he exclaimed. “Where did you come from?” 
“I come from Tubbyland,” said Tubby instantly, “and 
I would like some breakfast.” 
“Tubbyland—” said the woodpecker, clinging upside- 
down to the wall in a way that made Tubby dizzy to look 
at. “Hm. I don’t know where that is! And as for break- 
fast, I’ve enough to do getting that for my own family, but 
if there’s any left over you shall have it.” 
He flew off, as good as his word, and in a few minutes 
he was back again but the breakfast he brought was not 
at all what Tubby had hoped for. It was a great fat worm, 
squirmy and unpleasant, and he dropped it so nearly into 
Tubby’s mouth, as she sat looking up, that she gave a 
little scream. He was off again instantly, and to hide her 
disappointment, and not to hurt the woodpecker’s feelings, 
she buried the worm as quickly as she could under the loose 
earth on the floor, where she would not be obliged to see it. 
She had only just finished, and was scraping the earth 
together again, when—bang—something hit her right on 
the nose. This time it was a nut, neatly cracked, so that 
  
-P-A-G-E-150
    In the Willow Tree 145 
Tubby had no trouble at all in getting the kernel out and 
eating it. It belonged to a squirrel, who was watching 
Tubby so intently that he let his nut fall without mean- 
ing to. 
Whirr! The woodpecker was back again, and with an- 
other worm, even fatter and squirmier than the first, dan- 
gling from his bill. 
“Open your mouth!” he called cheerfully. 
‘T've had plenty!” Tubby cried. “Indeed I have! 
Please don’t trouble any more!” 
“Nonsense!” said the woodpecker. “Young people 
must eat. I don’t know where you come from, but we'll 
see to it that you don’t starve. The children send this 
with their love!” 
And he dropped the worm plop into her lap. 
Luckily he didn’t wait to see what became of it. 
“T hate breakfast!” thought Tubby. For one worm after 
another, every few minutes, came tumbling down on her 
head. It kept her busy burying them all, and even then 
their tails would come wriggling up again, in a way that 
was most unpleasant. But presently, to her relief, the 
supply of worms gave out, or else the woodpecker thought 
she had had enough, for he ceased to appear, and Tubby 
was just shovelling the earth over the last and biggest 
worm of all when a voice overhead said: 
“What are you doing down there?’ 
Tubby looked up. She was getting a crick in her neck
-P-A-G-E-151
  146 Poor Cecco 
from having to tilt her head back so often. This time it 
was the squirrel again. 
“None of your business!” cried Tubby, for she was 
afraid he would tell the woodpecker. “I’m tidying my 
house,” she added with dignity. 
“Are you the new Janitor?” 
“Indeed I’m not,’ Tubby replied. 
“Then I don’t know why you are here,” said the squirrel. 
“You look like some kind of an orphan. Why did you 
eat my nut?” 
“I was hungry,” said Tubby. “I thought it was meant 
for me.” 
“Never mind,” the squirrel said. “Plenty more where 
that came from.” And he slapped his pocket. “T’ll come 
down and talk to you, if you like.” 
He came skipping down the side of the wall and dropped 
neatly to the floor, where he sat watching her with his 
bright beady eyes. 
“This basement isn’t so bad,” he remarked presently, “if 
you were to fix it up a little. Myself, I always prefer 
living in the upper story. But perhaps you had no choice.” 
“Indeed I hadn’t,” thought Tubby, but she didn’t tell 
the squirrel so. Instead she kept silence, and merely occu- 
pied herself with walking round and round the room, star- 
ing hard at the grey walls and humming as she did so, till 
at last the squirrel exclaimed: “Don’t do that! It makes 
me giddy! What are you looking for?”
-P-A-G-E-152
In the Willow Tree 147 
“T’m looking for a place to post my letter,” Tubby ex- 
plained. 
“Oh, I thought you might be looking for a job,” said the 
squirrel, “and you certainly won’t find one there. Can you 
read and write?” 
“Of course!” said Tubby proudly. 
“Then stop poking your fingers into those cracks and 
listen to me. I’ve got three children at home. They’re 
smaller than you, but about the same colour. That’s why 
I thought you might be an orphan. Do you want to come 
and teach them?” 
“Teach them what?” Tubby asked. 
“Anything you like,” said the squirrel, waving his tail 
vaguely. 
Tubby thought a little while. 
“Td like to see the house first,”’ she said. 
“It’s just up there,” said the squirrel. Looking up, 
Tubby saw for the first time a big hole halfway up the 
wall of the tree, which she had not noticed the night be- 
fore. 
“How do you get up?” she asked. 
“This way,” said the squirrel, and he ran up and down 
the wall two or three times, clinging with his claws and 
making a funny scratchy sound as he went. 
“T can’t do that!” Tubby said. 
“Tl help you,” said the squirrel. And he did, pushing 
her from behind and showing her where to put her paws.  
-P-A-G-E-153
  148 Poor Cecco 
It was easier than she expected. “If he can help me so 
far,” Tubby thought, “he might be able to help me right 
up to the top.” But first she wanted to see the squirrels’ 
home. 
It was in a hollow limb of the tree, that reached a long 
way back like a passage. It was stuffy in there and very 
warm, and it smelled of fur and hay and nutshells; either 
the squirrels ate all their meals in the bedroom or else they 
slept in the pantry, Tubby could not quite make up her 
mind which. But the sight of the baby squirrels, sitting 
up in bed with their little paws clasped and their round 
eyes gazing up at her, pleased her so much that she sat 
down then and there among the hay and nutshells and 
took them all three on her lap. 
“We want a story!” cried the baby squirrels. “Tell us 
a story!” 
Tubby began immediately: 
“Once there was a little mouse and he lived in Tubby- 
land and he wore blue trousers, and one day he said to his 
mother, ‘Mother, I would like a party! ‘Very well,’ said 
his mother, ‘you have been a good child,’ and she took him 
down a long passage and opened the door, and there was 
a Christmas tree with candles on it and shiny lights—” 
“T want to go down the passage!”’ cried the three baby 
squirrels all at once, and they began to jump up and down. 
“Wait aminute,” said Tubby. “I haven’t told you what 
they had to eat at the party, yet.”
-P-A-G-E-154
    In the Willow Tree 149 
“What had to eat?’ asked the baby squirrels, clasping 
their paws. 
Tubby went on hurriedly: “They had all kinds of cake 
and biscuits, and carrots and nuts and peppermint, and a 
great be-yootiful cake with orange icing and silver balls on 
it, and three candles—” 
y2 
“Want some nuts!” the baby squirrels began again. 
“Want some nuts!” 
“Don’t be little pigs!” said Tubby severely, for she 
didn’t like being interrupted. “How can I tell you stories 
if you jump up and down all the time? So they lived hap- 
pily ever after,” she finished in a loud firm voice. “And 
now one of you find me the comb and I'll comb your hair.” 
After much hunting the baby squirrels found the comb 
under the bedclothes, and Tubby set about making them 
tidy. This was a task she thoroughly enjoyed; their hair 
was so soft and silky and parted so perfectly down the 
back, and it was such fun to comb out those long feathery 
tails till they shone like spun glass. The only trouble was 
that as soon as she finished one squirrel and set him aside, 
he at once began bouncing about in the hay and made him. 
self all untidy again, until Tubby was almost in despair. 
“Were there ever such wriggly children!” she exclaimed. 
“Be quiet, do!” And she sat the last squirrel down very 
hard, hoping that he would stay this time, for she wanted 
to explore the rest of the house. 
Beyond the squirrels’ living-room the passage grew very
-P-A-G-E-155
150 Poor Cecco 
narrow, so Tubby had hard work to squeeze herself along. 
It began to smell musty and wormy, too; evidently no one 
had used it for a long while. But Tubby wriggled on, for 
she was bound to see what lay at the end. 
Soon it grew lighter. There was a small knothole in the 
wall, near the end of the passage, and as soon as Tubby 
caught sight of this she thought: “Now I can post my letter 
at last!” And pulling the letter from her pocket she poked 
it through the knothole and let it fall. 
As she turned round she bumped against something 
sharp. It was the corner of a box that had been pushed 
into a hollow right at the end of the passage. It was 
wedged there so tightly, covered over with dust and cob- 
webs, that Tubby had difficulty in pulling it out. But she 
managed it at last, and saw scratched on the lid the initials 
T. L. 
“That's for Tubbyland,” thought Tubby. “Perhaps 
there are chocolates in!” And lifting up the lid she looked 
inside. 
There were no chocolates in, but there was something far 
more interesting. There was, first of all, a gold thimble, 
and then a silver dime with a hole in it, and a bit of tinsel 
and some red worsted, and a ring with a bright green stone, 
and a bit of broken looking-glass and three safety-pins and 
a gilt watch and chain, just the right size for Poor Cecco. 
And when she had pulled all these things out, there, folded 
away at the bottom, under some scraps of coloured paper   
-P-A-G-E-156
In the Willow Tree 151 
and silk, was a brand-new red velvet coat with gold but- 
tons, and a little pair of sky-blue trousers trimmed with 
silver braid! 
They might have been made to the very measure of 
Bulka! 
Tubby’s paws shook with excitement as she folded the 
clothes up again and tumbled everything back into the 
box. She could hear footsteps along the passage. It was 
the squirrel, come back to see how she was getting along. 
“Look what I found!” cried Tubby. “Look what I 
found! There’s T.L. on it. It came from Tubbyland!” 
2 
“That's a queer thing!” said the squirrel, peering into 
the box with his head on one side. “That must have be- 
longed to old Miss Magpie. She rented this house before 
we had it, and from what I hear she was a terrible old 
miser. All sorts of things she had, stored away, and they 
do say she didn’t come by the half of them honestly, either. 
I wouldn’t be at all surprised if she stole these! Anyway 
you're welcome to them if they’re any use to you, for ’m 
sure I don’t want the house cluttered up.” 
And while Tubby held her pinafore out he very oblig- 
ingly stowed everything into it, the box being too big to 
carry. 
That evening, after she had tucked the baby squirrels 
into bed, tidied up the nutshells, and bidden Mr. Squirrel 
good-night, Tubby sat on the floor at the bottom of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
  152 Poor Cecco 
tree, with her treasures spread about her. She unfolded 
the little coat and trousers, folded them again, laid them 
in every possible position to see how beautiful they looked. 
How pleased Bulka would be! How fine he would look 
with these elegant blue trousers on, and the red coat but- 
toned down the front! 
Oh, why wasn’t Bulka here! 
A great tear rolled down and splashed on the blue vel- 
vet. Anxiously Tubby wiped it off with the hem of her 
pinafore, but it was no use; another fell, and another— 
She pushed the clothes aside and sat very still, blinking 
hard. 
Dusk fell; the walls about her shone once more with 
their soft greenish light. Poor Tubby felt very lonely 
and very homesick. Never had she missed Bulka so much. 
She groped in her pocket for the pencil. There was just 
one tiny scrap of paper left, all crumpled, and smoothing 
it out she tried to write. But the words wouldn’t come, 
and the pencil danced up and down before her eyes. 
Suddenly, on the outside wall of the tree she heard, very 
faint and far off, a tiny tapping! 
  
-P-A-G-E-158

THE LETTER FROM THE SKY 
1 OU see,” explained Poor Cecco, “if Murrum hap- 
pens to walk by here, and if he only happens to 
put his paw on that piece of wood, then this will 
pull that, and that ¢i2s—and then the whole stick will fall 
down right on his back!” 
“A lot of good that will do!” said Jensina. 
They were in the garden, by the onion bed, looking at 
the trap which Poor Cecco had invented, while Harlequin 
stood by, well pleased with his share in the work. 
“Anyway it will give him a good fright,’ Poor Cecco 
retorted. 
“Why did you put it here?’ Jensina objected. “Mur- 
rum doesn’t eat onions, does he?” 
“Because it’s the only place where the earth is soft 
enough. You don’t seem to understand, Jensina,” he went 
on indignantly, “that it took ages digging that hole out!” 
“T’ve known a lot of cats,” Jensina remarked, ‘“‘but I’ve 
only known one that was an idiot, and he got drowned in 
the buttermilk pail 
“TI wonder where Bulka is?” said Poor Cecco after a mo- 129 
ment, wishing to change the conversation. 
153
-P-A-G-E-159
  154 Poor Cecco 
“T thought I heard him calling a minute ago,”’ Harlequin 
replied. “Look, there he comes!” And he pointed down 
the garden path. 
Bulka, when he left the house, had, after some search 
for a quiet nook, settled down with his armful of letters 
under the shade of a rhubarb plant. The rhubarb stems 
were tall; the broad leaves spread out like a tent, and 
beneath their shelter he felt secure from prying eyes. 
Spreading the letters out, he read them all through, one 
by one, and as he read his little heart trembled with emo- 
tion. Dear Tubby, what beautiful things she had written 
here and all for him alone! 
He couldn’t sit still any longer; he must jump up and 
wander about in the sunshine and think of it all. With 
the precious letters, tied all together by a strong grass- 
blade, clutched close to his heart, he skipped along, up one 
border and down the next, paying no particular attention 
to where he was going and only thinking of his dear Tubby, 
when, just as he paused to give an extra skip and wriggle 
—ping!—something fell right on the top of his head! 
It was the very letter which Tubby, as you will remem- 
ber, had posted through the hole in the willow tree branch! 
Certainly that letter had lost no time on the way. 
Bulka rubbed his head, looked up at the green branches 
above him, down at the ground, and saw the letter lying 
there, addressed to him, on the garden path. His first 
thought was that it had somehow dropped from the packet
-P-A-G-E-160
     The Letter from the Sky 155 
in his arms. But no, the grass band was still unbroken; 
nothing was missing. 
He opened the letter and read: 
Dear BULKA: 
Iam ina funny place it is a house in a tree 
Murrum brought me It is lited with green 
lites— 
‘When he had read as far as this Bulka started off at a run, 
across the herb borders, through the marigold thicket, up 
one path and down the next, calling loudly for Poor Cecco 
and Harlequin. 
“T’ve got a letter from Tubby!” he cried breathlessly, 
when at last he caught sight of Harlequin’s head above the 
onion tops. 
“We know,” Jensina said. “You told us. Goodness, 
Bulka, you’re out of breath!” 
“Tt’s a new letter,” he told them. ‘It fell out of the 
sky!” 
“Show me!” said Poor Cecco. And he read it aloud. 
Plainly, if the letter were true, Tubby was in a tree. 
But which tree? They looked round. The whole garden 
was full of trees. 
“Where did you find it?’ Poor Cecco asked. 
Bulka thought, staring about him, and his face grew 
doubtful. “TI don’t know,” he said at last. “It just fell 
on me.”
-P-A-G-E-161
156 Poor Cecco 
“But surely you remember? Where were you walk- 
ing?” 
“I was walking—I was walking everywhere!” said 
Bulka. Which was very nearly true. “I’d been all over 
the garden, and then it fell on me, and I ran—and I ran, 
and I couldn’t find you!” 
“T call that silly!” said Jensina. 
But Poor Cecco, seeing that Bulka was very near to tears 
_ —a thing that had not happened for a long time, for dur- 
ing his travels he had learned to be quite brave—said 
kindly: “Never mind, Bulka! Tubby’s in a tree, that we 
know, and we'll hunt the garden over till we find her, if 
it takes us all night!” 
All the others came running when they heard the glad 
news—even the Express Wagon rumbled along, in case he 
should be needed on ambulance duty—and together they 
set out to search the garden from end to end. 
It took them a long while. They began with the small- 
est trees first—like the rose trees—because they were the 
easiest. Some of them were so small that it would hardly 
have been possible for the Easter Chicken, let alone Tubby, 
to have been hidden in them, but as Poor Cecco said, it 
was best to leave nothing untried. So at each one they 
peered and tapped and listened. 
There was some discussion between Harlequin and the 
Wooden Engine as to whether the raspberry canes were 
trees or flowers, but this Poor Cecco decided. He said they 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
    The Letter from the Sky 157 
were vegetables. While they ran to and fro among the 
garden beds the Express Wagon kept pace with them, as 
nearly as he could, on the path. 
They all worked with a will. Anna got tangled in a 
fallen pea-vine. Bulka scratched himself in the currant 
bushes, but still they kept on, tapping and calling, till 
gradually the sun sank lower and the shadows began to 
lengthen. 
It was nearly dusk when they found themselves, thor- 
oughly disheartened, in the corner beyond the parsley bed. 
Suddenly Anna, whose upturned eyes were invaluable in 
a search of this kind, exclaimed: 
“Isn’t that a tree?” 
It was the willow, its huge grey trunk looming above 
them, grey and enormous. It was so big to their eyes that 
none of them before had even thought of it as a tree at 
all. Now, at Anna’s remark, they looked up. Certainly 
there were branches on it, and sprays of green leaves here 
and there. 
“It’s a mountain,” said the Engine. 
“No,” said Poor Cecco, “it is a tree. It has bark. But 
it is a much too large tree.” 
“Do you suppose Tubby’s there?” Gladys whispered, 
overawed. 
Bulka’s heart sank at the thought of Tubby, shut up in 
that enormous fortress. But he rushed up and began to 
pound on the rough grey bark.
-P-A-G-E-163
  158 Poor Cecco 
There was no answer. 
“We must try all the way round,” Poor Cecco said. 
So all the way round they walked, tapping and listen- 
ing. Suddenly Bulka, who had his ear glued to the trunk, 
cried, “Listen, all of you! I hear something!” 
Instantly they all stood still. Somewhere within the 
tree could be heard a distinct answering tap. 
“It’s Tubby!” cried Bulka. “It’s Tubby! Tubby,” 
he called, “is that you?” 
Quite clearly he heard the tiny voice: 
“Yes, Bulka!” 
“Where are you, Tubby?” he asked. 
And again the tiny voice whispered back: 
“In Tubbyland, Bulka!” 
“I told you!” said Gladys triumphantly. “I told you 
all along that’s where she was. Now at any rate we know 
where that wretched Tubbyland is!” 
But the others paid no heed. They all had their ears 
to the tree—except naturally the Wooden Engine, who 
kept exclaiming: “What is she saying? What does she 
say?’ and hopping up and down on his wheels with ex- 
citement. 
“How can we get her out?’ Harlequin asked. 
How indeed? In vain they walked round and round 
the tree; there was no sign of a door anywhere, and of 
course they knew nothing of the hole in the top. 
“We might tunnel underneath,” Poor Cecco said. And 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
The Letter from the Sky 159 
he began to dig, but his paws soon came against the hard 
      
      
    
   
   
   
      
      
      
    roots, and he was forced to stop. 
“Maybe she’ll eat her way out!” suggested the Lion 
hopefully. 
No one thought this very likely. Harlequin stared at the 
tree, saying, “Hey Presto!” but as usual with no result. 
“At any rate,” said Poor Cecco, “we won’t desert her!” 
“We'll stay by the tree all night!” declared the Lion. 
And this they prepared to do, each at his station, leaning 
with their backs against the tree, while the Engine and 
the Express Wagon parked themselves side by side, within 
easy call, at the edge of the path. 
Night fell; the moon shone out; every few minutes Bulka 
could be heard whispering: “Tubby, are you asleep? 
Good-night, Tubby!” 
And in the branches above them a black form crouched, 
sleek and still. It was Murrum, thoroughly well pleased 
with his performance. There he sat, and stared down 
with pale contemptuous eyes on the faithful watchers gath- 
ered round the tree. 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
Chapter XVII 
THE RESCUE 
RESENTLY Poor Cecco felt some one nudging 
him. It was Jensina, who had crept softly round 
from the other side of the tree. 
“Listen,” she whispered. “Listen, I have an idea!” 
“What is it?’ Poor Cecco whispered back. 
Jensina, standing there on tiptoe, looked strangely ex- 
cited. Her eyes shone in the moonlight. 
“You know the rats? Do you remember what the Iron 
Grenadier said? Oh, Poor Cecco, suppose we get the rats 
to gnaw the tree and let Tubby out?” 
Ee 
“Jensina!” he exclaimed. “It’s wonderful! But they 
could never gnaw this tree through!” 
“Rats can do anything,” Jensina said. 
“They aren’t here.” 
“They are. Sh-sh! I never told you, but Gladys saw 
them. The Easter Chicken told me. They are sitting on 
the front porch.” 
“Have you got the Tooth?” 
“Tt’s here,” said Jensina. “I didn’t dare leave it in the 
house.” She showed him the mysterious object, in its 
160   
-P-A-G-E-166
  The Rescue 161 
silver-paper wrapping. Poor Cecco gazed at it for a mo- 
ment in silence. 
“Oh, Jensina, aren’t you afraid? Let me go!” he en- 
treated. 
“No,” replied Jensina firmly. “I took the Tooth, and 
it’s I who must bargain with them. But you may keep 
quite near me,” she added. 
Brave as she was, Jensina’s heart went thump—thump, 
as she advanced along the path towards the house. Hastily 
Poor Cecco had warned the others of her plan, and while 
he walked beside her they followed in a body, clinging 
to one another for protection, yet thrilled with curiosity 
to see what was going to happen. 
And now they had reached the last patch of open moon- 
light between the lilac bush and the dark shadow of the 
porch. Here Jensina paused, while Poor Cecco whispered 
his last entreaties. 
“Now, do be careful, Jensina! Remember what the 
Grenadier told you. Make them promise everything first, 
and don’t make a muddle of it!” 
“Do you think I’m an idiot?’ she demanded. 
These words, so characteristic of Jensina’s brave spirit, 
did much to restore his confidence. He stood back, as she 
bade him, and alone Jensina strode forth into the patch 
of moonlight. 
Immediately, from the porch shadow, the two rats came 
forward to meet her. Poor Cecco and Bulka recognised
-P-A-G-E-167
  162 Poor Cecco 
them at once; they were the two policemen rats who had 
followed them all along. They looked bigger and fiercer 
than ever. On they came, their whiskers twitching, their 
hind legs stretched behind, and within a few inches of 
Jensina they paused, sat up, and waited. 
Jensina began to speak in the rat language, slowly at 
first, and then more rapidly. The rats nodded. Jensina 
pointed down the garden. The rats nodded again. She 
raised her hand, and the watchers could see distinctly the 
silver-paper shining in the moonlight. 
The rats saw it too; one of them took a step forward, 
but with a swift gesture Jensina warned him back. Still 
holding the Tooth, she repeated, very slowly and distinctly, 
every word that she had said before, pausing every now 
and then to think whether she had left anything out. 
The rats nodded once more, and now their faces were 
pleased and friendly. The fattest rat bowed. Then, while 
Poor Cecco fairly held his breath with suspense he came 
forward, and stretching out his paw politely took from 
Jensina’s hand the Tooth. Placing it in his mouth, he 
made one leap, and where he went does not matter, for 
he vanishes from this story forever, and the tooth with 
him. 
Instantly there was a scuffling and squeaking. From 
every bush, from every patch of shadow, rats appeared. 
Grey rats, brown rats, old and young, dozens and dozens 
of them. Bulka gave a squeal of fright, but this time the
-P-A-G-E-168
The Rescue 163 
rats paid no attention to him. Straight down the garden 
path they poured, scattering the toys in their course, over 
the parsley bed, right to the old willow, and by the time 
the toys had pulled themselves together and hurried back, 
they were already hard at work gnawing a hole in the side 
of the tree. 
“Look!” Jensina cried, clapping her hand. “They’re 
cutting a doorway! Aren’t they clever? I told you they 
could do anything!” 
The rats were in fact working in a circle, clinging with 
their feet to the bark while they gnawed. Soon the saw- 
dust began to fall in a powdery heap that grew rapidly 
larger. 
“Jensina!” Bulka cried. “How can I ever thank you!” 
Jensina indeed was the heroine of the moment. Even 
the dolls smiled and tried to make up for the mean way 
they had acted. How they had misjudged her! If only, 
Gladys thought, she had known beforehand what an im- 
portant person Jensina really was! 
Meantime Anna, always timid, had been so alarmed by 
the sudden flood of rats that she ran away up the side path, 
straight towards the onion bed. Staring up at the sky 
as always, she never saw Poor Cecco’s trap until she had 
stumbled right on it. The stick came down with a whack, 
one corner of Anna’s green meadow sank into the hole 
Poor Cecco had so carefully dug, and stuck fast; there she 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
    164 Poor Cecco 
stayed, tilted perilously sidewise, snivelling with fear and 
pain and ringing her bell loudly for help. 
This time the Lion heard her. For all that he was a 
Lion, the nearness of those rats, and their long white teeth, 
made him strangely uncomfortable inside, and he was only 
too glad of any excuse to move away. 
Tenderly he helped Anna out of the pit, and dried her 
tears, and together they stood in the moonlight side by side. 
“If you would only flee with me to the jungle, dear 
Anna,” the Lion murmured for the hundred and first time, 
“this sort of thing wouldn’t happen!” 
“Tm always fleeing,” returned Anna pettishly, for her 
back still smarted where the stick had hit it, “and look what. 
comes of it! Even my green meadow is no longer safe 
nowadays! Not but what one might as well de in the 
jungle and have done with it,” she added rather more 
graciously, “with all those nasty rats about!” 
And bending her head to simper at the Lion, she released 
it rather too suddenly, producing a loud and prolonged 
“baa-a-a!” which startled even herself. 
“Your voice is like music,” the Lion whispered, gazing 
at her adoringly. 
And Anna simpered again. 
The carpenter rats had worked so hard that by now they 
had nearly bitten through the tree. The toys stood round, 
breathless with excitement, while the sawdust fell faster

HE leader of the rats held out a folded yellow paper. 
“Sign on the dotted line, please,” he said. “And 
here’s wishing you and the young gentleman every happi- 
ness!”

and faster, and at last the section of bark, round which they 
had been gnawing, began to tremble. 
Bulka, who had disappeared, came running up, carrying 
the blue beads which he had just fetched from the toy- 
cupboard. : 
And now the rats stopped working, wiped their fore- 
heads, and drew back. The leader, clinging with his paws, 
gave one last bite, and the bark fell outwards, leaving a 
neat arched doorway through which, after a moment’s 
hushed suspense, Tubby herself walked proudly forth, 
bearing in one paw the scarlet jacket and in the other the 
sky-blue trousers trimmed with braid. 
“Bulka!” cried Tubby. 
“Tubby!” cried Bulka. 
And they fell in each other’s arms. 
The leader of the rats came up to Jensina, holding out 
a folded yellow paper which he drew from his breast pocket. 
“Sign on the dotted line, please!” he said. 
She wrote her name in large letters: JENSINA. 
“Thank you,” said the rat, glancing at it. “And if you 
ever need another little job done, remember we give 
prompt service and are always willing to oblige.” 
The second policeman rat also came forward and shook 
hands. 
“A fine run you give us, young lady,” he said, “but we 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
  168 Poor Cecco 
don’t hold no grudge for that, now that all’s friendly-like 
between us, as you may say. So bygones is bygones, and 
here’s wishing you and the young gentleman every hap- 
piness!” 
Jensina glanced hastily at Poor Cecco, but he had not 
heard; he was talking to Tubby. 
“Thank you very much!” she said. “But you are quite 
mistaken; we are not even engaged!” 
“Well, you never know your luck!” returned the rat, 
smiling broadly, and he touched his forehead and moved 
away. 
Harlequin gave a sudden cry: “There’s Murrum!” 
Murrum was still crouched on the limb above them, gaz- 
ing down in fury and switching his tail. It was this black 
tip, moving in the moonlight, which had caught Harle- 
quin’s eye. 
“Aha!” cried the rats. “We'll soon settle that!” 
And with a mighty whoop they began to scamper up the 
willow trunk. Murrum did not wait to meet them; he 
dropped to the ground, his ears laid back and his fur bris- 
tling, and made off over the parsley bed, the rats in glad 
pursuit. 
“They can’t really hurt him,” said Jensina. “They only 
want to give him a good fright.” 
Bulka had hung the blue beads solemnly round Tubby’s 
neck. He stood now, beaming with happiness, while she

carefully measured the little jacket and trousers against 
him. They were exactly right! 
“Oh, Tubby!” he whispered. ‘Where did you get these 
lovely clothes?’ 
“Aren’t they nice?’ she returned proudly. “I bought 
them in Tubbyland!”

THE WEDDING 
ND now, of course, there must be a wedding, and— 
of course—the wedding must take place in Willow 
Tree Hall, where, after the ceremony, a grand ball 
and reception would be held in honour of the bride and 
bridegroom. 
Great preparations were afoot. Bulka’s costume was _ 
already provided; Tubby, by rights, should wear the white 
satin petticoat and veil, but Gladys had used the petticoat 
for so long that it was quite shabby, though the veil might 
yet pass muster, after being washed and mended, and the 
spray of orange blossom attached to it was still quite good. 
So the dolls and Jensina sewed Tubby a new frock out 
of the pieces of coloured silk that had been in the Tubby- 
land box. It had purple sleeves and a bit of pink down 
the front and was trimmed with tinsel lace. With it she 
wore the blue beads. 
Poor Cecco, who was to give Tubby away, wore a green 
ribbon tied round his middle, and the gilt watch and chain, 
a present from the bride. 
Virginia May, Gladys and Jensina were bridesmaids, 
with white ribbons and bouquets of wild parsley blossom.

  The Wedding 171 
The wedding gifts were laid out on the cigar-box, cov- 
ered with a blue cloth. 
Jensina gave her drinking cup and the green glass stop- 
per; Poor Cecco his penny. Gladys gave her last year’s 
straw hat, retrimmed, Virginia May a hair-ribbon for 
Tubby’s ears, and the Easter Chicken got up early and 
picked a large bunch of flowers. Harlequin gave a striped 
pebble that had been in a brooch. Anna, the Engine and 
the Lion gave a saucepan, three spoons and a bent napkin- 
ring, wrapped up in paper. They really belonged in the 
toy-cupboard, but every one was delighted that Tubby 
should have them. The rats presented a blue egg-cup, 
slightly chipped, an almost new tea-strainer and a silver 
pencil, sent all the way from the ash-heap country by Rat- 
Express, and the house-mice, to show their gratitude to the 
toys for driving Murrum away, brought seven thimblefuls 
of rice, a perfectly good cheese rind and a long pin with 
a pink head, which they had found under the floor- 
boards. 
And now the happy moment had arrived. The Express 
Wagon, making a fine clatter, drove up with the guests. 
Harlequin stood ready, the musical-box was all wound 
up to play; Tubby, in her veil and orange blossoms, and 
Bulka with his little scarlet coat and sky-blue trousers, 
were just about to kneel down side by side upon Ida, who 
had begged this privilege— 
But they didn’t. They couldn’t, because Ida wasn’t
-P-A-G-E-179
  2 Poor Cecco 
there. And on enquiry, it appeared that no one had seen 
Ida since the early morning. Without Ida the wedding 
could not very well proceed, but just as they were all get- 
ting quite concerned the Easter Chicken called out: 
“Here’s Ida! And, my goodness, look what she’s bring- 
ing!” 
Ida, with her tender heart, had felt really upset when 
she saw the Money-Pig in pieces on the floor. All through 
the day, at intervals, she thought of him, put tidily away 
in the doll’s trunk. And now, when Tubby was found 
again and every one so happy it seemed too bad the Money- 
Pig, unpopular as he was, should be missing all the good 
times. 
So atter much hunting about Ida found an old tube of 
glue in a box on the pantry floor, and very secretly, while 
the others were busy, she set herself down in a corner of 
the toy-cupboard beside the doll’s trunk and proceeded to 
glue him together. It was a hard job; many of the pieces 
were chipped and wouldn’t fit, one ear was lost entirely, 
though Ida searched high and low for it; but in the end 
she got him together somehow, and more or less like his 
former self, except that the slit in his back would always 
remain a little crooked, try as she might. Well pleased 
with her labour, she had to wait till the glue was dry 
enough for him to be moved, and he could be brought, with 
the help of the Wooden Engine, as far as the Willow Tree. 
So there he stood at last, rather patchy in parts, shaky still
-P-A-G-E-180
    The Wedding 173 
on his legs and not a little ashamed of himself—but rav- 
enously hungry. 
Hurrying forward with many apologies Ida laid herself 
on the ground. Tubby and Bulka knelt down on her, side 
by side. In a hushed silence Bulka took the ring with the 
green stone and slipped it over Tubby’s paw, where it fitted 
easily. The musical-box burst out with a triumphant 
2” 
“Tum tum tum tumptity!” Harlequin waved his wand 
above them, saying “Hey Presto!” and immediately they 
were married. 
Scarcely was the ceremony over, and every one had 
crowded round to kiss the bride, than the Lion came for- 
ward, with Anna sidling along behind. They too wanted 
to get married, seeing how simple it all was. Harlequin 
was willing, but Poor Cecco put his foot down. 
“Nonsense!” he declared. “One wedding at a time! 
It’s Tubby’s turn to-day, and besides, there are no more 
gifts ready. Anna has spent all the summer shilly-shallying 
on account of that stupid green meadow of hers, and now 
she must just content herself with being engaged for the 
present!” 
So they were engaged, formally; Anna, after some coy- 
ness, consented to wear a grass ring round her left ankle, 
and she took off her bell and hung it about the Lion’s neck. 
“You were quite right,” Gladys whispered to Poor 
Cecco. “Anna could have made up her mind long ago, if 
she had had any sense.”

  174 Poor Cecco 
That night there was a grand ball in the Willow 
Tree. 
The walls were hung with garlands of flowers; refresh- 
ments were set out, and the squirrel arrived, bringing a 
whole bag of nuts. In the middle stood Tubby’s wedding- 
cake, with Icing anp Almonds ann Silver Balls. And 
at least three candles. The Toad, with a white apron 
over his spotted vest, acted as waiter and handed the 
plates. The three baby squirrels, too small to take part, 
were allowed to look on from their window until ten 
o'clock. Every one wore their best, and in addition to 
the Musical-box the Grasshopper and Crickets’ Jazz Band 
was engaged to play the dance music. 
Never had there been such a gathering; the mice had 
been busy all morning carrying invitations, and the guests 
came from far and near. 
Softly the green light shone out from the old willow 
tree walls, making the whole scene beautiful. Tubby 
danced with Bulka, Jensina with Poor Cecco, Gladys with 
Harlequin. Anna lumbered, giggling, through a quadrille 
with the Lion and the Engine—all found partners, and 
every little while Bulka would break away from the dance 
and turn somersaults for pure joy. 
Every one had a wonderful time. Even the Money-Pig 
made himself agreeable. He could still only eat soft food; 
it was whispered that he might have to live on cake for 
the rest of his days, and he certainly began now with such 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
The Wedding 175 
haste that Bulka had to drag him away, declaring that 
some must be left for the rest of the guests! 
In a pause in the music Poor Cecco stood by Jensina, 
gazing on the happy throng. 
“Isn’t it nice?” he said. “Oh, Jensina, how well every- 
thing has turned out! Look at Tubby! Look at Bulka, 
all over cake crumbs! Really, it almost makes one 
feel—” 
“Yes?’? murmured Jensina, gazing shyly up at him. 
She was thinking of what the policeman rat had said. 
“makes one feel like standing on one’s head!” fin- 
ished Poor Cecco somewhat hastily, for he had caught the 
look in Jensina’s eye. 
Jensina’s natural common sense returned to her. 
“You needn’t think I’m in a hurry to get married, 
either,” she retorted instantly, “because I’m not. I much 
prefer a life of adventure and combat!” 
“And from what I know of you,” Poor Cecco gallantly 
returned, “‘you’re likely to get plenty of it! And now I 
must go and dance with Tubby!” 
And with this he slipped away, just as the music struck 
up once more. 
“Hey Presto!” said Harlequin.

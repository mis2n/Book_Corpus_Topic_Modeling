REPORT.   
Inasmuch as the General Assembly will not be in regular session 
until another annual report shall be made from this office, ai] mat- 
’ ters pertaining to our system of Public Instruction, needing special 
legislation, are omitted in this report. I propose only to deal with 
the work of the Public Schools, including such statistics as the law 
requires. In the general prosperity which a bountiful Providence 
has vouchsafed to the people of Tennessee during the past year, the ” 
cause of popular education has fully shared. Personal visitation 
and observation together with the evidence furnished by the re- 
ports of County Superintendents, have satisfied me that the interest 
in favor of our system, as fixed by the Act of 1878, and Acts 
amendatory thereof, is steadily increasing and assuming a more in- 
telligent and well defined form of action. Active opposition to 
the system has almost ceased, and universal recognition of the 
fact that the State should maintain “a uniform system of Public 
Schools” is nearly assured. The growth of population continually 
requires additional educational facilities; but our increasing wealth 
at the same time supplies the means for meeting the new demands, 
so that our school interests are steadily keeping pace with the gen- 
eral progress of the State. This fact is clearly shown by the large 
excess of receipts of school money for the last scholastic year, over 
those of any former year. It will be seen by reference to the 
statistics of Table Number VI, that these receipts amounted to 
$1,204,738.40, including the balance on hand July Ist, 1882, and 
exclusive of the receipts from five counties which failed to make a 
financial report.

CLERK AND TREASURER’S RECORD BOOK. 
Section 21 of the Acts of 1873, chapter xxv, requires the Clerk 
of each school district to keep in a bound. volume a cash: accouht 
and a record of his own official acts. It has been the custom of 
the Clerks to purchase such books and pay for the same out of 
the District School Fund. It was. a difficult matter for the 
clerks to purchase a book well suited to the purpose. In many 
instances therefore, no record was kept. To secure a compliance 
with this important provision of the law, a bound book prepared by 
the State printer, especially for this purpose, and with the addition 
of blank forms for each enumeration of the scholastic population, 
has been approved by me, and furnished the District Clerks of the 
State at a cost of sixty cents a volume. ‘his arrangement is in the 
interest of economy, since it reduces the cost of such a book at 
least 50 per cent. 
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS, 
I confidently look forward to the time when every county Super- 
intendent in the State may give his entire time and best efforts to 
the general supervision of the schools in his county. In the great 
majority of counties, the County Courts have chosen their County 
Superintendents from the very best men, but inadequacy of ecom- 
pensation prevents many of them from devoting themselves to the 
arduous duties which the law imposes upon them. The work 
of proper supervision of schools requires more time than they can 
spare from private affairs, with such little remuneration. Yet I ven- 
ture to say that, with very few exceptions, a more earnest and compe- 
tent corps of workers cannot be found than the County Superintend- - 
ents of Public Schools in Tennessee. I cannot therefore too strongly
-P-A-G-E-11
( 10 ) 
urge the importance of a more adequate compensation to these offi- 
cers, both as an act of justice to them and asa measure of efficiency 
to the schools, ‘ 
NORMAL INSTITUTES, 
The only professional training given a majority of our teachers, 
is obtained in Normai Institutes. These Institutes “are a source of . 
much information to teachers, and exercise a very salutary influence. 
wtpon the people.” They have been encouraged by favor and with 
enthusiasm. Six State Normal Institutes were held during the 
past summer, three for white, and three for colored teachers, and 
each for a period of four weeks. All were aided by the Peabody 
Education Fund, as follows: Institute held at Memphis for col- 
ored teachers, $150. West Tennessee Normal, held at Jackson 
for white teachers, $440. Middle Tennessee Normal Institute for 
colored teachers, held at Nashville, $150. State Normal Institute 
for white teachers, held at Knoxville, in the University of Tennes- 
see, $550. East Tennessee Normal, for colored teachers, held at 
Knoxville, $100, making a total of $1,390. 
The State Normal Institute at Knoxville, for white teachers, was 
also aided by an appropriation of $300 from the University Fund. 
In these Institutes were employed some of the best teachers in our 
graded schools, and several of the ablest professors in our higher 
Institutions of learning. 
INSTITUTE AT MONT EAGLE. 
A most excellent Institute was also held at Mont Eagle, on the 
Cumberland Mountains, in Grundy County, under the auspices of 
the Mont Eagle Sunday School Association, a private enterprise, 
and under the able management of Prof. James E. Scobey. This 
was sustained alone by private enterprise, and for its success much 
credit is due, both to Prof. Scobey and Rev. J. H. Warren, of Mur- 
freesboro. Both these gentlemen took an active interest in getting 
up and carrying cn the work. They were encouraged by the co- 
operation of many citizens. 
COUNTY NORMAL INSTITUTES. 
Very successful County Normal Institutes evincing extraordinary 
enterprise and public spirit. on the part of the County Superintend- ~ 
ents, by whom they were managed, were held in the following.
-P-A-G-E-12
(11) 
counties, viz: Weakley, Marshall, Wilson, Lincoln, Loudon, 
Roane, Greene, and perhaps others. These were held for a term of 
four weeks. No one can fail to see the good results following such 
a course of training. 
COUNTY INSTITUTES. 
In addition to these Institutes under the supervision of the 
State Superintendent, in many. counties, have been held County In- 
stitutes or Educational ‘Associations, which, according to reports of 
County Superintendents, have resulted in great good, both asa 
means of exciting a deeper interest on the part of the people, and 
of affording teachers an opportunity to better qualify themselves to 
impart instruction in the Public School curriculum of Tennessee. © 
CITY SCHOOLS. 
By request this department has been furnished -with special re- 
ports of Superintendeats of our city graded schools, which reports 
show these schools to be in a most prosperous condition. They are 
a source of much pride to the citizens of the various cities, having 
a system of graded schools. Especially are the public schools of 
Nashville mentioned in terms of the highest praise by prominent 
educators visiting the capital of the State. . 
PEABODY SCHOLARSHIPS. 
The following circular was issued from this office : 
OFFICIAL CIRCULAR IN RELATION TO NORMAL 
SCHOLARSHIPS. . 
  
Orrice or State Sup’r or Pusiic et ae: 
. May 1, 1883. 
Ly accordance with an act, passed March 30th, 1883, approved 
on same day, Ghapter CCLV., the sum of $10,000 annually was 
entrusted to the State Board of Education to be used to support 
the State Normal College, provided, that the General Agent of the 
Peabody Board of Trustees “shall allow to this State Peabody 
Scholarships on the same condition as those granted other States ;” 
and the General Agent of the Peabody Education Fund having of- 
ficially notified me that he has allowed this State fourteen Peabody
-P-A-G-E-13
( 12) 
Scholarships, in compliance with the condition of said appropriation, 
the following rules and conditions are hereby officially promulgated 
for the benefit of all concerned.’ The requirements are high, and 
are prescribed by the Normal College itself, having been announced 
as follows: 
REQUIREMENTS FOR OBTAINING AND HOLDING PEABODY SCHOL- 
ARSHIPS AT THE NORMAL COLLEGE AT NASH- 
VILLE, TENNESSEE. 
1. The applicant fora scholarship must be at least seventeen 
years of age, present to the President of the College a certificate of 
irreproachable moral character, gentlemanly or lady-like habits, 
presumed gocd health, declare his intention to make teaching a pro- 
fession, must give a pledge to remain at the College two years, if 
the scholarship is continued so long, promise to submit cheerfully 
to all its requirements, in study, discipline, etc., and to teach in the 
Public Schools of his or her own State at least two years, if there 
is opportunity. 
2. The applicant must obtain from the State Superintendent of 
Public Instruction for his State, a certificate that he has passed a 
satisfactory examination before said Superintendent, or other com- 
petent person duly authorized, in the studies required for admission 
to the second or “ middle class ” at the College, viz: In Spelling, 
Reading, Penmanship, Grammar, and Analysis, Rhetoric, Geogra- 
phy, civil and physical, Arithmetic, Algebra, Book- keeping, Physi- 
ology, United States History, Elements of Geology. No particu- 
Jar text- books are prescribed for this examination. The candidate 
should give evidence of such knowledge of the above branches, as 
would justify omitting their further study. Students will also be 
examined at the College with reference to their classification, ete. 
3. Examiners are respectfully urged to make the required exam- 
ination thorough and complete, and thus save the candidate from 
possible rejection, when he offers himself for acceptgnce at the Col- 
lege. Examiners should consider themselves responsible for the 
persons they recommend. Persons who fail so far -in passing the 
entrance examination at the College, that they cannot make up 
easily and in a reasonably short time all deficiencies, will be re- 
jected. ' 
4, Gentlemen and ladies thus admitted, who complete the pre- 
‘
-P-A-G-E-14
(18 ) . 
scribed course of study and training satisfactorily, graduate regu- 
larly, and receive from the proper authorities a diploma, admitting 
them to the degree of “ Licentiate of Instruction.” (“1. I.”) 
5. Persons desiring to enter the senior class, will be examined 
at the College upon the studies of the middle class in addition to 
those prescribed above. Such students will not graduate with the 
senior class, but will pursue still more advanced studies another — 
year; and, if character, attainments, etc., justify, will be admitted 
at the close of their course to the usual College or University de- 
gree of Bachelor of Arts, (B. A.) None, however, except regular 
graduates, will be admitted to this class. 
6. The Peabody Scholarship money will not be paid until the 
student has been a member of the College one month, at which 
time, and at the close of each succeeding month, $25 will be paid 
to an amount not exceeding $200 for the year ; no payment will be 
made for the fraction of a month. It is expected that this money 
will be appropriated by the student to the payment of board and 
other College expenses first of all; and no certificate or diploma 
will be granted to any student known to be in arrears in these 
respects. 
7. These scholarships will, in no case, be continued to students 
whose rank or standing is low, whose general demeanor is objection- 
able, who do not give promise of usefulness as teachers, or whose 
health or other circumstances prevent constant attendance on, or 
performance of College duties. 
8. <A full report of each student’s class-standing, deportment, 
presumed ability to teach, etc., etc., is sent every term to the State 
Superintendent to be filed in‘his office for further reference. 
9. Students failing to complete their course of study according 
to the conditions prescribed, or to teach after graduating, are re- 
quired to refund the amount of money they have received from the 
“ Peabody Education Fund,” to the President of the College. 
10. Expenses—Gentlemen usually pay from $15 to $20 a month 
for board in approved boarding houses or private families. Ladies 
pay in best private families $18 to $20.2 month. Six dollarsa 
year is paid for the use of such books, ete., as are furnished by the 
College, and for a portion of the incidental expenses.

BOARD OF EXAMINERS. 
One scholarship is assigned to each of the ten Congressional dis- 
tricts of the State, for each of which a Board of Examiners will be 
appointed, to be composed of five experts, who will meet at some 
certain point in the district, at a time to be designated, but within 
the months of June, July, and August, and proceed to examine all 
the applicants for scholarships residing in the Congressional district, 
in all the branches of study required by the College. The exami- 
nation should be both oral and written, and should be conducted 
with the view solely to test the qualifications of the candidate. The 
record of the examination should be kept on a scale of one hun- 
dred, and the candidate receiving the highest average mark in this 
scale, will receive the certificate of recommendation to this office, 
unless there be a tie,'in which case the State Superintendent will 
review all the facts and make the appointment from the two highest. 
Three members of the Board shall constitute a quorum to conduct 
the examination. The names of the members of each Board will . 
be hereafter announced. The place for meeting of Examining

The remaining four scholarships will be appointed by the State 
Superintendent from pupils.in the Normal College, whose standing 
as scholars, and whose personal deportment, shall conform to the 
College standard for promotion. 
DISTRICTS FAILING TO APPOINT. 
Should any one of the Congressional districts fail to hold exami- 
nations and send a person for a scholarship, within the time pre- 
scribed in this circular (June, July, and August), the State Super- 
intendent will supply the vacancy by appointment of a qualified 
person. : : 
By the Act above referred to, the annual appropriation for sus- 
taining colored scholarships was increased to three thousand three 
hundred dollars, and fifty dollars of same was appropriated to each 
of two scholarships in every Senatorial district, making in all sixty- 
six colored scholarships in the State. 
The,State Board of Education has adopted the subjoined rules 
and regulations for the appointments to said scholarships, to which 
the attention of the several Senators is called, and their timely 
" action invoked.

STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The nineteenth annual session of the State Teachers’ Association 
was held at Gallatin Dee. 14th and 15th, 1883, The attendance 
was not large, but the interest was good, both on the part of the 
teachers and the citizens ofthetown. The citizens evinced great hos- 
pitality in. the entertainment of the members of the Association 
and other visitors, and manifested a very high appreciation of the 
work of the session. ~ 
The colored teachers held their State Institute in Nashville, 
Dec. 23, and report an interesting and profitable session. . 
TENNESSEE JOURNAL OF EDUCATION, 
Among the prominent agencies for bringing about a deeper and 
more general interest of teachers and school officers, and for pro- 
moting improved methods of instruction and school management, 
should be classed the Tennessee Journal of Education, edited by 
Hon. Leon Trousdale. 
PRESS OF THE STATE. 
The Press throughout the State have evinced great liberality by 
lending their influence in behalf of the cause of general education.

STATE NORMAL COLLEGE. 
This Institution which is now supported by the liberal appropria- 
tion from the State Treasury of $10,000 per annum, and by a con- 
tribution from the Peabody Education Fund of $9,000 per annum, 
being the only State Institution for the professional training of 
teachers, is deserving of the highest encouragement and the closest 
scrutiny on the part of the people. For an account of its opera- 
tions during the past year, reference is made to the report of the 
President, herewith submitted and included in the appendix. 
SAVING BY PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
By our statistical tables it is shown that the cost of tuition per 
pupil per month in private schools is $1.50, while the cost of tuition 
per pupil per month in the public schools is 73 cents, thas making 
a difference of 77 cents per pupil per month in favor of public 
schools. Taking into account the number of pupils enrolled in the 
schools of ninety counties of the State, (324,786,) this is a 
saving in these ninety counties of $250,085.22 per month, or 
$1,250,426.10 for a term of five months, These figures clearly in- 
dicate the economy involved in our public schools. All persons 
familiar with the cost of tuition in private schools must admit that 
the above average of $1.50 per pupil per month is a low estimate. 
NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION. | 
A convention of educators of the United States, in which a great 
majority of the States was represented was called by his Excellency, 
Governor Blackburn, of Kentucky, to meet in Louisville, in the 
month of September, during the continuance of the Southern Ex- 
position. A number of delegates having been appointed by your 
Excellency, attended and took an active part in the deliberations. 
The principal subject discussed was that of National Aid to Educa- 
tion on the basis of illiteracy, to be distributed among the States, 
and to be disbursed by their own agencies. After a long and ear- 
nest discussion of this important question, resolutions were adopted 
recommending to Congress to make liberal appropriations from the 
surplus in the Treasury, to be distributed pro vata annually, accord- 
ing to illiteracy for twelve years; and a commission was appointed 
to prepare a bill and memorialize Congress on this subject ; two of 
whom were selected from Tennessee, viz: Dr. O. P. Fitzgerald 
and myself. The commission have prepared and will submit a bill 
for the consideration of Congress.
-P-A-G-E-20
(19) 
This bill provides, “That the funds paid to the several States 
_ shall be apportioned and expended by their duly authorized officers 
among the counties or corresponding divisions of such States in 
proportion to the number of illiferate persons in the same between - 
the ages of ten and twenty-one, as shown by the United States cen- 
sus last preceding, and shall be applied within the same to the free’ 
common school education of children, without distinction of color, 
between and including the ages of six and twenty years.” 
Should this bill become a law, Tennessee will receive the sum of 
$4,951,470, to be distributed in twelve years, as-follows, viz: For 
each of the years 1884, 5-6; $660,196; for 1887, 8-9, each 
$495,147; for 1890, 1-2, each $330,098; for 1893, 4-5, each 
$165,049. 
' ‘The foregoing calculation is made on a per capita basis of illiter- 
ates between the ages of ten and twenty years, as provided in the 
first section of the bill, to-wit: First, second and third years, each 
year four dollars; fourth, fifth and sixth years, each year three dol- 
lars; seventh, eighth and ninth years, each year two dollars; and 
tenth, eleventh and twelfth years, each year one dollar. 
CONCLUSION. 
I am unwilling to close this report without expressing my very 
high appreciation of the valuable services rendered by my associate, 
€ol. Leon Trousdale, who, in the capacity of Clerk, has devoted 
himself to the duties of the office with preat fidelity and ability. 
To him more than any other man are the people of Tennessee in- 
debted for the progress, general development and present condition 
of our public school system. Having been State Superintendent 
for six years, he has given the subject much thought, and each term 
of his service has been characterized by a wise and conservative 
management of the affairs connected with the work entrusted to his 
eare. As Clerk, he has been entrusted with the entire labors and 
responsibilities of the office during my absence on official tours ; 
and to him belongs a large share of the credit for such efficiency 
as may be accorded to the administration of its duties. 
In my official intercourse with the people of the State, I have 
been impressed with the earnest interest and intelligent zeal mani- 
fested in behalf of the cause of popular education, and with the. 
_ desire almost everywhere evinced for a continued improvement of
-P-A-G-E-21
(20) 
- the schools. To this end they have ever shown a willingness to 
lend their aid, by throwing open their doors to teachers attending 
Institutes; and by such envouragement they are doing much to ele- 
vate the profession and enable teachers to better prepare themselves 
for the great work before them. With these and similar encour- 
‘agements, with a State abounding in natural resources, with an in- 
vigorating and health-giving climate, with a population noted for 
industry, enterprise and general public spirit, we have a future of 
great promise, and one that should prompt us to earnest endeavor 
and noble efforts. , 
Finally, I desire to tender my sincere thanks to your excellen- 
ey for wise and willing Counsel and for strong encouragement in 
my official labors. 
. Tuomas H. Parne.

STATE Norgwat CoLiece. 
  To the State Board of Education of Tennessee: 
GENTLEMEN :—The whole number of students at the State 
Normal College during the scholastic year ending September 1, 
1883, was 168, of whom 72 were from this State. At the Annual 
‘Commencement, May 30, a class of 46 graduated with the degree 
of “Licentiate of Instruction” and 4 with the University degree 
of “Bachelor of Arts,” having taken that of Licentiate previously. 
The health of the students have been unusually good. There 
has been no serious illness except in the case of one who came here 
with the liabilities upon him which occasioned his decease. This 
improved condition of the health of the students is greatly owing 
to changes in warming and ventilating class-rooms, and the estab- 
lishment of a “ Board of Health and Comfort,” among those, to 
whom is committed, under prescribed conditions, the regulation of 
the temperature of rooms, opening and shutting of windows and 
ventilation; the theory being that while the Janitor is to furnish 
ap abundant supply of heat for all occasions, those who are imme- 
diately affected by it are the best judges as to ‘how it should be 
applied. The occupants of each class-room select one of their 
number to take charge of the business, who is denominated the 
“Health Officer.” These persons thus selected compose the “Board 
of Health and Comfort,” and are expected to make the laws of 
health a special study. 
The 25 State scholarships established at the College were with 
difficulty disposed of, only 22 being taken on any terms. 
The State appropriation of $10,000 a year to the College, made 
April 6, 1881, was diminished not only by the amount of State 
scholarships, but also by a deduction of $2,500 a year for scholar- 
ships for people of “ African descent.” A statement of the man- 
ner in which the balance has been expended has been made.
-P-A-G-E-53
( 82 ) 
An appropriation of $10,000 annually for two years was made- 
by the Legislature at its last session and approved April 6, 1883. 
No part of this sum has as yet been expended. : 
The chief obstacles to the success of the College, as far as mem- 
bers are concerned, are of such a nature that time and persistent 
efforts alone will remove them. The greatest of these is not as 
many suppose, that suitable efforts have not been exerted to make 
the College known to the people: Any one who will take the 
trouble to look the matter up, will find that pen and voice, in pub- 
lic and private, have seldom been employed more generally and 
persistently respecting any enterprise, or that it lacks on the whole, 
appreciation, but looking upon it in a business light, and from a 
pecuniary standpoint, as so very many have to do, it seems to them: 
poor economy to place their children in an institution, however 
great its advantages, and how cheap the tuition, where there will 
not only be no money income from two or three years of time, 
while board must be paid and clothing bought, but which after all, 
offers such small pecuniary reward for all this expenditure, and for 
services as the profession of the teacher. A good clerkship or 
something of the kind is the “bird in hand which is worth two in 
the bush,” and hence is preferred. Time and unremitting effort 
alone will remove these obstacles. 
Respectfully submitted, 
EBEN 8. STEARNS, 
Chancellor of University of Nashville, and 
President State Normal College.

CITY SCHOOLS. 
  
NASHVILLE CITY SCHOOLS. 
NASHVILLE, December 31, 1883. 
Hon. Thos. H. Paine, State Superintendent of Public Instruction :_ 
Dear Sir :—In complying with your request for a report of 
the operation of the Public Schools of this city for the past year, 
I need only present the brief summary of facts and statistics to 
show that but little change has occurred in the management and 
history during .that interval. When as here a system of schools 
acceptable to a people has been established for thirty years, and is 
accomplishing reasonably fair results, there is seldom occasion for 
innovations or radical differences in methods. 
The scholastic enumeration was 316 greater than for the previous 
year, and there was an increase of 123 in the total enrollment. 
These figures and the fact that the per cent. of absence and tardi- 
ness were not greater than usual, show that there has been very 
little variation in attendance. This is especially a gratifying 
retrospection: in view of the frequent prevalence of contagious 
diseases, through fear of which some of the schools were for a time 
dismissed and all greatly disturbed. 
The record in tardiness is particularly noticeable as being the 
lowest yet attained. 
Financially the schools have been well provided for; the salaries 
of teachers and all accounts being paid monthly, and a balance of 
$8,952.73 left on hand at the close of the year. In addition to the 
disbursement of $89,197.30 by the Treasurer for ordinary purposes, 
the city has built, at a cost of $28, 000.00, two elegant and commo- 
dious houses for the accommodation of colored children. The 
annual cost of the schools has been increased some $6,000.00, as 
the result chiefly of diminishing sizes of classes, which of course 
required the employment of a greater number of teachers.

Mempuis, Tenn., July 1, 1883. 
To the Honorable Board of Education : 
GenrLemen—I know of no more appropriate subject with which 
to commence my report than that of health. In this respect we 
have been especially blessed the past session, having escaped even 
our accustomed annual visitor, the measles, which frequently hereto- 
fore has proved an ally to absenteeism to the extent of almost sus- 
pending some of the schools. The first monthly report showed 
2,960 pupils on the roll, a gain of 301 on the number reported for 
the corresponding time last year. The attendance steadily increased 
each month until it attained 3,297, the largest number recorded 
since March, 1878—a period of five years. The number on the roll 
when the schools closed in May, compared with the number remain- 
ing at the close of last session, shows a gain of 494.
-P-A-G-E-57
( 56 ) 
Receipts from non-resident pupils for 1880-81 amounted to 
$415.80, and for 1881-82 to $657.70. This session the total 
amount collected from pay pupils is $837.15, the largest sum ever 
received from this source since the schools were organized. The 
collections for each month may be seen in the following table: —

  THE YEAR’S RECORD. 
This is, in some respects, very encouraging. Owing to the com- 
plete arrangements made for the same, the organization of the 
schools, at the beginning of the year, was effected in the most satis- 
factory manner. With the exception of two or three rooms, which, 
from their over-crowded condition, had to be re-organized in the 
early part of the year, the schools worked smoothly from the very 
first. Earnest and efficient work on the part of both teachers and 
pupils has advanced the schools to a praiseworthy degree in 
thoroughness and excellence. The Board of Education, as custo- 
dians of the same, have done all in their power to promote their 
efficiency and contribute to their welfare. . 
In the number enrolled there has been an increase of 128 over 
last year’s enrollment. The whole number enrolled, 2,265, was 
70.87 per cent. of the entire scholastic population, a slight increase 
in the percentage of the previous year’s enrollment. In the average 
number attending and belonging, there has been very little increase, 
owing to the many obstacles in the way of the same during the 
past year. 
The additional expense incurred by the employment of four extra 
teachers for the entire year, and one for a portion of the year, 
together with the incidental. outlay attending the furnishing and
-P-A-G-E-63
(62) 
heating of the rooms occupied by them, has increased the expense 
of the schools $2,667.49 over those of 1881-82. The total cost 
per pupil enrolled has increased to 63 cents; per pupil belonging, 
$1.49 ; per pupil attending, $1.70. The advance in the cost in the 
last case will be explained under the head of Attendance. 
A very encouraging feature in the work of the year is the fact 
that as soon as the prevailing diseases, which had to a discouraging 
extent hindered the working of the schools, abated, pupils were 
eager to enter again, and, if possible, redeem the time thus—in the 
majority of cases, at least—unavoidably lost. During the last two 
months the withdrawals were comparatively few, and for very good 
cause. The number examined in June, 1,425, was within 19 as 
many as were on roll in February. The fact that last year no one 
was allowed to enter a higher class without complying with all the 
requisites of an examination, has much to do with this matter.

Cuarranooga, TENN., October 19, 1883. 
Hon. T. H. Paine, State Superintendent of Public Instruction : 
Dear S1r:—I have the honor to forward a report of the Chat- 
tanooga Public School for the year ending July 31, 1883. 
Owing to the prevalence of small-pox in the city the enrollment 
and attendance were considerably less than during the previous 
year. A class of fifteen completed the High School course, and 
held appropriate exercises in James’ Hall. -

The increased enrollment in the Howell School more than met 
the expectations of its most sanguine friends. The enrollment last 
session was 502, against 358 of the year previous, which gives an 
increase of 124, or 26 per cent. increase. This has corroborated 
the statement made in my report of last year that the addition of 
the High School would not only increase the enrollment in the 
higher grades, but would cause a corresponding increase throughout 
all the grades. ‘The first two floors of the building has heretofore 
accommodated all the grades; but it became necessary to furnish 
the third floor to enable the seating of the three higher grades, and 
to employ an additional teacher to assist in the primary department. 
The grade added last year, containing ten pupils, was taught by the 
teachers already employed in the higher grades; the remaining in- 
crease (124) was in the lower grades. Thus it is obvious that the 
increased expenditure of money was caused not directly by the ad- 
dition of the High School, but by its indirect influence on the lower 
grades—assuring parents that their children can now finish (with- 
- out change of school, which is so desirable) a thorough English 
education. The enrollment for the combined schools was 1,075, 
while for the year previous it was 901, which shows an increase of 
174, The per cent. of enrollment on enumeration for the year of 
1881-82 was 41.82; for last year, 49.90. These results are most 
gratifying, as the good to be accomplished by any system of public 
schools in a community can be measured by the per cent. of its 
school population enrolled. 
It isa remarkable fact that although the ‘attendance for each 
room has changed, the combined attendance for the entire schools, 
for the year, is exactly the same as for the year preceding (96.06), 
which is a creditable per cent. The low per cent. of tardiness 
0.09, is especially noticeable, as it is not half so much as for the 
year before, which was .22 per cent.; and, as you will see by con- 
sulting the comparative table, is by far the best result in that di- 
rection ever attained here. By comparing the above results with 
those of other cities it will be found that we are fully up with the 
best schools. These results are particularly creditable when it is 
remembered that each school draws pupils from a radius of two 
miles, and that, as stated last year, no punishment is used to produce 
this regularity. The decrease in per cent. of tardiness for the past 
two years has been so great that I take the liberty of again calling 
your attention to a table showing this decrease.

: Te the Board of Education : 
Srrs :—Above you have our annual financial report of the con- 
dition of the Public Schools for the year ending June 12, 1883. 
We have received fully one thousand dollars more during the last 
‘school year from the city than we will get again. This excess. - 
came from back taxes collected and the exceedingly close collection 
of last year’s taxes, the delinquent tax list being less at this time, 
perhaps, than ever before. Our running expenses this school year. 
were $7,400 in round numbers, and we had 1,072 enrolled and 
about 900 pupils belonging, making cost per pupil for ten months, 
on enrollment, about $7.00, and on belonging $8.20. 
Respectfully, . 
A. HOWELL, 
Secretary and Treasurer Board of Education. 
‘ COLUMBIA CITY SCHOOLS. 
Hon. Thos. H. Paine, State Superintendent of Public Linstruction : 
Dear Sir :—Herewith I submit an extract from my annual re- 
" port of the Columbia City Schools for the year closing June, 1883, 
the same date being the close of the second year of the existence. 
of the Schools. . 
The Schools were organized in the face of much opposition, but 
their bitterest enemies at first, are now among their best friends. 
The system is giving general satisfaction, growing continually in 
popularity, and advancing in usefulness and efficiency. 
Our Board of Education is composed of live, energetic and repre- 
’ sentative men, and we have an efficient corps of teachers, and an 
excellent course of study compiled and arranged from the best 
systems of the country to suit the wants of our own people and 
pupils.

The Schools have done much to improve the city in many esserf- 
tial respects, and many people would move into the city now for the 
educational advantages afforded if there were only houses to rent.

UNION CITY SCHOOLS. 
Hon. Thos. H. Paine, State Superintendent of Public Instruction : 
Dear S1r:—In compliance with your request, I present here- 
with a summary of the work done in the Union City graded school 
during the school-year 1882-83: 
Union City is a rapidly growing town of about 3,500 inhabi- 
tents.. Its population consists largely of laboring men, who are 
employed in the various factories located here. Before the time 
. embraced in this report there had been no regular town schools of 
@ permanent character. Public and private schools of 9 transient 
nature only had existed. In the year 1879 a large and. well-
-P-A-G-E-73
(72) 
adapted school building, costing $12,000, was built. This was 
mainly effected by private subscription, but the school fund for the 
years 1880 and 1881 was required to discharge a balance of in- 
debtedness. The house is beautifully located, and occupies with 
the grounds, a whole square. The title is in the right of the 
School Board, which is composed of three citizens elected by the 
people, together with the Mayor, who is a member by virtue of his 
office. 
In the early part of 1882, a special election was held at which 
the citizens voted to levy a corporation tax additional to the State 
and county tax for the purpose of establishing and carrying on 
permanent town schools. In pursuance of this the Board of 
Aldermen voted a special tax of $1,000. 
During the summer a Superintendent and seven teachers were. 
elected, and the school was opened September 4, 1882, and con- 
tinued for a term of nine months. The school for colored pupils 
was not opened, their portion of the fund being retained for the 
purpose of erecting a suitable building. The entire expense of the 
school for the year was $4,145.50. $300 of this came as aid from 
the Peabody fund. 
The scholastic population, embracing all between 6 and 21 years 
was :

The population is increasing rapidly by immigration, and will 
make necessary an early increase in school accommodations. The 
total number of pupils (white) enrolled in the school during the 
year was:

The number pursuing the advanced studies of the High School, 
and other statistics not called for in the school law, are here omitted. 
While the attendance, based on the actual number belonging at 
any one time, has been good. The unsettled condition of the popu- 
lation, the presence of many boys in the factories and cther minor 
considerations have prevented many from attending the whole term. 
This year ail the children of the town were gathered into one 
building. The organization embraced three primary grades, two 
intermediate grades, two grammar-school grades, and three high- 
school grades. Teachers’ meetings were held every two weeks, 
when the latest and best methods of instruction were discussed. 
All grades were taught music, calisthenics and drawing. Begin- 
ers were put to writing at once, and made wonderful progress. 
Further on the classes learned geographical forms by moulding in 
sand and map-drawing. Practical grammar was taught rather than 
theoretical. A love for reading was encouraged by the collection 
” of small libraries in different rooms, the books being lent by the 
children. They also collected geographical products, specimens of 
native woods, fossils, minerals, Indian relics, etc. The walls of the 
rooms were covered with pictures and mottoes made or contributed 
by the pupils. Everything was done to encourage, stimulate and 
refine the taste. In the high-school the higher English branches, 
Natural Science, Mathematics, Latin, Greek, French and German 
were taught. The course more than prepares pupils for college. 
This was all made free, and I am glad to say that a free high- 
school meets with no opposition whatever in Union City. Many 
parents and strangers visited the various departments during the.
-P-A-G-E-75
( 74 ) 
year. Friday afternoon was the time when most visits were made. 
Written examinations were held quarterly and a “ Roll of Honor” 
embracing the names of such pupils as averaged above 95 per cent. | 
was published in the town papers. The discipline was mild, but 
firm. Everything moved by system. Disorder was sought to be 
prevented rather than suppressed. No pupil was suspended during 
the year. The closing exercises at the end of the year were largely 
attended. The newspaper press of the city rendered great assist- 
ance in the work. Public sentiment is now a unit in favor of 
graded schools. 
Respectfully, 
T. C. KARNS,

COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS’ REPORTS 
ANDERSON COUNTY. 
Witriaw M. Crark, SUPERINTENDENT, Clinton. 
Herewith is transmitted my report for 1882-83. While not so 
full as you have a right to expect, it is the best that can be done 
under the circumstances: 
Information called for under “ Enrollment in Schools,” “ Aver- 
age Daily Attendance,” etc., cannot be furnished. Sec. 1, chap. 
xei, page 27, Public School Laws, will, I hope, fully explain the — 
reason. 
While the teachers of this county are as well qualified as those of 
any other mountain county in our direction of the State, and as: 
zealous in their labors as those of any section in Tennessee, they 
fail to make reports simply .from the fact that their last month’s 
salary is paid and no questions asked. This evil is not likely to be 
remedied until there is some legislation on the subject. 
We regard the Public School as an institution that has come to 
stay in spite of all opposition. The day is coming when a director 
will be elected because he is capable and not because his election 
is a source of merriment. Last year a school director in this county 
allowed the school in his immediate neighborhood to be taught and 
no record kept. In every respect save this, the teacher was com- 
petent and performed every other duty satisfactorily.

BENTON COUNTY. 
D. J. ALLEN, SUPERINTENDENT, Camden. 
I think our people are becoming more interested in schools, and 
Ido not think it will be very long until wecan report a five months 
school in every District, as we should do. Besides there are efforts 
being made in different portions of the county to establish graded 
‘schools, and I think the right men have taken it in hand to make 
it a success. I humbly trust and pray that it will not be long until 
‘the county of Benton will lift herself out of the dust and ashes 
and become almost, if not quite, an educational center. 
BLEDSOE COUNTY. 
T. F. Haxx, Surerrnrenpent, Pikeville. . 
I have made the enclosed report as soon as our County Trustee 
‘could make his report to me, hence pardon the delay. 
Our schools are flourishing in Bledsoe county; if we could get all 
~ the patrons to send regularly I think we soon could make a success 
, with the Public School fund, as we now have a uniform system of 
text books which will also be of great profit when fully introduced. 
We have adopted the plan of grading the teachers, which keeps 
considerable interest among them. 
We think if the law were changed so that each County Superin- 
tendent should approve all school warrants in their counties, that it 
would be much easier to keep the receipts and expenditures correctly. 
BLOUNT COUNTY. 
A. M. Gamez, Superinrenpent, Maryville. 
In submitting this my first ‘annual report, I am sorry it is so - 
~ very defective aud incomplete. 
- The county is large and portions of it are mountainous. Sick- 
ness prevented my visiting directors in time to get up all their 
reports, Most of those I have received are very defective.
-P-A-G-E-81
( 80 ) 
I notice a decided improvement, especially with our teachers. 
They are taking more than usual interest in their work, as a con- 
sequence the people are taking a greater interest in our Common 
Schools. 
BEDFORD COUNTY. 
Wma. H. Warresiprs, SUPERINTENDENT, Shelbyville. 
I herewith present my annual report, in which I am pleased to 
say that I think the Public School system has taken firm hold upon 
the minds of the people of our county, as is evidenced by the 
general increase of enrollment and average attendance. You will 
see from report that there has been a considerable increase in the 
scholastic population, which, I think, is due principally to the fact 
that the Directors have taken more interest and exercised greater: 
care in taking the population. 
TEACHERS. 
The teachers of our county are, with few exceptions, young gen- 
~ tlemen and ladies thoroughly alive to the work, and their zeal and 
energy are telling well. on the schools; indeed, Bedford has now but. 
few dead-head schools, and I am glad to say that public sentiment 
with us is so aroused to the importance of having live, progressive 
teachers, that from almost every nook and corner of the county the 
demand comes up which says, “ give us efficient teachers, or none.” 
Let me say here to all young ladies and gentlemen of the profes- 
sion, who have the qualifications and determination to succeed, come 
and we will give them a cordial welcome. 
1 HOUSES, FURNITURE, ETC. 
The improvement in houses and furniture is very gratifying, we 
have finished up this year three well-arranged and commodious 
houses, and have one or two others under contract, in fact the 
Directors of our county seem to be fully awakened to the necessity 
of consolidating smali schools and erecting good houses, Truly 
they are going as far in this direction as public sentiment and the 
means at their command will allow.

INSTITUTES, 
‘We made a new departure this year in the way of institutes, in- 
stead of holding one each month, and for only one day at a time, 
we held one institute continuing three days. The institute was or- 
ganized into class work, thereby showing the different methods of 
conducting recitations, ete. a 
VISITATIONS. 
I have visited all the schools in the county with a few exceptions, 
stopping in each school from one hour and a half to half a day ; 
found the teachers generally taking much interest in their work, 
and succeeding well in keeping up the interest and life in their 
schools. 
FINANCE. 
We are in good condition financially. Thatis, we ran our schools 
within our means, so as to keep out of debt; yet our fund is not 
large enough to give us as much school as we should have. On the 
present assessment we continue our schools about four months. I 
think it would be wise economy in our County Court to make our 
school tax large enough to carry on the schools for seven or eight - 
months in the year. 
CARROLL COUNTY. | 
+S. E. Tucker, SuPERINTENDENT, Huntingdon. 
‘We are making some improvements, more pupils enumerated, 
more scholars enrolled, more money, better teachers, and better 
prices. 
COUNTY COURT. 
Our County Court deserves the highest praise for the effort it has 
made for the last three years to make our Public Schools a success. 
The tax was left to the people in the County year after year, and 
‘was voted down every time, Then the County Court levied a tax 
of 10 cents on the $100 worth of property, and 50 cents on the 
poll. This proved a success and a great benefit, so the County 
Court last January raised the tax to 123 per cent., and the poll to 
6
-P-A-G-E-83
( 82) 
one dollar, the same as State, making the poll $2 for school put- 
poses. The moral intelligent class, who once opposed the Public © 
Schools, are beginning to believe that “ parsimony towards educa- 
tion is liberality towards crime,” and that it is cheaper to educate 
than to prosecute criminals. They, since meditation and examina- 
tion of statistics, feel that it would be a great wrong to let 3,000. 
poor children of our 8,000 grow up in ignorance, when the _ 
meager amount now paid (not equal to their tobacco and whiskey 
bill) will never be missed, and in ten years will educate all better 
and cheaper than a part by subscription. So they are in favor of 
the tax. 
DIRECTORS. 
The Directors of our County are mostly the prominent men of: 
the different districts. They want to get teachers as cheap as pos- 
sible, and perhaps some of them have economized falsely in this 
way.’ They pay from $20 to $50 per month. Some teachers this 
Summer, with third grade certificates, received $25. First-class 
teachers received $40 to $50. Our Directors are aware of the im- 
portance of employing only first-class teachers and paying them 
a good price. We have lost several first-class teachers by the Di- 
rectors being indifferent about paying good wages. 
I visit the schools, converse with the Directors, teachers and 
parents, am at the, county site every Saturday and first Monday 
during the school terms, keep up an educational column in our 
county paper, and in this give instructions to Directors ; so I have 
scarcely any trouble. I find that Directors know their duty, do it 
better than others. 
FINANCE. 
Our financial condition is good. Our excellent Trustee attends 
to his business promptly, pays off our teachers whenever they pre- 
sent an order properly signed by directors. He makes his report 
to me without any trouble. : 
TEACHERS. 
Our teachers are on a fair average. We have a few young men 
who held second and third-class certificates, who are attending 
school, and will continue. We held two institutes of two days 
each ; one in April and the other in June. These meetings were —
-P-A-G-E-84
( 83 ) 
very well attended, one-half of the best class of teachers attending. 
‘Our teachers are alive to education, and interested in their work. 
A large portion of them read educational journals and bovks on 
education, and the art of teaching. I will call an educational meet- 
ing of the colored teachers next month, that they may organize 
+ themselves into an educational association. 
TEXT-BOOKS. 
This has caused a great deal of trouble in the past, but the 
directors have adopted for five years a series of books. 
SCHOOLS. 
We have over one hundred public school houses. Some of the 
houses are very neat buildings, well furnished with desks, and some 
apparatus. But they are generally lacking in this respect. These 
schools generally continue from four to five months in the year, 
where the directors have not allowed the patrons to have a sub- 
school district every half mile, or at least three, where two would 
be sufficient. We generally have two schools at each house during 
the year; three months in the winter and two in the summer. The 
two combined will average over eighty days in the county ; but 
this plan is not working well. The directors and patrons generally 
believe one five months school each year would be better. I be- 
lieve the Magistrates are determined to make the schools of Carroll 
equal to any in the State. 
SCHOOLS VISITED. 
T have visited come eighty schools since I was elected, January, 
1883. I consider this a very important part of the County Super- 
intendent’s duty, as it awakens a general interest on the part of the 
students in the schools, causing them to be more obedient and in- 
terested in the pursuit of their studies. I try to spend from two 
hours to a half day in each school visited. 
HIGH SCHOOLS. 
We had several high schools taught in our county during the past 
year. At Clarksburg academy, ten months; Huntingdon high 
school, ten months; Buena Vista academy, five months; West 
Tennessee seminary, (at Hollow Rock), ten months; At McKenzie 
the three schools, all continued in session ten months. Trezevant
-P-A-G-E-85
( 84 ) 
high school, five months; Atwood high school, ten months. At 
McKenzie, Huntingdon, Hollow Rock, Trezevant and Atwood the 
schools are now (October) in session under very favorable prospects. 
The public school at McKenzie is partly run by a corporation tax.. 
This school was very prosperous and successful last year, enrolling 
171 pupils. Bethel college is the property of the Cumberland 
Presbyterian church. MeceTyeire Institute is the property of the- 
Methodist church, South. Both these colleges situated at MeKen- 
zie are excellent schools, and are liberally patronized by surround- 
ing States, as well as all West Tennessee. 
West Tennessee Seminary at Hollow Rock is the property of 
the Methodist church, North. This school meets the approbation 
of all the parents. It has a normal training department connected. 
with it which is doing great good for our teachers. I could per- 
ceive a marked degree of improvement in visiting the schools this. 
summer, in the teachers, though they had attended this department. 
only one term. 
  
COFFEE COUNTY 
C.N. TowNseND, SUPERINTENDENT, Hillsboro, 
Enclosed you will find my annual report for 1882-83, which I 
trust is in accordance with the provisions of the school law, except 
it should have been forwarded to you on the Ist instant : 
The delay of the report was caused by the School Directors and 
teachers not making their reports of schools as is required of them: 
by law. The teachers of some of the schools had closed them and 
failed to make out an abstract of them or to return register, and’ 
had moved out of the State before I entered on my duties as County 
Superintendent, therefore, my report to you is not, perhaps, in all 
things correct, but as much so as I can make it under existing 
circumstances. I have taken great care in getting up facts from 
which my report is made, and trust you will accept it as the very 
best I can furnish. 
The Public Schools of the county for the present year are under- 
good headway with prospects of success. They are supplied with 
better teachers than in former years, and the only impediment to- 
them is a want of funds to continue them.
-P-A-G-E-86
( 85 ) 
The educational interest of the county is much better than it has - 
‘been, but not so great as it ought to be on so important a question. 
‘The county tax for school purposes for 1883 will increase the reve- 
nue derived from county for 1882 about one-third. This amount 
-will not more than pay the indebtedness for last year and continue 
‘the schools sixty days on an average this year. 
CARTER COUNTY. 
B. M. Hyper, SuperinrenDEnt, Cave Spring. 
The enrollment in schools and average daily attendance are only 
. approximated results. I could not obtain correct reports from the 
Directors. On account of the disposition of some of our Directors 
to let the schools to the lowest bidder regardless of the ability of 
the applicant, some of our schools have not done very well. Our 
Directors pay third grade teachers as much as they do first grade 
teachers, which is poor encouragement for our teachers to prepare 
themselves for better teaching, and therefore we have very few 
“good teachers in this county. . 
CHEATHAM COUNTY. . 
T. J. ADKIsson, SUPERINTENDENT, Ashland. 
- Owing to the condition of ex-Trustee Weakley’s mind, I have 
fallen a little short in the requirements of the law in forwarding 
to your office my annual report by October Ist, 1883. I was 
necessarily compelled to get up Weakley’s report. By reference 
to my statistical report you will see the county debt to be $1, 983.61. 
That amount he expended in paying off county warrants. The 
‘County Court gave him credit to that amount on settlement. Suit 
is now pending for the balance, $1,471.29, in the Chancery Court, 
against him and his sureties. The friends of Public Schools are 
not discouraged. We will soon recover our losses and return to 
our former position.

( 86 ) 
CHESTER COUNTY. 
W. R. McNart, SuperintenDENT, Henderson. 
I to-day mail you my report for 1883. As you will see it is blank 
in some respects, from no failure on my part, the teachers fail- 
ing to return their abstracts, the directors failing to report every- 
thing in their several districts, except enumeration reports. In my~ 
opinion the Legislature laid the gap down, when it repealed County 
Superintendents endorsing teachers’ money orders. We had no 
trouble previous to that time. I hear other County Superintendents 
complaining of the same trouble. 
We are striving to raise the standard of education in our little 
county : First, by sending out more first grade teachers. Second, 
by exciting the people generally on the subject of education. In 
order to do this, we take the county by districts, have District Ed- 
ucational Meetings, and have made several efforts for County In- 
stitutes, but to not much effect ; yet we still try with the hope that. 
success will be ours.’ 
CLAY COUNTY. 
W. L. Brown, SUPERINTENDENT, Celina. 
In submitting to you my report, I will say that the failure of 
the directors to make out and return their reports at the proper 
time, and in the proper order, together with the negligence on the 
part of the teachers to return their abstracts, have rendered it very 
difficult for me to make out an accurate report. This report, how-. 
ever, I believe to be tolerably correct with the exception of the 
average daily.attendance. 
The public school interests are rapidly progressing ; we have a 
better grade of teachers this year than at any previous year. The 
citizens throughout the county are taking more interest, and as a 
consequence, we are having some better schools. The greatest 
drawback to the success of our free school system is money sufficient 
to run them at least five months in each year.

COCKE COUNTY. 
Rurvus L. Hickry, SUPERINTENDENT, Newport. 
I herewith transmit to you my annual report of the public schcols 
of my county. While they are not as good as they should be, I 
_ am glad fo say that they are in a very prosperous condition. I 
have noted with interest the progress of the schools, both white 
and colored, and they are better, according to my humble judgment, 
than they have ever been before. Iam unable to give you the 
value of the school property in the county, but will be safe in say-~ 
ing that it is about the same as last year. The directors of my 
county have been very dilatory in sending in their reports. The 
law should be more strict in this respect. I would mention also 
that it should be the same with teachers in regard to sending in 
their abstracts, for it is almost impossible for a County Superinten- 
dent to make a correct report, unless all reports required by the 
school law are’sent in. I have visited so far fifty schools, and the 
discipline is very good, with but 1ew exceptions. Our corps of 
teachers, as a general thing, are better than common, and the peo- 
ple are becoming more interested in the free school system. As ~ 
time rolls on, I hope our county will have better schools, and that 
the canse of education will receive the encouragement of all. 
CROCKETT COUNTY. 
R. S. Tuomeson, SUPERINTENDENT, Alamo. 
Our scheols were run last year longer than was justifiable from 
the amount of money on hand, and the consequence is, we had 
schools of short duration this year. " All these, with the exception 
of three, I visited, and I think, in discipline and general good 
management, there has been a marked improvement over former 
years. Our teachers enjoyed a course of normal training last year, 
which accounts, to some extent, for this improvement. It is getting 
to be almost impossible to get reports from directors and teachers. 
Appeals by postal or otherwise avail nothing. I think all warrants 
should be approved by the Superintendents, and this would force 
teachers, at least, to hand in their abstracts at the proper time, and _ 
there obtained, the rest of the reports could-be ‘more easily 
arrived af.
-P-A-G-E-89
( 88 ) 
CUMBERLAND COUNTY. 
A. A. Mintarp, SUPERINTENDENT, Crossville. 
We are making some progress in the work of public schools. 
The dissatisfaction of previous years has nearly passed away, and 
the people are learning the value of free schools. It affords me 
much pleasure to note the increased interest in school circles for the 
past year. The-enrollment, daily attendance, and self-sacrificing 
zeal of all the boards show that-our patrons, directors and teachers 
have all been at work, to forward on the march of mind in our 
county. A survey of the educational statistics for the past year, | 
shows marked improvement in more than one feature. Notwith- 
standing, the frequent changes of teachers, lack of uniformity 
of text-books, irregularity of attendance, in some localities, are 
difficulties that can only be gradually overcome. I have been un- 
able to make the standard of qnalification for teachers what, in my 
judgment, it would be. Owing to the difficulty of obtaining teach- 
ers for the schools, there are, in my judgment, some defects in the 
school law, which I think our Legislature will remedy by amend- 
ment or otherwise. First. The Legislature at its session in 1881, 
repealed that part of the law which requires school warrants te be 
audited by the County Superintendent before they were paid off by 
the Trustee ; by that means the County Superintendent had it in 
his power to control and present any illegal issuance of warrants. 
_ As it was, before this law was repealed, the Superintendent 
had more oversight of the financial department, and could 
easily correct all financial abuses. Another very important feature 
L hope will be considered by our next Legislature; and that is to 
enact a law to make each and every school house independent of 
itself, which I think, in my judgment, would be the means of cor- 
recting a great deal of the trouble that arise in our civil districts, 
or to give each county court the power of auditing such business at 
its own option. I have visited all the schools and conferred with 
“all the school directors relative to the scholastic condition, pros- 
perity and management of the schools of their respective districts. 
We have a good corps of teachers who have prepared themselves 
for the work, who are zealous. and enthusiastic, and are devoting 
their best talents and energies to their profession. I called a school 
convention of all the directors of the county on the 15th of Sep- 
tember, which was largely attended, and a great deal of interest 
and enthusiasm was manifested on the occasion.

DYER COUNTY. . 
Tuos. C. Gorpon, SUPERINTENDENT, Dyersburg. 
I adopted the expedient of making quarterly reports to our 
County Court. I find this plan of reporting very popular, enhanc- 
ing materially the interest in Public Schools. I also make quarterly 
reports per postal cards to our district clerks, setting forth : 
Ist. The district expenses itemized for each quarter. 
2d. The total debits of the district for the quarter. 
83d. Amount of money in each district at the beginning of a 
quarter, and 
4th. The amount accrued during each quarter, and total credits, 
The card, therefore, acquaints each clerk with the finance of his 
district at the close of each three months and gives him also a 
chance to correct any forgery or false charge. 
TEACHERS’ LIBRARY. 
The ieading publishing houses of the county generally send to 
the County Superintendents (ex officio) copies of their latest school 
books. I have received many books since I came into the Superin- 
tendent’s office, from Wan Antwerp, Bragg & Co., Cincinnati; 
Clark & Maynard, New York; A.S. Barnes & Co., Chicago; 
Ginn & Heath, Boston. As 'these books were sent for examination 
with reference to endorsement and introduction, I have given 
opportunity to all the Trustees of our county to read and examine 
. them. That is with these books I have begun a Teachers’ Library 
in the Superintendent’s office at the court-house. We have about 
sixty fine volumes on the shelves already. If the teachers of the 
whole State could avail themselves of such an opportunity they 
could keep better posted as to the relative merits of text books and 
the changes in the methods of instruction. 
. 
COUNTY INSTITUTES. 
The Trustees of our county keep up their Institute. It meets . 
four times a year, at the close of each quarter. We formed one of | 
the first Institutes in the State, and it retains the strength and 
energy of its younger days. It has done and is doing much to 
advance the cause of popular education with the patrons and to 
ereate a healthy “ esprit de corps” among our fraternity.
-P-A-G-E-91

SUGGESTIONS. 
* The revocation of the County Superintendent’s power and duty 
to approve all orders upon the Treasurer, was and is a mistake. - It 
greatly retards the work of collecting abstracts, Directors’ reports 
and census returns. Please work to have “the approving power” 
restored. Let a County Superintendents’ Convention be called if 
necessary, to give joint emphatic utterance on the matter. 
It seems to me that it would be best to make a school year and a 
county fiscal year identical. In the middle of the year, in July or 
August, it is not a little troublesome to get correct statistics from 
the Trustee. He seems to balance his work with the close of the 
calander year. 
THE OUTLOOK. 
The Public Schools are now really popular. The former discon~ 
tent and dissatisfaction have subsided. The people are willing to be 
“ taxed for education. ,Our teachers have the chance to improve, 
perfect and popularize the “colleges of the people,” to meanly 
lose or nobly save the last, best hope of earth. 
DECATUR COUNTY. 
W. H. H. McMi.van, SupsrintenDEnt, Decaturville. 
My report is about as near correct as Tcan make it. It has been 
delayed partly in consequence of professional engagements, and 
partly from the great difficulty experienced in trying to get reports 
from directors and teachers. 
With all the drawbacks incident to our public school system, I 
am glad to report some visible signs of improvement, both in school 
work and in co-operation, on the part of the people who are taking 
a much more lively interest in educational matters than they for- 
merly did, especially in remote rural districts. I am finally of the 
opinion that our institutes are contributing more than anything else 
to the efficiency of our teachers, and to creating a public sentiment 
favorable to the public school system.

( 91 ) 
DeKALB COUNTY. 
ALVIN AVANT, SUPERINTENDENT, Smithville, 
The general course and result of the public schools in this county 
are as good and satisfactory as I could expect under the circum- 
stances. The people generally are fast becoming thoroughly inter- 
ested in the public schools. This is manifested by a willingness to 
expend both their time and money in building up and fostering the 
system. I was fortunate enough to get our county court, at the 
Jast January term, to increase the tax on property for the schools, 
and I hope to be able to get them to still increase it at the next 
January term. I have adopted a system of modern text-books for 
the public schools, which are being used in all the schools ; the old 
text-books having been laid aside, and the new ones taken up in 
their place. I have first-class normal teachers in several of my 
schools, and the normal, or modern method of teaching is being 
rapidly introduced into all the schools throughout the county. 
“Pure Fountain College,” at Smithville, has one hundred and 
seventy students in attendance, Masonic Academy, at Liberty, 
about one hundred and thirty; the “ Alexandria Normal” about 
one hundred and forty students. All of these are first-class normal 
schools, and are every year sending out young ladies and gentlemen, 
who make the very best of teachers. To sum it all up, (and using 
-a slang phrase to express it), the educational interest in DeKalb is 
_ “on a boom.” : : 
DICKSON COUNTY. - 
W. G. McMixian, SUPERINTENDENT, White Bluff. 
This report would have been made sooner, but it was a matter of 
impossibility to get full and complete reports from each district. 
The directors were tardier this year than ever before about making 
their reports. Our schools are in good condition, and county free 
from debt. 
FENTRESS COUNTY. 
B. L. SrepHens, SUPERINTENDENT, Jamestown. 
While I do not claim any degree of credit to myself for the fact, 
yet .I can safely say we have made decided progress in the cause of 
education. There has been great improvement in our school-houses;
-P-A-G-E-93
(92) 
old houses have been repaired, new houses built, and many refur- 
nished without any of the school funds being used. Our teachers 
are, as a class, improving and doing good work. Many of them are 
furnishing their schools with a uniform system of text books, and 
devoting their best talent and energies to their profession. Still we 
have teachers, or rather sleepers, who care nothing for the advance- 
ment of their students, all they want is the almighty dollar. Di-’ 
rectors failing to dismiss such characters from teaching, the money 
is misspent, and the pupils not benefitted. In some parts of the 
county the Directors will hire a teacher with a primary certificate, 
because they can get him for less money than they can a teacher 
with a graded certificate, when a good teacher is required. 
There has been considerable increase in the private schools of 
this county both in number and per cent. of attendance, and in 
many of the districts the schools last all the year. 
The German colony in this county is alive to the cause of educa- 
tion. As svon as the emigrants arrived they built them a good 
school-house and started a good school while they lived in their 
~tents. The County Court levied a tax of twenty-five per cent. per 
hundred on all taxable property and on all privileges equal to the 
State tax. This lengthened our schools. Many of our best 
citizens are in favor of a fifty cents tax for 1884. 
If the Legislature would give us a tax on all litigation our school. 
system would be as good as we should ask. 
The delay in making this report was caused by the County 
Trustee failing to make his report as the law directs. He has not 
made any report to me up to this date, the 12th day of October, 
why he has neglected to do so I cannot tell. He lives in one 
mile of me, and has been furnished with the necessary blanks in 
due time. I regret having to send in my report without having it - 
full and complete, but I deem it unnécessary to wait longer. 
FRANKLIN COUNTY. 
W. L. Cuerry, SUPERINTENDENT, Winchester. 
As to the scholastic population, finances, etc., the report is correct. 
Ihave done all in my power, being unable part of my time to 
travel, to get up a full report as required. The teachers and 
,
-P-A-G-E-94

Directors have been very negligent. A great many say that they 
have been acting for years and ‘have never made a report.’ I will 
endeavor to do better in the future.

Jas. R. Deason, SUPERINTENDENT, Trenton. 
I herewith submit my annual report, the facts and figures of 
which speak for themselves.- Our schools are prosperous, and the 
people manifest 2 great interest in free schools. Year by year, for 
the past four, the county court has raised the school tax five cents, 
and will next January raise the tax to forty cents, giving State and 
county fifty cents. 
We now have good houses in nearly every place; and a few more 
to build, which will shortly be done. We have fine lands, plenty 
of water and timber, and a very intelligent body of people, and 
the best schools you will find in the State, outside of the cities, I 
think. Strangers are continually coming to our midst, and the first 
_thing-you hear is a voice of praise for our schools. Our neat 
school houses have caught several travelers bound for the West. 
I am justified in saying we are gradually improving, when the 
population increases, the funds increase, thes school houses are im- 
proved, the teachers attend instituteg, and. more children than ever 
“attend school. 
  
GILES COUNTY. 
Spencer D. Crack, SupERINTENDENT, Pulaski. 
In submitting to you nfy annual report, ] am gratified to state 
that we have had a prosperous year, and our schools are gradually 
improving. The greatest hindrance to the efficiency of our public 
schools is: 1st. That the term is too short, (generally about five 
months,) leaving an interval of seven months without any school; 
for in the country the private schoot,is almost a thing of the past; 
and 2nd. There is so little difference made between the skilled and 
unskilled teacher, that the accomplished teacher won’t stand it, but 
will either seek other pursuits or other States that pay their teachers 
“at least enough to live on. Our schools ought to run nine months 
atleast, and our most efficient teachers must be paid better salaries, 
or they will leave us.

GRAINGER COUNTY. 
Joun G. Water, SUPERINTENDENT, Rutledge, ' 
I herewith submit this my annual report. for the year, ending 
June 30, 1883. I think it is nearly correct.. Our schools are run 
under some disadvantages ; some are taught in church buildings, 
with no necessary fixtures ; and another barrier is, our teachers re- 
ceive low wages. I have visited the various schools of my county, 
and find the teachers working faithfully in [the discharge of their 
duties. We need more interest in the public schools, but we do not 
have the murmuring we once had; I think everybody is more in- 
terested than a few years past. 
We want more of the new methods of teaching. We want to 
call a meeting of the Directors early in the spring, (say April,) and 
get them to assist in making a Normal successful in the county, by 
agreeing to pay better wages to the teachers who have attended 
the Normal. 
GREENE COUNTY. 
H. W. Farxsworra, SUPERINTENDENT, Greeneville. 
Oar sixth annual Normal Institutes for white and colored teach- 
-ers were held with an attendance of 104 teachers in the white, and 
19 in the colored. Examinations were made during the session ;. 
we never had more intelligent and grammatically expressed answers, 
with neatness and arrangement of papers submitted to us for 
inspection. Teachers now know that qualification to teach com- 
mands better salaries. 
The schools were badly crippled by measles, and in one section 
of the county by small-pox. Many schools were suspended on ac- 
count of these, and were not opened again during the year; these 
reduced the average attendance and average length in days very 
much. : 
The success of teachers in many of our schools depends upon the 
uniformity of text-books, to a great extent, on account of the num- 
bers attending school; increased classes decrease the time of the 
teacher in recitation. True educators would rejoice if our legisla- 
tors would create a State Board to select a series of books to secure -
-P-A-G-E-96
(95 ) 
uniformity throughout the State. Our finances are sound, the peo- 
ple liberal, and education among the masses grows in favor and 
support. We are full of joy and hope, for light is dawning, and a 
bright future awaits us. 
GRUNDY COUNTY. 
T. B. Lockuart, SUPERINTENDENT, Altamont. 
The schools in this county are improving to some extent; the 
people as a mass are taking a greater interest than ever before, which 
' shows the present system is gaining in popularity. Our schools 
will continue longer this year than ever before since the present 
jaw was enacted, and a better class of teachers are employed. I 
hope that in my next annual report I will be able to show a marked 
improvement, both in schools and teachers. 
Our schools this year will continne about four and one-half 
months with a better attendance than heretofore. 
HAMILTON COUNTY. 
H. B. Heywoop, SuPERINTENDENT, Chattanooga. 
L have the honor to transmit herewith the annual report for the 
scholastic year, ending June 30, 1883. As the schools reported 
were in progress, and for the most part, closed during the summer 
and autumn of 1882, I cannot {speak advisedly as to progres 
made ; the indications are, however, that it was fair. The statis- 
tical report shows all matters called for, and, I think, I am 
safe in saying that it is correct as stated thereon. The low average 
attendance is not a good feature, yet it does not compare unfavorably 
with that of the State in years gone by. Too small a percentage of 
the scholastic population is regularly in the schools. In the absence 
of a compulsory law, (in favor of which there are some strong ar- 
guments) the most available plan is to visit the districts as often as 
time permits, and address the citizens on this topic, and at the same 
time encourage the teachers to visit families failing to send to 
school. This has been done to some extent, and has not been alto- 
gether unfruitful of results. Parents generally seem to be awaken-
-P-A-G-E-97
(96 ) 
ing to the importance of availing themselves of the means{provided 
by the State for the education of their children, and it only requires 
effort on the part of the friends of education to make the interest 
permanent, whereupon will follow a good average attendance. We 
need more money, more first grade teachers, houses provided with 
prope? seats, and a permanent County Institute for the accomplish— 
ment of all which the law ministers, but indifferently. A County _ 
Institate has been organized, and monthly two-day meetings held. 
The movement is becoming more popular, and the number of pa- 
‘rents, teachers and directors in attendance gradually increasing - 
with the advent of each session. It has invariably been found on 
visitation that the most orderly and best managed schools were in 
charge of those teachers who have presented themselves regularly 
at the Institute. Each teacher in his management before the school 
has been graded to a scale of 0 to 10 on seven points considered 
prominent characteristics of successful work in the school-room, the 
use to be made of this in the future is obvious. Irregularity in at- 
tendance, and yearly change of teachers and directors are chief 
- among the causes that mar the progress of the ungraded district. 
school. A. teaches this year, B. next; the efficiency of the work 
of each is diminished one third or more. Is this progress? Wilk 
the Legislature aid in repealing this order of things by making the 
text of the law less flexible in some particulars? Shall the best 
men in each district be made directors, and encouraged to remain 
in the office for a term of years? A course of study for each 
year should be adopted in all the district schools, and each teacher 
be required to make return of the grade of each pupil as determin- 
ed by a final examination, at the close of the school; his sue- 
cessor will thus enter upon his work on a system already estab- 
lished, and a great loss of time by reason of the change of teachers 
will be avoided. A convention of school officers in each grand 
division of the State might be productive of good. There 
exists a strong hope, that our system will continue to grow in 
favor and usefulness; but in order that it may so increase, it 
must not be forgotten that its guardians must not relax their efforts 
in its behalf. It is the earnest wish of the writer that your efforts, 
seconded by every school officer in the State, may mark a new era | 
in the prosperity of our public schools.

HANCOCK COUNTY. 
A. J. TyLer, SUPERINTENDENT, Sneedville. 
Enclosed find my annual statistical report for the past year. It 
is full and correct except so much as may be taken from teachers’ 
abstracts. 
Tt seems next to an impossibility with me to get reports from all 
the teachers, inasmuch as they consider that there is nothing made 
to them in performing this extra duty, and I have not the power to 
compel them. There is no marked improvement in our schools 
over last year, yet I consider them gradually progressing, and the 
minds of the people becoming more awakened to the benefits to be 
derived from them, and think another year we shall be able to 
have assessed a greater tax for this purpose. 
Without more money we could scarcely hope for better schools. 
Our county pays a tax of only ten cents on the hundred dollars’ 
worth of taxable property for school purposes. This, together with 
the funds received from all other sources, extends our schools only 
from two to three months. Some of the districts have no schools 
‘this year in order that they may pay out of debt. Our teachers 
have yet to contend with a great variety of text books. Could we 
be successful in raising a fund sufficient to run our schools from 
five.to six months in the year, and our district Directors learn to 
rightly appreciate the services of first-class teachers, I think our 
greatest barriers would be removed and our people would soon 
realize the blessings bestowed by good schools, which were antici- 
pated and expected by the founders of the free school system, and 
not till then. 
HARDEMAN COUNTY. 
A. J. Coaves, SUPERINTENDENT, Bolivar. 
The Public Schools are more popular in this county than ever 
before. All of our districts have had Public Schools this year, and 
in fact we have bad too many for the amount of money we have 
used. We have bad 128 Public Schools that would average three, 
months each. We could have done better with two-thirds that 
number, as we could have run them longer. The Public Schools 
7
-P-A-G-E-99
( 98 ) 
have made more progress this year than ever before. I have visited 
a number of the schools, and as a general thing, have found them 
doing good work. 
The County Superintendent should be made to approve or audit 
the warrants before they are paid by the Trustee; on account of 
this defect of the law it is utterly impossible to get the teachers’ 
reports as required by law. 
HARDIN COUNTY. 
Joun T. Damron, SUPERINTENDENT, Savannah. 
In submitting this, my third annual report, it gives me pleasure 
‘to state that never in the history of our Common Schools have we 
been able to give a more encouraging report. Everything pertain- 
ing to our Common School interest promises success in our county. 
The gradual increase of interest taken on the part of our people is 
manifest. Onr teachers are better qualified, our Directors take a 
deeper interest in the welfare of the children of their respective 
districts. Our school tax should be increased from 20c to 30c, and 
I hope ere long this will be done. County Superintendents’ salaries 
should be regulated by the Legislature, there is no uniformity in 
their salaries; some receive $60, and others $1,000 per annum. 
They should approve all school warrants before they are paid by 
the County Trustee. Each civil district should have one Board of 
Directors. With Thomas H. Paine as State Superintendent, our 
Public School system will certainly gain the hearty co-operation of 
the people of Tennessee. 
HAWKINS COUNTY. 
W. A. SHEFFEY, SUPERINTENDENT, Rogersville. 
The report herewith submitted is very meagre, and not as correct 
‘as it should be, but as nearly so as I can make under existing cir- 
cumstances, The great difficulty in mviking a fall and correct re- 
port is caused by the failure on the part of teachers and Directors 
to return their abstracts and reports as promptly as they should. 
When I entered on the discharge of Superintendent’s duties (the
-P-A-G-E-100
(99 ) 
present is my first year) I was unable to find any record of last 
year’s enumeration, any abstracts, any Director’s reports, or any 
Trustee’s report, and my efforts to secure these have been only par- 
tially successful, consequently you can appreciate the difficulty 
under which I labor in attempting a report. 
On the whole I think our Public Schools are perceptibly better 
the present year than they have been for some years previous, with 
better prospects for the future. 
HAYWOOD COUNTY. 
M. M. Grissam, SUPERINTENDENT, Brownsville. 
I submit to you my annual report of the Public Schools of Hay- 
wood county which approximates correctness. I entered upon the 
duties of my office last October, and it has been with some difficulty 
that I have obtained the necessary data from which to make a re- 
port, In some instances the teachers failed to deliver their 
abstracts, and I have been compelled to make them out myself 
with the best assistance I could get. 
The schools generally in the county are in a good condition. I 
visited a good many of them while in operation, and found them 
well attended and doing good work. Our County Court, on ac- 
‘count of heavy expenditures due to a prevalence of small- pox, did 
not levy any tax for school purposes for the year 1882, The usual 
tax of 10¢ on the $100 worth of property was readily levied last 
April for this year, and this furnishes good evidence that our Pub- 
lic Schools are appreciated by the people. 
There are some good school-houses in the county, but many, 
especially those occupied by our colored people, need repairing, and 
in some instances are now really uncomfortable. 
I held a teachers’ meeting or Institute in July, of two days’ 
duration. Those who attended were well pleased, and no doubt 
benefitted. I think I can hold such meetings with less difficulty 
in the future. 
‘We have no uniformity of text books, and in some ‘of the dis- 
tricts we have too many schools, both of these obstacles we are 
endeavoring to remove. In the main we are doing much good in 
_ educating our people in our Public Schools. They are gradually 
growing in popularity, and we really expect an improvement in 
many respects during the coming year. ,

( 100 ) 
HENDERSON COUNTY. 
T. J. Brooxs, SuPERINTENDENT, Leawington. 
The cause of education and the present system of public Schools. 
are gaining the confidence of the people to a considerable extent. 
After my election as County Superintendent, steps were immediately 
taken to induce the County Court to levy a tax for the support of 
the schools, which was decided in favor of the proposition. Owing 
to the mode prescribed by law for the collection of the tax, a year 
must necessarily elapse before a sufficient sum accumulates to com— 
mence operation. 
During the past scholastic year I have visited about two-thirds 
of the schools of the county, which was all I could do, owing to- 
the short duration of the schools. I examined the work of the 
teachers and whenever necessary, suggested a change in the mode of 
teaching and of enforcing good discipline. The want of regular 
attendance is the principal drawback to the success of the schools. 
The experiment of cheapening the labor of those upon whom the 
vitality and efficiency of the schools depend, while it has been 
attended with success so far, is certainly a dangerous one in its- 
tendency ; it will eventually, if continued, drive out the better class 
of teachers and supply their places with others less competent, 
because they are cheaper. It will produce a continual change of 
teachers from a higher to a lower grade, which is always hurtful,. 
even when those of the same grade are secured. It will retard the 
progress and advancement of pupils, because it will require a waste: 
of time for teachers and pupils to become mutually acquainted. 
Good teachers who are employed for their superior qualifications, at 
@ reasonable compensation, will always inspire the pupil with confi- 
dence and awaken an interest in behalf of the school. 
We expect to reorganize and hold Institutes in our county soon, 
as a means of improving and elevating the character of the schools.. 
We think it will infuse new life and vigor in the teachers. 
  
HENRY COUNTY. 
W. B. Van CLEave, JR., SUPERINTENDENT, Paris. 
I was elected to the office of County Superintendent the first 
Monday in January last, and by close attention, hard work 
and a good deal of riding I have got the Public School interest. 
revived to a fair standard.
-P-A-G-E-102
(101 ) 
I have to beg pardon for the delay in making this report, and 
offer as an excuse, and the only excuse, a defect in the school law, 
‘to which I hope you will call the attention of the next General 
Assembly. The defect to which I refer is the fact that school 
-orders do not have to be approved by County Superintendents, thus 
giving them no power to collect the absiracts so needful for the 
making of a correct report. 
One of the duties of the County Superintendent, and one I deem 
very important, is to visit the schools, and I have made it a point 
‘to comply strictly with this requirement, and I see the good effect. 
I have visited sixty-six schools and delivered as many addresses, 
and rode over one thousand miles since January last. No County 
Superintendent is worthy the place that does not visit the schools. 
I believe that the law should compel every teacher in the Public 
Schools to attend as many as two Institutes during each year. 
‘Teachers in my county cannot be induced to attend. 
Our County Court promptly levies the schoo] tax every year; it 
is now considered by them to be as much their duty to levy this tax 
cas any other tax. e 
Non- attendance and irregular attendance are great drawbacks to 
-our free schools. I am in favor of a compulsory school law. This 
alone will educate all our children in the State. I am also in 
favor of our Legislature passing a law adopting a uniform system 
-of text books for five or more years. This for a while might work 
ahardship, but in the end would be greatly to the interest of 
-education. 
In this report I must beg leave to request that you allow but two 
grades of certificates to be granted to teachers. Some Directors 
will employ the cheapest teacher they can get regardless of qualifi- 
-eations. One great drawback to progress here is the want of better 
houses. We have some good houses, but not enough of them. 
The schools of this county, considering everything, are doing 
well, I would call attention to the fact that unless that part of the 
Jaw giving to Directors sole power to form new districts is repealed, 
many districts will have their school interests much impaired by 
‘the recklessness of Directors. 
Many teachers do not live in the county, and as soon as their 
session closes they get their money (never make out their abstracts)
-P-A-G-E-103
( 102 ) 
and are heard of no more by us. By reason of this imperfection 
my report is not strictly correct, but it is the best I can do. There 
is a disposition to put most of our school-houses in order. 
There are many other things to which I would like to call your 
attention, but for fear I appear in the light of an enthusiast, I-wilk 
close by saying that we are alive, with a hearty determination to. 
constantly improve and make the Public Schools of Henry county 
equal to any in the State. 
HICKMAN COUNTY. 
Wm. P. Ciark, SUPERINTENDENT, Centreville. 
In compliance with the provisions of the law, I herewith submit 
this my annual report, which, I think, exhibits very satisfactory 
progress of our schools, as compared with those of previous years. 
And to follow the custom of embodying in the reports of the County 
Superintendents, some suggestions as to modifications or changes in 
our school system, I would respectfully offer in brief the following :. 
Ist. Re-enact the law of 1879, requiring County Superinten- 
dents to approve school warrants. 
2nd. Enact a law that will give the Couaty Superintendent well: 
defined authority, and require of him the performance of specific 
duties, and let his salary or compensation be determined by the 
number of days actually devoted to the visiting of schools, and let 
the districts so visited and favored pay him a per diem by warrant 
drawn by the directors of those districts. 
3rd. Let the Legislature levy the school tax or property polls. 
and privileges and litigation. 
4th. Require all public schools in a county to be taught the 
same number of days. A compliance with this last suggestion is,. 
to my mind, the only means by which illiteracy in sparsely settled 
localities can be kept down ; besides, I fail to discover any satisfac- 
tory reason for the so dividing a county into districts, whereby one- 
child can attend five months and another child, though on a differ- 
ent side of an arbitrary line, can get but two months tuition. And 
this great disparity is by no means temporary; yet one child num- 
bers just one, and no more, in prorating the school fund. 
5th. Require of teachers monthly written reports to County 
Superintendent, and let County Superintendents submit quarterly 
reports to State Superintendents.

HOUSTON COUNTY. 
I. F. McoMinuan, SuPpEeRiInTENDENT, Erin. 
In presenting this my third annual report of the public schools, 
I am pleased to say we had, for the scholastic year, ending the 30th 
day of June, 1883, the best teachers, and also the best schools ever 
known in the county, and with a better attendance. Some of our 
schools run more than five months, while others fall short of that 
period ; yet all did remarkably well. Our greatest drawback is an 
insufficiency of funds. 
TL hope to be able to send you a good report next year. 
JACKSON COUNTY. 
J. B. Toipert, SUPERINTENDENT, Gainesboro. 
In submitting this my annual report, I am sorry to say that it is 
not so complete as I desired to make it, but as our former Superin- 
tendent did not get up all the statistics for last year, this being neg- 
ligence on the part of district directors, it is impossible for me to 
make my report in full, I must say for our county, however, that 
her people generally are taking more interest, working more zeal- 
ously, and doing more in every respect to the advancement of her 
Public Schools than they have ever done before. 
JOHNSON COUNTY. 
A. T. DonneLiy, SUPERINTENDENT, Taylorsville. 
I have the honor herewith to transmit my annual report for the 
year ending June 30th, 1883. It is as correct as I could make it 
from the reports before me. It has been very difficult to get full 
and correct reports from Directors and teachers. Some teachers 
have failed to report. The County Trustee has not made any re- 
port. 
The schools of my county are in a prosperous condition. Our 
school fund is sufficient to run the most of our schools five: months. 
The enroliment and attendance last year was better than the year 
before. Our teachers are well qualified, and did their duty. The
-P-A-G-E-105
( 104 ) 
patroas of the schools took more interest than usual. We are still 
greatly in need of better school-houses and better school furniture. 
The question of text books in our county is one that is hard to 
manage, we have not yet arrived ata uniform system of text books 
for our schools, there is no law to enforce it and the people are slow 
to adopt a system and stick to it, the want of it isa great draw- 
back to our free schools, 
The want of harmony among Directors, teachers and patrons in 
some parts of the county isa drawback. The teachers’ Institutes 
held in different parts of the county last year did a great deal to - 
bring about harmony, and to awaken an educational interést. 
We need a fund for the purpose of having a Normal School 
every summer to prepare teachers for the work of the Public 
Schools. Considering everything our schools have done very well 
the past year. 
The educational interest is steadily growing in the county, no 
one now is bold enough to oppose the Public School system, they 
are now regarded as a necessity. The County Court does not re- ~ 
fuse to levy a tax for school purposes to carry on our schools. We 
hope to make our schools still better in the future. 
KNOX COUNTY. 
J. R. Sures, SuperinrENDENt, Knoxville. 
Part of my statistical report only approximates correctness ; but, 
with the reports I have collected, it is the best that I can present. 
Our Public Schools are in a prosperous condition. Much of the 
success of our Public Schools is attributable to the State Normal at 
‘Knoxville. Ata meeting of the teachers and Directors last spring, 
we concluded to attend the State Normal, and hold no county Nor- 
mal. We were highly pleased with the way it was conducted. The 
most of our teachers attended it, and, in my visitations, I see the 
fuits of their Normal training. Said Normal is doing much to 
fit the teachers of our State for the very responsible positions which 
they hold. : 
The Normal for colored teachers, conducted by Prof. Cate, of 
Maryville, was well attended, and did much to qualify teachers to 
do better work, but, as you will have a report from those two Nor- 
mals, I will say no more.
-P-A-G-E-106
( 105 ) 
Directors are beginning to demand normal trained teachers; they - 
see the difference between school keepers and school teachers ; they 
are willing to pay an experienced teacher more than one who has 
used no effort to prepare himself for the position. 
_ There seems to be a lack of system in conducting the public 
’ schools in our State. We need a course of study for our schools, 
or, in other words, they should be graded. Under the present sys- 
tem, directors do not know what to require of teachers; teachers 
cannot tell how and what they will teach, the children do not 
know what the next teacher will require them to study, parents do 
not know how their children are getting on, children do not know 
that there is any end to the course of study they have commenced, 
there are no examinations and promotions, and many other irregu- 
Jarities.which I could mention. Some study reading, some arith- 
metic, some geography, some grammar, some two or three of the 
above studies, Each seems to study whatever is most interesting 
to him. I think a pupil studying the second reader, should study, 
not only the second reader, but also so much writing, arithmetic, 
geography, and more, if thought best. Of course, much would be 
given orally ; the other grades should be similarly conducted. I 
think we can have sume system about our schools, if we make the 
attempt. Other States have graded their public schools, and why 
‘can we not? It is no new, untried experiment; those who have 
undertaken it, are highly pleased with the result. Our schools 
would be much more efficient. The schools of the second district 
of our county are all graded. There are ten schools in the district. 
The teachers are highly pleased with the new departure. They have 
but little difficulty in getting their pupils to go into the respective 
grades. One of the teachers remarked to me that the mountains 
which he saw in the distance, proved to be small hills when he 
reached them. ‘The Directors of said district have taken much in- 
terest in the welfare of their schools, and, in addition to the course 
of study, they publish the rules for the government of their schools. 
Thinking some would be interested to know how the grades run, I 
insert them in this report; they are probably not the best, but are 
~ good. They are as follows: 
FIRST GRADE. .

Other schools in the county are adopting the same course of 
study, and, I think that next year, we can open all our schools’ 
with some system. : 
In a brief report like this, I can say but little about shools. 
Knox county is noted for its fine schools. The Knoxville City 
Schools are very good—the pride of its citizens. I return my . 
thanks to the Superintendent and Board of Education for their as- 
sistance in the work assigned me. I would like to speak of the 
University, and other schools in our midst, but I must bring my 
remarks to a close. 
  
LAKE COUNTY. 
L. DonaLpson, SUPERINTENDENT, Tiptonville. 
In obedience to the requirements of law governing Public Schools 
T herewith submit my annual report of the statistics for the year 
ending June 30th, 1883, of my county. A failure on the, part of 
my predecessor to turn over to me the abstracts of teachers at the 
time I came in office has occasioned much trouble to me in making 
a fair and expeditious report. Owing to the floods, storms and 
other causes I have not been able during the short time I have 
been in office to give that attention to the visitation of schools 
which is probably required, but in other respects can say that they 
have had my attention and interest, and I think I can see good 
results therefrom. 
We have a pretty fair corps of teachers. The interest in educa- 
tion and the maintenance of a regular tax to sustain it has a strong 
hold on the people. Our Directors are disposed to give good 
salaries to teachers, and the future of our schools is not discouraging. 
LAUDERDALE COUNTY. 
Henry Sanrorp, SUPERINTENDENT, Ripley. 
T have the honor herewith to transmit my annual report of the 
“sckools of this (Lauderdale) county. By reference to it you will 
see that there has been a marked increase in the number of pupils 
enrolled, and the average attendance has greatly improved.as com-
-P-A-G-E-110
( 109 ) ‘ 
pared with any former year. This is owing to a variety of causes, 
The principal of which are, an accumulation of the school fund 
heretofore unexpended and greater efficiency of the teachers; 
which causes produced a decided change in popular sentiment in - 
favor of Public Schools. 
I visited sixty Public Schools out of sixty-five in operation dur- 
ing the past summer. 
Doubtless so many amendments to the school law have been 
suggesied to you until possibly they have become annoying. Like 
ordinary chills, they are periodic. They may be troublesome, but 
are not fatal. I hope that the one now offered may be adopted by 
the next Legislature and have a beneficial effect. 
ist. Clothe the State Superintendent with the same power in 
regard to the school fund and taxes as the State Comptroller has 
over the State taxes. 
2d. Cause each County Court Clerk to make out and send to 
him a copy of the aggregate of the taxable property of his county, 
which by law he is required to send to the Comptroller, and let 
there be added to that a statement showing the number of polls in 
his county, and the tax on polls. 
3d. Require the State Superintendent to open and keep an ac- 
count with the Trustee of each county. 
4th. Require the County Court Clerk to send a certified copy 
‘of each annual settlement made by him with the Trustee to the 
State Superintendent. 
5th. If upon an examination of the accounts ‘and settlements of 
the Trustee, the Superintendent finds that the Trustee is a defaulter, 
require the Superintendent to bring suit against said defaulter in 
any court the Superintendent may elect without being required to. 
give bond and security for costs. 
The adoption of this or something similar to it, and the re-enact- 
ment of the law requiring the approval of the County Superintend- 
ent of warrants, will save an immense amount of money annually 
to-the children of each county in the State. 
_ I speak from observation and experience. I have made it a point 
to inquire about the condition of the school fund in several counties 
and with but few exceptions the statements all agree that the con- 
dition is bad indeed, all ascribe it to the lack of express authority 
vested in some one to call the collecting officers to a strict account.
-P-A-G-E-111

‘It is with pleasure I can say (after years spent in litigation) that we 
‘have had more money to spend in supporting schools during the 
‘past year than in any previous year, and with still more pleasure I 
can say that we will have a much larger amount to spend for the 
same purpose another year. ~ 
LAWRENCE COUNTY. 
W. K. Lackey, SUPERINTENDENT, Lawrenceburg. 
In submitting this report, I am fully aware of the close criticism 
which it must undergo; yet my confidence in you is such that I 
‘know you will make ample allowance for anything which you may 
think out of place.or unnecessary. 
The three principal points to which you, in your circular, called 
our attention, have been carefully observed in every particular. In 
-endeavoring to comply with the requirements, I have spared no 
pains, nor “shirked” any responsibility. 
In the first place I have tried to grant certificates to only com- 
‘petent and experienced teachers, having long since been convinced 
that we have had too many unqualified persons in charge of our 
Public Schools, persons who entered the profession and the school 
room only for the “dollar,” and were wholly unprepared and un- 
fit for the responsible duty of training: the young. This is one 
great cause, in my opinion, why there are so many intelligent citi- 
zens in opposition to our Public School system ; and hence my en- 
deavors in this direction to get clear of this great cause for com- 
plaint. : 
In the second place, I have visited nearly all the schools in the 
-county, and aim to visit all before they are closed. In pursuing 
this plan, I have met and encouraged almost three thousand pupils, 
besides speaking “‘ face to face” with the teachers, Directors, -pat- 
rons, etc. J am well convinced that in doing this I have aroused 
a lively interest in educational matters in many localities hitherto 
careless in this respect. I have also, by this plan, seen the differ- 
ent methods of instruction and school government, as well as 
gathered my own statistics directly from personal observation. 
And without any desire to flatter in the least, I think too much 
praise cannot be bestowed upon our State Superintendent for adopt- 
ing this plan of school visitation. If carried out by every County
-P-A-G-E-112
(111) 
Superintendent, aceording to the instructions given, it would cer- 
tainly be one of the great agents in stirring up new interest among 
the pupils, parents and teachers, and smoothing down the petty 
prejudices and discords of every community into friendship and 
harmony. 
To sum up the present condition and future prospects of our 
schools, compared: to those of the past, I believe it safe to say, that 
the system is growing in favor, gaining friends, and extending its 
beneficial influence daily. But there is one great impediment yet 
to be removed. Our schools are entirely too short to accomplish 
the desired results. We should extend them to at least five months 
a year; then we might reasonably anticipate a great and rapid im- 
provement in our literary condition. 
I firmly and honestly believe that we ought to have a law enacted 
to compel careless parents to send their children to school for a- 
certain length of time. Many parents, through stinginess, careless- 
ness and contrariness, are depriving their children of the benefits 
of the schools, and are permitting them to grow up in vice and 
ignorance. Such parents should be forced to bestow upon their 
children what is justly due—a common school education. We 
should also have laws to compel teachers and school officers, and 
especially Trustees to make out their reports in time. 
One favor I would humbly but earnestly ask, and that is, that 
‘you would permit only two (ist and 2d) grades of certificates to be 
granted to applicants for schools. Our schools would be much 
- better, and their character more elevated. 
In conclusion I would say, that I have discharged my duties the 
very best I could regardless of the small salary allowed me by the 
‘County Court. My report has been made from actual personal 
effort in visiting the schools, and can be relied upon. [ trust it 
may give entire satisfaction. ‘ 
May our Public School system have the smiles and blessings of 
Heaven, and its benefits received by every child in the State, and 
that the labors of its advocates may be crowned with the very 
‘highest success, is my earnest wish.

LINCOLN COUNTY. 
H. T. Wiurams, SupeRinTeNDENT, Fayetteville. 
I herewith enclose you my annual report. It is as nearly correct 
as I could make it. You will observe that only six months of it I 
am responsible for. Our Directors generally are live, public-spirited 
men. Buta few districts have shown up very badly; in-one the 
teachers were not required to keep registers ; in another I found no 
abstracts, two of the Directors had never seen one, and the other 
had paid no atténtion to them. I found the registers well kept in 
the present schools, in books used as scratch books by the children, 
of two of the said Directors. Several of the teachers had left the 
county and I could get no trace of abstracts or registers. In about. 
ten cases I had to take old abstracts of present Directors and 
schools and “guess off” an abstract. Only one Board of Directors : 
failed to make a report. Happily I bad on a former visit to the 
district taken notes. 
The Deputy Trustee, Mr. Robert Hancock, rendered invaluable 
assistance by giving me free access to his books and furnishing any 
item in his power. 
Notwithstanding the few discouragements, our people are waking 
up to their educational interests. All along the line I find cause 
for encouragement. Our forty cent tax raised some excitement and 
opposition at first, but now I think that has subsided, and a healthy 
current of public sentiment is working the Common School inter- 
est up to a respectful consideration on every hand. From tax 
payers and thoughtful men all over the county only one ery is heard + 
“ Let us have a compulsory law.” “If we are forced to pay taxes 
to maintain Public Schools, why not force our neighbors to give 
their children the benefit of the money ?” According to this report 
thirty-eight children in every hundred never enter the school-room. 
Out of the remaining sixty-two about forty stay in school long. 
enough to do any good. With all the weakness of the present sys- 
tem herein lies the greatest, and I do hope our next Legislature 
will be wise and good enough to give us a sufficient remedy for it. 
With 8. 8. Woolwine, of Nashville, as manager, our Institute 
of two weeks, resulted in great good. It grew in interest from the 
start; the citizens became interested and the teachers began to re- 
alize that indeed and in truth theirs is a high, holy and responsible 
calling. Truly they are, in the language of Col. Lamb, of f Fayette 
ville, “ A great power in the land.”
-P-A-G-E-114
(113) 
With a majority of our teachers, white and colored, I am welt 
- pleased. For thoroughness, energy and skill I think they will rank 
favorably with any body of teachers in the State. Mr. Woolwine 
said that for talent and intelligence they were above the average. 
However, we have a few that cannot be induced to awaken, arise 
and walk only where the glimmering light of their own experience 
or rather conceit leads them. 
LOUDON COUNTY. 
Joun W, Hypen, SureRINTENDENT, Loudon. 
On the first Monday in July we opened a teachers’ Normal In- 
stitute in the town of Loudon, which was in session three weeks. 
Nearly all the white teachers in the county were in attendance. 
We enrolled in this Normal Institute forty teachers. Prof. 8. W. 
' Tindell, of Mossy Creek, was with us and rendered valuable ser- 
vice. Our Normal was a complete success, everybody was pleased. 
I am now holding district teachers’ Institutes, and the interest in 
these meetings is good. 
Our teachers are better this year than usual, and when we have 
good teachers we may expect good results. We pay Ist grade 
teachers $30 per month, 2d grade $25, and 3d grade 20. 
Our financial condition is in good shape. We intend to try to 
make Loudon county the banner county in Tennessee in the Pub- 
_ lie School work. 
MACON COUNTY. 
J. W. Kine, SuPERINTENDENT, Lafayette. 
In making thie, my first report, it is with pleasure I state that 
our schools in Macon county are giving general satisfaction, more 
so than for years past. I have visited and given a little talk to 
every school in the county, of which there are fifty-six in number. 
I found nearly all of them in good working condition, with good 
attendance. The-teachers seem to be doing their whole duty. It 
is generally understood over the whole county that the schools this
-P-A-G-E-115
(114) 
Fall have been a grand success. The various school officers of the .. 
county have been more interested in schools than common. Since 
they have been furnished with the schotl law they more fully un- 
derstand their duties. 
I am satisfied that we have a better element for teachers than has 
been for a long while. Fifty-six are employed, and thirty-two of 
them are 1st grade teachers. I think the 3d grade certificates 
ought to be dispensed with in our county, except for colored teach- 
ers. 
We are improving in school-houses, and furniture for the same. 
The School Directors have deeds to nearly all the school sites in the 
» county. If the County Court levies a tax for schools another year, . 
which I think they will, we propose to make the schools as inter- 
esting as possible. We aim at holding Institutes in our county 
next year. 
MADISON COUNTY. 
W. G. Cockrinu, SUPERINTENDENT, Jackson. 
T must confess that I am greatly perplexed in making this my 
third annual report. Since the passage of an act, chapter xci, 1881, 
but few teachers bring me their abstracts, but leave them (if-far- 
nished at all) with the Trustee, and many of them are so imperfect 
that Iam unable to make out the average daily attendance ; there- 
fore I am compelled to leave the blank unfilled. 
Our teachers in the country districts have performed good work, 
and have given their patrons ample satisfaction. However, four of 
our teachers failed to give satisfaction; two of them were charged 
with dereliction of duty, and were, by my advice, discharged. 
Our Summer Normal stirred up great interest among our teachers, 
and doubtless its good results will be seen and felt in West Ten- 
nessee for years to come. 
Our city is supplied with a sufficiency of first-class schools to 
thoroughly educate many thousand children. ‘

MARION COUNTY. 
8S. B. Dreagins, SUPERINTENDENT, Jasper. 
‘Our schools are in a good condition. We have plenty of money; 
our houses are not what we intend to make them. It is hard to get 
directors and teachers to make returns at the proper time. This 
report is made in part from last year’s returns; it is the only way 
I can get my report ready in time. 
MARSHALL COUNTY. 
W. T. Ownsy, SUPERINTENDENT, Lewisburg. 
At the beginning of my administration, January, 1883, I suc- 
ceeded in getting the county court to assess an additional tax of ten 
cents on the one hundred dollars, which now gives us a very re- 
spectable school fund. I then turned my attention to the condition 
-of the school property, which, in several districts, I found badly 
out of repair; but to this date we have expended several thousand 
dollars in the repairing and building of houses, and for furniture ; 
and are now cutting lumber for four additional new buildings. I 
then ealled together the Commissioners and procured+the adoption 
of a uniform series of text-books—adopting the “New American 
Series,’ which have been placed in the schools of the county, and 
met the approval of teachers, pupils and patrons; especially the 
patrons who swapped their old books for new ones, and made money 
by the transaction. In June and July last, I held a small Institute, 
being assisted by Prof. Nicholson, of Knoxville, Miss Maud Fer- 
rell, of Winchester, and Profs. Bailey, Woolwine and Shirley, of 
Nashville, which was largely attended, and did much for the school 
interests of the county. 
The teachers generally, are efficient and zealous. The interest’ 
manifested by the people in public schools never greater. The 
cause is succeeding, and will succeed. :
-P-A-G-E-117
(116 ) 
MAURY COUNTY. 
W. K. McKewsnon, SUPERINTENDENT, Columbia. 
Ihave the honor of submitting my first annual report of the 
Public Schools of Maury county. In addition to the causes which. 
hinder our progress to final success in these schools, as reported to- 
your office by my predecessors, I will add these : 
1st. Careless and inefficient Directors. 
2d. Uncomfortable and poorly furnished houses, improperly 
located school centres, and too many schools. 
These hindrances are becoming so apparent to the people that 
we think they will soon be removed. 
With all these difficulties surrounding them, our Public Schools 
are evidently growing in favor with the people. The County Court 
at its January term will be asked by a long list of petitioners. 
from each school district, to increase the school tax. 
Our Directors have established monthly meetings, in which they 
discuss questions pertaining ‘to the best method of managing their 
schools. ° 
We are holding teachers’ Institutes in different parts of the 
county. These are well attended by the teachers and people, and 
will, no doubt, do a great deal of good. 
Attending Directors’ meetings and teachers’ Institutes will pre- 
vent, to some extent, my visiting some of the schools, but I think. 
I can do more good in this way. 
McNAIRY COUNTY. 
Lixpsry Sanpers, SUPERINTENDENT, Purdy. 
I herewith snbmit my second annual report of the schools of 
McNairy county. I will say in addition to my statistical report, 
_that the schools of this county are in a better condition than they 
have been since the establishment of the Public School system in 
Tennessee. . 
I have endeavored to make my report as accurate as possible, 
but owing to circumstances it is imperfect in many particulars,. 
When I took charge of the office, one year last April, I found our
-P-A-G-E-118
(117) 
free school system pronounced a failure by many. Its enemies were 
outspoken and aggressive. The county was not only badly district- 
ed, but very unjustly. Local confusion and dissatisfaction were the 
rule and not the exception. Under these trying circumstances I 
.took charge of the office, without a record to refer to. In two 
years we have thoroughly reorganized our schools and placed them 
upon a sound and healthy basis, and to-day they command the re- 
spect and admiration of all lovers of mental culture. 
Our schools will compare favorably with any in the State in en- 
thusiasm, organization, discipline and efficiency. The great battle 
of popular education has been fought and won in McNairy county. 
‘We have been emancipated from the old fogy ideas and methods of 
our fathers, and wedded to the new ideas and methods of to-day. 
We owe much to the teachers’ Institute for this great change for 
the better, for our improved system of teaching, etc. 
MONROE COUNTY. 
W. H. Kivproucu, SuPERINTENDENT, Madisonville. 
I herewith submit my annual report. It is as full as I could 
make it, statistically and financially. ‘The report shows a steady, 
yet slow progress in the Public Schools of the county. We have 
. built five new houses the last scholastic year, four of which are 
nice, comfortable frame buildings, the other isa log house. We 
have a regular organized county Normal School which opens 
the first Tuesday in July of each year, and continues in session for 
ten days. The last session ‘of the Normal was well attended, hav- 
ing forty-six teachers and several other persons in attendance. The 
examinations are both oral and written. The establishment of 
county Normal Schools in the various counties has done more to 
secure the services of competent teachers in the schools than any- 
thing that has been advanced toward perfecting the system of Pub- 
lic Schools throughout the State. I have been Superintendent of 
the Public Schools of Monroe county nearly seven years, and I find 
by close observation that-we have too many Directors in each dis- 
trict. About all the wrangling we have in the districts is caused — 
by the directory. In my opinion, one well qualified Director in
-P-A-G-E-119
(118 ) 
each district and the County Superintendent is all that the system 
requires to have the schools efficiently operated, and the spirit of 
the law well directed. The success of all schools, whether pnblic 
or private, depends upon the skill and ability of the teacher. Tn 
view of this fact may we look forward to the time when our State 
regulations will be such as to give our Public Schools a school- 
master indeed. 
MONTGOMERY COUNTY. 
J. Mrnier, SuPERINTENDENT, Clarksville. 
In submitting herewith my first annual report of the schools of 
Montgomery county, I regret that I must say it is not correct in 
every particular. The enrollment in schools, the average daily at~ 
tendance and the number of pupils studying the various branches: 
are only approximated results, yet they are as nearly correct as I 
can make them with my present means of information. The clerks 
of some of our school districts failed to report on these points; in’ 
fact they never required teachers to make abstract reports, and in a 
few cases teachers were allowed to teach without keeping a register. 
I know very little of the character of the schools of last year, as 
nearly all of them were taught before I came into office. We have 
some very excellent teachers in this county, but a great majority of 
them are not well qualified. 
It will be seen from my statistical report that forty 1st grade. 
certificates were issued from this office last year, thirty-seven of them 
were issued by my predecessor in office. It may also be seen that. 
while we have one hundred and six schools and one hundred and 
twenty teachers, there were issued but seventy-three certificates 5 
many of our teachers must have taught without license. 
The Public Schools of this county have been almost a failure, 
the prime cause of which has been great remissness in the officers. 
of their administration. 
The outlook for the future is more hopeful. On my coming into. 
office I immediately began the work of creating a better interest im 
favor of Public Schools, and in this I think I have well succeeded. 
- Increased interest prevails throughout the county. I organized a
-P-A-G-E-120
( 119 ) 
teachers’ Institute the 14th of April, and at our first meeting I ap- 
pointed a committee on text books, composed of nine of the best 
educators of our county, said committee met with the Institute on 
the 12th of May, and recommended the adoption of the “ Eclectic 
Series” of school books. The above named books were unani- 
mously adopted by the School Directors of our county for five 
years from July ist, 1883. Radical and sweeping exchanges have 
been made by many of our schools, and we are rapidly approaching 
uniformity of text books throughout the county. Our Institute 
has met monthly and has accomplished much good in instructing 
teachers “ how to teach,” and in creating more interest among the 
people in the cause of education. 
We are entirely free from school debt, with a handsome balance 
of $14,705.95 on hand July Ist. I shall use every effort for a bet- 
ter school tax in April next. 
Many of our Directors are preparing to build suitable school 
houses, and I think the next report from this county will show a 
marked improvement in this particular. We are proud of. our 
City Graded Schools. Under the management of City Superin- 
tendent Webber, they are very popular, and are doing noble work, 
reflecting much credit on the officers of their administration and 
the profession of teaching. Our colleges at Clarksville (South- 
western Presbyterian University and Broadhurst Institute) are ~ 
schools of great merit, perhaps second to none in this part of the 
State or country, and are contributing much toward elevating the 
standard of education. 
  
MOORE COUNTY. 
A. G. Russert, SUPERINTENDENT, Lynchburg. 
Indifference on the subject of schocls on the part of parents, the’ 
lack of school-books, and the want of efficient Directors in many 
- districts, are the causes which prevent good schools in our county, 
Have visited all the schools, some twice. Have been holding in 
our county town, Institutes every two weeks during the summer and 
fall, which have infused something of new life into many of the 
schools. The Institutes have been under the control of Normal 
_ teachers, dnd that plan of teaching is more generally taught through- 
~ out the county than ever before.

MORGAN COUNTY. 
J. S. Srapies, SUPERINTENDENT, Wartburg. 
Owing to the change of the law doing away with the approval 
of warrants by County Superintendents, teachers in several instan- 
ces have failed to file their abstracts or return their registers, so 
this report in consequence is not precisely correct. The County 
Trustee has not made any report, and says he cannot make a correct 
report. I gathered all the information from him and his books 
that I could. . 
We have more schools this year than ever before, but cannot run 
them longer than three months. , 
  
OBION COUNTY. 
W. A. Harrison, SUPERINTENDENT, Troy. ° 
I transmit herewith my annual report on the educational status 
of Obion county. The report has been made with a view to per- 
fect accuracy in its details, and, I_ presume, gives as perfect a record 
of our educational standing and ‘progress as is available. 
The Public School System has gained a hold on the sentiments 
of the people of this county that grows stronger year by year ; and, 
yet there is an apathy in many instancss on the part of parents in 
availing themselves of its advantages and blessings. It is a source 
‘of disappointment to myself to realize the fact that, in this county 
as well as in every county in the State, many children are allowed 
to grow up into manhood and womanhood without receiving that 
amount of education necessary to enable them to exercise an intel- 
ligent citizenship. 
Free though we may call ourselves in ‘this Grand Republic; yet, 
- ig there not such a condition as may require at least a thin web of 
restraint and compulsion? In other words, would not a compul- 
sory school law bring a message of blessings to our fair State? It’ 
has done so in older counties than ours, and would, assuredly, not 
fail in this. 
I would suggest that some means, the character of which I will 
leave to wiser heads than miné, be adopted by our next Legislature, 
whereby parents will not have it in their power to overlook or neg- 
lect the education of. those who are to become the mainstays of 
this Republic.

OVERTON COUNTY. 
P.M. ALLRED, SUPERINTENDENT, Livingston, 
I have the honor of submitting to you my first annual report of 
the Free Schools of Overton county. Our schools were short this 
year for lack of means, but I note, with pleasure, the increased 
interest in school circles, and the very marked improvement 
in the teachers, there being forty first grade teachers this year 
against thirty-five last. Ihave a prompt Board of Directors, and 
I take pleasure in mentioning the very prompt and efficient manner 
in which the Clerks discharge their duties. The growth and pros- 
perity of the schools are largely due to the liberal feelings mani- 
fested by the County Court, the members of which have looked to 
the common good and given the schools liberal support. Nothing 
better could be done by the next Legislature than to pass a law to 
give back to County Superintendents the power of auditing war- 
rants, and to change the time when abstracts shall be made out, 
from August 30, to the end of the school term. I have instructed 
the teachers to make out the abstracts from their registers at the 
elose of the term instead of August 31, that I may be able to make 
a full report next year. Also, have requested the District Directors 
to require teachers to return abstracts before giving them an order 
for the last installment of their salaries, which insures promptness 
on their part. 
We have three good schools in this county from which most of 
our first grade teachers come. My predecessor held three Institutes 
‘in 1882; and the teachers of the county organized a Teacher’s Asso- 
ciation in the winter of the same year, which meets every three 
months, December 8th being the time of its next meeting. It is 
my wish toe hold a Normal Institute in June of next year. 
. PERRY COUNTY. 
: J. R. Hursrepuer, SuPERINTENDENT, Linden. 
. ‘My report after some delay is not as full as it should be, though 
- Ihave labored very hard in trying to make it full. As the teach- 
ers in this county have not been accustomed to making thir reports 
to the County Superintendent, they_are very slow. Some of our’
-P-A-G-E-123
( 122 ) 
teachers were from other counties, and have gone home without 
making their reports; and some of our schools have not yet closed. 
I have visited all the schools in the county, both public and private. 
T find the note-book furnished me very valuable in making my re- 
ports ; without it, it would be almost impossible to make a report. 
from this county. There isa marked improvement in our schools 
this year; the patrons seem to be interested in the schools. The 
enrollment is much larger than last year, though I cannot give a 
correct report this time. I will organize Teachers’ Institutes next 
year, as our teachers, many of them, need improvement ; however, 
we have some worthy teachers. I hope my defective report will be 
‘in due time. 
RHEA COUNTY. 
N. Q. ALLEN, SUPERINTENDENT, Washington. — 
During the months of July, August and September, the time 
when my work as County Superintendent should have been done 
in visiting schools and gathering statistics for report, my wife was 
very sick with lung troubles. I ‘could not leave her; then I was 
sick myself for a while, and the result is that very little material 
has been gathered, and only on Saturday last the Directors got 
in their scholastic population. 
  
ROANE COUNTY. 
H. F. Wunat, SurERINTENDENT, Kingston. 
When we look back at the school year ending June 30, 1883, we 
see many indications of improvement. We know that our mistakes 
have been many, and that we are far short of perfection in the 
Common Schools, but we think we have been making some decided, 
some permanent advancement, toward our ideal standard of what 
the schools should be. 
The schools continued ‘an average of four and a half months. 
This was a little more lengthy term than heretofore, but it was not 
as long as it should have been.
-P-A-G-E-124
(128) 
The accompanying statistical report is more nearly correct in 
every particular than the one made last year, from the fact that the 
teachers and directors did not make full reports last year. 
There were several very good and earnest teachers in the field, 
teachers who had some go-a-head activeness about them and were 
zealous in promoting true principles of education. There was 
more efficient work done by the teachers than before, which was 
owing, to a great extent, to normal training. Of course we had 
some failures, but we can but expect some failures for a while yet. 
The Roane county Normal Institute was held at Kingston and 
was quite a success. It was conducted by Prof. M. L. Morrison, 
: Dayton, Prof. S. F. Brading, Chattanooga, Rev. 8. W. Tindell, 
President Carson College, Mossy Creek, and myself. There was 
an enrollment of seventy. All were highly pleased. Considerable 
interest was awakened throughout the county. ‘The citizens of 
Kingston were deeply interested, and did much to encourage the 
Institute work. One prominent and important feature of the 
Institute was its Higher Department, in which the more advanced 
took lessons in some higher branches than those included in the 
Common School course, such as Physics, Physiology, ete. It con- 
tinued four weeks. 
The law giving the County Superintendent the authority to give 
orders to Directors for their work and to approve orders given by 
Directors, should not have been repealed, One very important 
“feature of that law was that it gave the Superintendent ability to 
gather correct reports. 
Held about fifteen teachers’ meetings in different parts of the 
county that seemed to awaken a deep interest. They were very 
well attended by the teachers, and largely attended by the people 
- of that part of the county in which they were held. Sometimes 
e houses’ would not accommodate all that were present. Dinners 
were brought out and served in regular “picnic” fashion. All 
were intensely interested in the discussions and class drills that 
came before the meetings and became enthusiastic in the cause of 
education. If a reliable system of compulsory education were 
leit to a vote of the citizens of the county it would certainly be 
sustained. I think if such a law was passed and provisions to car-
-P-A-G-E-125
(124) 
ry it out, it would be better than the present system, Under the 
present system there is a large per cent. of the scholastic popula- 
tion never enrolled in the schools at all, and a large per cent. of 
those enrolled leave school at the end of the first or second month. 
ROBERTSON COUNTY. 
P. D. West, SUPERINTENDENT, Springfield. 
I have worked at a very great disadvantage, entering the office 
of County Superintendent in January, after most of the schools had 
closed. Nearly all the schools open in August and September. I ° 
found all the records of the office mixed and torn, and so badly 
kept that I could not even tell who the Directors were. Again 
another trouble, the Directors get no pay and it is hard to get men 
in some districts to leave their business and attend to these duties. 
There is law enough to compel them to act while in office, but 
there is no law to compel them to take the place. If I press one 
or two of them, then no one will accept the office at all. We have 
a great many model Directors in our county, men who take a de- 
light in doing their whole duty, but one or two neglectful in their 
duties in reporting will spoil an entire county’s report. Our 
County Trustee, has neglected, I might almost say refused, to make 
a report to.me, although I gave him the blanks for the same in July 
or August, and have since reminded him of the necessity of mak- 
ing it out. I was taken sick with typhoid fever last October 
and am just able to be up, consequently my report has been de- 
layed. 
The people of Robertson county last spring voted 10 cents per 
$100 worth of property, 50 cents on polls and a privilege tax 
equal to one-fourth of the State privilege tax for school purposes. 
Subjects not reported on in the ubove have not been reported to 
me, and the fact’ that my salary was so low (being but $200 per 
year), that I was compelled to work at something else for a living 
during the spring and summer, and through sickness in the fall, 
when I had arranged my business to look after the schools, I was 
anable to learn from other sources what should have been reported 
to me.

During the scholastic year the attendance at the schools has been 
very good, greater than last year, and the teachers have been prompt 
in attending school. With the exception of two districts, schools 
have been taught in every district during the year. 
-, [have organized teachers’ Institutes in the county for both white 
and colored teachers, and regular meetings are held on the fourth 
Saturday of each month. 
I have condemned two school buildings during the year, and the 
Directors have had new ones erected. 
SCOTT COUNTY. 
James H. Jerrers, SuPERINTENDENT, Huntsville. 
Therewith submit my first annual report for the scholastic year, 
ending June 30, 1883. I wish to be excused for the delay of my 
report, as I could not get the Trustee’s report till the present time. 
Our School System is very good, and I can say that I have a 
faithful number of directors; they seem to be taking an in- 
terest in building and repairing the necessary buildings for our 
schools. E organized an Institute September 17th, but few in at- 
tendance. Since that time, I have had two public meetings of one 
day each., I have only visited about twenty-one schools up to the 
present time, and have delivered about twenty public addresses. 
Our teachers are, most of them, doing a good work in the cause of 
education, and some of them are not very well posted in the . Plan.of teaching, but they are trying to qualify themselves. Our 
teachers are very dilatory in making out their abstracts’ since the law has been repealed making it the duty of the Superintendent to approve the teachers’ warrants before the same could be paid by the Trustee, thus taking all powers from him in collecting the neces- sary reports,

SEVIER COUNTY. 
P, A. WEAR, SUPERINTENDENT, Sevierville. 
Having commenced in due time, I have been enabled to have all 
matters reported to me by the District Directors and teachers, which 
are necessary to enable me to make a full report to you by the time 
required. I find there is no great difficulty in doing this when the 
proper course is pursued. I am glad that I have the pleasure of 
reporting general satisfaction in our Public Schools of this county. 
Tn our county heretofore, there has been a lack of qualified teach- 
ers. By this, I do not mean teachers whose education is not suffi- 
cient to teach, but a lack of proper and normal training. 
To supply this deficiency, we held a Normal School at our County 
seat this year, which continued one month, and I see now, that it 
is what we have long since needed. My method of bringing it 
about was as follows: 
I called a meeting of the directors and teachers, and stated the 
object of the meeting briefly. On the day appointed for the meet- 
ing, there was a general turnout of the teachers, but not of the Di- 
rectors. Notwithstanding the absence of Directors, I was instruct- 
ed to take one and one-half per cent. of the Public Schoo] fund of 
the county to defray the expenses of a Normal, the teachers 
agreeing at the same time to teach without compensation long 
enough to repay the same. 
T have had some trouble in collecting the amount from the sev- 
eral districts, but no Director has objected to the plan after having 
properly understood it. I was enabled with this amount to employ 
two splendid instructors, and with my own aid we conducted a suc- 
cessful Normal, at the close of which we had a written examination 
sufficiently hard to test the scholarships of teachers, and I have 
heard no complaint whatever of incompetency. 
INSTITUTES. 
I have held a Teachers’ Institute once a month, and find this also 
to be a great help to teachers. It seems to animate them with new 
zeal, and Monday morning following, they commenced their work 
with fresh courage; and they seem to work more diligently than 
they did the previous week. 
\ VISITING SCHOOLS. 
There are many ways to visit schools; but my method is this:
-P-A-G-E-128
(27) 
T let the teachers of the several schools know when, or about when 
I will visit them. By so doing they are enabled to let all students 
who have attended during the term know of my coming, and there 
is almost invariably a full school, and a great many tintes the pa- 
rents are present. I now talk to the parents concerning the pro- 
gress of the school; and I can always ascertain whether or not it is 
necessary to advise any changes, 
REMARKS. 
I think it is first our duty to see that the teachers are well quali- 
fied to teach, because it is impossible to have a successful school 
without this factor. We should then do all within our power to 
explain the importance of an education to the patrons of the school. 
This is ‘done by calling meetings for this purpose. When these two 
features of the Public Schools are properly adhered to, we realize 
the benefits of a good school, and where there is a failure in either 
there isa failure in the school. 
SHELBY COUNTY. 
Mrs. W. H. Horron, SuPERINTENDENT, Memphis. 
I herewith submit my annual report as Superintendent of Public ~ 
Instruction of Shelby County. I hope you will pardon my delay, 
but my excure is tardiness of the clerks of two or three districts. 
Having held the position but for a few months, I have visited only 
about one-half the schools, there being 152 ig the county. I find 
most of the Directors much interested and prompt in their duties, 
being always ready to accompany me in my visits and ready to 
adopt any suggestions to enhance the interest and advancement of 
the schools: 
For the convenience of teachers I have held four different In- 
stitutes and examinations; one at Kerrville, on the Chesapeake & 
Ohio Railroad; one at Bartlett, on the Louisville & Nashville Rail- 
road ; one at Collierville, on the Memphis & Charleston Railroad, 
and one in Memphis, all of which were well attended and much 
interest manifested.
-P-A-G-E-129
( 128 ) 
The Institute for colored teachers, held by Prof. Steel, at the Le 
Moyne, was very largely attended. It lasted two weeks; at its close 
we had a thorough examination and issued certificates. I held an 
examinatidn later for those who could not attend the first. 
I am endeavoring to raise the standard of teachers in Shelby 
county, and have succeeded to a certain extent. Our Teachers” 
Association which meets in Memphis the first Saturday in each 
month, is growing in numbers as well as interest. It is our inten- 
tion to go through a regular course of study. Our object i is to put 
in each school a progressive, professional teacher. 
Hoping and thinking my next report will be more favorable, I 
close. 
SMITH COUNTY. 
G. C. Moors, SUPERINTENDENT, Carthage. 
I received your note last Saturday, but have been busy finishing 
up fall work. All my time from the first of July to the first of 
the present month was given to the schools and their interests. 
. The past year gave a decided improvement in schools and school- 
houses. The schools now in session are well attended. 
The colored people have built three neat school-houses at a cost. 
of not less than $1,000. . 
The white citizens fave built six nice frame school-houses, one 
of these costing $1,425. 
The rule of this county is to use the public money in paying the 
teachers. 
The other point in your note I will look 10, and also call the at- 
tention of the Trustee to it. 
In canvassing the schools of the county this year I called the 
attention of the School Directors to the importance of their reports, 
and have a promise from the clerks, when they receive their new 
books, that they will do their duty as the Jaw requires.

STEWART COUNTY. 
J. W. Srout, SuPERINTENDENT, Dover. 
Herewith please find my annual report of Public Schools of this 
county for year 1883, which you will find to be full and complete. 
We have had but two private schools in the county during the 
year. Their teachers kept no record except of attendance, and I 
have not been able to get that. . 
Our Free Schools have absorbed every other educational interest 
_ in the county, and the private school is a thing of the past, and 
likely to remain so. 
The public examinations held this year and last have done much 
good, and the certificates issued more accurately represent the at- 
- tainments of the holders than any I have heretofore issued. 
SUMNER COUNTY. 
Cc. 8. Dovanass, SUPERINTENDENT, Gallatin. 
In submitting the above report, I would state that it is as accu- 
rate as I can make it under the present laws. We are aware that 
we have no method of forcing the return of abstracts, and hence 
some very important items must be approximated. I am pleased 
to report the school interest in good shape and possibly growing. 
Sore heads and grumblers are becoming beautifully scarce, and our 
people, recognizing the fact that this system is now a permanent 
fixture of the State, are manifesting much interest in its success, 
and I think the day is not far distant when old Sumner will move 
to the front, and by her works show that she is thoroughly alive to 
the welfare of her sons and daughters in the future. Of course, 
with only four or five months school, we can expect to accomplish 
but little, but I think, with energy and perseverance, our prople 
‘will soon be educated to that grand idea that intellectual work is 
the foundation stone of every successful Government, and that ina 
short time they will see that the present method of.educating at 
9 :
-P-A-G-E-131

public expense can be made, not only the most economical, but the 
most thorough. Convince a people that it is to their financial in-” 
terest that they adopt and advocate certain methods, and I think 
history assures us that they generally do it. Our county has been 
seriously involved in a railroad bonded debt, or there would have 
been no difficulty in securing a levy of twenty-five or thirty cents, 
thereby enabling us to continue our schools for eight months at 
least, and employ first-class school talent for our children. 
My plan has been to speak at least once in every School District 
as I make my tour of the schools, and in this way endeavor to en- 
courage our people, both that they may become friends to the sys- 
tem, and that they may insist that their representatives in the 
County Court levy a higher tax. , 
TIPTON COUNTY. 
P. A. FisHer, SUPERINTENDENT, Covington. 
My annual report, unavoidably delayed, is herewith respectfully 
submitted, and though approximated in some respects, is correct as 
to most important particulars. 
I am glad to report an increased interest in the schools of the 
county, evidenced by the unusual demand for professional teachers 
holding 1st grade certificates, and the efforts made in many places 
to supplement the school fund by private subscription. Our 
County Court has levied a tax of 20 cents on the $100, which meets 
the approbation of the great majority of the people. This increased 
tax will enable us to conducé the schools next year for at least five 
months. 
A meeting of Directors was held in the month of September, at 
which the various districts were well represented, with few excep- 
tions. Among the resolutions unanimously adopted, was one re- 
questing the County Court to appropriate the sum of $200 for the 
purpose of defraying the expenses of a Normal Institute to be held 
in Covington in the month of June next.
-P-A-G-E-132
(181) 
It was resolved also that no teacher should be employed, holding 
a 8d grade certificate, to teach in the Public Schools, except as an 
assistant. All were well satisfied with the result, and adjourned to 
meet in June next, unless sooner called together. 
An Educational society has been organized, composed of the most 
influential and intelligent citizens of the county, with a branch 
association in each district. Prizes were offered by this society for 
the year ending August, 1883, to the three pupils under 19 years 
of age, showing in competitive examination, the greatest proficiency 
in the Public School studies. The first prize (a scholarship, in- 
cluding all expenses, in any University of the State) was awarded 
to Miss Mary Allison, of Covington. Three prizes are offered for 
the coming year ending August, 1884, the first. prize, as before, a 
free scholarship, the second and third, fifty dollars each, to be de- 
voted to the further education of the successful parties. 
I must not neglect to say in this connection that our county is 
under lasting obligations to Col. Wm. Sanford, the founder of the 
Educational Society, and to Capt. C. B. Simonton, and others, who 
so ably assisted in making it a success. 
In conclusion I am happy to say that the prejudice heretofore ex- 
isting against the Public Schools is rapidly disappearing, as is 
shown from the fact that we have but one permanent private school 
in the county, which does uot consume a part of the public funds. 
The only thing necessary now to insure the success of our schools 
is professional. teachers, or rather, more money, in order to secure 
“them. 
TROUSDALE COUNTY. 
Go. W. VauGHan, SUPERINTENDENT, Hartsville. 
I this day have forwarded you my annual report, which is as 
correct as I can make it from the data furnished. My report is 
deficient so far as private schools are concerned. I have made 
every effort in my power to get a correct report of them, but have 
_ signally failed. 
I was elected last January, and of course did not visit any of the 
schools last fall, but have visited all of them this fall except four, 
and I shall visit those soon. There are re twenty-two in operation, all.
-P-A-G-E-133
( 132 ) 
of which I intend visiting the second time. I think there will be 
a better enrollment this fall than ever before, and a much better 
daily attendance. The teachers seem to be reasonably energetic, 
and keep fine order. The pupils are equally energetic and reason- 
ably studious, and hence I hope that my next report will be more 
favorable. 
I have not as yet organized a teachers’ Institute, till now it has 
been impracticable; I hope to have one in operation soon. 
Now hoping that I shall not be censured for any neglect of duty 
in not making a better report, I promise to try to do better in the 
future. 
UNICOI COUNTY. 
W.S. Tucker, SUPERINTENDENT, Erwin. 
There seems to be a more favorable opinion toward Public Schools 
in some localities of our county than usual, and I think it would be 
an easy matter to make the feeling uniform if we had sufficient 
fands to continue our schools five months in the year, but owing to 
the financial condition of our county I fear we will not be able to 
increase our school funds for some years. The hope of National 
aid cheers us, and if that should fail we will still hope for a better 
State system. The good citizens all agree that in the Free School 
system rests our only hope, as we are not able to educate our chil- 
dren’ by private means and ‘as a general rule when our Public 
Schools are opened we have a good attendance. We think our 
schools will continue some longer this year, for we have a small 
balance in the hands of the Trustee. Our Directors endeavor to 
use their money as judiciously as possible, though they do not in 
some districts pay a sufficient salary to procure experienced teach- 
ers, They are beginning to see their error and we hope they will 
reform. .

UNION COUNTY. 
8. J. Lepgerwoop, SuPERINTENDENT, Maynardville. 
There has been a decided improvement in the Public Schools of 
this county during the last year. A Normal Institute of two weeks 
in the month of July has given an impetus to school work. 
A good number of the teachers of the county attended, and made 
good use of the time. , 
The public spirited men of the county have done much in awaken- 
ing an interest in favor of Public Schools. The Directors of the 
‘county are trying to get active and intelligent teachers instead of 
mechanical and passive teachers, aud they have succeded in some 
localities in getting model teachers. 
We have visited all the schools of the county and tried to urge the 
teachers and pupilstto earnest work. Our school houses are gradu~ 
ally being improved. We have almost a uniform system of books 
in the county ; several schools now have uniformity of books, and 
I think I will be able to report next year solid uniformity. 
All that is needed in this county is more money and better school 
houses. We have the material, and some exertion on the part of 
the school men of this county and we may hope to accomplish some- 
thing in this, our mountain home.

Jas. MAYFIELD, SUPERINTENDENT, Spencer. 
This is as correct a report as it is possible to make under the cir- 
‘cumstances. The Directors have failed to make any report to me 
except that of the scholastic population, and it was with difficulty » 
that I obiained that. I never received the*Irustee’s report until 
September 27th. We have no Teacher’s Institute, and the Direct- 
ors and patrons take little interest in the Public Schools. The 
County Court refuses to levy a tax, and will not allow the County 
Superintendent any salary so as to enable him to discharge the du- 
ties of the office as it should be done. A majority of the voters of
-P-A-G-E-135
( 134) 
this county are opposed to the school system, and have voted no tax 
every time there has been an election held for that purpose. Not- 
withstanding, we have twenty public schools in the county which 
will last on an average of three months and a half. I have issued 
certificates to twenty applicants, two first grade, and the remainder 
second grade. We have some very efficient teachers, and the schools 
are progressing finely. 
WARREN COUNTY. © 
8S. T. O’NeAL, SUPERINTENDENT, MeMinnville. 
I have endeavored to collect and report such “acts as are illustra- 
tive of the success and increasing popularity of our Public Schools, 
and the necessary measures to develop a well-ordered system. But 
owing to the indifference and neglect of duty on the part of some 
of the Directors and teachers, I have been unable to collect all the 
facts necessary to show the true stutus of all the schools in the 
county. Yet, in happy contrast to the manifested indifference and 
delinquencies mentioned, I am pleased to report that most of the 
districts are managing their educational affairs with intelligence and 
‘public spirit, and have secured the services of good and efficient 
teachers, : 
Practical knowledge of things, principles and thoughts should be 
worked in with the subjects of study and investigation. The ris- 
ing generation should be taught to husband every thought that 
tends to qualify men and women for the social, moral and political 
duties of life. A common sense knowledge of useful things con- 
stitutes a vital part of popular education. 
I visited most all the schools in the county, and found’ the at- 
tendance better, a manifestation of a greater interest on the part of 
the patrons, and better regulated schools than formerly, and many 
other evidences of a gradual and continued progress of all interests 
pertaining to our common schools. . 
The county is in a better financial condition than it has ever been 
since the inauguration of the Public School System in the State of 
Tennessee.
-P-A-G-E-136
( 185 ) 
‘ It has never before been the case that all the districts in the 
county were out of debt with funds in the hands of the Trustee at 
the beginning of the scholastic year. Teachers’ salaries are paid 
monthly. Paramount to all the disadvantages that impede the pro- 
gress of our schools, is the insufficiency of the public fund to run 
the schools five months per annum, and to secure the services of ex- 
perienced teachers to supply the places of those who are unequal 
to the duties and responsibilities of the school room. “ The teach- 
er is the soul of the school,” and we can conceive of no advance- 
ment in intelligence and morals, except through the instrumentality 
of our educators. Hence, the necessary qualifications of teachers 
should be steadily advanced until only those who know the adapta- 
tion of instruction to capacity and attainment, and can devise a 
‘sure method of advancing from the known to the unknown, shall 
be permitted to instruct. 
WASHINGTON COUNTY. 
L. C. PEopies, SUPERINTENDENT, Jonesboro. 
* The report for this county for the past year shows that the aver- 
age number of days taught during the year, is greater than for any 
other previous year since the school law was enacted. The average 
compensation of teachers per month has also been better ; but still 
this is not long enough school, nor high enough salary. The State 
should give us funds sufficient for eight months in the year. 
The schools did well for the ninety-five days they were open to 
the public. The enrollment was larger than any other previous ~ 
‘year. The school system in the main, with the lack of providing 
sufficient funds for eight month schools, and for the section of law 
as enacted in 1879, requiring County Superintendents to approve 
and audit all warrants before their payment works well. The next 
Legislature should re-enact this section to prevent gross and i im- 
provident expenditures of the school fund.

WHITE COUNTY. 
Jas. J. Grissom, SUPERINTENDENT, Sparta, 
In compliance with the School Law, I submit to you my first 
annual report.. I am pleased to say my report is complete with a 
few exceptions. There were but few teachers who filed abstracts 
for 1882, (perhaps a dozen). ‘Therefore, I have been compelled to 
get the information expected from them by a dilligent use of my 
note book. As I have visited all the schools in the county, except 
two, (from which I had abstracts) and examined the registers, and 
took the items from them, so, J can approximate correctness very 
closely. 
The list of official work is not full, as I have been in office only 
nine months, and our teachers very dull and careless about Insti- 
tute work, I have been trying to get them inthe spirit in order 
that we may have some good work on that score, commencing with 
next year. I have the promise of co- operation from all of our best 
teachers. My statistics of private schools and some miscellaneous 
items were to some extent approximated, as our Clerks were a little 
careless about them. 
The Public School interest undoubtedly is growing under many 
impediments, defects and small opposition, which surround us at 
this time. We have a gain in enrollment above last published re- 
port which was for 1880 and 1881, of 1,485. This is 224 more 
than double jast report of enrollment. This daily average is nearly 
two and one-half times that of 1880 and 1881, while the gain in 
scholastic population is only 290. 
I will now speak of some of our obstacles, defects and needs : 
The school system in this county has been suffering more persecu- 
tion from management of finances by former Trustees and slack- 
ness in the discharge of duty by officials generally than all other | 
causes combined. Our former Trustee is some four or five thousand 
dollars behind, according to the Chairman’s report, which we need, 
and have been needing for over a yeat, to pay indebtedness for 
1881 and 1882. Under our embarrassing financial circumstances, 
we are obliged to cut the schools a little short, in order to get rid 
. of the old debts, and try to get our prosecuting officials to locate 
this deficit.
-P-A-G-E-138
( 187 ) 
From the existing circumstances the schools will close the present 
year upon an average of about a three-months term. 
It does seem to me that some compulsory law would be of great 
practical utility to the State at large. 
The State has authority to tax the people to support the school 
system, which amounts do a great deal, and is a considerable econ- 
omy in educating the masses if all would utilize the grand opportu-. 
nities it offers. If ordinary means would arouse those good careless 
people who let the children loiter away a considerable portion of 
their time in almost total idleness, we could perhaps avail ourselves 
of other means, but as all else seems to fail, I think it a matter of 
‘last resort to make our schools what they ought to be, and give us 
value received for our money. So, I think our county ripe for such 
a bill, and hope we will have such legislation as will encourage 
those who are alive and wide-awake to their duty and interest 
and push the dormant ones to action. We also need more efficient 
teachers, better houses and more school furniture. Many of our 
house are too small and poorly equipped and adapted for the work. 
We need more professional teachers. The schools of this county 
are principally taught by farmers and young men who work on the 
farm during spring and summer and teach in the fall; therefore, 
many of the teachers are not enough interested and do not take the 
pains to qualify themselves. I like to encourage farmers’ education 
and their young men and women as teachers, for I am one of that 
class myself, but we should fit ourselves for the positions we pro- 
pose to fill. 
We have had some very gross abuses of funds in this county by 
unconservative Directors which I could not prevent, under the 
present law, as the Superintendent dées not approve the warrants. 
I am proud the schools are doing reasonable work under the 
present situation, but feel confident that better attendance and more 
satisfactory work will be secured when we get some of the barriers . 
out of the way, and the people see the benefit and economy of the 
. free system over that of the private.

WILLIAMSON COUNTY. 
Huex B. Wauusce, SUPERINTENDENT, Franklin. 
As the County Superintendent of Williamson county I beg leave 
to make the following report concerning the Public Schools and the 
Public School interests in my county for the year as to receipts and 
expenditures, and for the year commencing July 1, 1882, and end- 
ing June 30, 1883, as to the scholastic population. The scholastic 
population amounts as follows: 
White males, 2,876 ; white females, 2,696; total whites, 5,572. 
Colored males, 2,033 ; colored females, 2,220; total colored, 4,253 ; 
grand total, 9,825. The school interest in the county has taken 
fresh strength throughout the county. Teachers, patrons and pupils 
all seem to be stirred up to the importance of good schools as well. 
as schools of longer terms than have been heretofore. The plan of 
consolidated schools has been adopted in several districts and these 
consolidated schools have given almost universal satisfaction to 
teather, patron aud pupil, for by this plan they have found out 
that not only have the teachers received better pay but the terms 
have been lengthened, and better teachers being necessary to teach 
these consolidated schools have been employed, and in the branches 
of study beyond the Free School studies the patrons have had less 
tuition to pay than in a strictly private school. ‘Thus, they have 
better schools, more competent teachers, cheaper schools and longer 
terms. So far there are eleven of these consolidated schools in the 
county and their terms range from twenty to forty weeks and their 
attendance from twenty to two hundred and ten pupils. There 
have not been as many schools taught in the county this year as 
usual but the length of the terms of the schools ha increased con- 
siderably on last year. This year the average number of days 
taught has been ninety-eight against eighty for last year. The 
strictly Free Schools have not run this long, but the consolidated 
schools have brought the general average up to ninety-eight 
throughout the county. We have adopted a uniform series of text- 
books throughout the county and we have found out that it has done 
much to build up the schools and thus give an opportunity to many 
to attend school who could not afford to go before, for it thus made 
~ one book useful in any of the Free Schools of the county, and a 
change of school or of teacher does not necessitate the change of

books. Ths change of books and this buying of books has kept a 
great many away from our Public Schools. As a matter of course, 
our school interests are not what I would wish them, but I can say 
that they are improving. I have raised the standard of teachers’ 
grades in the county; or, more correctly, I have not given a certifi- 
cate to every one who wanted one. There have been ninety-four 
applicants and of these I have rejected twenty-two and given-certi- 
ficates to seventy-two, thus making my rejections a little more than 
20 per cent. of the applicants, and I could even be a great deal more 
strict than Iam. Hoping you great success in your work, I re- 
main your co-worker and friend, etc. .

Iam late making my report, but I could not have made it com- 
plete earlier. In assuming the duties of County Superintendent at 
the beginning of the year it was impossible to tell anything about 
the financial conditions of the various school districts of the county. 
After some time a correct report was made. Some of the districts 
had drawn much more money than was due them upon a pro rata 
basis, while some had not received the amount due them. Upon 
. the whole, the county is in good condition so far as its school fund 
is concerned. 
Teachers’ Institutes have been held once in each month during 
the year. Besides the regular monthly meetings, Institutes have 
been held at various times in different places. A Summer Normal 
held during the month of July was attended by more than a 
hundred teachers. Profs. W. E. Bell, J. B. Warren, A. L. Scobeg 
and J. W. Grannis did good work in this school, for which we feel 
under lasting obligations to them. This has been a great year for 
the cause of education in our county.

INTRODUCTION 
A First TaLk WITH THE STUDENT 
Practical and positively helpful is the motto I have placed 
before myself in writing this book. If it does not give you 
vital help for every hour of your busy day of teaching, then 
it fails of its purpose. 
I find those people most practical, in the long run, who 
have thought their way into at least a moderate amount of 
“theory.” For theory such as the worker wants is no 
flimsy tissue of dreams, but a structure of ideas that prove 
themselves true by the results they produce. Logical theory 
is the hub of the wheel of truth, holding in order a whole 
circle of facts. A grasp of theory may put us in possession 
of a great number of related facts which we might otherwise 
have to acquire singly, if at all. 
Let us illustrate. If you were going to teach me to run 
an automobile, you might proceed in any of three ways: 
(1) You might take me, in all my ignorance, into the seat 
beside you, and without explaining anything, show me how 
to turn this button and push that lever until the thing 
buzzed and started, how to turn the steering wheel, and so 
on — just one trick after another. In this way I might get 
on fairly well for some time, and drive without even know- 
ing what made the car go. Perhaps I should congratulate 
myself on being a good practical driver; but some day, 
when something went wrong, I should have no idea of 
what it was or how to fix it, because I should not under- 
stand the machine. 
. vii
-P-A-G-E-8
  viii INTRODUCTION 
(2) You might begin in the opposite way, and without 
showing me anything about practical driving, concentrate 
on the understanding process. As a result, I should be able 
to pass an examination on the science of running a car — 
the ‘‘theory” of it — the chemistry of producing and ex- 
ploding the ‘‘mixture,’”’ the plan of engine cycles, the ad- 
justment of differentials, and so on; and I should know 
just what is going on inside the works whenever the driver 
pushes a button or turns a lever. ‘‘The mere driving of 
the car,’ you would tell me, “is a simple knack which 
any one can pick up for himself.” But life is busy, and 
people do not pick up things so easily and incidentally as 
they are sometimes supposed to, and I should probably 
lose a job or two (as many teachers have done) before I 
could apply in a practical way the complex bulk of knowl- 
edge you had given me. 
(3) You might steer between the two extremes above 
described. You might first explain to me what makes the 
car go, what are the fundamental parts that keep it going, 
just what is happening inside the ‘‘ works” whenever I push 
a button or pull a lever, and so on. This would give me 
insight. If I then practiced my knowledge by actually 
running the car, I should know just how to control it, how 
to avoid injuring it, how to get maximum power out of it 
under varying road conditions, and how to treat it when 
it balked. I should also realize the limitations of my own 
knowledge and power, and call in a specialist when he was 
needed. 
This third plan is of the type we shall follow in studying 
The Child’s Mind and the Common Branches. Accordingly, 
we shall work first (throughout Part I) to get insight. We 
shall find what makes a child’s mind go, how to control it
-P-A-G-E-9
  INTRODUCTION ix 
so as to get most power out of it, what is going on in the 
brain when we pull our educational levers, and so on. 
Psychologists who have experimented on the solving of 
puzzles, find that a subject will do a great deal of experi- 
menting with a puzzle until he gets insight into the prin- 
ciple according to which the puzzle is worked out. After 
that, he can usually work the puzzle every time and quickly. 
Further, if he is given another puzzle somewhat like the first, 
he masters that quickly. But if he has simply juggled with 
the first one till he has learned some trick of solving it, 
without knowing just how or why it works as it does, he 
may have as hard a time with the second as if he had had 
no experience whatever with puzzles. 
Now, just as different puzzles may have much in common, 
so that if you can solve one with insight you may be able 
to solve many others that are similar; and just as different 
makes of automobile have much in common, so that if you 
can manage one with insight you can soon manage any 
other; so the elementary school subjects have many diffi- 
culties in common. If you know what is going on in the 
child’s mind when you teach him any one of them, you 
have caught the cue that will make you master of teaching 
them all. 
This cue of necessary knowledge is simple enough for any 
teacher to master — James said that it “might almost be 
written on the palm of one’s hand.” James is a great sim- 
plifier of general psychology, as Thorndike is of educational 
psychology. In the chapters that follow, you will hear 
many echoes of both these men. Neither must be blamed, 
however, for anything that happens in this book. I have 
taken their simple but sweeping laws of learning and ap- 
plied them (together with many other contributions from

special investigators too numerous to name) to the daily 
tasks of the teachers of our common schools — to the teach- 
ing of the common branches. 
I hope the reading of this book will make your work 
sweeter and lighter.

CHAPTER I 
Tue Nature or Bonps 
Exercisss..— 1.,In colonial days, when the minister was the 
school examiner and the Bible was a reading book, a certain 
minister, while examining a school, called on a boy to read. The 
boy complied, and in his best form began: ‘And the Lord spake 
unto Moses, saying tick, Speak unto the children of Israel, saying 
tick, tick, and thus shalt thou say unto them, tick, tick, tick, tick.” 
It is recorded that this response ‘‘acted like a shower-bath on 
the poor teacher, whilst the minister and his friends almost died 
of laughter.” 
How do you explain the boy’s reading in this fashion? The 
ticks were imitations of clock ticks. The old-fashioned teacher, 
in the days of slow-ticking clocks, had his pupils imitate the time- 
piece as a means of pausing the proper number of seconds at the 
various marks of punctuation. This boy was not expected to 
“tick” during examination, yet did so innocently. Why? 
If this incident suggests any rule that you think could be laid 
down to guide teachers, state it. 
2. A certain horse used to go alone to the railroad station 
when he heard the whistle of the in-coming train, wait till the 
train had gone, and then return home. 
How do you account for this? Why do not all horses do it? 
How would you get a horse to do it if you wanted him to? 
What is a bond?—A certain lazy student attached a 
string to his door latch, so that he could pull it from where he 
sat at his study table and let people in without getting up.

-P-A-G-E-14
  4 THE CHILD’S MIND 
Here was a bond, a connection, between himself and the 
door latch. The old-fashioned doorbell worked on the 
same principle; you pulled a handle, and this was attached 
to a wire which passed on the pull and so rang a bell within. 
Notice, in each of these cases, three simple essentials: 
(1) a disturbance at the beginning, such as the pull at the 
bell handle; (2) some means, such as string or wire, for 
passing on the impulse; (3) a resulting response, as the 
ringing of the bell, which may seem very different from the 
original agitation. Number two, the “means for passing 
on the impulse,” is a bond between the original disturbance 
and the resulting response. 
A bond is a connection of some sort. In your automobile, 
there are bonds which reach from the levers and buttons 
outside to the machinery inside. In the cash register, there 
are bonds so built that when the clerk presses the correct 
keys, just the right figures fly up into sight and show you 
the amount of your purchase. 
Bonds are fundamental in this book. So let us study a 
few clear cases of them, first in lifeless things, then in 
plants, and after that in animals, including little human 
animals. 
Bonds in lifeless things. — First, there are mechanical 
connections. When you set your watch, there must be 
some kind of bond operating between your hand on the 
stem without, and the watch hands turning within. In 
your typewriter, there must be a connection from each key 
that you press, with the type as it comes into contact with 
the paper. Each key of your piano must be connected 
with a note—that is, must drive a hammer against a 
certain wire. Go into a printing shop and watch a lino- 
type machine at work; what a wonderful bond, connection  
-P-A-G-E-15
  THE NATURE OF BONDS 5 
of some kind, there must be between each letter-key and 
the casting of that letter in type metal! 
In addition to mechanical bonds, we find chemical, photic 
(light), and electrical connections. The fuse of a firecracker 
or a skyrocket forms a fire bond, a chemical bond, from 
the stimulating match outside to the explosive response 
within. There is a photic connection, a light-bond, be- 
tween the object you photograph and the picture in the 
camera. Another light connection extends from the moving- 
picture machine to the screen on which the picture moves. 
This age of electricity offers endless examples of electrical 
connections; what are telephone and telegraph but bonds 
from sender to receiver? Even the humble doorbell now | 
works most commonly, not by mechanical connection, but 
by bonds that are electrical. 
It was once thought that the human nervous system 
worked like a mechanical doorbell; that is, that the nerves 
were strings, corresponding to the wires of the doorbell of 
days gone by, and produced their effects by actually pulling 
on the muscles and the glands. Our present idea is that 
something like an electrical impulse passes over ‘the nerves; 
or in other words, that the nervous system works more like a 
modern electrical doorbell. At the same time, it is safe to 
say that nerves act somewhat like firecrackers; for the 
nervous impulse has something chemical about it. We 
may even assert that man’s nervous system is much like 
what a piece of fireworks would be if the fuse and inner 
powder renewed themselves immediately after burning, so 
that a certain small explosion could be produced many 
times over. | 
Bonds in plants. — Everyone has noticed how plants 
respond to light and water — to whatever is necessary to
-P-A-G-E-16
6 THE CHILD’S MIND 
their type of life. And they do all this by means of some 
kind of bond or connection inside them. There are bota- 
nists who even believe that they have discovered nervous 
systems in plants; but, if such nervous systems exist, they 
are probably very rudimentary and crude compared with 
ours. Darwin, in order to test out what a plant could and 
would do, had a trombone played to it; but it did not 
seem to respond to sound. It evidently had no sound

bonds. It was even worse off than the pupil whom you 
may have in your school, who “can’t tell one note from 
another” because nature has not furnished him with a 
separate nerve bond for each separate note. 
Yet plants do wonderful things. See how the touch-me- 
not responds by flying all to pieces when you stimulate it 
by tapping its full pods. The English sundew, if you hang 
a small piece of meat near its flower, bends toward the

Street, New York City. 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
  THE NATURE OF BONDS 7 
meat slowly, and at length closes upon it and consumes it. 
A closely related plant, the Venus’ flytrap, snaps shut like 
a flash when an insect lights on its flower. So wonderful 
are this stimulus, bond, and response that Linnzus, “Father 
of modern botany,” spoke of them as ‘‘Nature’s miracle.” 
Nor is the wonder done, for these responses show dis- 
crimination. The sundew will not close its tentacles on 
anything that is not food; and it will not close on objects 
that strike it with impact, but only in response to steady 
pressure, be that pressure so slight as the weight of a tiny 
fragment of hair. The Venus’ flytrap, being set for a dif- 
ferent kind of action, does not respond to pressure, but to 
impact, such as the lighting of a fly. 
Bonds in lower animals. — The more humble animals ap- 
pear, like the plants, to have no nervous systems. As we 
should expect, their behavior is very simple and plant-like. 
When the water brings a bit of the right kind of vegetable 
matter into contact with an amceba, it puts its “arms” 
around the particle, encloses it, and thus makes a dinner 
of it, much as the sundew does with a fragment of meat. 
The amceba, too, is able to discriminate; it does not put 
its arms around everything that comes along, but clasps 
only that for which it has need. ae 
As we pass upward from the more humble to the mofe 
exalted animals, the abundance of bonds and the variety 
of responses become so great that it takes whole libraries 
to describe them. The earthworm, one of the lowliest of 
creatures that enjoy the convenience of a nervous system, 
has a set of nerve connections for every zone of its squirmy 
body, and another set, running from head to tail, that keeps 
all these zones codperating — pulling together instead of 
pulling apart, or at cross purposes. It responds to food, 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
    8 THE CHILD’S MIND \ 
to touches of various kinds, to electric shocks, and so on, 
to such an extent that it is possible to give it something of 
an education. 
Still, if you had to teach a school of wild animals of any 
kind, you would soon be surprised at the very limited 
number of different tricks which they can learn to perform. 
Animal trainers always find it hard to give a varied program 
without encroaching on another trainer’s tricks.! It is true 
that many animals, left to themselves in their accustomed 
surroundings, show a sort of nature-wit that seems like 
human intelligence. Burroughs says that the house wren, 
if he builds in a box that contains two compartments, will 
fill up the one he does not use “so as to avoid the risk of 
troublesome neighbors.”’ But no doubt we often give the 
creatures credit for being more intelligent than they are. 
For example, a tiger in a circus always grew restless and 
excited when a certain tune was played by the orchestra, 
and it was at first thought that he had a fine ‘‘ear for music.” 
But it was discovered that this tune was always the last 
on the program, at the close of which the animals were fed. 
The bond he had formed was of a different nature from what 
had been supposed. It was not a connection between music 
and soulful feeling, but between music and bodily feeding. 
That tune was the tiger’s mess call. 
Learning is forming bonds. — Other things being equal, 
the difference between a creature that has mastered any 
given piece of learning and one that has not, is that the 
first is now in possession of a set of bonds, of connections, 
which the latter yet lacks. Let a waltz be played, and the 
practiced waltzer is “off with the music.” His waltz bonds

THE NATURE OF BONDS 9 
are working, from ear to brain and from brain to feet. 
Could we project his brain and that of the non-waltzer on a 
screen in such a way as to show all the differences between 
them, we should observe that certain paths, or connections, 
stand out strongly in the one; whereas the other, in corre- 
sponding areas, remains a blank. 
“Educating” the piano and the typewriter. — Suppose all 
the keys of your piano or your typewriter were disconnected 
from their respective hammers or type pieces. Then you 
would have to give the instrument an “education” by form- 
ing the proper bonds in it. You would have to ‘connect 
up” each key so that when you struck it, an impulse would 
pass in through that mass of wires and levers, not at ran- 
dom, but along the one right route that could-bring-the.desired _ 
Tennang If your instrument were so made that every time you 
struck a key carefully and correctly, it did its bit toward 
forming the right connection, and every time you struck a 
key carelessly or unskilfully it did just as much to form a 
false connection, the educating of that instrument would be 
very much like educating a child. You would be extremely 
careful about striking a key or letting anyone else strike 
one; for you weuld not want your piano to play b-flat when 
you struck d, nor your typewriter to print a 7 when you 
struck an a. We ought to be just as careful as to who 
“plays on’’ a child, and for much the same reason. 
_“Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me!” says 
Hamlet to Guildenstern, when the latter has insisted that he cannot play 
on a pipe. ‘You would play upon me; you would seem to know my 
stops; you would pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound 
me from my lowest note to the top of my compass: and there is much 
music, excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot you make it speak. 
’*Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play’d on than a pipe?”
-P-A-G-E-20
  10 THE CHILD'S MIND 
This is good warning for every one of us who attempts to 
play on a human instrument. 
If we could have brain tuners, as we have piano tuners and 
repair men, educating a child would be easy. All that would 
be necessary would be to lift off the top of his skull, make 
the proper connections among the fibers of his brain, and 
close him up again. He would then behave properly, re- 
sponding in approved fashion to whatever was done to 
him — and he could probably be made to think some wonder- 
ful, original thoughts besides. But no such miraculous brain 
surgery as this can be expected; and so teachers will have 
to work on, making brain connections as best they can by 
operating from the outside. 
Educating a plant.— We could, perhaps, find our way 
inside of plants to the point where connections are made; 
but there seems to be no very definite mechanism there, 
such as wires or nerves, to connect. Yet plants can be 
educated, within limits. The morning-glory is trained to 
climb a string. Beans can be made to throw out few 
leaves or many, few pods or many, produce shriveled beans 
or plump ones. 
Of course, the bonds we form in the plant must be within 
the limits of its nature; we cannot teach an onion to climb 
a string. But this is true of children also; they can learn 
only that which is within the limits of their inborn nature. 
No one can teach a color-blind child to see color correctly. 
One girl of about twelve years, normal in most matters, 
was not only unable to sing, but after five months of 
training could not even clap her hands rhythmically, as 
for marching. 
In the brain, nature must have started the bonds or the 
teacher can never complete them.
-P-A-G-E-21
THE NATURE OF BONDS 11 
Educating an earthworm. — No animal is so stupid that 
it cannot learn at least a little. Yerkes worked very 
patiently to find whether he.could teach an earthworm to 
turn to the right when it reached the forks of the road. 
The ‘‘road,” as arranged for the worm, is shown in Figure 2. 
th 
  Fig. 2. Apparatus for determining whether an earthworm can learn to 
choose the correct one of two roads. The light line running from In to Out 
shows the path followed by the worm on its thirtieth trial. (From Yerkes’ 
monograph, “The Intelligence of the Earthworm,” p. 337.) 
The worm was released at the point marked In, whereupon 
it crawled down the highway to the place where the two 
roads branch off, each at a right angle with the main road. 
But the worm could not go far toward the left before he 
found his way made unpleasant by sandpaper (P); and if he 
still persisted in this sinister direction, he soon came into 
contact with a live electric wire (#) which was sure to 
persuade him to go back. He learned, after a time, to heed
-P-A-G-E-22
Vv 
12 THE CHILD’S MIND 
the warning of the sandpaper, and not to blunder ahead 
and be punished — a notable example, it seems to me, of 
what we may call anticipation in learning. Later, he 
further proved his kinship to man by ceasing almost wholly 
to take the left-hand road when he reached the forks, and 
by turning quite regularly to the right, where lay the way 
of freedom and success. 
Educating an elephant. — When an animal trainer wants 
to teach an elephant to stand on its hind legs, he has the 
animal lifted by means of a derrick, at the same time giving 
the word of command. After this has been done a certain 
number of times, the word of command is sufficient, without 
the derrick; the familiar signal “sets off” the animal to do 
his trick. 
Stimulus, bond, and response. — At the beginning of this 
chapter we found, in the case of the doorbell, ‘‘three simple 
essentials: (1) a disturbance at the beginning, (2) some 
means for passing on the impulse, and (8) a resulting re- 
sponse which may seem very different from: the original 
agitation.”” And these three essentials have appeared in all 
the examples cited. 
In discussions about teaching and learning, these three 
essentials are known as (1) stimulus, (2) bond or connection, 
and (3) response. 
A stimulus is, in general, anything that starts a bond 
to working. The stimulus that makes a Venus’ flytrap 
snap shut is sudden impact on its flower, as of a fly 
alighting. The stimulus that made the earthworm turn 
to the right was what we call in psychology a “situation,” 
where there is not merely one simple signal for action, 
but a group of circumstances all exerting their influence 
— in this case the ‘‘forks of the road.’ The stimulus for
-P-A-G-E-23
  THE NATURE OF BONDS 13 
the elephant was at first the situation, ‘being lifted and 
receiving a signal’’; later, the stimulus was simply the 
signal word. 
The connection, or bond, is a nervous connection, and re- 
quires, typically, (a) a nerve fiber running from sense organ 
to brain, to carry the impulse to the brain, (b) a connecting 
fiber, or fibers, in the brain, to carry the impulse to the 
proper point of exit (as connections are made on the tele- 
phone switchboard), and (c) a final fiber to carry the im- 
pulse from the brain out to the muscle (or other organ) 
that is to respond. Just what it is that runs over the 
nerves, into the brain, through the brain, and out to the 
muscles, we do not yet know. One old theory, now ex- 
ploded, stated that. it was juice of some kind—a term 
which electricians still use as a kind of slang name for the 
electric current. Whatever it is that passes over the nerves 
is commonly known as a nerve current, or better, as a nerve 
impulse. When a trainer gives an elephant the stimulus 
word, telling him to stand on his hind feet, a nervous 
impulse runs from the animal’s ears in to his brain, 
through the brain by a certain path — which must be 
just the right path — and out to his muscles, causing them 
to move. 
The response is what happens at the delivery end of the 
bond. In the case of the earthworm spoken of, the response 
was turning to the right; and in the case of the elephant, 
standing up on hind feet. But the response need not always 
involve so much muscular activity. The response of a 
certain married woman, on seeing a former lover (not her 
husband), was turning pale. Your response when you re- 
ceive a letter from your old home town, may be sitting in 
the twilight, dreaming of home.
-P-A-G-E-24
  14 THE CHILD’S MIND 
The essentials of good learning. — The essentials of any 
piece of good learning are three: 
1. A stimulus well established. 
\ 2. A clear connection — clear through. 
3. A ready response. 
A boy had taught his dog to sit up and beg. Later on, 
when company was present, the boy’s father tried to get 
the dog to do his trick, but failed. The son happened in 
at the time and told the dog to sit up, whereupon he did so 
without hesitation. The dog had not learned to respond 
to the situation, Man saying ‘‘Sit up,’”’ but reacted at once 
to the stimulus, My Master saying “Sit up.” Children in 
school may respond well to the teacher when they cannot 
answer the same questions, or nearly the same ones, put to 
them by the superintendent. If there is to be a change in 
the stimulus, as there was in training the elephant to stand 
on his hind legs, the change should be practiced. 
But a “clear connection, clear through,” is also necessary. 
A woman once spoke of a “‘con-se-crete road,” meaning a 
concrete road. A psychologist who was present suggested 
that the woman who had made the error probably went to 
church regularly. He was correct. Here the nervous path 
(connection) for ‘‘concrete’”’ got mixed with that for “con- 
secrate’’; the first syllable, con, which is common to the two 
words, setting off the wrong second syllable because she had 
said ‘‘con-se-crate’”’ so many more times than she had said 
“con-crete.”” There was no clear connection, clear through 
the woman’s brain, for the word concrete. The boy who 
went on “ticking” during examination (see Exercise 1 at 
opening of chapter) was simply using the well-worn brain 
path that had many times been thrown into action by his 
teacher’s telling him to read. The teacher had not trained 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
  THE NATURE OF BONDS 15 
him to stop ticking during examination, and consequently 
he had no brain connection corresponding to Read-without- 
ticking-while-the-preacher-is-present. 
But sometimes, even if one knows clearly what he wants 
to do, the response is not ready, or perhaps not possible. 
One’s mouth may be so dry that he cannot utter well what 
he has to say. Very likely you can think notes higher 
than you can sing, and can even set your vocal cords to sing 
them, but the cords refuse to vibrate at such a lofty pitch. 
A very successful school that teaches rapid typewriting, has 
the learner spend a great deal of time loosening up his 
fingers; thus making more flexible the heavy palmar cover- 
ing of the hand, and gaining control over and strengthening 
each finger. Expert teachers of piano put their pupils 
through similar training. The muscles must be capable of 
a “ready response” at the instant when the nerve impulse 
is poured into them. 
Bonds in children. — Our pianos, typewriters, automo- 
biles, and other mechanical devices come to us with con- 
nections all made, ready to work. Nature makes some of 
her animals on the same plan — the insects especially. As 
soon as they arrive at the adult stage, they can do all that 
they will ever do. 
Some bonds in children are ready-made by inheritance, 
and so are ready to work at birth. The normal child 
breathes at birth as soon as the air stimulates his lungs — 
though sometimes a little spanking is necessary as addi- 
tional stimulus. And many other things that he does are 
done without learning. Some of these inborn bonds are 
complete ‘“‘all but the finishing,” and as the child grows 
older, nature finishes them without any trouble on the 
part of his elders; so that he ‘‘naturally” works his fingers
-P-A-G-E-26
16 THE CHILD’S MIND 
and pulls at his toes, plays with the objects about him, 
grabs things to eat, shows some fighting spirit, perhaps 
tries to run away from home a time or two, and so on. 
But most of the bonds in the child’s nervous system have 
to be taught in. Putting on his cap becomes the signal for 
going out of doors, and so for joyful demonstrations. A 
mother commonly teaches her baby to ‘‘wave by-by”’ by 
taking hold of baby’s hand and waving it, at the same time 
retreating from the room and repeating “‘By-by.” Some- 
times, when baby has learned the trick well, it gives him 
such pleasure that he is even resigned to go to bed for the 
sake of performing his little by-by act. A bond built by 
mother or teacher may rival the connections contrived by 
nature. 
It is instructive to watch a principal or teacher — a good 
one — as he trains his pupils at the beginning of the year 
in certain essential acts, such as the flag salute. How 
clearly he sets forth the signal to which they are to respond, 
and how definitely he later repeats it till it is ““well estab- 
lished.”” How carefully he gives and explains, step by step, 
the response which he expects, repeating it until his pupils 
are ready to try it with him, and at length to steer through 
it alone. Not yet does he stop, however; he observes the 
more common errors, and corrects them before the class; 
and, as the repetitions go on, his keen eye inspects the 
performance of each pupil. He gives individual aid, if 
need be, or assigns some pupils to be tutors of others. 
He is bound to have, in every brain, a definite connection, 
clear through. He will not be satisfied until each has 
achieved a correct and ready response. To the careless 
onlooker, he appears to be wasting time; but he is really 
saving it — saving it tor every day of the year.

CLASS EXERCISE 
The purpose of the exercise is to study the forming of the bonds 
that are necessary in order to pass to the board and work there in 
the most efficient way. 
1. Let the instructor, or class and instructor together, form a 
plan whereby the class (or a section of it) can pass from seats to 
the board without conflict or confusion, and work there in orderly 
and uniform fashion. The following points are suggested: 
a. That each shall pass always by the same route from seat to 
board. 
b. That each shall take his station always at the same place at 
the board. 
c. That each, on reaching the board, shall immediately take 
chalk and write his name at the top of his work space, and then 
turn and face the instructor until directions are given. 
d. That there be practice in counting off by 4’s, 5’s, etc., so 
that four, five, or some other number of topics can be assigned by 
number, each topic to be treated by every board-worker who has 
its numeral. 
e. That each student erase his work at the close of the class 
period unless instructed to do otherwise. 
2. At the command of the instructor, let the class practice the 
exercise as agreed upon, until it moves smoothly and easily. 
8. Report of observations, with discussion. 
In such a performance, is there anything difficult for children to 
learn? Any point at which there is likely to be disorder? How 
can books, pencils, etc., be kept from falling to the floor when 
the owners are rising from seats and passing to the board? 
Need there be any passing each other in narrow aisles? Suppose 
no chalk is found at the board: how should the situation be dealt 
with? What necessity is there for the teacher to plan before- 
hand how he will give out work? If all at the board are doing 
the same work, such as a drill problem, how should the teacher 
find employment for those who finish it more quickly than the 
others? Under what conditions should each pupil take his seat
-P-A-G-E-28
18 THE CHILD’S MIND 
as soon as he has finished? If all are to return to their seats at 
the same time, should there be a special plan for this? 
Passing to the board and doing board work are among the 
most common and most essential of school exercises, but they 
frequently give rise to disorder. How can you train your pupils 
in these essentials so as to have a well-established stimulus, a 
definite connection clear through, and a ready response? 
FOR FURTHER STUDY 
1. Give five original examples of bonds. 
2. A thirteen-year-old boy, when writing such words as almost, 
always, etc., began them with all. What very old bond was assert- 
ing itself in these less frequently used words? 
3. A cook was heard to remark that she thought Dewey must 
have been a very brave man to sail up Vanilla Bay as he did. 
Explain in terms of bonds. 
4. Show the similarity between training an elephant to stand 
on his hind feet and training a baby to wave “‘by-by.” 
5. A young lady who intended to write training, wrote traing 
instead. If one of your pupils should do this, what should you 
think as to his ability to spell the word? Why? 
6. Show why we should speak very plainly and correctly to a 
baby if we want him to learn to talk well. 
7. An old man, on meeting a certain friend whom he had 
not seen for some years, rushed up to her and said, ‘“‘Why, Mrs. C., 
what a useful look you have — and after all these years!” Explain 
in terms of bonds. 
8. Before cabbage plants can be removed from the hothouse 
and set out in the field in the early season, they must be exposed 
to more or less cold. What must be done to girls and boys before 
they can safely be sent out into the ‘cold world”? 
9. Why is it that one who is educated by direct contact with 
the world sometimes has an education superior to that obtained 
in school? Explain in terms of connections formed in school, 
and connections needed in dealing with the world. 
10. An actress who did not like a certain actor, refused to 
receive a kiss from him at rehearsals, saying, “That is only in
-P-A-G-E-29
  THE NATURE OF BONDS 19 
the play.” Leaving out the kiss at rehearsals may be safe for 
expert actors, but would not be so for amateurs. Why not? 
11. A man who had just bought a horse, found that it insisted 
on stopping at every mail box along the road. He had bought 
the horse from a rural mail carrier. Explain in terms of stimulus, 
bond, and response. 
12. List several bonds that have to be formed (a) in arith- 
metic, (b) in spelling, (c) in geography. 
13. ‘What is the condition of the interior of the earth?” 
asked a teacher. “It is in a condition of igneous fusion,” replied 
her pupils. Then came the principal and asked them, “What 
should I find if I dug a hole down to the middle of the earth?” 
They were unable to answer. Why? 
14. It is said that on the morning after the battle of Sedan, 
“six hundred cavalry-horses, without riders, galloped up at the 
sound of the bugles, and took their accustomed places in the 
French ranks.” Were they unusually intelligent horses, or how 
else can you explain what they did? 
15. Speaking in terms of bonds, what provision for forming 
them should you expect to find in an ideal course of study?

CHAPTER II 
Tue BRAIN AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR THE FORMING OF 
Bonps 
Exercises.— 1. A young man who lost his right arm by 
accident after coming to maturity, has for some years used his 
left hand for handshaking. He sometimes has dreams that involve 
handshaking; but in these dreams, he always shakes hands with 
the right hand, never with the left. Where do you think the bond 
is, chiefly, that controls a handshake, in hand or brain? Why? 
Compare, in this case, the bond for right-hand-shaking with that 
for left-hand-shaking, as to (a) strength and (b) number of con- 
nections with other brain paths. What is your evidence? 
2. Write the alphabet forward, noting in seconds the time 
required. Now write it backward, again noting the time in 
seconds. Which method runs off more easily and quickly? Since 
you are dealing with the same letters in each case, letters which 
you have known for years, why should this be? 
If you have taught a child that Three and four are seven, or that 
Three times four are twelve, should you then expect him to know, 
without further teaching, that Four and three are seven, or that 
Four times three are twelve? Why or why not? 
Bonds must be formed through a network of nerves. — 
If all the connections in the brain were separate, like the — 
wood and metal connections in a typewriter or a piano, so 
that each could be built simply and separately, our job of 
educating a child would be a rather easy one. But a 
nervous impulse, when it enters the brain, is somewhat 
like a train running into a railroad yard; that is, there are 
many tracks lying open ahead, with many switch arrange-

ments to control them (see Figure 3). But the switches in 
the brain are not tended by an independent roadman who 
can move mechanical rails 
according to his will, regard- 
less of what has been done 
before. These brain switches 
are alive, growing, changing, 
and they tend themselves; 
they open and shut according 
to (1) the way they are made 
(born), and (2) their previous 
openings and shuttings.

Figure 4 shows five typical nerve pathways. The first 
is the extreme of simplicity — so simple, in fact, that our

shown — but the general picture is truthful. Your fishhook

to R, the response of the now excited muscle. Or again, 
SS may be sugar on your tongue, and R may be the response 
of a gland throwing saliva into your mouth. Nature has 
outfitted us all, from angleworm to philosopher, with an 
abundance of such bonds that work from birth. But we

THE BRAIN AS AN INSTRUMENT 23 
build many others that work in the same way. S may be 
a stroke that you make on the blackboard before your pupil, 
and R his response, making the same stroke on his paper. 
Or S may be a letter that comes before your eye as you sit 
typewriting, and & the response of striking that letter on 
your machine. 
Diagram 2 shows a chain of such activities, each setting 
off the next, as each cartridge of a machine gun loads and 
fires the one that follows it. ‘Your writing of the alphabet 
is of this character. The writing of a sets off b, and so on 
to the end. If nothing interfered so as to break up this 
circular performance, you would go on writing the alphabet 
until exhausted, as a machine gun shoots itself out before 
it stops.!. Further, a nerve impulse, like a machine gun, but 
unlike a train, never backs up; but, like time, always moves 
forward along its one-way thoroughfare. Consequently, 
when you want to write the alphabet backward (having 
learned it forward only), you cannot do it by shifting gears 
or turning a reverse lever, or by any process of running the 
film through backward; you must build new bonds, form new 
connections. 
In Diagram 3, S may be ball coming, and Ri, R2, the 
throwing up of the two hands to catch it. But sometimes, 
instead of one response plus another, it is a question of one 
1JIn the jelly fish there is a ring of muscular tissue which is supplied with a 
corresponding ring of nerve fibers. Under proper conditions, an impulse can 
be started in these fibers which continues to go round and round the ring for 
many hours, as shown by the resulting muscular contraction which also chases 
itself about the same circle. Consider the fondness of children for saying some 
catchy thing over and over, to the desperation of their elders; our own diffi- 
culty in getting rid of a tune that haunts us; and Mark Twain’s story of a rail- 
road rhyme that possessed every one to whom it was told: 
Punch, brothers, punch with care! 
Punch in the presence of the passenjare.
-P-A-G-E-34
  24 THE CHILD’S MIND 
or the other. For instance, S may be some one pronounc- 
ing for you a word which is spelled, phonetically, r, long 7, 
t, rit, and your R is to be the ordinary spelling of the 
word, orally or on paper. Whether you spell out r-1-g-h-t, 
or w-r-i-t-e (or possibly w-r-i-g-h-t or r-i-t-e), will depend on 
how the switches are set in the center, C. If you have just 
been thinking of your correspondence, you will probably 
spell w-r-i-t-e; but if some question of right or wrong has 
been agitating you, then r--g-h-¢ will very likely roll out 
of your nervous system. 
Diagram 4 shows us, instead of two responses, two stimuli; 
but they may either compete or codperate. If. just when 
the lover sends flowers (SZ) to the young lady, her mother 
puts in a good word (S2) for him, a strong R is to be ex- 
pected. Or, either alone might produce a good response; 
but if the flowers and the mother are working at cross pur- 
poses, the heroine may receive him coldly, or not at all. 
Diagram 5 of Figure 4 brings out the typical teaching 
situation. Herrick tells a story which illustrates it finely. 
His dog saw some sheep (SZ) and chased them (R1), where- 
upon he whipped her (S2). She ran home and hid (R2). 
On the next day, she again saw a flock of sheep, but this 
time, instead of chasing them, she ran home at once and hid. 
The connection S1-R2, set up by the whipping, was stronger 
than Nature’s inborn bond, S/-Ri. What a triumph for 
education, even if it did involve corporal punishment! 
The brain is a reversing station. — One great business of 
the brain is to reverse nerve impulses, that is, to receive 
them and guide them back along the right channel. In 
Figure 5 we get a general view of how this goes on. An 
impulse coming in at I, the back of the spinal cord, sets up

an excitation which takes whatever path the set of the 
switches in the brain has left open to it — short or long, 
simple or complex.

Fic. 5. To show (in a schematic way) how nerve impulses come in (J) at 
the back of the brain stem (the spinal cord and its extension in the brain) and 
return messages go out (O) from its front. The excitation, as it passes through 
the brain, may take a simple and direct path, or a complex and devious one, 
according to the set of the switches. For further explanation, see the text.

one obstruction after another on its way down, and glances 
from side to side until it finally falls into a pocket, the 
number of which tells your score. Suppose Jennie Jenkins 
(as in the old song) is choosing a color: ‘Will you have a 
green, Jennie Jenkins?”” But when green is tried out as a 
stimulus, it bumps against an obstruction: ‘“I won’t have 
a green; ’tis the color for the queen,” and so this excitation 
is shunted off onto a connection that results in rejection. 
In the same way, color after color brings a negative response 
until blue is tried: ‘‘Oh, yes, ’ll have a blue; ’tis a color 
very true,’ and so the blue impulse proves to be the only 
one that can qualify to enter the nerve channel that leads 
to the response of ‘‘ Yes.”’ 
The brain is an organ of discrimination. — The beginning 
of discrimination consists in responding differently to different 
things, and is found low down among matters mechanical. 
Your lock opens to one key but to no other. Chemical dis- 
crimination is found among the atoms; an acid which rushes 
at iron and consumes it may remain perfectly passive in the 
presence of gold or glass. Light “discriminates” by pene- 
trating glass but not copper, while electrical discrimination 
is found in the fact that a current will run through copper 
but not through glass. 
Among plants, we have seen that the sundew responds to 
pressure but not to impact, while Venus’ flytrap responds to 
impact but not to pressure. The amceba, too, we have ob- 
served as it ‘‘discriminates” between the good-to-eat and 
the not-good-to-eat. Our lower animal friends discriminate, 
choose and reject to the point of fastidiousness in case of 
food, home, mate, and so on. The baby, if the smell of 
his bottle does not quite suit him, may hurl it to the limit 
of his arm’s strength. 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
  
THE BRAIN AS AN INSTRUMENT 27 
The upshot of the whole matter is this: from toe to top 
of nature’s creation, right discrimination is the beginning of 
successful action. For right discrimination (in a nervous 
system) is simply guiding the nerve impulse along the right 
road, that is, the connection that leads to the right response. 
In one sense, this is all the brain has to do. It is no won- 
der, then, that nature has been agonizing, through so many 
thousands of years of evolution, to build in our heads the 
finest discriminating instrument in existence. 
How the brain discriminates. — In a general way, you 
have the idea already, from the discussion of the brain as a 
“reversing station,” of how the brain discriminates. But 
the brain does not reverse nerve impulses at random; it 
returns them along preferred paths. Go into a printing 
shop and watch the linotype machine as it assorts its ma- 
trices. (A matrix is a mold, in appearance like a little brass 
check, for casting a piece of type.) Here they come, a 
long succession of them, all the letters of the alphabet 
mixed together; yet each will fall out of line at the proper 
point and return to its kind, a’s to a’s, b’s to b’s, z’s to 2’s. 
Each has a special shape, like the key to a lock, and so 
can pass all tripping points till it comes to one that is es- 
pecially designed to trip it, when off it goes, followed by all 
others like it as fast as they come to the same point. Every- 
thing depends on (1) the shape of the ‘‘little brass check” 
and (2) the resistance it meets, that is, the path that is open 
to it. 
You sit at the soda-water fountain and the clerk starts 
impulses (corresponding to the little brass checks) in your 
nervous system: Here they come: “‘ Lemon?” ‘‘ Raspberry?” 
“Chocolate?” “Pineapple?” Everything depends on (1) the 
kind of stimulus (or resulting nerve excitation) and (2) the
-P-A-G-E-38
  28 THE CHILD’S MIND 
resistance it meets. All save one soon meet obstructions 
which trip them off into a channel that brings a negative 
response; but one “‘appeals to you,” takes such a form that 
it meets no resistance. That one you choose. 
And here issues a profound truth: simple as this dis- 
criminating process seems, it is all that is necessary to explain 
the most elaborate acts you will ever teach your pupils to per- 
form, or the deepest thinking they will ever do. All your 
teaching will consist in setting up obstructions to one stimu- 
lus, removing resistances to another, building a new bond 
for this, breaking a bad old one — if you can — for that. 
There is a bond for everything, and everything has its 
bond. — A teacher of a first grade was once very much sur- 
prised to find that although one of her pupils knew pennies, 
nickels, dimes, and quarters when he saw them, and could 
tell how many nickels were equal in value to a dime, yet 
she could not by any effort teach him that two and two make 
four. She told this to the superintendent, who could not 
believe it until he had tried out the boy himself; then he 
was convinced. Bonds for nickels and dimes, and the con- 
nection for two plus two, may lie in separate and distinct parts 
of the brain. The statement that ‘‘there is a bond for 
everything,” means, of course, everything that is in that 
brain, not everything in the universe; for here was a boy 
who evidently could not form a bond for one certain process 
of knowledge, the adding of two and two. 
It is simply amazing to an inexperienced teacher to find 
what closely related items of knowledge pupils can carry in 
their heads without ever suspecting that one has anything 
to do with the other. They are like the boy who, blind 
from birth, had learned to know the house cat by touch. 
Later, when he had received his sight, he saw the cat but
-P-A-G-E-39
THE BRAIN AS AN INSTRUMENT 29 
failed to recognize her; the touch bond and the sight bond 
were working separately. He then picked her up, looked at 
her intently while stroking her, and said, “‘Now, Puss, I 
shall know you next time.” 
We can readily see why any new thing attracts our at- 
tention, if it is of such a nature as to stimulate us at all; 
for it starts a nerve excitation which, instead of flowing 
smoothly along some well-worn brain channel, has no path 
at all prepared for it. It produces somewhat the same 
effect in the nervous system that would be produced in the 
linotype machine if one of the “‘little brass checks” were so 
different from all the rest that it refused to follow any open 
channel, but clogged the machinery until a new passage 
could be made for it. 
Lessons from brain disease. — The behavior of certain of 
the afflicted shows us how independently bonds may function 
or fail to perform. For instance, a patient may not be able 
either to speak or to write the word “bell” if he merely 
sees the bell, and yet both speak and write the word if 
the bell is also rung. Or the sound may enable him to 
speak the word but not to write it, or vice versa. Another 
finds all nouns, or all verbs, or perhaps all long words of 
whatever kind cut out of his vocabulary, the remainder of 
it remaining intact. Or one may be able to speak words 
when they occur to him, but may be unable either to hear 
or see these same words when spoken or written by another. 
Either the in-going, sensory channels may be clogged, or 
the out-going, motor pathways, or a part only of either. 
A cobbler’s right hand may lose its cunning, so that he can 
no longer cobble shoes, and it still may serve him well in 
other acts. Or one’s hand, though not paralyzed, may lose 
the power to control that little instrument, the pen. Some- 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
    30 THE CHILD’S MIND 
times one whole side of the body becomes ‘‘apractic,’’ that 
is, still under the general control of the will and yet unable 
to perform its former acts of skill. 
How nerve impulses influence each other. — In discussing 
Figure 4 (diagrams 4 and 5), we found two (and there may 
be more) nerve channels opening into a final common path. 
Further, we found that the impulses poured into this final 
common path from different directions may either favor 
each other or be antagonistic. If a boy wants a piece of pie 
and his mother tells him to take it, the impulses resulting 
from these two stimuli facilitate each other when they enter 
the final common path. Such an effect is called facilitation. 
But the impulses may interfere with each other. If two 
opposing crowds of people, say the reds and the blues, try 
to come out of the same door at the same time, what happens 
will depend on their relative strength. If they are of about 
equal pressing power, they may come out in mingled order, 
first a red and then a blue; but if one preponderates, it will 
inhibit (literally, “hold in’) the other. Competing nerve 
impulses behave similarly: an excited small boy on the 
platform made the startling declaration that 
Under a spreading blacksmith tree, 
The village chestnut stands. 
A trained lion attacked his trainer during a performance, 
downed him, and carried him over to a woman performer 
who was also in the ring. She quickly fired two blank 
cartridges and threw her arms round the lion’s neck — 
signals for him to change his act. He at once drew his teeth 
from the trainer’s body, fell into the proper pose, and quite 
forgot his anger. Why? Because by these old signals she 
roused a rush of nerve energy which swept with such force 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
THE BRAIN AS AN INSTRUMENT 31 
into the ‘‘final common path” that it inhibited the angry 
biting and set off the accustomed act. The well-established 
stimulus, the definite connection, clear through, and the 
ready response, saved the trainer’s life. 
Such a “holding in” of one nerve current by another is 
called inhibition. 
If your pupils respect you, and also have a little wholesome 
fear of you, you may be able to inhibit, by a look or a 
word, most of their mischief. 
Sensori-motor bonds and high-level bonds. — Sensori 
means coming from a sense organ. Motor means going to a 
motor organ. A sensori-motor bond, then, is one that 
forms a direct connection between stimulus and response. 
Suppose you see a flower and pluck it, without thought of 
who owns it or what will be done about it; you are exercising 
a sensori-motor bond from eye to hand — a bond that runs 
through the lower part of your brain. 
Look again at Figure 5. Notice that, according to the 
plan there pictured, an incoming impulse may take either 
the low road or the high road. If one takes the high road 
and another takes the low, the latter will get to the end 
of its circuit first, for it follows a simple, direct route over 
an open path. These bonds that make use of the “low 
road’’ are, in general, sensori-motor bonds. Observe also 
that the upper part of the brain is richer in roads than the 
lower part, so that an impulse which attempts to make its 
way through this network is likely to be switched from 
point to point in a way that is complex and devious. If 
you stop to reflect before plucking the flower, the nervous 
excitation is being reflected from point to point in your 
upper brain as you think, ‘‘Who owns this?” ‘Will he 
care?” ‘Has he a watchdog?” Ete.

  32 THE CHILD’S MIND 
The lower animals (putting it roughly) have only sensori- 
motor nerve paths. Consequently, if they react to a stimu- 
lus at all, we expect their response to be direct, simple, and 
immediate. We are much surprised if an animal response 
is delayed (as when a mine mule is said to have waited a 
month for a chance to kick a man who had flogged him), or 
if it is complex in the carrying out, or requires any planning, 
has anything ‘‘deep” about it. So far as they go, these 
sharp-sensed creatures may beat us. Shaler says that “the 
average horse will be able to return on a road which it has 
traversed a few hours before, with less risk of blundering 
than an ordinary driver.’’! But the lower animals, like 
some very ordinary people, have specialized, as we might say, 
in sensori-motor bonds, both by birth and training, and at 
the expense of something higher. For though they are sharp 
sensed, they are not sharp witted. It is said that a group 
of monkeys, gathered on a cool night round a camp fire left 
by an African traveler, sadly watched it die, none of them 
having intelligence enough to lay on sticks and keep it going. 
Relation between sensori-motor and high-level connec- 
tions. —So long as a nerve impulse can sweep smoothly 
along a sensori-motor pathway, it will do so; but when 
something blocks its course, it will rise, like water dammed, 
to a high-level channel — if there is any high-level in that 
brain. Here is the reason for the multitude of ‘don’ts” 
and punishments which education compels us to inflict on 
children: we must block their sensori-motor, animal-like 
responses in some way, to compel their nerve currents to 
rise to the higher, reflective level, to make them ‘think 
what they are about.”

  34 THE CHILD’S MIND 
hold up the toy and get him to listen while you show him 
how to ask nicely for it, and he “‘begs.” He then gets the 
toy, and smiles. The arrows indicate incoming and out- 
going nerve currents. The dotted lines indicate channels 
that are being opened to the higher centers. 
The second part (B) of the figure shows the brain process 
after education. ‘‘The impression see awakens the chain of 
memories, and the only reactions that take place are the beg 
and smile. The thought of the slap, connected with the 
activity of Center 2, inhibits the snatch, and makes it 
abortive, so it is represented only by a dotted line of dis- 
charge not reaching the terminus. The same fact is true 
of the cry reaction. These are, as it were, short-circuited 
by the current sweeping through the higher centers from 
see to smile.” This “‘educated”’ response may seem slow and 
hesitant, especially at first, as compared with the original 
sensori-motor responses; but it represents a real saving in 
time, energy, and suffering. 
To be educated, then, is to look before you leap, to think 
twice before you speak, to ‘‘use your head” — especially 
the upper part of it. 
Brains must be developed from the bottom up. — This is 
a point which we teachers are in danger of forgetting, and 
yet which it is almost fatal to forget. Although the su- 
preme and final effort in education is to call the higher 
centers into control, the only road to them lies through the 
sensori-motor pathways. ‘‘I want you to think this over,” 
you say to your friend; yes, but all you have done 
is to send a message in through his ears, and so along a 
sensori-motor channel. It will never reach his reflective 
centers unless he is given to reflection. Nature made many 
animals without an upper story to their brains before she
-P-A-G-E-45

\o 
THE BRAIN AS AN INSTRUMENT 35 
invented man, and she still makes him on a plan that com- 
pels us to build up the lower animal story first if the upper, 
distinctly human part is ever to amount to anything. 
Fortunately, the old style of book-bound education, aimed 
almost wholly at the high-level cells, is giving way to a new 
style which leads a child to develop his sensori-motor cen- 
ters first by using his eyes, ears, and muscles more as the 
lower animals do. 
To try to build up high-level ideas without first exercising 
the sensori-motor connections is like trying to build a 
castle in a quicksand. Or (to change the figure) it is like 
trying to get directly to the upper story of a building, when 
there is no way of entering but through the lower story. 
We must follow the order of nature. — Some bonds are 
born ready to work, some achieve readiness and then work 
well, and some, unfortunately, have work thrust upon them 
when they are not ready for it. 
Most interesting and surprising, perhaps, are the con- 
nections already formed at birth. Kittens, having never 
had experience with a dog, and before they get their eyes 
open, will spit and arch their backs at the mere smell of a 
hand that has just stroked a dog. White rats, on seeing 
or hearing or smelling a cat for the first time, show great 
fear. But they do not act so when first they smell the 
odor of a rabbit. ‘‘Rat-brained” though they are, nature 
has formed very finely in their little skulls the fibers of 
discrimination. 
Other bonds, although not ready-made at birth, ripen 
“naturally”? at the proper age, as glands and muscles do, 
and need no training, or very little, to enable them to do 
their perfect work. For example, the young bird’s flying 
muscles and his flying nerve fibers seem to mature together. 
   
-P-A-G-E-46
    
36 THE CHILD’S MIND 
Shaler says that when a young shepherd dog of good blood 
first sees a flock of sheep, he regards them with such atten- 
tion as he gives to no other living thing except his master. 
He feels himself their caretaker, never seizes one unless it 
tries to run away, and even then does not make for its 
throat, as other dogs do, but catches it by the leg or the 
fleece, using only so much force as is necessary. And if 
excitement does lead him to violate the practice of the good 
shepherd, ‘‘a little remonstrance, or at most a slight casti- 
gation, is pretty sure to turn him from his evil ways.” ! 
Most of our school teaching would be as easy and pleasant 
as the training of such a shepherd dog if we could have the 
same favorable conditions; that is, (1) if we could teach 
our pupils what “‘comes natural”? to them, and (2) if we 
could teach it at the time when their brain fibers are most 
ready to learn it. After all, nature is the great teacher; 
we must depend on her to furnish the brain fibers, and we 
must wait for her to mature them before we can do any teach- 
ing of value. It would be hard teaching a shepherd dog to 
herd cats, or even to herd sheep, before he leaves off his 
puppy ways and shows himself ready to become a good 
shepherd. 
One of the very worst features about much of our 
present-day ‘‘education” is that we are ever urging our 
learning on unready brain cells, destroying happiness, 
creating nervousness, and making a terrible waste into the 
bargain. 
What is Nature’s order? — Nature works like an electri- 
cian who strings many wires at once, but turns the current 
into them only as they are needed, leaving some unelectrified 
for years. All the nerve cells, some three thousand millions 
1 Nathaniel Southgate Shaler — Domesticated Animals, p. 20.
-P-A-G-E-47
  THE BRAIN AS AN INSTRUMENT 37 
of them, are in place at birth; but they never all develop — 
you will die with some of yours unused. 
In general, the process of growth and of connection- 
forming begins low down in the nervous system and rises 
toward the top — the spinal cord first, then the sensori-motor 
fibers of the brain, and last its lofty and complex portion. 
How far the process has proceeded is shown, not so much 
by the growth of the body or its parts, but by what the 
individual does. The baby coos and cries (upper spinal 
cord), the school boy hammers and tinkers and plays ball 
and reads books of wonder and thunder (largely sensori- 
motor bonds), the man of science experiments and then sits 
and thinks by the hour (reflective centers). 
But there is a further fact so important that if teachers 
had always known and acted on it, they would have saved 
a world of trouble; and that is that there are coarse bonds 
and fine bonds; that the coarse bonds produce crude and 
clumsy responses which must be tolerated for a time; and 
that only gradually can these coarse connections be split 
up into fine ones that will give minute, deft, accurate, re- 
fined reactions. When any part of the brain is developing, 
nature throws up a kind of framework of it to begin with, a 
sketch-plan in which whole ropes and cables and clumps of 
cells work together at first. Later, and as a final stage, 
the fibers learn to work singly, each setting off a simple, 
unit response. The baby’s hand is controlled by a coarse 
bond, and so it works, all fingers together, as one punching 
or grasping organ; but a few years later, when growth and 
use have split this coarse bond into many fine ones, each 
controlling a fraction of a finger, that little hand will be 
able to button buttons, or guide a crotchet hook, or finger a 
violin.
-P-A-G-E-48
  38 THE CHILD’S MIND 
A child will attempt, in his crude way, almost anything 
that he finds his elders doing; but it is refinement, analysis, 
minuteness, and extreme accuracy that weary him to death 
and fatigue him to the very solar plexus — either refinement 
of muscular movement or too much hair-splitting with ideas. 
In general, he ought not to begin with minute parts (such 
as the letters of the alphabet) and build up larger units, 
like words; but he should begin by forming a coarse bond 
for a large bulk (such as a word, phrase, or short sentence) 
and then tear that bulk to bits, forming a finer bond for 
each of its parts. The channels through his brain are wide 
and deep; he wants nothing to do with fine discriminations. 
Probably even you, if you wrote ‘‘The cheese had degener- 
ated,” would think your instructor in English was making 
too much fuss over a small matter if he wanted you to say 
that the cheese had deteriorated. 
Because of this coarse-framework, sketch-plan develop- 
ment of the brain, youth should try itself out on every- 
thing that rouses its interest, doing many kinds of work, 
even if it does none of them very well for a time. 
The brain is a living map.— To begin with, the brain 
maps the body. The parts of the body, and the brain 
centers that control these parts, are always arranged in the 
same general order. For example, if we find the hip center 
at one point and the foot center at another somewhat re- 
moved, we may be sure of finding the knee center between 
the two, and so on. But not all body parts of the same 
size have equal centers. The most important, most ser- 
viceable, and most carefully controlled bodily organs have 
proportionally the largest and most complex brain repre- 
sentation. 
Further, the brain maps the environment. Not that there
-P-A-G-E-49
  
THE BRAIN AS AN INSTRUMENT 39 
is anything in one’s head which looks just like what we see 
about us; but there is a point, or area, or nerve tract, or 
“center,’”’ to represent everything in the world so far as we 
have experienced it—and there may be inany centers 
waiting for new experience to come. Now, these centers 
have to be inborn, and many, if not all of them, are made by 
nature to respond to just one part of the environment, and 
to no other part. For example, a part of the brain is set 
apart by nature to form color bonds, another center to 
form sound connections, and so on. We all have faith in 
the ‘‘big-brained man” because (among other reasons) we 
feel that in the mighty architecture of nerve fibers domed 
by his towering skull, everything will be fairly represented; 
that on the action-map of his brain nothing will be omitted. 
He carries the world in his head. 
Yet the big-brained man may lack some very valuable 
centers. Dean Stanley could not tell when the national 
anthem was being played, except by watching to see whether 
all the people stood up. No teacher, probably, could ever 
have formed an action-map for music in the Dean’s brain; 
nature had not furnished the fibers. On the other hand, 
there was Turner, son of a poor London barber who wanted 
his boy also to be a barber; but the boy had such strong 
form-and-color centers in his brain map that he would do 
nothing but draw and paint. He became one of the great- 
est painters of sunlight. But in Turner’s head, the doings 
of polite society never were mapped; he was shy and un- 
sociable, and for a time lived in an obscure house and went 
- under an assumed name, so as not to be found out. 
What tremendous individual differences we should see in 
the brains of our pupils if they could lie revealed like so 
many photographs before us! Perhaps the greatest task 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  40 THE CHILD’S MIND 
the teacher has is to find with what centers a child’s in- 
heritance has furnished him, to what parts of the world 
he can respond, and then to plan his education to fit his 
brain. Wesley Mills tells of an eminent horse trainer who 
holds that every horse is specialized by nature for some 
particular line of work, and so should be broken in by an 
expert who can discover what that horse’s natural specialty 
is and train accordingly.! If it is true of horses, how much 
more of children that the natural specialty should lead in 
education. 4 
Laws for the forming of bonds. — To bring out these 
laws, let us see how a professional trainer educates a jaguar, 
a leopard, or a panther to jump over a stick.? 
He lays a broomstick on the floor and then steps back, 
apparently unarmed. The animal leaps on the stick first, 
then at the trainer, who receives him with an iron prong, 
hitherto concealed. The creature slinks away. The trainer 
next coaxes the beast, stroking him with the very stick 
which he at first had charged, and at length induces him to 
walk over it as it lies on the floor. Gradually, and at suc- 
cessive lessons, the stick is raised until the animal jumps it 
at the desired height. After each practice period he receives 
his reward: he is fed and perhaps petted. From this process 
results ‘“‘a well-established stimulus, a clear connection, 
clear through, and a ready response.” 
Notice that the trainer (1) taps nerve cells that are ready 
to work, the jumping “‘centers’’; (2) inhibits the native re- 
action of charging, tactfully guides the nervous discharge 
into the desired channel, then fixes the bond by exercise; 
and (3) takes pains to make the effect of the performance

agreeable to the animal. From this, three laws of learning 
stand out. They are: 
1. The Law of Readiness. 
2. The Law of Exercise. 
3. The Law of Effect. 
These 1:aws- mean so much to teachers that a chapter will 
be given to each. 
CLASS EXERCISES 
P 
Suppose you had eight cards like those shown below. 
  
    T| [5] [4] [c] [e] [J [NI [Ge                     
Show how to arrange them in a pack in such an order that if you 
put the topmost one on the table, then put the second at the 
bottom of the pack, the third on the table, the next at the bottom 
of the pack, and so on till all are on the table, they will spell the 
word Teaching. Each card, as it goes down on the table, must 
be placed at the immediate right of the one that preceded it.   
1 These are the chief laws of learning as stated by Thorndike. The reader 
versed in psychology may be interested to compare them with the laws laid 
down by James for habit forming, as below. 
James’s Laws of Habit. Thorndike’s Laws of Learning. 
1. Start strongly. 1. Readiness, 
2. Permit no exceptions at first. 2. Exercise. 
3. Seize every opportunity for practice. 3. Effect. 
Thorndike’s third law seems to have no counterpart in James’s group; but 
whether the result is pleasant or not will have much to do, actually, with 
whether one seizes every opportunity for practice. This third law of Thorn- 
dike’s has been called in question from a theoretical standpoint; but for us 
teachers, who must take a practical view of things, its value is undoubtedly 
immense. 
2 This exercise is adapted from Henry Ernest Dudeney’s The Canterbury 
Puzales, pp. 32 and 169 (Thomas Nelson and Sons). A form of solution is 
there given which will hold for every variety of such problem.
-P-A-G-E-52
  42 THE CHILD’S MIND 
Try it “in your head” first, or with paper and pencil, but 
without actual cards. If you do not solve it soon, put each letter 
on a slip of paper and try to arrange the slips properly. 
(The instructor may vary the problem, using a shorter or longer 
word or phrase. If many slips of paper are needed, provide them 
in advance.) 
In solving such a problem, do you prefer to use sensori-motor 
bonds (as in handling the lettered slips), or to let your high-level 
brain cells think it out abstractly? Why? How are your pupils 
likely to feel if you ask them to solve abstract problems without 
concrete help? 
I 
Let each go through a textbook in some one of the common 
branches (chiefly outside of class, perhaps) and list the outstand- 
ing discriminations that a learner must make. Following are 
a few examples:— In Language, to, too, two; your and yours; 
like and love. In Arithmetic, counting (for counting is only 
applying number-names to successive acts of discrimination); 
the times sign and the plus sign; dividend and divisor (as in the 
rule for inverting the divisor). In Music, notes, intervals (as 
thirds, fifths, ete.), sharps, flats. 
Have class reports and discussions, with ‘generalizations where 
possible. Try to interpret the learning in terms of brain processes 
started by stimuli that differ: hence the discrimination, the dif- 
ferent channel through the nervous system, the different response. 
Til 
Go through the Binet-Simon Intelligence Tests (which can be 
obtained from the Houghton Mifflin Company, of Boston) and 
discover how many of the tests, either obviously or by implica- 
tion, require discrimination. For example, if a child, when 
directed, points to eyes, nose, right ear, left ear, etc., what dis- 
crimination is involved?

FOR FURTHER STUDY 
1. A certain student sometimes writes their for there, signed 
for assigned, studing for studying, etc. Another cannot tell the 
difference between what and wat, nor between morning and 
mourning, when the words are spoken. Another insists that 
Laura rhymes with sorrow. What may be the matter in these 
cases? 
2. A dog barked at one man but at no others. A parrot 
swore at a sailor but at no one else. A crow was friendly with 
one person but apparently suspicious of all others. Show how 
these cases could be explained in terms of bonds. 
3. If the soles of the feet are tickled gently, lively kicks are 
likely to result. Yet we put our whole weight on our soles — 
apparently a much greater stimulus — and feel no impulse to 
kick. Why is this? 
4. If one memorizes a series of nonsense syllables (as raf, mul, 
zed, etc.), and then arranges them in a new order and again 
memorizes them, the second learning takes about as long as the 
first. Think this out in terms of nerve paths (perhaps as shown 
in Figure 4) and explain. 
5. If you were to put each letter of the alphabet on a separate 
card, shuffle the cards, and then learn the twenty-six letters in 
the order that resulted from the shuffling, as 7, ¢, a, g, etc., should 
you regard this as much of a task? Why or why not? Compare 
with the labor of the first learning of the alphabet. 
6. Goldie, a tigress, was meek and mild except when a certain 
red stool, on which she sat during performance periods, was in 
sight. This made her furious. The trainer painted it another 
color, but the result was the same. What was the stimulus to 
which she was responding? 
7. People have been known to fall downstairs because, a base- 
ment door and another similar one leading elsewhere being close 
together, they opened the wrong door. Watson, when he wanted 
to give his rats a hard problem, placed the opening of the true 
way into the food box, and that of a false way, close together.
-P-A-G-E-54
  44 THE CHILD’S MIND 
Children often become confused in reading words similar in 
appearance, such as what and when, but rarely when they meet 
those that are strikingly different in length or other general ap- 
pearance. 
Starting from these cases, try to discover as many factors as 
you can that make discrimination easy or difficult. Do you think 
that doors located near one another in the environment are likely 
to be “mapped” close together in the brain? Why or why not? 
What fineness of brain fiber is needed? 
8. When a child wants something which he cannot have, why 
does the mother attract his attention to something else as a means 
of quieting him? Why do politicians do the same thing with “the 
people”? Answer in terms of nerve currents and inhibition. 
9. Yerkes found that frogs, which did not respond at all to 
bells ordinarily, would nevertheless jump farther if a bell was 
rung just when a touch stimulus. was applied, than they would 
with the touch stimulus but without the bell. What principle 
is illustrated here? 
James says that teachers in presenting a subject, should appeal 
to the eye, to the ear, and to other senses if possible, to make it 
effective. Why? 
10. Give original illustrations of all the types of nerve action 
illustrated in Figure 4. That is, give concrete situations, such as 
those found in the text, which, you think, would cause the nerve 
currents to pass along the paths indicated. 
11. Animal trainers find that what one lion can learn in a week 
may take another a month, and that what one tiger can do after 
two lessons another can only imitate feebly after months of 
practice. 
_ Tell of some individual differences you have observed in the 
kind of thing that people or the lower animals can respond to, 
or the success with which they can respond. 
12. Give two or three original examples of facilitation or 
inhibition. 
13. The energy released by the brain in responding to a stimu- 
lus may be much greater than the stimulus carries with it. For

example, which excites you more, to hear in the street the cry of 
“Fire,” or that of “Potatoes”? How do you explain this? Try 
to think of other examples. 
14. Do you think a trainer could teach a leopard to catch fish 
with pole and line? To poise himself on a big ball? What rela- 
tion must the learned act have to the animal’s acts in its native 
state? Do you think a bear, if he never stood on his hind feet 
of his own accord, could be taught to skate on two feet? 
15. Give cases of training pet animals, or other teaching, if 
you can, to illustrate the laws of Readiness, Exercise, and Effect.

And yet so well our Work adjusted Lay, 
We came to Work, as if we came to Play.* 
Exercisr. — Recall your school days, especially those of your 
elementary school experience, and try to recollect cases in which 
you were especially eager for your work, or especially averse to it. 
Describe at least one experience of each kind. 
Make a list of the major influences, such as good textbook, 
regard for teacher, desire to excel, etc., which, in general, led you 
to work; and a second list of factors which made you unready or 
kept you from working, such as subject too hard, fatigue, poor 
methods of teaching, etc. Were you equally ready for all branches 
at all times? 
Compare your readiness for tasks in school with your attitude 
toward occupations outside of school. If you find anything to 
be explained, explain it. 
What is readiness? — Burroughs tells of a tame gray 
squirrel that had never seen chestnuts; yet when he was 
offered some, the squirrel danced with excitement; he put 
his paws eagerly around them, and drew them to him, and 
chattered, and looked threateningly at those about him. 
Long ago, children were taught their letters by showing 
them little cakes shaped like A, B, C, ete., and allowing 
them to eat their way through the alphabet as far as they 
could remember the names of the letters. A girl who

wanted to hurry her lace-making, promised herself a: choco- 
late for every scallop she crocheted. Another girl, who 
hated one of her teachers, studied every lesson thoroughly, 
in order to deny the teacher the satisfaction of “catching” 
her unprepared. A boy, eager to have a wireless set, earned 
money, read books, and worked through a total of several 
days in order to put through his project. A high school 
student was so challenged by an algebra problem that he 
shut himself up in his room for two days and finally worked 
it out. : 
As in an electric system, some wires are “alive,” charged, 
ready to act, while others are inert and unready; so in a 
nervous system, some cells are a-tingle with energy and 
ready to respond to the slightest stimulus, while others are 
so unready as to remain sluggish and unresponsive under 
the strongest of stimuli. Between these extremes there are 
all grades of readiness and unreadiness. And the very 
same cells may pass from one extreme to the other under 
varying conditions of growth, nourishment, work, fatigue, 
and rest, and the pulses of energy that come thrilling into 
them from other centers. 
Many words with one meaning. — It is unfortunate that, 
in the discussion of matters mental, educational writers 
have, in many instances, developed several different terms 
that all refer to the same substantial fact. You have such 
a case on your hands at present, and you need to know this 
in order to avoid confusion and useless labor. The sub- 
stantial fact is that of readiness or unreadiness, as stated 
above; and some of the many terms that are used to sug- 
gest it are motivation, interest, and attention. The “‘motiva- 
tionists,” in particular, seem to feel that, since they are

different set of facts; but it does not. Teachers are natural- 
born gossips; they love to start something new, hear the 
latest, add to it a bit, startle somebody (either in their 
schoolroom or out) by telling it again with gusto. But 
whether the gossip be about ‘‘problems and projects,” or 
“mediate and immediate interest,”’ or ‘‘incentives,”’ or the 
many supposedly valuable brands of ‘‘attention,” still stand 
the ancient and fundamental facts in the child’s brain; 
master them and you will understand the new terms as fast 
as the phrase-makers can coin them — just as, if you have 
studied the human body, you can discern its lineaments 
(though sometimes deformed) in spite of all the changing 
vesture of fashion. 
What does readiness mean in the brain? — In the first 
place, there must be a “‘center,’’ furnished by nature at 
birth and ripened by growth and maturing until it is able 
to act, somewhat as the sex centers begin to function at a 
given age. Secondly, this center (in many cases if not all) 
must have been made by nature to ““map’’ some part of 
the environment — to master some kind of subject matter, 
as a teacher might prefer to put it. If Burroughs’ squirrel 
had been given marbles instead of chestnuts, he would not 
have cut such lively capers; but give the marbles to a boy 
in the springtime and he will behave much as the squirrel 
did. Finally, this center must not be interfered with by 
any inhibiting influences, but must be set for action by 
impulses that enter it either directly from some stimulated 
sense organ, or indirectly from some other part of the 
brain. 
Such a center may act as a kind of storage battery, re- 
leasing and sending out much more energy than the stimulus 
sends in. 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  
READINESS 49 
How to secure readiness. — The general plan is simple 
enough. Consider first a case of national readiness, some- 
times called ‘‘preparedness.”” When our nation goes to 
war, the War Department becomes the ‘“‘center” which 
must be charged with energy. It is likely to have a good 
deal of energy of its own to begin with; but besides, from 
every part of the country we pour into it all the stimulating 
resources at our command; and further, we throttle every- 
thing, from man to mouse, that threatens to interfere with 
its activities in any way. In short, the rule for readiness Zi 
would read, Stimulate all facilitators and quiet all inhibi —oe 
Now, put a boy’s brain in place of the country, and 
suppose his fighting center, his little war department, has 
been stirred up by some insult. It probably has a good bit 
of energy of its own to begin with; in addition, other parts 
of his brain pour into it many strong and stimulating cur- 
rents; and whatever would hinder it, such as nervous im- 
pulses representing thoughts of dirt and damage, is damped 
off. So whether you want to put a boy or a nation into a 
condition of readiness, the rule remains the same, Stimulate 
all facilitators and quiet all inhibitors. 
But there are two or three very pertinent observations to 
be made at this point. The first is that no nation or person 
can do more than one thing at a time whole-heartedly. In 
spite of the fact that bonds work with a great deal of in- 
dividuality and independence, still we must think of the 
brain as somewhat like a complexly connected system of 
water pipes, in which great pressure or drainage at any one 
point creates a disturbance at all other points. The reason 
why the last period of the day so often brings poor work 
is not that our pupils are fatigued, but because the thoughts 
of approaching after-school freedom and sport are rousing \   
 
-P-A-G-E-60
    50 THE CHILD’S MIND 
disturbing currents in their nervous systems. Further, 
when rival currents are started, all depends on which gets 
possession of ‘‘the final common path” that controls action. 
If some rare bird comes fluttering at the schoolroom window 
during the arithmetic lesson, very likely you had better halt 
_ your number work and begin observations on that bird.1 
Know your child is another of these ‘‘pertinent observa- 
tions.” Know him by living with him, as the animal 
trainer knows his animals. ‘‘I can’t tell you much about 
Shropshire sheep,” said an English shepherd when ques- 
tioned about them; ‘‘I’ve spent most of my life with South- 
downs.”’ He could “motivate” and manage the Southdowns. 
Why is this? Not all states in a nation, and not all 
centers in a child’s brain, will contribute equally to any 
cause. Each brain responds differently according to the 
connections in it, and to get the strongest results we must 
know which connections will contribute most. The only 
way to get such knowledge in its fulness is to know our 
pupils as the good shepherd knows his sheep. 
Sample cases of readiness. — A woman who had lost all 
sensation in one arm, but could still move it, wanted to 
hold her baby on that arm. She found that the only way 
to do this was to keep looking at the baby. If she looked 
away from the child for even a moment, he fell in spite of 
all she could do. In her poor, diseased brain, the only bond 
left that could reach those arm muscles was the connection 
that ran from her eyes in through the sight centers. 
1 Of course the ideal is to use any disturbing occurrence in such a way as to 
reénforce the impulses that bear your lesson along. For instance, a very tactful 
teacher had prepared to give a fine lesson in first grade reading, when her pupils 
came trooping in with hands full of maple keys and heads full of excitement 
about them. She quickly shifted her plan and made these curious little air- 
planes, with their funny nose-spins, the basis of a blackboard lesson in reading.
-P-A-G-E-61
  
READINESS 51 
A woman tells me that her son ‘‘never could explain 
anything,” had no words for his ideas, until a certain teacher 
(one of the good shepherd type) got him to explain before 
his classmates some of his electrical contrivances. From 
that time on, she avers, ‘‘he could explain anything.” 
There may be some motherly exaggeration here, but the 
fact probably was that the center which ‘‘mapped” these 
electrical contrivances was the only one with power enough 
to break a path through to the speech connections which 
were getting ready to work. 
The mother of a thoughtful boy saw to it that he 
brushed his teeth every morning of his life until he was 
ten years old; yet he was always ready to forget about it 
until he heard the story of microbes and saw why teeth 
need to be washed. Then he himself fixed the habit of 
teeth-washing, for good and all.! We must use all the 
supporting centers we can appeal to; but individual ac- 
quaintance is necessary to tell which will give the greatest 
support. 
Sometimes it is necessary to rouse inhibiting opposition 
to the action of some excited nerve tract. In fact, there are 
frequently two opposing forces at work in the brain, as there 
- are among the people at election time. Dr. Crile finds that 
he can often help an intelligent patient to control fear or 
anger by making him see that he may do actual physical 
damage to his brain and other organs if he permits such 
emotions to master him.? In such a case, the bonds that 
stand for self-preservation (‘‘nature’s first law’) prove 
stronger than the connections aroused by the objects of the 
fear or the anger.

  52 THE CHILD’S MIND 
Proceed from the ready to the near ready. — Every live, 
healthy, well-nourished, well-rested brain is ready for some- 
thing all the time — in spots, at least. That is, some of its 
connections are ready to act and will probably insist on 
acting. But what the brain of your pupil wants to do at 
any hour may not be at all what you as a teacher want to 
have done. He probably wants to play — children always 
want to play— but you want him to read. The smooth 
solution probably lies in having him play the story he is 
going to read— dramatize it. His play centers, which 
seem always ready, begin to discharge through his reading 
connections, which are “near ready,’ and your lesson is 
borne along on the deepest currents of six-year-old human 
nature. 
Are there any ever-ready bonds? — Ever-ready bonds 
are born in the brains of all children (or nearly all), and it 
is almost as important for teachers to know about them as 
it is to know where the button is that turns on the current; 
for such knowledge enables us constantly to carry out the 
rule, Proceed from the ready to the near ready. 
We have already discovered these connections, made 
ready by nature at birth or matured into action later, and 
without the help of a teacher. (See, in Chapter I, Bonds 
in children, and in Chapter II, We must follow the order 
of nature.) Some of these bonds, and in fact the only 
ones that we as teachers are much interested in, represent 
old racial traits called instincts. The words ‘‘old” and 
“racial” indicate that such centers ‘‘map” situations that 
have been very vital in the life of man — food-getting and 
fighting and fleeing and leading and following and mating, 
and so on. Such responses, for instance, as those that make 
for self-preservation, must be ready to work at any instant; -
-P-A-G-E-63
  
READINESS 53 
and because they must work so strongly, they are marked 
by strong feeling. It is such explosions of feeling that the 
teacher must use to drive the car of education. 
What instincts of childhood can the teacher use? — We 
can do little more here than to name a few of these instincts, 
leaving you to make elsewhere a longer study of this most 
interesting subject. (For further reading, see references at 
close of chapter.) 
To begin with, there is the instinct for action — teachers 
might feel like calling it the “wriggling and twisting in- — 
stinct.”’ Children naturally (and that usually means in- 
stinctively) want to do something with their bodies — 
walk, run, fling themselves — move. And we must not 
forget that in this connection the vocal cords are a very 
important part of the body; to whisper, to babble, to 
laugh, to talk, to sing, and especially to make rhythmical 
noises and movements — these instincts are almost. irre- 
pressible. 
The instinct of curiosity, the exploring instinct or what 
might perhaps be called, in young children, the instinct for 
using the sense-organs, is another mighty force. Hands, 
eyes, and ears, like muscles and vocal cords, tingle with 
readiness. Of course there must be concrete materials at 
hand, objects, pictures, colors, and so on, for these ready 
organs to work on. 
The instinct for playing and that for imitating practically 
explain their nature by their names. If they were treated 
according to their importance, they would have to be given 
many pages instead of merely being named. One expert 
teacher has summed up! childhood by saying that ‘A child 
is a playful, imitative little animal.’ This is not a bad 
statement to keep in mind. 4
-P-A-G-E-64
  54 THE CHILD'S MIND 
\ Self-assertion involves not only self-preservation but also 
a desire for superiority, power, control. Pride is the frequent 
mark of it, and it is also the instinct that Satan makes 
most use of to undo us; but it is far from being all bad. 
It is the mainspring of the fighting instinct, and of rivalry, 
emulation, and the desire for what is commonly called 
“success.” 
The negative side of self-assertion is fear, “shrinking 
from injury,”’ whether bodily or otherwise. Nor is this all 
evil. As ‘‘the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,” 
so the fear of the teacher may be the beginning of education. 
But it should be a wholesome fear, which does not wound 
the child’s nature nor undermine his normal self-assurance. 
One of the strongest of all instincts is the_herd instinct, 
the social instinct, the tendency to go with the group and 
to do as it does. The feeling that ‘‘Everybody’s doing it,” 
whether it is wearing a new kind of hat, or “‘saucing”’ the 
teacher, or studying hard, is one of the mightiest forces 
that move us all. 
Abilities may have the force of instincts. — What is an 
ability? All brains, in their instinctive portions, map cer- 
tain fundamental features of the environment, to which we 
must all respond. But in addition, each brain has its own 
special centers, especially strong, in which are mapped with 
great ease, music, or colors, or words, or what not. Such a 
trait, insuring ready control over some kind of subject 
matter, is called an ability. It differs from instinct in being 
a personal, individual trait instead of being common to all, 
and in requiring teaching and practice to call it out and 
develop it. 
But ability is inborn, and often more strongly inborn than 
some of the instincts in the same brain. The baby whose
-P-A-G-E-65
READINESS 55 
biography Millicent Shinn has written so beautifully,’ took 
great pleasure, when only six or eight weeks old, in listening 
to chords on the piano, and ‘‘even after she was already 
fretting with hunger, would forget all about it for ten 
minutes, if one would take her to the piano.” Ellen 
Velvin * tells of a showman who so loved his violin that 
he seriously declared ‘‘life wouldn’t be worth living without 
it,” and whose dying wish was that his beloved instrument 
be buried with him. 
Here, then, is another set of connections which, as they 
ripen, will respond with great vigor and vim, and will also 
help us to ‘‘proceed from the ready to the near ready’’; for 
one who wants to carry out a pet project will often plod 
through a great many intermediary and uninteresting diffi- 
culties in order to reach the end that is ultimate. For 
instance, the boy who wants to make his own violin can be 
brought to study hard on woods and wood working, which 
he might otherwise care nothing about. 
And here is another reason why you must ‘‘know your 
child” intimately. No book can tell you in advance which 
child will have which abilities (though the study of heredity 
makes some revelations), nor at what age they will ripen; 
for the same ability appears at different ages in different 
children, and sometimes rather suddenly. 
Proceed from old bonds to new ones. — Old bonds are the 
brain paths that have been well formed, usually by a great 
deal of exercise. They are based originally, of course, on 
instincts and abilities. Such are the connections that repre- 
sent our habits, feats of skill, acts of learning well drilled in. 
Over these old paths, especially if they have been exercised

56 THE CHILD’S MIND 
with pleasure, nervous impulses slip with ease, enabling us 
to build branch lines from them. For habit bonds may be 
as strong as instinctive connections, and, in fact, differ 
from them in no essential way except in origin. It is only 
another case, then, of proceeding from the ready to the 
near ready. 
The good teacher never goes through a lesson without 
building on these old bonds in some way. Having taught 
his pupil to count, he presents addition as a short way of 
counting; multiplication as a short way of adding; algebra, 
at length, as a kind of arithmetic. Reading begins with 
words, or groups of words, instead of letters because the 
pupil has talked words for years, but has never talked 
letters. Geography is presented in terms of the child’s 
_ home surroundings, and history is most welcome when told 
in the language of his own experience. 
Summary of sources of readiness. — We have found in 
the brain three sources of readiness, three kinds of center 
which the teacher can stimulate when she wants to rouse 
a child’s interest, get his attention, ‘‘motivate” him. These 
bonds represent: 
1. Instincts, presumably common to all and ever ready. 
2. Abilities, presumably peculiar to each. Watch for 
their ripening. 
3. Habits — using the term broadly to include all bonds 
well practiced. 
Summary of the problem of readiness. — It is commonly 
stated that the problem of interest, attention, readiness, 
“motivation,” is the most difficult in all education. But 
under ideal conditions for teaching, it is scarcely a problem 
at all. For, as said above, every normal child is ready for 
something all the time. We should find out what that some- 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
  
READINESS 57 
thing is and teach it to him. Theodore Roosevelt, as a boy, 
never had to be urged to study nature. His tutor simply 
' taught him what he wanted to know. The big trouble is, 
God made the children and man made the schools. The 
result is that we usually have to teach what we are told to, 
and teach it at the time when it appears in the curriculum. 
A new type of school organization is needed. 
Further, there may easily be too much artificial urging of 
interest. For even if we do succeed, by cunning, in creat- 
ing an inflammatory desire for what we have to offer, we 
may be thwarting and dwarfing our pupil’s deeper yearn- 
ings and native abilities in a way that is mentally unhy- 
gienic and socially unwholesome. 
There is, withal, a legitimate art of mental making 
ready. Let us see how to practice it. 
The animal trainer’s method. — The skilful trainer de- 
pends on the following factors: 
. The homing pigeon is given a pleasant 
ovecote, in a quiet place, and is fed the food that most 
pleases him. Chickens hatched and kept on a carpet will 
not scratch; but sprinkle gravel on the carpet and the 
scratching begins. If an animal has learned to do a trick 
in one part of the room, moving his box to another part 
may cause a breakdown in the habit. 
\ Bodily and mental condition. The animal is kept in fine 
trim, and is given short lessons so as not to cause fatigue. 
Personality of the trainer. It is astonishing to find what 
emphasis experts lay on this factor, and not only on the 
courage of the trainer but on other moral qualities as well. 
Further, the best trainers have a real affection for their 
animals, and live with them until they know them inti- 
mately.
-P-A-G-E-68
  58 THE CHILD’S MIND 
ale task. ‘‘Suitable task” here means one that 
the animal to be taught, naturally undertakes. The monkey 
climbs and swings, the parrot talks, the panther poises and ~ 
springs; but these animals cannot exchange tricks indis- 
criminately. 
A suitable special stimulus. The first essential is to get 
the animal to move in some way in response to the desire 
for food, the call of its mother or mate, or at sight of the 
nest. But if he cares so little about the stimulus as not to 
move in its presence, the case is hopeless. Further, if he 
can respond to food directly, he acquires a habit very quickly; 
but if he has to respond to such stimuli as lights (which he 
may care little about), choosing by means of color the path to 
his food, hundreds of trials may be necessary before he can 
do the deed with certainty. If reénforcing stimuli are used, 
such as food and a mate, or mates, more facilitators are 
roused and the learning is further hastened. 
\A happy result. Contrary to common belief, fear and 
punishment are not much used by professional trainers. 
They more than carry out the maxim of the Talmud, 
“Punish with one hand and caress with two.” The great 
secret is that a fine performance is followed by feeding.! 
Causes of unreadiness. — If we have found above the 
factors that make for readiness, then we have also found the 
sources of unreadiness. If an animal (child included) is 
1 Quite lately I was studying some performing seals whose intelligence 
seemed absolutely startling. The intelligence is undoubtedly there, but 1 
found that the secret was that the trainer gave each a piece of fish every time 
he did a trick successfully. 
It is just the same with all performing animals. The maxim is: ‘Do your 
duty and you will get something,’’ and every performing animal knows it, 
from the elephant, who gets peanuts and sugar, down to the tiny guinea pig, 
who gets some dainty bit of green stuff. — Ellen Velvin— Behind the Scenes 
with Wild Animals, p. 167.
-P-A-G-E-69
  
READINESS 59 
indifferent to the education we urge upon him, then the 
cause must lie in an unfit environment, or the unfit condi- 
tion of the learner, or some defect in the personality of the 
trainer, or an unsuitable task, or an inappropriate special 
stimulus, or an unhappy result. 
Let us next consider, very briefly, how all these facili- 
tators and inhibitors operate to make the brains of children 
ready or unready for learning. 
Environment. — Both kinds of environment, the material 
and the social, should favor our aim. The good nurse or 
mother has rattle and rings and other playthings lying about 
before the baby needs them, to suggest their use. School 
apparatus and museum equipment and the town library 
have the same kind of value. 
But stronger still are the social ‘‘atmosphere,”’ “spirit,” 
morale, of home and town, of the ‘‘bunch” or group, and 
of the classroom or the whole school. The herd instinct is 
almost all-powerful. And besides, suggestion counts, whether 
the child is aware of it or not. The knee-kick response of a 
sleeper is strengthened by stimuli of which he is unaware, 
such as taps with a pencil or the calling of his name. And 
if the subject is awake, his knee-kick is increased by hearing 
a poem recited, or by the crying of a child in the next room. 
It is remarkable to see how a boy will beg to take up Cesar 
if his chum is studying it. The root reason why you and I 
are civilized instead of savage is because of the environment 
into which we were born. 
Bodily and mental condition. — The good trainer makes 
it a rule that no animal which is at all sick shall be allowed 
to perform or be trained. Children are of more value than 
many lions, and fatigue and lack of sleep may be as much 
of a handicap in learning as illness is. 66 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  60 THE CHILD’S MIND 
One of the worst forms of fatigue, especially for children, 
is the fatigue of restraint, of ‘“want-to-but-can’t.”’ Some 
sparrows, on a rainy day, were prevented from their usual 
flying, but spent the day scolding and chattering. The 
experimenter found clear signs of fatigue in their brain 
cells, ‘‘as though, while confined by rain, the little birds 
had kept up a deal of thinking.” 
Children must build up inhibitors, must learn to endure 
reasonable restraint; but just when we are launching our 
lesson, the fewer cross currents in their brain cells the better. 
The personal factor. — Teachers do not seem sufficiently 
to realize the fact that teaching is a confidence game. With- 
out faith, no miracles. The boy who does not trust his 
teacher may be as wild and intractable as a horse that dis- 
trusts his driver. The teacher should aim to inspire con- 
fidence to such a degree that he could sell his pupil a gold 
brick; but he should also be so consecrated that he cannot 
abuse that confidence. 
Confidence, sympathy, suggestion, leadership —if these 
words could be printed in type large enough to show their 
importance, each would have a page to itself. 
The pupil tends instinctively to follow the teacher in 
bodily attitude, gaze, attention, feeling. When Professor 
Higley (a royal teacher of mathematics) fixed his keen eye 
on a certain section of the blackboard, our eyes all followed 
1 This principle explains, too, the physical influence of the physician or sur- 
geon, who, by his personality, inspires, like a Kocher, absolute confidence in his 
patient. The brain controls many processes that have wholly escaped from 
the notice of the “practical man.” It is in accordance with the law of associ- 
ation that a flower, a word, a touch, a cool breeze, or even the thought of a 
fishing rod or of a gun, is helpful. On the contrary, all suggestions of despair 
or misfortune — a corrugated brow, the gloomy silence of despair, or a doubt- 
ful word — are equally depressing. — Crile — Origin and Nature of the Emo- 
tions, p. 47.
-P-A-G-E-71
  READINESS 61 
his, because his look was so strong and earnest. Woodrow ! 
tells of a father who, having interested his little daughter 
in a picture book, would suddenly turn to the pages of 
capital letters, point to one, and exclaim with a great show 
of excitement, “‘Oh, Martha! Look! Look! There’s P!” 
Then, without giving her time to ‘‘discover the deceit and 
to determine for herself that after all there is nothing 
wildly exciting about the letter P,” he would return to the 
pictures. This was often repeated, with the result that 
she soon knew all the letters at sight. 
An enthusiastic (but not gushing or frantic) teacher 
makes a ready pupil. ‘ 
A suitable task. — Papers written by my students indicate 
that the two factors which make most for readiness are the 
teacher and the task. But the task gives the golden mo- 
tive, especially for the more mature children. 
As already indicated, a ‘‘suitable” task is one for which 
the learner has native ability, and which is presented at a 
time when the brain cells which form the seat of that ability 
are ripe enough to work. Edward Hodges Bailey, who de- 
signed the statue of Nelson at Trafalgar Square, could not 
learn his lessons at school, but was always drawing funny 
pictures of his classmates. Probably his teacher thought 
him stupid; but as George Eliot says,? “for getting a fine 
flourishing growth of stupidity there is nothing like pouring 
out on a mind a good amount of subjects in which it feels 
no interest.” 
A suitable special stimulus. — As we get older, we learn 
to respond to the call of the future — save money, perhaps, 
to use ten years hence. But children have not lived through

    62 THE CHILD’S MIND 
a very long past, and so do not feel very far ahead. They 
do not care to cast their bread upon the waters and depend 
on finding it after many days; there must be some present 
stimulus, something, here and now, to set them going right. 
As we glance over our ‘“‘summary of sources of readiness,” 
we can see at once what such a special stimulus is bound to 
be. We must appeal to an instinct, or to a special ability, 
or to old habit bonds already built on one of these two. 
As we glance over our list of instincts, action suggests 
anything with movement in it—the dance, writing or 
drawing on the blackboard, talking, singing, building, add- 
ing or subtracting children to or from a group. The ez- 
ploring instinct bids us have plenty of concrete materials 
on which to use the senses and muscles, going sometimes on 
excursions to get them. Curiosity is whetted when we’. 
make a mystery of things by covering them up for a time, 
or by holding back the climax of a story, or by presenting a 
challenging project or problem. Play may include almost 
anything that ingenuity can devise— and whatever the +] 
teacher speaks of as a ‘‘game”’ is likely to be regarded as 
one. Imitation is a challenge to do anything — write, draw, 
read, sing, skip — which the leader can do well and the 
follower is ripe for. Pupils are as fond of a ‘‘demon-, 
stration” as we teachers are. And let us not forget that 
the pupils often imitate a classmate more readily than they 
do the teacher. Rivalry and competition can be introduced, 
in countless ways — pitting a pupil against his own old 
record, or against that of another; or one row, or sex, or room 
against another, etc. Fear may be aroused with impunity 
if it is moderate fear of condemnation by one’s family or 
mates. The social or herd instinct furnishes one of the 
strongest of stimuli for doing anything in creation which 
   
-P-A-G-E-73
  
READINESS & 
4 ' 
that particular herd can be brought to approve. Be it re- 
membered by all, from politicians to teachers, that there is 
an instinct for codperation as well as for competition. 
The appeal to ability of any kind, when the ability is 
there, needs little comment and little of our pedagogical 
doctoring. He who can dance or draw, sing or spell, read 
or reckon, and do it well, is not likely to need much urging. 
Here is the ideal readiness — when the worker is lost in his 
work, the player in his play. 
Old bonds, themselves built on instincts and abilities by 
the child’s experience, can only be appealed to when we 
know what his experiences have been. The promise of a 
familiar and well-loved trip or a game or picnic or party, may 
pull the pupil through hours or days or weeks of work. 
Vision of a happy result. — If an animal were made un- 
happy every time it performed well, it would soon cease to 
perform. In general, unhappiness is nature’s danger signal, 
whereas happiness means “‘ Dare on in the same direction.” 
The child has a brain that looks ahead, sees a vision of how 
things are coming out. Make that vision a moving one, 
and do not disappoint it. (This subject will be treated 
more extensively in Chapter V.) 
Primacy of purpose in education. — The lower animals 
seem to have no idea of time, or of purpose. Even their 
apparently purposeful acts are mostly ‘‘blind,” and the 
same thing is true of many of the acts of children. But the 
child should gradually get his mental eyes open and act 
more and more according to purpose. 
~ Now, purpose is idea of end, an idea so loved and cherished 
that it serves as center of organization for our activities, de- 
termining what shall be done and what left undone. This 
means that in the brain, one center or group of centers —
-P-A-G-E-74
a THE CHILD’S MIND 
perhaps the music centers, or the art centers, or the natural 
science centers — are leading in their activity, and stimu- 
lating other parts of the brain to support them in their 
leadership. The good teacher, as his pupil matures, is not 
satisfied with the sort of readiness that just pulls that pupil 
through the task of the day, but suggests to him ever larger 
and longer purposes, according to his dom‘nant instincts 
and abilities. And so comes readiness for life out of school. 
CLASS EXERCISES 
1. Review this chapter and make an outline of Means of 
Securing Readiness, to be used as a guide to observation when 
visiting schools. 
2. Let each student take a period or more for school visita- 
tion, some going to lower and some to higher grades. The greater 
the variety of schools visited, the better. Try to discover causes 
of readiness and unreadiness. 
3. Place under the name of each instinct and ability a list of 
the activities which it seems to inspire. For example, under 
Social Instinct might appear talking, discussing, social play, 
singing or reading to others, etc. 
Make special note of those activities — such as parties — which 
call into play a number of instincts and abilities, and try to deter- 
mine which instincts and abilities they: are. 
Keep your notes for future use. 
FOR FURTHER STUDY 
1. Students like to study ‘‘in the same old place,” and take 
their examinations in the classroom where they have recited. 
Show why. 
2. A soldier who had lost the power of speech because of ‘shell 
shock,” became so excited when he appeared before the Queen of 
England that he spoke, and thereafter retained his speech. Explain 
in terms of nerve currents, inhibitors, and facilitators.

3. “I permitted myself but two emotions,” said Foch, speaking 
of his work as Marshal during the World War, ‘‘and these were 
‘If I fail,’ and ‘If I succeed’.” Show the value of a feeling of 
responsibility as a facilitator. 
4. Ifa pupil thinks he will not meet a certain set of facts again, 
in review or examination or otherwise, what attitude is he likely 
to take toward them? Why? 
5. A boy made up his mind not to hear the alarm clock 
which his brother had set for an early hour in the morning. He 
succeeded. What probably happened in his nervous system? 
6. Certain secretions of ductless glands are necessary to make 
muscles work well, but are not needed to increase the efficiency 
of brain cells. Race horses and human athletes need a warming- 
up period. Would it be desirable for a lecturer or a teacher to 
“warm up” by lecturing or teaching for a half hour before facing 
the final audience or class? 
7. A friend of mine requires his children to be at the breakfast 
table by 7:30 if they are to be permitted to go to the ball games. 
Just what is the nervous source of their readiness for breakfast? 
8. Some schools specialize in writing in the second grade, 
others in the sixth and seventh. How can we find out when the 
writing ability ripens in most children? What should be done 
about it? 
9. Give a description of unreadiness in children as produced 
by a neglect of every factor of readiness, environment, personal 
condition, ete. ‘ 
10. Picture a correction of all that is assumed in Exercise 9 
to be wrong. What would be the effect on the children? 
11. A dog which refused dry bread, was often fed morsels 
dipped in the gravy remaining in the plate. Yet if he saw bread 
rubbed round a dry plate, he ate it eagerly until his hunger was 
satisfied. Explain in terms of readiness. 
12. Recall the readiness or unreadiness you have felt when 
certain lecturers, ministers, or teachers began their talk or exer- 
cise. What does this show regarding the personal factor?

13. An eleven-months-old baby walked clumsily if supported 
and urged; it found the movement unnatural and wanted con- 
stantly to drop down to the creeping position. Should such a 
baby be taught to walk? Why or why not? 
14. Different parts of the brain develop unequally at various 
times, and no two brains just alike. What does this probably 
mean with regard to abilities and their development? 
15. Donaldson (in Growth of the Brain, p. 357) says that those 
methods of education which take advantage of the natural in- 
equalities of growth in different parts of the brain, “preferring 
irregularity to the roundness gained by pruning, will most closely 
follow that which takes place within the body, and thus prove 
most effective.” 
Do the schools do this if they arrange for just so much growth 
in each branch in each grade? What change is needed? What 
advantage is there in teaching pupils individually or in small 
groups? : 
16. Give several instances of school exercises in which play 
might well be used. 
17. Describe five lessons that you would teach by having your 
pupils imitate you. 
18. A boy who had been saved from the streets always carried 
a photograph of the minister who saved him. ‘Whenever I am 
tempted,” he said, ‘‘I take it out. His look is a wonderful help, 
and by the grace of God I am able to overcome all.’”’ Explain in 
terms of inhibitors. 
19. You want to bring about in yourself a condition of readi- 
ness for your task of teaching. Review the factors of environ- 
ment, personal condition, etc., and show what you should be able 
to get from each that will help you.

been able to stimulate all facilitators and quiet all inhibitors 
in our pupil, and that we now have somewhere in his brain

a good strong charge of nerve energy with many volts of 
pressure, ready to flow off along some channel and form that 
channel. Now for the ‘‘clear connection, clear through.” 
But a nervous impulse may spread itself over more than 
a million paths. Our next problem is, therefore, how to 
guide the current over the one path that we want to make 
perfect. 
‘What responses do I want? To what stimuli?’ — 
The question, What responses do I want, should form the 
first line of every lesson plan. For a guide is no good unless 
he has a clear idea as to where the road leads. If I were 
asked to state the outstanding difference between the pro- 
fessional and the unprofessional teacher, it would be that 
the professional teacher thinks out clearly just what he is 
trying to do and has a plan for doing it. The unprofessional 
teacher, though a college graduate, perhaps, merely mean- 
ders and muddles along. 
Exercise the very bond you want. — Even one who knows 
what he is trying to do may fall down flat in his plan for 
doing it. One of the most common causes for this apparent 
failure lies in exercising the wrong connection. A very 
earnest teacher drilled in grammar with great thoroughness 
during the first half of the year; but in the second half, she 
was amazed to find that her pupils were not obeying the 
grammatical principles they had learned. They did not 
even put a period after a sentence, but waited till the end of 
the whole composition was reached and then placed the 
period. When she reminded them that periods should ap- 
pear more frequently, they began to stick them in thick, 
one after each phrase and clause, and some at random. 
Teaching a science is not teaching an art, teaching prin- 
ciples is not teaching practice, teaching “formal grammar” Z

is not teaching ‘‘good language,” and especially is all this 
true in the teaching of children. 
For, consider a case: you want your pupil to say “‘is not” 
(or some other correct form) instead of ‘‘ain’t.” Here 
comes the impulse to speak, adown the brain fiber S—-C 
(Fig. 7). Which path of discharge it will take at C, the

“is not”? connection or the ‘‘ain’t”’ path, will depend very 
largely on which has been exercised more — and the ‘‘street”’ 
is likely to take care of that. But up in the top of the pupil’s 
brain is found the result of the teacher’s work, forming a 
rather slender bond for the rule, ‘“‘Use no vulgar contrac- 
tions.” The pupil may never think of this rule as being 
connected with his use of ain’t — nor is it, unless the teacher 
forms a connection in his brain by making him think of the

EXERCISE a 
two together. And even all this consolidated knowledge 
may compete but weakly with an “‘ain’t” path that has 
dug itself in by repetitions almost beyond reckoning. 
Now, life is full of such situations. We expect people to 
practice goodness just from hearing it preached. ‘‘I told you 
better,” says the parent to the erring child. ‘‘Yes,” the 
child ought to answer, ‘‘but you didn’t exercise my prac- 
tice bonds. You should put me through what you want 
me to do.” In school, we teach definitions in arithmetic 
when we ought to be working with numbers, and expect 
good citizenship to be learned from reading a history text 
which says next to nothing about how to be a good citizen. 
Practice as you will perform. — One of the surest ways to 
exercise the very bonds you want is to have the pupil prac- 
tice as he will finally perform. It would be ideal if, instead 
of having a single dress rehearsal as the finishing touch in 
learning a play, we could put on our costumes and practice 
in them from the very beginning as we learned our lines. In 
time, we should each be a character instead of “acting” it. 
The school is coming to realize this principle. The pupil 
washes his teeth at school as he is expected to do it at 
home; brings in ‘‘real”’ problems from his home, his bank, 
his community, and practices on them; writes his spelling 
lesson because, in general, no one need know how to spell 
a word unless he wants to write it; reads silently because 
life demands so much silent reading; addresses his ‘‘fellow 
citizens” and learns the game: of give and take with them 
- because democratic citizenship demands it. 
We learn to do by doing; that is, we learn to do a thing 
well by doing it well. I find that about two per cent of my 
students have been taught the alphabet backward as well 
as forward, though no one of them has found a use for the  
-P-A-G-E-82
  72 THE CHILD’S MIND 
backward act. Pupils are learning rules and giving ‘‘ex- 
planations” in arithmetic with little return for their pains, 
when they ought to be practicing processes as daily life 
demands them. And many are they who are translating 
Latin and forming myriads of bonds for its grammar, 
thinking they are on the high road to an education — for- 
tunately, a few are — whereas the main net result will be 
an increase in the stock of useless things memorized. 
Two kinds of guidance. — If we are clear as to what re- 
sponses we want, and intend to exercise the very bonds we 
want, the next question is that of guidance: How can we 
guide the nervous charge along the chosen channel? In 
general, there are two ways of seeing to it that we get just 
the right response: we may call one way external guidance 
and the other internal guidance. 
External guidance: by movements. —If you want to 
form a bond for wiggling your ears, take hold of them and 
wiggle them. This will give you a feeling (or sensation) of 
a certain kind; and by and by, when you try from inside 
your head to reproduce that feeling, your ears will wiggle 
without external help. The elephant, you recall, is taught 
by this method to stand on his hind feet; and various other 
animals, such as the rat and the raccoon, have been educated 
by the same kind of pedagogy. 
One of the prettiest examples of external guidance by 
movement is found in the French method of training avi- 
ators. The airplane has two sets of control levers, so that 
the learner, who goes up with his teacher, senses through 
his set of levers every control-movement the teacher makes. 
Gradually, the learner catches the habit and begins piloting. 
The teacher permits every movement that is correct, but 
prevents those that are incorrect, till at length their posi-
-P-A-G-E-83
EXERCISE 73 
tions are reversed: the learner has full control of the ma- 
chine and the teacher passively senses the movements made 
by the student.! 
Would that we could apply this tandem method of learn- 
ing to every kind of lesson. Probably we can apply it, in 
its essentials, much more widely than we yet think. 
Internal guidance: by ideas. — ‘‘To be well shaken be- 
fore taking,” was the direction on the medicine bottle in the 
a 
  Fie. 8. What gear means.” 
old story. And the caretakers shook the patient! It is 
not always easy to call up, by words alone, ideas that will 
guide to the right response. 
Suppose you read a statement like this: ‘‘The gear of 
your bicycle is the diameter of a single high wheel which

    74 THE CHILD’S MIND 
will roll as far, at each revolution, as your bicycle does at 
each revolution of the pedals.” The desired response is 
not a movement on your part, but simply that you shall 
“get the idea,” “catch on.’ To make sure that you do, 
we may assume that the gear of your bicycle is 76 inches, and 
ask you to draw on the floor the circumference of the equiva- 
lent high wheel. If you do not quite ‘‘see the point,” you 
will appreciate the more what a wonderful help a simple

picture is, and why teachers should be able to draw such 
pictures to guide the responses of their pupils. 
Figure 8 shows an old-fashioned bicycle, with a large 
wheel, 48 inches in diameter, and one of the first safety 
bicycles. Every time each rider’s feet go round, the two 
bicycles will travel along the ground the same distance. 
Accordingly, the safety is said to be geared to 48 inches, 
the diameter of the high wheel. 
If your bicycle is geared to 76 inches, the meaning of that 
is shown in Figure 9. Such a high wheel would have been so 
very high that the rider could not have touched the pedals.
-P-A-G-E-85
  
EXERCISE 75 
Guidance by imitation. —If an Amazon parrot, which 
does not commonly learn to talk, is kept with a talking 
parrot, the Amazon learns to talk; and experiment shows 
that he learns faster in this way than he can from a human 
teacher. Kittens, in imitation of their mother, have been 
known to stick a paw into a narrow-mouthed milk jug and 
then lick it, and to sit up and beg for food after their mother 
had been taught the trick. A red-winged blackbird has 
learned to crow like a bantam rooster, and even English 
sparrows, reared with canary birds, learn to sing somewhat 
like them! 
The teacher who does not take advantage of the imitative 
tendency in children is simply throwing away her ammuni- 
tion. This kind of guidance lies halfway, as one may say, 
between the external and the internal. We do not take hold 
of the child’s muscles and move them; but we move as we 
want him to move, write as we want him to write, speak as 
we want him to speak, sing as we want him to sing, solve a 
problem as we want him to solve it. We give him a com- 
pelling external copy and a vivid picture-idea at the same 
time. 
In this way we approach closely that method which is in 
many respects ideal, the tandem method. When a farmer . 
wants to ‘‘break in’”’ a colt, he hitches him up as mate with 
a well-trained horse. ‘‘Take my yoke upon you and learn of 
me,” should be the exhortation of every teacher to his pupil. 
Make yourself the yokefellow of the child you teach, and do 
everything as you want him to do it — live as you want him 
to live. : 
No guidance: trial and error. — There are tasks in which 
it seems impossible to guide the learner into making just the 
right response at first. Such are the precise holding and mov-

ing of a violin bow, or a tennis racquet, or even a pencil; the 
pronunciation of a difficult sound, or the singing of a note 
or a series of them. A newly-hatched chick gets about 20 
per cent of the grains it pecks at the first day, over 50 per 
cent the second day, about 85 per cent after another day or 
two of practice, and there it seems to reach its limit. This 
is nature’s illustration of the rule the teacher must follow in 
such cases: Call forth any crude response you can get at first, 
and then peck away toward perfection. As said before, the 
brain does not develop by elegant and regular steps, but it 
forms first great ropes and cables of connections that run 
through its structure like a kind of framework, and it puts 
in the refinements later. From such an organ we cannot 
expect, at first, great nicety of response, either mechanical 
or moral. We must tolerate the crude and coarse, but only 
temporarily; for practice does not make perfect if we go 
on practicing in imperfections. We must inhibit the wrong 
responses as much as we dare without bringing on dire 
discouragement, and exhort our pupil to strive for the goal. 
But there is no such thing as pure trial and error, no 
learning where we cannot give some guidance if we set our 
ingenuity at work. Teachers are in general too much afraid 
of ‘‘showing”’ their pupils and of letting them teach each 
other. They have the absurd idea that if the pupil only 
works out alone some terrible exercise, or dives deep enough 
to fish up the answer to the arithmetical problem that is 
beyond all ordinary comprehension, he will then experience 
a great influx of strength that will enable him to upset all 
opposition in that line thereafter; but they are wrong. “It 
will be better for you if you do it alone,” is often not true. 
“Tt will be better for both of us if we do it together,” is 
often gospel.
-P-A-G-E-87
  
EXERCISE 77 
Old nerve channels guide new impulses. — As before 
said, a new stimulus rouses in the nervous system an impulse 
which has no channel ready made for it, and so attracts 
attention. Nevertheless, the new impulse will flow into the 
readiest old channels, and so the new object will be given 
some old name, as the automobile was long called a ‘‘horse- 
less carriage,’ and as a little girl called the fire shovel, 
which was strange to her, a “big black spoon.”! The same 
principle holds in the performance of new acts: they will be 
guided by the old habits that are somewhat like them. He 
who first puts on skates wants to walk in them, the baseball 
player who begins tennis uses ‘‘too much wallop,” and so on. 
We must take advantage of this for guidance, using the 
old paths as main lines and building our new learning onto 
them as branches. A figure 6 is like a figure 1 with a curl 
at the bottom, 9 is like a 1 with a curl at the top, d (written) 
is only an a with a flag pole on it, and so forth. ‘‘Read it 
just as you would tell it to your mother,” will help the little 
reader to give expression. If addition is just a quick way 
of counting forward, subtraction is just a quick way of 
counting backward. Ever the new grows out of the old. 
To sum up: the fundamental question for all guidance, as 
soon as we know what we want to teach, is What related 
responses can the pupil already make? 
To give guidance is to establish discrimination points. — 
Although we build onto old brain roads, we must form new 
ones before we finish. It is a large part of the teacher’s work 
to set guide posts, to establish discrimination marks so that 
the pupil can tell one road: from another and know where 
to turn off. The boy, in arithmetic, who, after reading his 
1In psychology, this interpretation of the new in terms of the old is known 
as apperception.  
-P-A-G-E-88
    
78 THE CHILD’S MIND 
problem, does not know whether to add, subtract, multiply, 
or divide, is in need of just such training. Here is the very 
reason why the foundations of a subject must be mastered 
with great thoroughness before the pupil is allowed to thread 
his tortuous and confusing way into the upper stories at all. 
He must first have at least some guide marks that he is sure 
of. He must know better than to say that ‘‘a verb is some- 
thing to eat,” or that ‘‘Congress is divided into civilized, 
half-civilized, and savage.’’! 
Precepts for giving guidance. — No brief treatment can 
be exhaustive; but the following precepts for giving guid- 
ance, it is hoped, will prove suggestive. 
Introduce but one difficulty at atime. “T can lick allo’ yez,” 
shouted Pat to a nest of hornets, ‘‘if only ye’ll fight fair and 
come at me one at a time!’”’ The same is true of the pupil 
and his difficulties. Just how much it takes to make a 
“difficulty”? depends on each pupil. But since there is a 
bond for everything and everything has its bond, the great 
danger is that the teacher will not analyze the lesson suffi- 
ciently to give concentrated attention to each bit of a bond — 
and have the pupil do so, too. In swimming, the learner 
must (1) keep up, and (2) make strokes. The swimming 
master relieves his learner of the first of these troubles by 
supporting him in some way, and at the same time coaches 
him in stroking. 
The great worry of the teacher is a pupil who loses readi- 
ness unless he can do the whole thing at once — play a 
game of tennis at the start, or a tune on his violin. The 
practical teacher distinguishes: himself by the degree to 
which he can invent exercises that drill in one simple step 
at a time and yet satisfy the pupil’s desire to “play the game.”

EXERCISE 79 
For example, the skillful teacher of tennis, instead of letting 
the learner run a risk of fixing a lot of bad habits by going 
into the game at the beginning, may get him to practice the 
grip on the racquet and the making of a simple stroke by 
batting the ball up against a high wall and seeing how long 
he can keep it going. 
Give guidance that is positive, definite, detailed. ‘‘Take 
quite a lot of flour,” said the old cook to the young house- 
wife, ‘‘more than you’d think of butter, some eggs, and

bad. Let us see how a Boy Scout is taught to pedal his 
bicycle (Figure 10). The ball of the foot, not the hollow of 
it, is placed on the pedal, and the ankle bends so that the 
downward push on the pedal begins before it has reached 
its high point and continues after it has reached its low 
point. A poor teacher would merely remark to a beginner, 
“Don’t keep your ankle so stiff.”” Such guidance would be 
negative, indefinite, and without detail.

80 THE CHILD’S MIND 
To tell a child that her “stitching is careless,” that she has ‘“‘poorly con- 
structed joinings,” that the “finish is clumsy,” that she shows “lack of neat- 
ness” or “carelessness in putting things together,” that her first, second, 
third, fourth, and fifth faults, in the order of their importance, are the “‘posi- 
tion of needle and thread,” that “lack of individuality” and “harmony”’ char- 
acterize her work, and that she “has the inability to learn certain stitches” 
would not, to any great extent, identify for her the bond which she was to 
form. One judge, a specialist in the teaching of sewing, mentions the 
“quality” of the stitch. If such an unanalyzed statement were made to a 
child, would it not be difficult for her to form the proper bond to bring about 
improvement in this matter, and would it not aid her in so doing if she were 
told that instead of having poor “quality” her stitches were pulled too tight, 
or were too loose, or were uneven, or whatever the fault might be? 4 
Foresee and forestall common errors. The teacher is always 
“working on the levee,” always forming channels in the 
pupil’s nervous system, always building up banks in the form 
of inhibitors to keep the nerve currents from rushing out of 
their courses. He must be like the good Dutch dike-master 
and get there before the bank is broken./ The modern method 
of dealing with crime is to prevent it. Waa ote, method 
of dealing with errors is to prevent them — so far as we can. 
For example, we all know that pupils tend to misspell 
separate and grammar and scissors; that in the first grade, 
the figures get turned round so that they face the wrong 
way — 3 looking like a capital E, and so on; and that 
certain barbarisms always crop up in language. The pre- 
ventive is to present our work, from the start, with em- 
phasis on the correct form just where the danger points are. 
But do not present the wrong forms unless you know your 
pupils have already been victimized by them; many of these 
wrong forms are like forbidden fruit, wonderfully seductive 
when once our attention is called to them.

EXERCISE 81 
This foreseeing and forestalling of errors has become a 
science in itself. In at least one system of writing there are 
published photo-engravings of common faults peculiar to 
each letter, to show the teacher just where to lay the stress 
on the correct form when first she places it before her class. 
Encourage prevision by the pupil. This is the principle 
of keeping two jumps ahead of the game. Just as you must, 
at first, look ahead for your pupil, so he must learn to look 
ahead for himself. It was a great advantage to the upper 
animals when they acquired eyes, and could see instead 
of having to blunder ahead blindly. One important reason 
for so much muddling and blundering by our pupils is that 
they either do not see what is coming next, or they are 
not ready for it when it piles up before them. In reading, 
as the pupil speaks one phrase he must, with his eye, be 
scooping up the next one. As he speaks or writes one 
word or sentence, his thoughts must be prospecting ahead, 
preparing the next. The very spirit of speed in typewrit- 
ing lies in letting the mind run over, in a quick, anticipatory 
way, what is to be written next. Life itself, if we live well, 
is largely a matter of looking ahead. But a word of warn- 
ing here: do not expect prevision nor speed from a beginner. 
“Introduce but one difficulty at a time.” Now, speed 
itself is a difficulty. In the beginning, go slow, work for 
accuracy, and let speed, for the most part, take care of 
itself. Prevision comes only with practice: the old road 
reminds us which turn is coming next. 
Get the right response, then exercise in it. One who has 
poor guidance in the beginning and so is confused in his 
responses, who (for example) does not discriminate between

chance of using the wrong word. This is one of the inci- 
dental curses of our public school policy of attempting too 
much; the pupil’s nervous system becomes like a bed of 
sand, marked superficially by many shallow channels that 
lead nowhere. 
First, guidance, to print the pattern on the child’s mind. 
Second, drill, to deepen the channels. 
The laws of intensity, frequency, and recency. — The 
rapidity with which a bond is formed depends on the amount 
of nerve energy that passes over it; and this depends on the 
Fig. 11. A suggestion as to how to arrange for drill periods. (From p. 75 
of E. L. Thorndike’s The New Methods in Arithmetic.) 
intensity and frequency of the nervous current. Our in- 
tense experiences — fires, whippings, near-drownings, com- 
mencements, and so on— start gulley-washing freshets of 
feeling along our nerve channels. And the nerve gulleys 
last: we can “‘never forget.” Readiness results in reten- 
tion. But if we kept our pupil in a high tension of feeling 
all day, he would go to bed at night prostrated. We must 
depend on milder means. 
This milder means is frequency, repetition with a reason- 
able degree of interest; for repetition without interest is 
as nearly useless as having a machine to move your limbs 
when you want exercise. Many experiments have been 
performed to find out how long and how often one should 
practice any type of work. The general conclusion is 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
EXERCISE 83 
Avoid fatigue. Have frequent, brief practice periods which, 
as mastery approaches, grow shorter and farther between. 
Figure 11, in which each vertical line represents a drill 
period, gives a suggestion of how we should contrive to 
have our drill-matter appear and reappear, for decreasing 
periods at increasing intervals, until it is well stamped in. 
But knowledge decays. The channels close with time. 
We get “‘out of practice.” It needs a fresh rehearsal to 
make our learning fresh — the law of recency. We review 
our pupils in decimals in order that they may have the 
right bonds ready to work in percentage and we review in 
arithmetic before they take up algebra. 
Change or confusion of stimuli.—If we could be sure, 
after we have drilled in a set of bonds, that they would 
always be touched off by the same stimuli we have used in 
our drill, it would ease our burden greatly. But we can- 
not always have our pupils practice as they will perform. 
They will be expected to give the same response to stimuli 
that are very different, or different responses to situations 
that are much the same. 
Toadstools and mushrooms, wood alcohol and the ordi- 
nary kind, oysters in season and out of season, wires alive 
and wires dead, different makes of automobile, or of type- 
writer, or even of pens, ink, and paper, furnish samples of 
stimuli which, though seeming the same, may demand very 
different responses. 
A more common cause of breakdown in response is that 
the situation to which our pupil has been responding has 
so many elements added to it or subtracted from it that he 
either does not recognize it or is overpowered by it. The 
large audience may make the little orator forget the piece 
he has practiced only before his teacher. Demosthenes 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  84 THE CHILD’S MIND 
took the roaring ocean as an audience, and Webster prac- 
ticed before the beasts in the barn. 
But to pull us through any and every plight of this kind, 
the king rule is to have the pupil practice under the condi- 
tions of final performance. It is for this reason that normal 
schools have a practice school, that the young physician 
spends his year as an interne in some hospital, and that 
the business student, as he approaches graduation, spends 
at least a few weeks in an office. 
How thoroughly shall we teach? — No simple and single 
answer can be given to the question, How thoroughly shall 
we teach? unless it is According to your purpose. That 
subjects are sometimes overtaught there is no doubt. 
Penmanship, for example, has received in many schools 
an amount of time and attention out of all proportion to 
its worth. 
But what the teacher wants to know is, how thoroughly 
he must drill in any particular bond to make it last. And 
here it is safe to say that the vulgar fault of the great herd 
of us is under teaching. It is not enough that our pupil 
shall just get through his performance once without an 
error. If the feat is an essential-part of his course of 
progress, he should have it on tap, as a good showman does 
his trick, ready to “‘throw”’ it on signal. 
And finally, it is wise, at critical points, to train the pupil 
up to the performance of harder tasks than he will ever 
meet outside; for it needs, as some one has so well ex- 
pressed it, ‘‘six-foot training for a five-foot jump.”

1. Animal trainers find that each trick must be done in just 
the same way day after day, — no deviation. Tell why you think 
this is true. Which do you think could make the more progress 
if there were many variations in stimuli from day to day, children 
of low or of high intelligence? Why?

say ‘lie down’ to that dog if you want him to obey; he was trained 
in Boston.’”’ Could there be any truth in such a statement? 
3. What kind of guidance is given by a moving picture which 
shows in detail the performance of the act to be learned? What 
advantage in having the performance greatly slowed down on the 
screen? 
4. Place your hand on a book as if in position for striking keys, 
all finger tips touching. Tap with your first and third fingers at 
once, then with middle and little fingers at once, keeping the other 
fingers at rest on the book while two are tapping. Can you do it 
slowly? Rapidly? What does this show? 
5. Would you rather memorize a selection first and be trained 
in its delivery afterward, or have training in expression while you 
learn it? Why?

completion exercises, such as —

you could improve your list by keeping a record, as you coached 
learners or performed some experiment with them or examined

you could discover the bonds that needed most exercise, and 
isolate them for special practice. (Hint. — Consider the use of

Errect 
A dog was caught removing an egg from the nest. His mistress seldom had 
occasion to scold, but made this an occasion. She took the egg from him, and. 
making much ado over it, scolded him vigorously until the dog fairly cried. 
Then she tested him by laying the egg at his nose. When he attempted to pick 
it up, she scolded and threatened him. The lesson was learned. Thereafter, 
whenever the dog saw an egg, he would slink away as though he had been 
whipped.! — Hannan K. HEeiieEr. 
Exercises. — 1. Shaler says that a dog which has had “an 
unsavory or painful experience with a skunk or a porcupine” is 
likely to keep away from these animals for a long time afterward. 
‘Men have frequently been cured of a fondness for alcoholic 
drinks, as dogs have of sucking eggs, by the secret addition of 
some drug that produced vomiting. A snake charmer, on being 
severely bitten, refused to do any more charming. Plutarch says 
that an impudent young fellow who had kicked Socrates was 
nicknamed “the kicker” by his companions, and so reviled by 
all that he went and hung himself. 
Try to explain these cases. What do you think goes on in the 
brain of the subject of such an experience? 
2. Give such cases as you can, from your own observation or 
experience, in or out of school, to show what influence the agree- 
able or disagreeable effect of an act has on the further practice or 
learning of it. Notice that all the examples above show disagree- 
able effects. Try to include in your list some of the agreeable 
kind. 
Readiness, Exercise, and Effect are the three prime laws 
of learning. In the two preceding chapters we have dis- 
cussed Readiness and Exercise. We will now take up Effect.

90 THE CHILD’S MIND 
What is Effect? — By effect is meant the pleasure or dis- 
comfort, the satisfaction or annoyance, that accompanies 
or follows any act. Pleasure favors the bonds that yield it, 
and the opposite of pleasure has the opposite effect. ‘‘You 
must never let a horse run away even once,” said the 
driver of a fine but frisky pair of bays, “for once he gets 
the thrill of it, he will do it again at every chance.” On 
the other hand, an elephant is often afraid of a mouse, 
and the reason is said to be that the mouse runs up the 
inside of his trunk to get the grain that clings there. 
What is ‘‘effect’’ in the brain? — We know beyond doubt 
that pleasure aids digestion and dolor delays it; the X-ray 
shows that the stomach of a worried cat refuses to work. 
But there are greater wonders; a mother, on seeing her 
baby’s fingers cut off by accident, found the corresponding 
fingers of her own hand red, swollen, and painful. ‘They 
looked and felt as if they too had been crushed.” ! Now, 
if pleasure and dolor can do so much with such physiologi- 
cal processes, it seems likely that they may be very influen- 
tial in the forming of bonds in the brain. 
But how can pleasure help? By sending more blood to 
the brain cells that are active. By increasing the charge 
of nervous energy that is ‘‘exploded.’’ By drawing off 
this flow of energy from all wrong channels and guiding it 
into the one right one.? 
Let us take as an illustration of nerve energy guided by 
pleasure, a case from Shinn’s Biography of a Baby.’ 
1 Frances Gulick Jewett — Control of Body and Mind, Ch. XVIII. Ginn 
and Company. 
2 And possibly in other ways. Personally, I think it very likely that there is 
a certain chemical action in the brain when we feel pleasure, a sort of affective 
deposit which is not active at other times.

EFFECT 91 
Now suppose the aimless impulse straying to the baby’s eye muscles, mak- 
ing the eyes roam hither and yon; but as they reach a certain position, they 
fall upon a lighted surface, and a pleasant brightness flows back into the 
consciousness; and something stirs within that has power to send an intenser 
current through these same fibers. For the time, at least, that channel is 
deepened, the wandering impulses are drained into it, and the eye muscles 
are held steady in that position. And, in fact, with the beginning of staring 
the irregular movements of head and eyes did decline, and gradually dis- 
appear. 
A further note reads: 
But the next day (27th day after birth), at the sound of chords, strongly 
struck, she hushed when fretting with hunger, and listened quietly for five 
minutes — her first pleasant experience through the sense of hearing. 
On the other hand it appears that unwholesome feelings 
may do actual physical harm to the brain cells. The brains 
of rabbits which had been frightened by a dog, but neither 
injured nor chased, were found, when the animals were 
killed soon after, to have suffered definite damage from 
the experience. 
The schoolmaster must use Nature’s method.— Plato 
says somewhere that taking pleasure means passing from 
a worse state to a better. Certainly, that has been true 
for the human race as a whole. Do you think the race, or 
any man of us, would continue for long if it, or he, followed 
the policy of persistently doing what was most painful? 
No; through countless generations pleasure has been Na- 
ture’s way of saying, ‘‘Do this and prosper,” while the 
warning of pain has been, ‘‘Stop that or perish.” 
We pay little attention to that which is neither agreeable 
nor disagreeable, but neutral. A spider will at first drop 
off his web when a tuning fork is sounded near him; but 
after a time, the spider sits serenely through this monotone 
music — why should he care for what makes no difference?
-P-A-G-E-102
  92 THE CHILD’S MIND 
In the same way, pupils may almost drop off their seats the 
first time the teacher scolds; but if she does it repeatedly 
and nothing further happens, they learn to listen to her 
“chin music” indifferently. 
The public school must apply the same rule of pleasure 
and discomfort that holds in the school of nature, but 
apply it more evenly and less extremely. Nature seems 
at times to suspend the rules and give us license to eat, 
drink, and be merry as we will — but then suddenly shows 
us that we have been acting on pain of death. The im- 
proved environment of the school—and that means 
mainly yourself, teacher — should see that no false brain 
channel is open long, before discomfort dams it; and that 
the opening of each new and approved way of discharge 
brings its return flush of pleasure by way of celebration, 
even if it is only the teacher’s cheerful ‘‘That’s right; keep 
it up.” 
Applying the law of Effect.— The simple rule is, Make 
pleasant what is to be sought, and unpleasant what is to be 
shunned. 
Figure 13 shows that white rats learned faster when both 
facilitator and inhibitor were used — reward and punish- 
ment — than when either operated alone. The reward was 
food, the punishment a mild electric shock. Almost cer- 
tainly this is true of children also. But we must remember 
that a sensitive child is very different from an insensitive 
animal; for the child, the feeling of failure, the looks of 
classmates, a word of reproof from the teacher, — these 
are often enough to cause serious discomfort or even suffer- 
ing. 
If we try to dam all the ways but one by which water 
can escape, we shall be kept busy with our damming and

still have no very strong outflow in that one direction; but 
if we open one deep channel and draw the discharge into 
it, the rest will largely take care of itself. Nerve energy

We must also be careful to see that some connection is 
formed between the response and the effect administered. 
A boy comes late to school. He whispers to find out where 
the lesson is. Later, he fails to recite. He is punished —

Company, copyright 1920. Used by permission of the publishers.
-P-A-G-E-105
EFFECT 95 
for which of these acts? He reports at home that he does 
not know what he was punished for. With a sincere pupil 
and a good teacher, this would never happen. 
The sources of Effect are like those of Readiness.— It is 
apparent that Readiness and Effect are in many respects 
similar. They are similar as to source. When we clap 
our hands for a pupil who has done well, we are appealing 
to an instinct to produce a pleasant effect. When he reads 
so well that we grant him more books to read, we are ap- 
pealing to an ability. When the lesson is so well prepared 
that we have time to play the familiar geography game or 
sing the favorite songs, we are producing a pleasant effect 
by an appeal to old habit bonds. Instinct, ability, habit: 
the tale is told. 
Here is another reason why we must live with our pupils 
until we know them: in no other way can we understand 
intimately just how and how much to thwart or gratify 
their habits, abilities, and instincts in order to cause them 
discomfort or pleasure to the right degree. 
How secure the desired Effect? — To answer this ques- 
tion, we need to pass in review a list of factors very similar 
to those considered in connection with Readiness. These 
are environment, bodily and mental condition of the learner, 
personality of the teacher, a suitable task, a suitable special 
stimulus, and a suitable result. 
We shall take them up in order as listed. 
Environment. A wild animal, if caged or penned, may 
not only refuse to learn, but may actually pine and die. 
Many children suffer similarly. ‘‘The kicker’? who kicked 
Socrates found himself too unhappy to live in his social 
environment. On the other hand, a man heard some in- 
different stories told while music of which he was fond was
-P-A-G-E-106
  
96 THE CHILD’S MIND 
being played and the stories seemed very good. A stimu- 
lating social environment in the form of a sympathetic 
audience may so affect a singer or speaker as to make him 
perform as if inspired. 
In brief, we must consider both the physical and the 
social environment; and we must not only keep them 
negatively free from any interfering influence, but we must 
make them positively helpful. 
Honor and dishonor, standing well or standing ill in the 
eyes of others, usually produce a stronger effect than any 
other forces at the teacher’s command. To be condemned 
or looked down upon by one’s mates hurts much more than 
a whipping — another example of the tremendous power of 
the herd instinct. 
Condition of the learner. A celebrated music master 
makes every student smile just before going out to sing to 
an audience. This is one of the best practical tests of 
condition, Can the learner smile at his lesson? 
Most human learning shows “plateaus,” halting places, 
where there is no improvement for days, or weeks, or months. 
Animal learning is usually free from such stagnant periods. 
One explanation! for this seems to be that the human learner 
is more likely to get out of condition than is a well-kept 
animal. The human gets fatigued, or “goes stale.” 
Going stale may result from practicing too long, or too 
frequently, or too fast, or under too much pressure; or 
fatigue of restraint may result from having to do “‘this old 
thing” all the time when the pupil wants to do that new 
1 But this is probably not the only explanation; the human brain has high- 
level centers of organization and control which the animal brain lacks, and I 
take it that these higher centers may come into their own rather suddenly at 
times, causing a rapid improvement which otherwise would never have taken 
place.

EFFECT oF 
thing at least a part of the time. Recreation pays. Experi- 
ment shows that one who leaves his task for a time may 
come back to it in such fine fettle that he soon beats every 
old record he has ever made. 
The personal factor. Here we can hardly tell whether 
we are dealing with Readiness or Effect. One of my stu- 
dents so hated her seventh grade teacher that she could 
scarcely be forced to go to school, and the next year so 
loved her eighth grade teacher that nothing could induce 
her to miss a day. The terrible teacher may make every 
task a terror, and the lovable one can raise dead facts to 
life. 
A suitable task. In addition to selecting work for which 
the pupil has some natural taste and ability, we must 
provide variety, that is, avoid monotony; and grade care- 
fully as to difficulty. 
“Mouse, mouse, thirty days mouse. To-day, no!” said 
a little foreign-born pupil by way of revolt against the too 
long continuance of the story of ‘‘The Lion and the Mouse.” 
Even the finest project may go stale. This pupil felt 
much as did the soldier boy who told me he had had beans 
for breakfast eighty-nine days in succession. 
Cats and animal trainers can show teachers how to 
avoid discouragement from over difficulty, that is, how to 
hearten the pupil with the flush of success by introducing 
but one difficulty at a time. A good mouser at first brings 
dead mice for her kittens, which growl and stick their teeth 
into their prey. Next, disabled mice are presented, and 
of course the kittens triumph. Finally, the mother brings 
off a bout with an uninjured mouse; but if he escapes, she 
brings him back. So grows the kitten’s confidence and 
sense of mastery. Trainers of terriers first try them on
-P-A-G-E-108
  98 THE CHILD’S MIND 
rats with drawn teeth. When the little dogs have killed 
some of these, they come at length to the point where they 
fear no rat, even with full dental equipment. 
A suitable special stimulus. Yerkes found in animal- 
learning a fact which also applies to child-learning: the 
easier the habit we are teaching, the stronger the stimulus 
that causes its quick acquisition; the more difficult the 
learning, the weaker must be the stimulus that causes 
quick acquisition — and of course quick acquisition means, 
with children, a happy effect. For a simple bit of learning, 
such as standing and sitting properly, we can ‘“‘put on the 
pressure’’; but in a complex subject, — such as the handling 
of numbers, — stern scoldings and other strong stimuli 
would only cause confusion and discouragement. 
Also, we must try to find stimuli that will result in satis- 
faction all through, and not merely stimulate at the begin- 
ning of the work. Business houses find that petty devices 
to stimulate their workmen soon lose interest. They get 
better and more lasting results from such plans as profit- 
sharing, insuring their workmen, permitting them a part 
ownership.in the business, and so forth. Herein lies a 
lesson for the school: it must take the children into part- 
nership, let them help run the job, and give them a share 
of the educational “ profits.” 
A suitable result. ‘I would rather study that conju- 
gation now than to write it out half a dozen times after 
school,” said a boy as he. turned to his Latin lesson. The 
good shepherd leads; but he has also a dog and a crook, 
and something must happen to the sheep that stray. 
Sometimes, indeed, we may purposely let a pupil take a 
wrong method, especially if he is headstrong or has a great 
deal of initiative, just to let him know how it feels to be
-P-A-G-E-109
EFFECT 99 
thwarted, to guard him against similar errors in the future, 
and to induce in him a greater readiness for the right way. 
Nevertheless, emphasis should be laid on positive effects 
rather than negative, and the one great positive result is 
success. As honor is the great gratifier of the social instinct, 
so is success the satisfier of the instinct of self-assertion. 
We can afford to tolerate a low standard for a time, 
especially when starting a subject, if we can purchase at 
that price the masterful self-assurance that the careful 
mother cat builds up in her kittens. 
One of the best uses to which we can put our educational 
measuring scales is that of making success evident, of 
showing the pupil, from time to time, that he is outdoing 
his old self, and that his is ‘‘the glory of going on.”

the close of the seven-minute period, with that aroused by wrest- 
ling with Figure 15. Should you care to have more problems like 
Figure 15? Like Figure 16? 
What is likely to be the effect on a pupil if he believes, from the 
beginning, that the solution of a problem is (for him) useless or 
impossible? 
Il 
Follow the directions given for the Class Exercise at the close 
of Chapter III, but take as your topic for investigation, Means 
of Securing Effect. Keep in mind, as you visit, both agreeable 
and disagreeable effects on the pupils. 
FOR FURTHER STUDY 
1. Mosso, watching a woman’s brain through a hole in her 
skull, found that the brain enlarged and showed a stronger pulse 
beat when she was frightened by seeing a skull among his books. 
What does this have to do with ‘effect’? 
2. A dog approached some bubbles on a carpet, but was 
frightened almost out of his wits when one burst. The second 
time this happened, he rushed out of the room and refused to 
enter again. Explain. 
3. A boy was much pleased when he found that a knowledge 
of algebra would enable him to solve problems that he could not 
do by arithmetic, and went eagerly to work at his algebra lesson. 
What has this sense of power to do with the self-assertive instinct? 
Try to give other instances.

4. There is much theoretical objection made to keeping pupils 
in after school to master neglected lessons. Try to get at the 
matter practically. Were you ever kept in for such a purpose? 
If so, what effect did it have on you? If you know of the expe- 
rience of others, give it. 
5. A prize was offered for the best essay on “How to Manage 
a Husband.” A woman is said to have won the prize by an essay 
of three words, ‘‘Feed the brute.’’ Can this be taken seriously? 
Compare with the method of training animals by an invariable 
reward of feeding. 
6. Why is it so hard to bring under control a school that has 
even once found it can defy the teacher? 
7. A student who had failed in his year’s work compelled him- 
self to remain and hear the applause received by the successful. 
Another, who had completed an unsuccessful semester, placed in 
his room the motto, ‘Fool, remember last semester, and work.’ 
Were these students wise or foolish? Why? 
8. A pupil who had much natural talent in drawing lost interest 
in water-color work when he failed to do as well as his mates. 
Later, in another school, his interest in drawing revived when he 
found he could do better than the pupils there; but he still dislikes 
water-color work. Comment on this. How might a standard 
measuring scale have helped the situation? 
9. A South African negro boy ran away frightened on first 
seeing a man mark on a blackboard with white chalk, but later 
ventured back to see the ‘‘magic stick.’’ In his educated man- 
hood, he said this had made the greatest impression on his mind 
of all that he had ever experienced. Explain why children are 
so elated at the privilege of marking on the board. 
10. Suggest as many ways as you can by which pupils may be 
“taken into partnership” in running the school, — such as having 
a bright pupil serve sometimes as teacher, encouraging pupils to 
aid in receiving visitors, permitting them to codperate in the 
school management, and so on. 
11. Clever and successful hostesses are said to keep well in- 
formed ag to the details of the lives of those whom they entertain.

  102 THE CHILD’S MIND 
Business men often do the same with their customers. What 
lesson here for the teacher who would make her lessons produce 
the maximum “effect”? 
12. Plato says that if a man is brought up from childhood to 
hear good music, he will like it; but that if trained ‘‘in the sweet 
and vulgar music,” he will dislike the better kind. On what is he 
counting for ‘effect,’ on ability, habit, or what? Do you think 
we can train for “effect,” so that what was at first indifferent or 
disagreeable will become agreeable? If so, how? 
13. In Salt Lake City, tickets for baseball games were given 
out to the boys and girls who had attained an average of 85 per 
cent or more in scholarship and deportment for the week. It 
was reported that “since the tickets were first distributed a 
sudden and remarkable improvement in study and conduct has 
been observed.” Would you advise making such practices wide- 
spread? Give reasons. 
14. It has been suggested that children be paid a small sum 
(say at the rate of a few cents a day) for attending school. Tell 
why you think this should or should not be done.

CHAPTER VI 
A GENERAL PLAN For THE Formine or ANy Ser 
or Bonps 
Exercises. — 1. Tell in some detail how you have taught (or 
would teach) any trick or other simple piece of learning to a child 
or a lower animal. 
What responses did you want? To what stimuli? 
On what did you rely to call out and fix these responses? 
2. Make a list of the chief points which you think should appear 
in every lesson plan. Base this chiefly on a review of what has 
preceded. 
You now know the chief laws of learning. The next need 
is to form them into a plan which we can apply to the teach- 
ing of every branch, and of every lesson. The purpose of 
this chapter is to produce such a plan. 
The method of the animal trainer.— When an animal 
trainer wants to teach one of his pets a new trick, he must 
ask himself such questions as the following: 
1. ‘What responses do I want, and to what situations?” 
It is of course useless for him to want any responses that are 
foreign to the animal’s nature; a lion can be trained to sit 
on a stool, but no one ever trained a lion to climb a rope. 
2. ‘What responses does the animal naturally make to 
such situations?” That is, what old bonds does he have that 
are like the new ones wanted? 
3. “How pass, by very gradual steps, from his present 
responses to the ones I want?” The lion trainer first places 
103 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
104 THE CHILD’S MIND 
a stick in the cage, puts meat on it, rubs the lion with it, 
shortens it daily, then uses his hand in place of the stick. 
He next puts a collar and chain on Leo while the animal is 
asleep, then shoves an empty chair inside the cage. The 
lion springs but cannot reach the chair. The trainer occu- 
pies the chair, first with the lion chained, then unchained. 
A fight may ensue. The old stick is used again; first for 
blows, if necessary, and then for petting. Later, the hand 
is substituted. After two weeks of growing familiarity, the 
trainer can raise the paw of his pet. Gradually, the lion 
learns to back up at command, to lie down, to sit up, and 
to do other tricks. Even then, care must be taken when he 
passes from his small cage to the large and crowded arena, 
or he will go wild — much wilder than a small boy who has 
practiced in his own little schoolroom and then attempts to 
perform in a large auditorium filled with people. 
The method of the teacher. — The questions asked above 
by the animal trainer (and also his procedure) are important 
for the teacher too. Educating a child is more complex, 
but not necessarily more difficult, than training a lower 
animal. In the numbered sections below are taken up the 
questions that appear to be most important for the teacher 
to ask as a general guide to the teaching of any kind of 
lesson. 
1. Just what bonds do I want to build? — What responses 
are wanted? To what stimuli? 
As we have already learned, we must hold steadily in mind 
the stimuli, the situations that the world will force on our 
little graduate, and let him practice now in school as he will 
have to perform hereafter out of school.

found in Frank C. Bostock’s Training of Wild Animals, pp. 125-150.

2. What related responses can the learner make already? — 
When he begins reading, he knows many words by sound, 
and responds to them when he hears them; he has only 
to learn to respond to them by sight. If one knows how 
to speak a foreign language — and English is a ‘‘foreign 
language” to a child — learning to read it is not difficult. 
3. How shall we pass from the bonds already formed to the 
bonds to be formed, introducing but one difficulty at a time? — 
The ideal method is the tandem method, for it gives perfect 
guidance, and introduces only so much difficulty at any 
point as the learner is ready to shoulder and carry. We 
should work as nearly tandem with our pupil as we can. 
As the introduction of more than one difficulty at a time 
is probably the most common error committed in teaching, 
let us halt a little here (so that I shall not commit this very 
error on you at this point). 
a. From sensori-motor bonds to high-level bonds. Let us 
recall that the sensori-motor connections are in the lower 
part of the brain, and that all education, in whatever branch, 
should start right there. The only sensible way to begin an 
education is to start with the sense organs and let them set 
off movements of some kind. 
Further, when dealing with minds immature or a bit slow, 
we must take care to pass by very easy stages from sensori- 
motor to high-level. Suppose we are teaching a pupil that 
three and two are five. We (a) put down three marbles and 
two marbles; (b) draw three marbles and two marbles on 
the board; (c) use a line only to stand for a marble, drawing 
three lines and two lines; (d) tell him a little arithmetical 
story that will cause him to see three marbles and two marbles 
very vividly “in his mind’s eye” after much practice; (e) 
get him to think in terms of words only — “Three and two
-P-A-G-E-116
  106 THE CHILD’S MIND 
are five”’; and finally (f) train him to respond to the stimulus, 
“Three and two,”’ by answering “‘Five,”’ without any further 
thinking or ado about it. 
He is now ready to take up problems in which he must use 
this “‘three and two”’ bond. 
b. Relation of the desired bonds to each other. This is one 
of the most difficult problems in all education. It will help 
to clear the matter if we note, with regard to the relations 
of bonds to each other, four possible arrangements: 
Simple and single. 
In series. 
In trunk line. 
Tn inclusive units. 
These are not to be thought of as four sharply separated 
plans; for they grade into each other. But we shall consider 
them separately. 
Simple and single bonds. This arrangement needs no dis- 
cussion. In geography, for example, we teach many inde- 
pendent items of information, each with its separate and 
simple bond: The earth is round, New York City is a great 
seaport, ete. Such connections have little to do with each 
other. Each response has its own path through the brain. 
Bonds in series. We have a good illustration of this in 
our knowledge of the alphabet; or of any succession of words, 
such as a poem; or of a succession of acts, such as those that 
are necessary in the mixing and baking of a cake; or even of 
a succession of thoughts, such as those that are necessary in 
proving that the earth is round, or in giving a demonstration 
in geometry.! 
1In the first working out of a proof, there is of course something more than 
a simple chain of bonds involved; but in passing from point to point as one 
repeats a familiar demonstration before a class, nothing more is necessary. 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
  FORMING ANY SET OF BONDS 107 
How to teach such a series appears to depend on whether 
the bonds for its separate units have already been formed, 
so that the chief work left to do is to get these bonds con- 
nected into a series; or whether the units themselves have 
first to be mastered. 
An example in which bonds have already been formed 
for the separate units is that of memorizing a poem. We 
already know the words, and most of the ideas it contains, 
so our task is to get these words and ideas connected into 
a series. In this case, we learn by wholes, repeating the 
whole thing each time until it is fairly well mastered, 
after which special attention must be given to sticking 
points, that is, points where the connection is found to 
be weak. 
Where the separate units in the series are new, and espe- 
cially if the tandem method cannot be used, so that it is 
hard to give guidance from point to point, teach but one 
unit (or at most a few) at a lesson — just enough to make 
“one difficulty at a time” for the pupil or class you are 
teaching. For example, Watson taught some rats to 
thread their way through a maze-like structure, dig through 
sawdust till they discovered a hidden gateway through a 
fence, mine through more sawdust till they had found a 
concealed passage underneath a box, and then make their 
way up through a hole in the box, which held their food. 
His “difficulties,” which he introduced one at a time, were 
as follows: (1) box with hole in bottom, no obstructions 
except its supports; (2) box as before, but with straw to 
obstruct hole; (3) box with sawdust to obstruct hole; 
(4) box as in (3) and with fences around it, having entrances 
obstructed by sawdust; (5) box with obstruction and 
fences, and with maze-like structure around the whole.
-P-A-G-E-118
108 THE CHILD’S MIND 
A child who learns to spell post, then postpone, and then 
postponement, is proceeding in much the same way. So is 
one who first adds, then adds and carries, and then adds 
and carries as a part of multiplication. As a rule, all acts 
of muscular skill are taught by this method. 
Trunk line bonds. These are pictured by the plan of a 
railroad which has a “through line,” that is, a trunk line, 
from which the side lines come out as branches. A very 
prominent teacher of boxing begins his lessons by teaching 
such a trunk line bond, that of rotating and reaching. The 
student stands with feet apart and parallel, rotates his 
body at the hips so as to throw his right shoulder forward, 
and reaches out his right hand, palm up. This is alter- 
nated with a corresponding movement for the left side and 
arm. From this first exercise, well drilled in, all others 
are developed as variations. 
The slang question ‘‘What’s the big idea?” applies here 
very neatly. This big idea, this trunk line bond, should 
be taught with great thoroughness. In ‘writing, the big 
idea is to swing across the page easily and at the same time 
make up and down movements. The pupil who can do 
this can soon make all the letters as variations of this 
general movement. In violin playing, the big idea (to 
start with) is drawing the bow. In language and grammar, 
it is the sentence. As we “modify” its subject and predi- 
cate and other parts we are simply building modifications, 
branches, onto the old trunk line bond we start with. In 
algebra, the big idea is the equation.!_ Teachers of reading 
1“Algebra,” say Rugg and Clark, “is organized about the equation. Its 
method is essentially that of the science of the equation, and this method does 
not change from the beginning to the end of the course.’”’ (P. 128 of Scientific 
Method in the Reconstruction of Ninth Grade Mathematics.)

and spelling make use of a trunk line bond on a small scale 
when they first teach a form, as at, and then present: 
| ¢ hat 
| In this book, the big idea is the bond. 
Inclusive units. As you begin learning to typewrite, you 
have to give particular attention to each letter-key as you 
strike it. But gradually, such clusters of letters as th-e, 
a-n-d, etc., begin to hang together, so that you can run 
them off quickly and easily. As you go on writing, every 
word you commonly use comes to have its cluster-bond, 
and even whole sentences, frequently repeated, seem to 
“write themselves.” But if you attempt to typewrite 
something from a foreign language, though printed in the 
same familiar alphabet, you ‘“‘clog,” for you have no in- 
clusive-unit bonds with which to manage its words in 
groups. 
What do these inclusive units mean in the nervous sys- 
tem? The letter bonds are controlled by a word center, 
the word bonds by a phrase center, the phrase bonds by 
a sentence center. So, when you wish to write The quick 
brown fox jumps over the lazy dog (a sentence containing all 
the letters of the alphabet), a single strong impulse from 
your sentence center (Figure 17), radiating out through the 
lower brain-paths it controls, like a general order going out 
from headquarters to all the smaller and smaller units of 
an army, is sufficient to set off the whole performance. 
Further, while that performance is running itself off, you 
can go on thinking of what to do next.
-P-A-G-E-120
  110 THE CHILD’S MIND 
Very little of this kind of learning (as it seems to me) 
is found among the lower animals; but in human learning, 
you will be able to think of a dozen examples at once. 
The essential rule for building up such a hierarchy of 
bonds is, Begin at the bottom; go slow; and be thorough. Be- 
ginning at the bottom means teaching each single little 
bond well before trying to form a group. Get the elementary 
facts thoroughly in reading, or arithmetic, or beginner's 
Latin, or chemistry, or any other subject where inclusive 
is

LS ££ ASA Bs BAA Fie. 17. The arrangement of bonds in inclusive units. 
units have to be dealt with, and these facts, later in the 
course, will seem of themselves to cluster and nest in pro- 
ductive ways, will make nuggets of value, and subsume 
themselves under principles in a manner most surprising. 
But let these elements go unmastered, and all the higher 
structure crumbles as fast as we try to erect it. 
c. Which bonds to form first. ‘Teach first the bonds (1) 
that are easiest and most interesting to learn, (2) that 
occur most frequently, (3) that prepare for the greatest 
number of other bonds-to-be. 
In primary reading, when we wish to begin teaching the 
sounds of the letters, shall we teach chiefly vowels or conso- 
nants? The consonant bonds are easiest to form, for each
-P-A-G-E-121
FORMING ANY SET OF BONDS 111 
consonant (as a rule) has but one sound; whereas every 
vowel has several sounds. Further, the consonants occur 
most frequently in important positions, that is, standing 
first in the word, or sticking above or below the line of print. 
And finally, consonant sounds prepare the pupil better for 
word bonds-to-be; for they give him the skeletons of words, 
whereas the vowel sounds merely fill in the soft parts. It is 
even possible to read a language without vowels — or with 
very few. 
Such a guide as the above, while it may not be infallible, 
is likely to lead us to the best conclusion we can form in 
advance of experiment. 
4. Readiness. — How shall we flush with energy the nerve 
cells to be used? This question has already received its 
answer (in Chapter III). 
5. Exercise. —How guide the nerve current repeatedly 
along the path to be strengthened? How keep it from 
wandering? How prevent errors and exceptions, that is, the 
exercise of wrong paths? How use a method that is tandem 
or near-tandem? (See Chapter IV.) 
6. Effect. — How make the result satisfying, pleasant to 
the pupil? (See Chapter V.) 
7. How test essential bonds? — This we must do to guide 
our teaching. It is well to think of subject matter, when we 
have taught it to a pupil, as a number of bonds in his brain, 
bonds organized into some kind of system. If, when plan- 
ning our teaching, we answer clearly our first question 
(“Just what bonds do I want to build?”), we shall know 
what responses to expect. The ideal test would consist of 
all these responses, arranged in order from easiest to hardest. 
By applying it, we could tell just how far we had “brought 
on” our pupil — or to use a religious phrase, how much we 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  112 THE CHILD’S MIND 
had edified him, had built up in him that goodly edifice of 
bonds which is to remain in his brain as a memorial of his 
educational sojourn with us. 
The essentials of a good measuring scale. — A good edu- 
cational ‘‘measuring stick’’ is in its essentials like a good 
yardstick or meter stick. To begin with, it is in the outside 
world, and not wholly in our heads. When the ‘oldest 
inhabitant” tells you that this cold winter is not nearly so 
frigid as one he remembers fifty years ago, the comparison 
is wholly in his head (subjective), and may not be very 
accurate; but the yardstick is a thing (objective). It does 
not change much, and cannot lie unless it has a very able 
assistant. 
As a rule, we measure products in education by samples 
of themselves, arithmetic by samples of arithmetic, compo- 
sition by samples of composition, etc., as we measure distance 
by a sample distance, a yardstick. The way to do a thing is 
to do it, and the best way to test it, as a rule, is to have it 
done. 
And finally, just as a good height-measuring stick is 
graduated from zero by definite and equal steps right on up 
to a point higher than that of the tallest man it is to measure, 
so a good educational measuring scale should begin at zero 
and be graduated by definite and equal steps right on up to 
a point at least as high as can ever be reached by the best 
pupil it is made to measure. 
Outline of a general plan.—In order to keep essential 
points prominently before us, let us formulate now a general 
plan for teaching. And to stimulate us to think over each 
new problem as if rises, let us make the entries in the form 
of questions.

CLASS EXERCISE 
The purpose of the exercise is to illustrate the use of inclusive 
units in learning. Wait for directions from the instructor. All 
lines in the figures called for are to be made without removing 
pencil from paper. 
1. In Fig. 18, copy or trace diagram A ten times. 
2. Study B, which combines two of these units, and C, which 
contains three of them. 
3. (a) Devise a figure composed of four of these units. (6) Show 
how a border could be made, composed of any number of them, 
following the plan of B. 
4. (a) Study D. How many of the units does this contain, 
counting the one in the center? (b) Devise a pattern containing 
nine of the units. 
5. (If No. 6 is to be performed, record the time required to 
solve this problem.) Using D as a unit, invent a pattern com- 
posed of five of these D’s, one of which shall stand at the center 
of the figure, as unit A stands at the center of D. 
6. Present No. 5 to a group of students who have had no 
experience with this unit. Be sure to state that the whole line 
must be made without removing pencil from paper. Compare 
the time record and method of procedure of this group with that 
of the experienced group. 
7. Show that the decimal system involves the use of inclusive 
(multiple) units. Suppose that moving a figure one place to the 
left multiplied it by 100 instead of by 10, ete. 
FOR FURTHER STUDY 
1. Select several sample lessons, simple ones, from various 
common branches, and tell just what bonds you think they should 
include, what responses you would expect, and to what stimuli, 
when the lessons had been taught. i 
2. Show how you would pass gradually from sensori-motor 
bonds to high-level bonds (after the manner shown in the example

given, of teaching that three and two are five) in presenting to a 
class the following: (1) a word, starting with the object for which 
it is the name; (2) some piece of geographical subject matter, such 
as a lake (beginning with the actual object); (3) a word in spell- 
ing; (4) a story in reading or language (beginning by playing the 
story); (5) facts of history (beginning with something now going 
on in your neighborhood). 
It is not necessary, in every case, to pass through all the steps 
given in the example in this chapter. 
3. Give several original examples of bonds arranged in the four 
ways discussed in this chapter. Give special attention to trunk 
line bonds and bonds arranged in inclusive units. 
4. In teaching the following tell whether you would proceed 
by the method of wholes, or by taking one (or a few) units at a 
time, and why: a memory gem, holding a pen and writing, learning 
a‘multiplication table, making a dress, playing baseball, reading 
(for a beginner), learning the Chinese alphabet. 
Give other examples of your own. 
5. Give as many cases as you can, from school work or outside, 
in which the tandem method can be used. For example, consider 
the teaching of a game of any kind to a friend by playing it with 
him, holding him responsible for his plays only in so far as he 
shows that he ‘‘knows what he is about.” 
Some think it good for a child to learn reading by looking on 
the page while parent or teacher reads easy subject matter, the 
child following along and pronouncing a word here and there as 
soon as he can do so and gradually undertaking the reading him- 
self. What do you think of this plan? 
6. Have you ever observed what happens when a child is 
“rushed” in learning reading, beginner’s Latin, arithmetic, or 
any other subject in which bonds must be formed on the plan of 
inclusive units? If so, describe the case and tell what you would 
have done about it. 
7. Pick up any elementary textbook and observe whether it 
teaches first the bonds that are easiest and most interesting to 
learn, that occur most frequently, and that prepare for the greatest
-P-A-G-E-127
  FORMING ANY SET OF BONDS 117 
number of bonds-to-be. If so, show how; and if not, criticize it 
and suggest improvements. 
8. Can you think of any cases where lower animals seem to 
learn by inclusive units? If so, try to explain them; and if not, 
tell why you think such examples must be rare. 
9. Why should beginners work for accuracy rather than 
speed? (Consider the danger of the nerve current’s ‘running 
off the track.’’) 
10. Hobhouse taught an elephant to pull a bolt and open the 
lid of a box by taking her trunk in his hand and guiding it through 
each movement. Show the likeness of this procedure to the tan- 
dem method. 
On the seventh trial, the elephant learned to pull the bolt, and 
at the fortieth trial, on the third day, she mastered the three 
movements, drawing the bolt, opening the lid, and holding it open. 
What do you think as to the speed of the learning? 
11. I have come across the following in my notes, relative to 
the method I used in teaching my son his first Latin from a book 
(he had had a little conversational Latin). ‘The first time over, 
I translate, going slowly and giving him a chance to chime in a 
word or phrase here and there. The second time, he chimes in 
more. I keep heading off his errors, both those which he has made 
before and those which experience tells me all pupils are likely 
to make. Finally, he goes through it alone.” 
Show that this is an application of the tandem method. 
12. Would the method described in No. 11 be a safe one to 
employ with an uninterested pupil? With an interested class? 
With an unready class? Why or why not?

CHAPTER VII 
Somp Simpite ScHoou Hasits 
A superintendent, wishing to secure an efficient disciplinarian, visited 
at the opening of a term a school with many new pupils. A class was 
called, and the pupils rose carelessly. They were promptly seated, and then, 
by a motion of the hand, were called again. The second rising was not 
quite satisfactory, and they were again seated. At the next silent signal the 
pupils all rose properly, and this was recognized by a pleasant “I thank you; 
that pleases me.”’ This exhibition of quiet power satisfied the superinten- 
dent, and the teacher was invited to take a better position. “Ten words of 
praise to one of censure,’’ is a good maxim in an elementary school. Right 
habits are the result of training, not of talking, and the habit of quiet self- 
control is no exception.1— Emerson E. Waitr 
Exercises. — 1. A superintendent observed that a certain 
school, at time of dismissal, became very disorderly and boisterous. 
Pupils ran against each other in their efforts to empty individual 
waste paper bags into a large basket, the basket overflowed its 
contents onto the floor, and there was much noise and confusion. 
Apply the outline worked out in the last chapter and show how 
you would remedy such a condition by forming appropriate bonds. 
2. Recall times in your elementary school days when you were 
very orderly in your school habits, and other times (if there were 
any) when you were other than orderly. Describe one or more 
notable situations. What did your teacher do that caused or 
prevented such situations? Again apply the outline (referred 
to above) and either justify what your teacher did, or show what 
you would have done had you been teacher, — that is, what you 
think should have been done. 
Conduct. — The most common branch of all, the one the 
pupil will practice most in after life, is Conduct. Further,

124 THE CHILD’S MIND 
the teacher, whether he realizes it or not, is teaching this 
subject, well or poorly, all the time. Other branches have 
but a period a day, but lessons in conduct are being taught 
and learned every hour of every day. Because the pupil 
does not carry home a book in the subject, nor recite lessons 
in it, both he and the teacher are, as a rule, in danger of 
forgetting its importance, and even its existence. Strangely 
enough, too, although we know that our pupils are below 
us in their achievement in other branches, and we conse- 
quently excuse their blunders and never leave the little ones 
especially, to learn by themselves, yet we often assume 
children to be our equals in the fine art of conduct. We 
become irritated when they do wrong (as if some adult 
had done us an injustice); and because we feel that they 
should ‘‘know enough to behave,” we leave them alone to 
blunder along without guidance in.this, the hardest branch 
of all. 
Because this subject is so large, it is usually treated in 
a book devoted to it alone. We cannot, of course, cover 
it completely here but we can apply what we have learned 
in regard to the teaching of bonds that are easiest to learn, 
that occur most frequently in school practice, and that 
prepare the way for the greatest number of bonds-to-be. 
Because the neglect of these fundamentals makes the teacher 
much trouble, they are the very things which, until her 
school is well organized, should occupy most of her attention. 
Entering the schoolroom. — Let us suppose conditions are 
such that our pupils can come rather directly into the school- 
room, tracking in a heavy weight of mud. What bond do 
we want to build? The “situation” is “entering the 
schoolroom,”’ and the desired response is ‘‘cleaning shoes,”’ 
or “‘removing overshoes.”’ Very likely there are some “‘re- 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
  SOME SIMPLE SCHOOL HABITS 125 
lated responses”? practiced at home. As the bond is a 
simple sensori-motor one, there is little danger of intro- 
ducing more than one difficulty at a time. 
Readiness suggests one of the chief questions: how can 
we start the nerve currents that will make our pupils want 
to come in with clean shoes? We might talk to them at 
the close of our morning exercises, when their nerve cells 
are fresh and receptive. (If we do it at the close of school, 
their impulses will all be for going out of the door instead 
of coming in, and they will not listen so. well.) One of 
the first things that occurs to me is a placard which I saw 
in a business office a few days ago: “If you track in mud 
at home, do it here. We want you to feel at home.” ‘Now,’ 
we might go on, ‘‘this schoolroom is our home for five days 
a week, and we want everyone to feel at home. Surely no 
one of us would track in mud at home, ete.” Other points, 
such as the appearance of a dirty room, what we think of 
people who live in dirt, and how our room compares with 
others, may also be brought out kindly and forcefully, but 
not to a length that makes them wearisome. 
Exercise of the bond can also be provided for at the 
same time. Little guidance is required, though small chil- 
dren may need help. The chief thing is to see that no 
exceptions occur. ‘‘We must all help each other to re- 
member about this. To-morrow morning, I am going to 
stand at the door when you come. First, I shall look into 
your face and smile ‘Good morning’ at you, and then look 
down at your feet, not to see whether you wear fancy 
shoes — that doesn’t matter — but to see whether they are 
free from mud. If they are clean, I shall let you come right 
in; but if not —” (a shake of the head). “If you see me 
tracking in mud, you must tell me (tandem method) and I
-P-A-G-E-136
126 THE CHILD’S MIND 
will go back and clean my shoes. You must do the same. 
How many are ready to help keep our schoolroom free from 
mud?” If we call for a show of hands, very likely every 
pupil will have at least one hand up. 
If there is danger of a last minute rush, we can provide 
a preliminary signal, such as a warning bell, which says, 
“Clean your shoes.” 
We take our stand at the door next morning and prevent 
all exceptions. Soon, a pupil whose personality is strong 
enough to make him respected, may be elected or appointed 
to take our place; and later, the place may be left vacant. 
Effect of an agreeable kind can be produced by praise 
(if it is deserved); by calling attention to the clean floor 
and the feeling of cleanliness we all have; by comparing 
the room with dirty rooms (not mentioned by name or 
number) which we may have visited somewhere; by quot- 
ing the approving remarks of a respected janitor; and by 
noting that when we march, we do not, like a caravan going 
through a desert, raise a cloud of dust. 
If our pupils again get careless, we can make the effect 
unpleasant by having a little inspection, each taking a peep 
under his own seat. The discovery of dirt will produce 
embarrassment. ‘‘ Now, when soldiers are in barracks, each 
one has to ‘police up,’ that is, keeps things clean and tidy 
around his own bunk and his part of the floor. If the floor 
gets dirty under your desk, you must be a good soldier and 
clean it.’”’ Perhaps the next inspection still reveals one or 
two dirty spots. ‘I shall have to ask Frank and James to 
stay and do police duty under their desks. All the rest may go.” 
Tests of any special or standardized kind are hardly neces- 
sary. The coming of visitors, including parents and principal
-P-A-G-E-137
  
SOME SIMPLE SCHOOL HABITS 127 
or superintendent, will serve as test occasions. Where several 
rooms are near together, an inspector may visit them all and 
then make special mention of the most deserving, perhaps 
awarding a banner. 
Teaching ‘‘attention.’? — I once asked an experienced and 
expert teacher what simple habits she found it most necessary 
to teach at the opening of a term of school so as to prevent 
trouble later. 
Her reply was, “I found it most necessary to teach my 
pupils to pay attention to me, so that whenever I spoke to 
them or gave directions, they heeded immediately.” 
This surprised me; but I recalled that the first thing a 
recruit learns when he enters the army is to stand at “‘Atten- 
tion,’’ and that Major Koehler, a West Point expert, had 
spent an hour simply teaching a company how to stand up 
and salute. Further, whenever an officer comes near a 
group of unengaged privates, one of them always shouts 
“ Attention!’ and they all come to the proper position with 
a snap. Probably the army carries this kind of thing a 
little too far, and probably the school does not carry it 
quite far enough. The attention bond (if we may call it 
that) is a trunk line bond: no matter what the soldier or 
the pupil is to do or to learn, attention is the first step. 
We shall not ask and answer in detail all the questions of 
our outline (page 113). In general, the stimulus will be, 
Teacher in a position of expectancy, or giving a signal for 
attention, and the response we want is Pupil attentive both in 
mind and attitude. Only in most unusual cases shall we 
permit any exceptions. 
Let us suppose ‘‘school is called,” and we step before our 
class. Our ‘‘personality,” that is, what is suggested in the 
minds of our pupils by our appearance, is of great importance  
-P-A-G-E-138
  
  128 THE CHILD’S MIND 
now. The hounding and hunting instinct is strong in chil- 
dren: if they feel that we are weak and contemptible, a kind 
of legitimate prey, and if we act so, we shall hardly command 
their attention. We must act the part of the self-reliant, 
earnest teacher, anxious to get the work under way. ‘I’m 
the man you want to keep your eye on,” said a Boston traffic 
policeman to me as I tried to pilot my wife across the street 
through a maze of automobiles. We should give our pupils 
the same feeling with regard to ourselves. The leading-and- 
following instinct is also strong in children; if we lead off 
well, they will follow. 
If any are inattentive, we wait a bit, perhaps, as a good 
speaker does for an audience. But this may not be sufficient: 
“T see one or two who are not yet paying attention. I hope 
I shall not have to point them out.” We may have to, how- 
ever. But we shall not begin so long as there is a single arm 
lopped over the back neighbor’s desk, or a single foot stuck 
out across the aisle. That teacher is fortunate who “just 
can’t go on”’ so long as there is a pupil out of order. 
Or suppose we are teaching a class. Of course we shall try 
to secure Readiness by making the work interesting, and we 
shall see that there is something going on for everyone during 
every minute of the period. But one is wandering. Permit 
no exceptions. Catch the first stray sheep. We may speak 
the pupil’s name, more or less incidentally: “‘So you see, 
John, ete.”” Or we may ask him the next question. Or, 
“John will not know this to-morrow, for he is not paying 
attention now.” Or, ‘‘Mary, aren’t you feeling well to-day? 
You don’t seem to follow the lesson,’ —and sometimes 
Mary isn’t well. 
If the class is generally inattentive, we change our pro- 
cedure. We stand, if we have been sitting, make a few
-P-A-G-E-139
  SOME SIMPLE SCHOOL HABITS 129 
gestures, perhaps, and act rather brisk. (You know how you 
feel when the quick clerk has your package done up before 
you can get out your purse to pay for it.) Perhaps we shorten 
the lesson period for the day. Or we may stop oral work and 
give a few questions on paper, to be answered then or later. 
The teacher who is apt in expression work (language and 
drawing) can usually help herself at such times by introduc- 
ing astory or a blackboard drawing that bears on the lesson. 
But attention we must have. 
Children, left to themselves in work, are restless, noisy, rude, ineffective 
in many ways. They waste their own time and that of others. They know 
this as well as anyone, and an undisciplined school scorns the teacher who 
permits misbehavior and knows it is having a good time at the expense of 
valuable things.! 
We shall always remember that love is the greatest thing 
in the world, but we shall also remember that it is not the 
only thing in school-teaching. The teacher who feels that 
she must govern wholly by the method of smiles will almost 
certainly have some insurrections that smiles will not put 
down. The race has struggled up to civilization through 
blood and tears, and most children still have to shed a few 
teardrops, if no blood drops, while they are catching up. 
Desk keeping.—If you have taught school, you have 
noticed that’ ‘it never rains but it pours.” Somebody’s 
books slide out of the desk; a pencil box drops and its con- 
tents roll to all points of the compass; a pupil reaches fran- 
tically for his property, bumps his head on a desk and sets 
off irrepressible, inextinguishable laughter. We can prevent 
much of this by training in that part of good housekeeping 
which may well be called desk keeping.

  130 THE CHILD’S MIND 
Guidance is perhaps the first essential, for many pupils 
do not know how to keep things from tumbling out, having 
no plan for keeping them in order. If any neat, bright pupil 
can give a demonstration, he may bring his books to a table 
in front and explain. ‘I put my large tablet and my big 
geography on the bottom; and on top of them two piles of 
smaller books, with their ends toward me, so. On my right, 
I place in order all the books that I use in the forenoon, 
and on my left, the afternoon books. When I put a book 
in, I lay it right on top of the pile; when I pull one out, I 
always draw it from the bottom, taking care not to pull 
any other book out with it. My pencil box slips in endwise 
here at the right. My waste paper I keep at the left; but 
I throw it out each day when the waste basket is passed. 
If anything happens to get my desk out of order, I always 
put it right before I leave at night.” 
If this is followed by a fair amount of ‘‘exercise” in ar- 
ranging desks, pulling out and replacing books, if there is a 
nightly inspection for a time, and if the dropping of things 
from desks is met by a “how-came-that’’ look from the 
teacher, the good desk keeping of the school should soon win 
the pleasant approval of praise. 
The forming and passing of lines. — Years ago, when I was 
a cadet teacher in a normal training school, I had my class 
of fifth-graders lined up in the hall, ready to pass, when the 
critic teacher scanned the row of pupils and said firmly, 
“Harl B., leave the line.’ It dawned upon me that my teach- 
ing coach had a higher standard and a better eye than I had. 
Since then, I have seen many teachers line up many pupils, 
and I have seen my old fault reappear many times. It is 
surprising to find how many teachers fail to remove the 
noisy, stamping, swaying, pushing pupil from the line.
-P-A-G-E-141
  
SOME SIMPLE SCHOOL HABITS 131 
Few of us, Iam afraid, love our pupils enough to punish 
them properly. 
Not that such an offense needs a crushing punishment. 
Here, as in so many other cases, it is certainty rather than 
severity that counts. Readiness of course we shall seek to 
create, largely by an appeal to instincts, pitting our room 
against some other or one row against another, dismissing first 
that line which is ready first or which persents the best ap- 
pearance. We shall praise those who march “‘like soldiers.” 
We shall try, too, to make it unpopular to disturb a line 
that is forming or passing, and to create a wholesome social 
atmosphere by an appeal to the herd instinct, and perhaps 
an appeal to reason on top of that. 
But the essential item of our outline to apply here is the 
prevention of exceptions. Horses and schools must not 
run away if we can help it. Something must happen to 
the wandering sheep. For exceptional conduct there must 
always be an exceptional effect 
CLASS EXERCISE 
Formulate a plan for getting each pupil in your school to use 
but one hook, and always the same hook, in the cloak room (sup- 
posing you do not have lockers). If your cloak room is an old- 
fashioned one, with but a single narrow door, how would you plan 
to get the wraps, umbrellas, overshoes, etc. (assumed to be in the 
cloak room) into the possession of their respective owners at time 
of dismissal? Consider the advantages and disadvantages of 
(1) having monitors to deliver wraps to pupils; (2) permitting 
one row of pupils at a time to get their own wraps. If the cloak 
room had two doors, how would you manage? So far as simplicity 
in school management is concerned, what is the ideal way to 
stow wraps?

FOR FURTHER STUDY 
1. Tell how you would teach a pet cat to jump over a stick 
or over your joined hands. 
2. State your plan for training pupils to stand promptly and 
in order on signal. 
3. What do heat, light, and ventilation have to do with the 
general readiness or unreadiness of pupils? 
4, Assume that your pupils are to pass to the front of the room 
or elsewhere to recite, and tell how you would train them to do it. 
5. Apply the outline on page 113 to show what can be done to 
keep pupils in good posture, whether standing or sitting. 
6. Do you favor leaving pens and other writing materials in the 
possession of the pupils all the time, or distributing and collecting 
them at each lesson? Why? Does your answer vary with the 
- age of the pupils? 
7. Tell how you would train monitors to distribute and collect 
materials, pass waste baskets, etc. 
8. What plan would you adopt in the first grade for keeping 
pencils sharp? In the fifth grade? How would you give pupils 
the necessary training to carry out your plan? 
9. What is the best method you know of for permitting pupils 
to get drinks, leave the room, etc., so as to satisfy all reasonable 
wants and yet permit no abuses? How would you put your 
method into operation? 
10. List all the things you would do to insure clean blackboards, 
to see that crayon is kept in place, and that neat written work 
is done at the board. 
11. Tell, in terms of Readiness, Exercise, and Effect, how you 
would make a fire drill effective. 
12. There is no doubt that many children, both at home and 
at school, are thought to be disobedient, when the real trouble 
is a lack of attention while the request or command is being given. 
How can this be remedied?

CHAPTER VIII 
Primary Construction Work 
ExercisE. — Recall all the cases you can of children who were 
left-handed. What do you think caused them to be left-handed? 
Do you know, certainly, of any such child who suffered no difficulty 
or delay in learning to talk? Did any change and become right- 
handers? If so, what caused the change? Also, was there any 
difficulty experienced, especially in the way of speech or nervous 
control? Do you think the right hand ever becomes as proficient, 
in such cases, as the left hand would if a change were not made? 
In order to introduce but one difficulty at, a time, let 
us study next a group of bonds which are easy to form, 
which occur very frequently, and which prepare the way 
for a great number of other bonds-to-be. They are sensori- 
motor connections for the most part, and their relation to 
each other is usually simple. Such a group of bonds is 
found in Construction Work, and especially in the begin- 
nings of it, which we shall now consider. 
Right-handed and left-handed pupils. — As soon as a child 
begins to use his hands, we must consider the matter of 
handedness. Parents ought to be the first to deal with it; 
but the children usually bring the problem to school with 
them. Quite commonly, the teacher never thinks of it 
seriously until the child picks up his pen. Yet for years 
before that day one side of his body has been getting the 
start of the other in all sorts of performances. For the 
question seems to be one of “‘sidedness”’ rather than handed- 
134 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
PRIMARY CONSTRUCTION WORK 135 
ness alone: the child is likely to ‘‘walk left-handed” (or 
right-handed), and in general, to use one whole side of his 
body in preference to the other. : 
There is little doubt (in my mind, at least) that children 
are born more or less right- or left-handed. Probably 
three or four per cent are born ‘strongly left-handed, three 
or four per cent ambidextrous (equally ready with either 
hand), and the rest right-handed. The left-hander is some- 
times neglected in school, sometimes caused to suffer 
through a forced change to a hand that will serve him less 
efficiently. (Imagine yourself compelled to change to your 
other hand.) Handedness seems to be even more pro- 
nounced in childhood than in adult life. r 
It would be well if we had some way to determine in each 
case which hand nature intended to be major and which 
minor, since she evidently has her mind made up about it 
for most children. Some have sought to find this out by 
measuring the bones and muscles of the arms of babies or 
primary children, on the theory that nature would make 
larger, from the beginning, the limb designed to be domi- 
nant. Strength of grip in the two hands has also been used 
as such an indicator. Better than either of these is the 
test of tapping with the fingers (not from the wrist or with 
the whole arm), and a tracing test whose nes Ee are 
much like those used in writing.’ 
To shift or not to shift. — If a child is born ambidextrous, 
it is safe to advise that he use his right hand wherever, as 
in writing, one hand must play a leading part. But if he 
is born a left-hander, such advice is not safe. Not only 
will his right hand never become so proficient as his left 
can be, but there appears to be some danger of inducing

136 THE CHILD’S MIND 
nervousness and of interfering with the development of his 
speech. 
Most people are right-handed and left-brained. That is, 
the left half of the brain, which controls the right side of 
the body, is larger and heavier than the right half. Also, 
there is a speech center! which is generally found on one 
side only of the brain, and that side is opposite the dominant 
hand.2. If we may make the reasonable assumption that 
the deft activity of the dominant hand is the best stimulus 
for the proper development of the speech center, then we 
can readily see that to compel a pupil to shift hands is 
probably to compel him, not only to shift his hand-control 
from one side of his brain to the other, but also to shift his 
speech center along with it. Hence the nervousness and 
speech trouble that are reported in some such instances. 
Nature never meant the child to be such a shifter. 
The sensible thing for us teachers to do is to make the 
right-hand bonds the stronger if we can do it with moderate 
effort; but if a pupil shows himself dominantly left-handed, 
and especially if nervousness or stuttering results when he 
attempts to use his right hand, then we should let him “get 
his hand in” the way he wants to. And further, we must 
stop regarding left-handedness as a disgrace or a life burden. 
The pure left-hander is just as skillful as the pure right- 
hander. Let us show the good sense of the baseball coaches, 
among whom the ‘‘south paw”’ is very welcome. 
1 Certain psychologists seem to have almost a phobia for the use of the word 
“center” in this way. In geography, we can speak of a railroad center or a 
commercial center without implying that no railroading or commerce goes on 
elsewhere, or that nothing but railroading and commerce go on in these centers. 
The term “speech center” does not imply that no other part of the brain has 
anything to do with speech, or that speech control is the sole business of this 
center.

  PRIMARY CONSTRUCTION WORK 137 
\ What bonds shall we build in primary handwork? — You 
remember that the ignorant man who borrowed his friend’s 
dictionary, thinking it was a novel, returned it with the 
remark, ‘‘There are many fine stories in it, but they some- 
how seem short and disconnected.’’ There are many fine 
experiences in primary handwork, and they are fortunately 
short and disconnected enough so that we can connect 
them with other subjects in a way most delightful. 
It is a spontaneous, expressive subject: that is, the blithe 
spirit of the child expresses itself through his two hands as 
the lark pours his full heart through his throat, ‘“‘in profuse 
strains of unpremeditated art.” His is the free purpose, 
and no matter what it is, it will serve our purpose; for 
what we want, foremost and chiefly, is to set his sensori- 
motor bonds into action, to get sense organ and brain and 
muscle to work together, and especially to teach him to 
manipulate, to codrdinate, to become handy with his 
hands. 
As the work does not demand long-drawn-out drill, we 
can make it a series of happy projects without much danger 
of introducing more than one difficulty at a time. And 
as it has no necessary order of its own, it can be a good 
servant of all seasons and subjects. We can carve paper 
turkeys at Thanksgiving, make candy boxes at Christmas, 
cherry trees and hatchets and valentines in February, and 
acircus in May. Play can be forwarded by making badges, 
doll cradles and hammocks, bean bags, game boards, driv- 
ing reins, pin wheels, toy money, ‘‘things” to ‘‘keep house”’ 
with or to sell from the toy store — and it is no small edu- 
cational service to enable a child to play happily. Other 
branches profit when we cut out paper animals and vege- 
tables in nature study, or letters to help teach alphabet and

138 THE CHILD’S MIND 
vocabulary, or when we call arithmetic to our aid in count- 
ing and measuring and laying out materials. Valuable 
language bonds are formed by naming materials and proc- 
esses, and by following directions accurately. The home 
profits when we construct a calendar, a pin-holder, a pen 
wiper, a match-strike, a mat. Through it all, of course, is 
developed taste in such work and appreciation for it, a readi- 
ness for the manual and industrial arts which are to follow. 
The use of such a myriad of sensori-motor bonds rouses the 
high-level centers: the child learns to ‘‘think in the con- 
crete,” to judge in advance what can and cannot be done 
with the strong-willed stuff found in the stubborn world 
outside of us. 
~The most common materials. Since the range of our work 
is almost unlimited, much will depend on the materials we 
can lay hands on in our neighborhood, and with the means 
furnished us. In the country, one can pick up many a 
treasure — straw, corn husks and cobs, acorns, pithy alders, 
birch bark, pine cones and needles, and other natural 
wealth, not elsewhere easily found. The country teacher 
should take pride in all this; and feel gratulation, rather 
than humiliation, because her work is different from that 
of the city. 
Merely to name the materials most commonly used will 
suggest a great deal that can be done with them. They 
are paper of various colors, cardboard, shoe pegs, beads, 
clay, sand, toothpicks, cord, yarn, spools, raffia, splints or 
willows, straw, leaves, and natural objects like potatoes and 
peanuts. Blue print paper and carbon paper come in 
handy, and old cigar boxes or chalk boxes, with brads and 
glue, can be made to serve, as in building airplanes and 
automobiles.
-P-A-G-E-149
  PRIMARY CONSTRUCTION WORK 139 
What related responses has the learner made already? — 
There are few parents who do not know at least a few tricks 
of construction, and it is to be hoped that there are few 
who do not enjoy teaching these to their children.! Luckily, 
too, children have such a strong constructive instinct that 
they often tear their toys to pieces to find out how they are 
made, and then put them together again — or try to. Fur- 
ther, the girl has probably made mud pies and cut out 
paper dolls. The boy has made — something or other, 
even if only a ‘‘kite” formed by tying a newspaper to a 
string. Quite possibly he has an album at home, perhaps 
made of wrapping paper, in which he has pasted pictures of 
his heroes and heroines. 
The kindergarten child is of course an ‘‘old hand” at 
construction work. 
Introducing one difficulty at a time. — As before said, the 
bonds are mostly sensori-motor, and usually in simple rela- 
tion. Some, however, lie in series or trunk line, and so 
form a ‘‘sequence” which the teacher must respect. For 
instance, teachers often dread the use of the ruler for 
measuring purposes during the first year; for the edge of 
it is so etched with small marks that children are badly 
confused by it. But begin with a ruler that has only the 
inch marks, and the game is easy. If such rulers are not 
furnished, it may be a good exercise to get thin wood, or 
1If my first teachers had asked me what I had made with my hands, they 
would have found that, either alone or with older help, I had made a “cart”’ 
out of a spool and a stick; a “flapper’’ consisting of a spool and a piece of 
paper so stuck on that it would flap when I forced my breath in and out; a 
button buzzer; a rattle from the dried windpipe of a chicken, with shot inside; 
a football from a pig’s bladder; a jumping-jack from the breast bone of a fowl; 
a potato popgun; strings of popcorn and wreaths of leaves; elderberry ink; 
whistles; slingshots; catapults; squawkers; and many other things. 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
  140 THE CHILD’S MIND 
even stiff cardboard, and make them. The half-inch mark 
can be added in connection with the teaching of one-half. 
Pasting, since it appears, with variations, in so many 
constructions, may be regarded as a trunk line bond. Ac- 
cordingly, it should have its own special exercise, which will 
be, in the teacher’s mind, a pasting drill, and in the mind of 
the pupil, a pretty little project in welding together strips 
of paper of various colors, perhaps left flat at first. In a 
later exercise these strips may be curled into links, the links 
interlocking to form a chain. 
The thoughtful teacher will usually have no difficulty in 
discovering which bonds must be fixed first in order to 
prepare the way for other bonds-to-be. 
Readiness. — It would be much harder to prevent readi- 
ness than it is to induce it. If in a child’s whole brain 
there are any cells that are always ready to work, they are 
the ones that control his muscles. Watch him roll, squirm, 
twist his body, and juggle, joggle, adjust together the 
things around him. The sap of life may not reach up to 
his arithmetic cells for years yet, but manipulation cells 
are early flooded with energy. 
When fuzzy and colored stockings are worn, children 
often pick off the fuzz and make bookmarks of it. They 
catch tricks from each other. He who can knit through a 
spool, or make a paper boat or cap or bird, or even interlace 
the papers from chewing gum into some new pattern, is a 
leader who quickly gathers followers and imitators. The 
ever-ready bonds of a number of instincts here unite their 
forces. 
Further, there is a seasonal readiness. The golden haze 
of autumn days, the glorious woods, and ripening gardens, 
put everyone in the mood for cutting out and drawing and
-P-A-G-E-151

   coloring such characters as ‘‘Billy Beet,” and “Tommy 
Tomato,” and all their many relatives. And think of 
Thanksgiving, and Christmas, and all the other dear days! 
Despite this readiness, let us not go at our exercises 
mechanically, merely passing out materials and giving set 
directions. Let us talk over our purpose, give the children 
a choice if we can, and indulge in visions of what we can 
do with the thing when it is done — where we can hang 
the paper chain, how we shall march with our soldier caps, 
to whom we shall send the Christmas card. 
And if you would have yourself and your class both ready, 
Teacher, make a specimen in advance, and bring it before 
their eager eyes. 
Exercise. — Rarely do ‘‘free expression”’ and ‘‘drill”’ meet 
and combine so happily as in handwork. Since there is 
always some kind of material in hand and something inter- 
esting is always being done with it, and since the funda- 
mental acts of skill, such as tearing and measuring and scissor- 
ing and pasting, recur again and again in new situations, the 
child need never feel any of the boredom of drill. 
Guidance is easy to give. Most of the results expected are 
not minutely accurate, especially at first, and time can be 
taken for coarse bonds to become refined without hurrying 
the process. External guidance may be necessary in teach- 
ing such acts as the holding of scissors — placing the thumb 
and the correct finger through the handle holes and starting 
the movement properly. Mass cutting should precede cut- 
ting to line, for the mass of the object being cut out is a 
better guide than a single line. Quite usually, guidance can 
be given by imitation, the teacher performing the exercise 
before the class and supervising the pupils as they follow, 
tep by step. After they have learned to read writing, or as

an exercise in silent reading (if it does not introduce more 
than one difficulty at a time), directions for an exercise may 
be placed on the blackboard. 
Things to do and make.' — Of course it is not our purpose 
to lay down a complete course of exercises, but suggestions 
may help to start the work. ‘One of the first and easiest 
things to do is to cut out pictures, as of fruit and vegetables, 
from catalogs and magazines. This may be followed by 
cutting out objects from blank paper; first with a sample in 
view, and then from memory. Other interesting and rather 
easy projects are the making of an envelope (perhaps to hold 
cuttings or other work), a simple bookmark, a box, a cut-up 
puzzle, a calendar, a simple booklet for pictures or stories, 
paper chains, badges of colored paper, soldier caps, pin 
wheels, Christmas and Easter cards, valentines, leaf chains, 
simple mats, and picture frames. These are followed by weav- 
ing, braiding, the making of coarse stitches of various kinds, 
and the beginnings of woodwork and mechanical drawing. 
An abundance of materials, such as plasticene and raffia, 
will make possible an abundance of other projects and 
processes. 
The group project, too, must be mentioned. If each pupil 
cuts out a tree, the united product will form a forest, the 
smaller and darker trees going into the background. A 
farmyard can be planned by having each child cut out one 
of the animals; a house can be furnished if each one will 
contribute a piece of (paper) furniture; or a whole village 
erected by letting every pupil “build” the kind of house he

would like to live in. Of course the children should know, 
from the beginning, the nature of their group project, and 
plan and work accordingly. 
The teacher’s self-starting equipment.— Not until tax- 
payers love their children more will teachers have all the 
material they need to work with. But homemade apparatus 
and a few cheap supplies will often help out wonderfully. 
To make subjects for mass cutting, one can use a potato 
or turnip. Cut it so as to form a large, flat surface, and onto 
this surface stick the paper form (perhaps that of a leaf 
which you wish to duplicate. With knife held perpendicular 
to the flat surface, cut round the edge of the pattern, perhaps 
a quarter of an inch deep. Next, cut away, to the same 
depth, all that portion of the potato or turnip which lies out- 
side the pattern, leaving the latter standing up in relief. 
Remove the paper pattern and you are ready to print. Ifa 
pad is needed, you can make one by wetting with ink a few 
thicknesses of cloth. Print on drawing paper as many copies 
of your pattern as your school needs for cutting-out purposes. 
To duplicate, in the form of a line drawing, any picture 
you may wish to have, place a sheet of carbon paper, carbon 
side down, on a sheet of glazed paper of good quality, and on 
top of the carbon paper the picture you desire to duplicate. 
Trace with a pencil all the lines you want to reproduce. 
Remove the carbon paper, and trace on the glazed paper, 
with hektograph ink, the picture which has been transferred 
to it. With the aid of the hektograph, draw off as-many 
copies as are needed. ! 
tTo make a hektograph, cook slowly together for two hours, as you would 
cook oatmeal, two ounces of sheet gelatine and one pint of glycerine. Pour 
this into a pan 9 by 12 inches and allow it to cool for several hours. 
The matter to be duplicated should be written or drawn with hektograph 
ink on fairly heavy glazed paper. After the ink has dried well, place the paper,

  144 THE CHILD’S MIND 
Simple designs for ornamental stamping purposes can be 
cut on the end of a cork, a rubber eraser, or on sticks that 
have cross sections of various shapes. 
It is very desirable that a paper cutter (photograph 
trimmer) be available, and an eyelet punch, with eyelets, 
helps greatly in making neat cards, booklets, etc. 
How handwork can help form bonds in reading. — When 
children are learning to recognize words, pictures are very 
helpful as keys to these words. Such pictures as those shown

Worst’s Construction Work for the Primary Grades, page 52.)           
in Figure 19 can be purchased from a supply house or made 
with the hektograph. The children may cut them apart, 
the words at first being left attached to the pictures. Later, 
the “game” is played by matching word and picture. 
When various groups of words are being built up, such 
as the -at family or the -ight family, these family names 
ink-side down, on the hektograph, and smooth it carefully with fingers or cloth. 
After a minute or so, remove it, and the matter to be duplicated will be found 
on the surface of the hektograph. Next, apply sheet after sheet of unglazed 
paper to the hektograph, pressing each down gently. The first ones should be 
removed after short contact, the later ones allowed to remain a little longer. 
When through using the hektograph, wash it off with sponge and lukewarm 
water.
-P-A-G-E-155
  PRIMARY CONSTRUCTION WORK 145 
and all the consonants that are to be placed with them can 
be presented on sheets, clipped apart, and then appropriately 
combined. 
The alphabet must be learned. In connection with 
reading, or spelling, or both, small letters and capitals may 
be presented in large, hektographed form and then cut 
out. It is also well for each child to make his own first little 
dictionary, that he may better understand and appreciate the 
large one. A booklet may be made for this purpose, and the 
words entered under the appropriate letters of the alphabet. 
How handwork may help to form bonds in other branches. 
— Picture number cards may be made or bought in 
sheets, showing one candle, two apples, three birds, and 
so on, with the corresponding figures, which are later to be 
cut loose and matched with the right pictures. Separate 
cards may be made holding (a) a domino face showing four 
spots, (b) four simple strokes, (c) the figure 4, (d) the Roman 
numerals for four, and the word “four.” These are to be cut 
apart and then re-grouped. Other numbers will of course be 
treated similarly, the cards being abstracted from among 
others with which, as time goes on, they are mixed more and 
more numerously. There will, of course, be many occasions 
for counting and measuring. 
In connection with history stories, we may cut out or build 
Indian tents, or weave a primitive mat. For language, we 
may make a story book, pasting in the illustrations. Geogra- 
phy takes us to the sand pile, if we are lucky enough to have 
one. We may even cut out musical notes and pin or paste 
them into a tune on a large staff. As for drawing, that is the 
very twin of construction work. 
Effect. — If our pupils undertake only that for which they 
are reasonably ready, Effect will usually take care of itself, 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  146 THE CHILD’S MIND 
for it will be happy and inviting. Never was a child, 
though (nor an artist, either), whose brain did not run ahead 
of his hand. Imagination promises more than the hand can 
perform. It would be unfortunate if this were not so. If we 
are still in the growing stage, dissatisfaction with our petty 
performances will lead to something larger. 
CLASS EXERCISE 
Let each one (or a selected number) demonstrate to the class 
some piece of cutting, weaving, folding, molding, or other bit of 
construction work which, it is expected, will prove interesting 
and perhaps useful in future teaching. 
If time permits, the demonstrator may apply the ‘‘Outlinc of a 
General Plan for the Forming of Any Set of Bonds,” stating just 
what bonds he wants to build, what related responses he assumes 
the learner is able to make, ete. 
FOR FURTHER STUDY 
1. Can you think of any reason why we should wish all people 
to be right-handed? Left-handed? Ambidextrous? 
2. If all children were left-handed, from which side ought the 
light to come in schoolrooms? Why? 
3. What experience did you have in construction work before 
entering school? 
4. Find cases in construction work where the bonds are related 
otherwise than simply, that is, in series or trunk line. 
5. How are a baby’s early movements related to his environ- 
ment? That is, does he try to get “into touch” with it? And if 
not, what is he doing, so far as his development is concerned? 
6. Give illustrations to show how a young child manipulates 
the objects of his environment before he tries to construct anything 
with them. 
7. Under what conditions, and with what object, would you 
permit or encourage inventive, original work in construction?

8. ‘Time can be taken for coarse bonds to become refined 
without hurrying the process.” Just how will this show itself 
in the child’s work? 
9. Show the value, from the standpoint of effect (and future 
readiness) of putting up samples of completed work in the school- 
room; of permitting them to be taken home, or played with. 
What instincts are appealed to by these means? 
10. Give original examples to show how construction work 
can be made to serve other branches. 
11. Suggest original group projects in construction work. 
12. Show how construction work can be used to encourage 
historical appreciation, such as, for instance, an appreciation of 
the difficulties faced by a Pilgrim housekeeper.

CHAPTER IX 
. PENMANSHIP 
EXERCISE. —a. Write the sentence, the quick brown fox jumps 
over the lazy dog, at natural speed, only taking pains to pause (and 
poise for the next flight) a long time, perhaps a second, every time 
the pen reaches the top of a letter or a part of a letter, but never 
when it is at the bottom of such a unit. For example, pause at the 
top of the small t, at the top of the loop of the h, at the top of the 
lower part of the h, at the top of the e, and so on. Write the 
sentence more than once, observing in the latter writings (especially 
if you are a good penman) whether your pen varies its speed in 
different parts of its course, and especially whether it travels over 
a short stroke at the same rate as over a long one. 
b. Write the same sentence as before, but this time make the 
long pause every time the pen reaches the bottom of a letter or 
part of a letter, and there only. Does this make any change in 
the general character and appearance of your writing? Any 
change in the forms of the letters? 
c. Find the most natural pausing points, occurring wherever 
they may, that divide the words or letters into rhythmical units 
composed of strokes that can be executed most easily together. 
Can you discover any relation between these rhythmical units and 
the forward motion of the hand or pen? Do all people divide the 
same words into the same rhythmical units, or is there an indi- 
vidual variation? 
State any conclusion you may reach with regard to this rhythmi- 
cal factor in penmanship. 
What is the ideal paper product? — Old writings, such 
as old letters and the signatures attached to the Declara- 
tion of Independence, show us that writing is not far dif- 
ferent now from what it was over a hundred years ago.

Practical people write a practical hand, whether in the 
last century or in this. We tell our pupils they may be 
Presidents some day; and in penmanship, at least, we are 
educating many of them past the presidential stage. 
Great documents are seldom signed by those who stick to 
the copybook, clerk-and-bookkeeper style of writing, nor, 
on the other hand, by those whose signatures are illegible. 
Writing is meant to be read — that much is clear; and 
if we are going to use it as a means of passing along ideas to 
our absent neighbor, he should be able to read it rapidly, 
somewhat as he does print. But if the reading were all, 
. there would be no writing; for the print we read in such 
quantities becomes more legible to us than any script, and 
we should all print with the pen. No, reader and writer 
meet each other in a compromise, the writer saving time 
and energy as compared with one who prints, and the 
reader losing it. The time and energy of both could be 
saved by using shorthand, but this is not yet conventional. 
It is sometimes said that script should not only be easily 
readable and readily writable, but should also be beautiful. 
But, in such matters as writing, the useful, serviceable, and 
familiar come to be beautiful and their opposites ugly. 
Here is a Japanese signature (Fig. 20) which may look fine

drawn in his favor. The Germans have kept, in much 
of their print, the old ornamented forms of the letters 
which the monks designed for use in making illuminated 
copies of the scriptures. But can any American studying 
the language say that the German letters have more beauty 
in his eye than those of the more practical English alphabet? 
What bonds do we want to form? — The ‘“‘situation”’ 
to which we want our pupil to respond is that of seeing, or 
hearing, or otherwise having in mind something that he 
wishes to write. The response is writing it legibly, easily, 
and speedily; and that means going through a very complex 
kind of movement; for the thirty bones and fifty muscles 
of the human writing machine, the hand and arm, must 
all be coérdinated in a way most wonderful. 
This movement, so far as its direction is concerned, is of 
two kinds, sometimes called (a) progressive and (b) projec- 
tive: (a) the pen must skate smoothly from side to side 
across the paper, and (b) at the same time it must move up 
and down the page so as to form the letters as it goes. 
In order to perform these movements, we should take 
good position. As taking position is simpler than writing, 
let us begin with that. 
Gross position. — Marksmen are trained to shoot in vari- 
ous positions, — standing, squatting, and prone (lying flat). 
And if we would have our pupil practice as he will perform 
in actual life, he must write in various positions, standing 
with notebook in hand, squatting with tablet on knee, 
bending over his table in the laboratory, etc. He must 
be able to adapt himself, as the writer of shorthand does, 
to all such situations. 
The standardized school position is shown in Figure 21. 
The writer sits hygienically, of course, in a well-adjusted

be necessary to turn somewhat to the left so as to have more room.

  152 THE CHILD’S MIND 
edge. The paper is placed at a convenient distance, a 
little to the right of the middle of the desk, and is held in 
place and shifted, from time to time as necessary, by the 
left hand. Its top and bottom edges make an angle of 
about 30 degrees with the farther and the nearer edges of 
the desk. Some teachers draw a line across the pupil’s 
desk from the lower left to the upper right corner (as shown), 
and have the pupil place his paper so that its lines run the 
same as this guide line. 
Position of writing arm and hand. — Most writers find it 
best to rest the right arm on the desk at a point a little to 
the right of a line drawn down through the middle of the 
paper, perpendicular to the line of writing (line ab in 
Figure 21). With this point (p) as a pivot, and with the 
paper turned at the angle described, it is easy for the hand 
to sweep across the paper and follow very nearly the line 
of writing. This progressive, sweeping movement is the first 
essential in producing good writing, and is the first thing to 
be taught as soon as the pupil can take correct position. 
The essentials of hand position can be summed up under 
four heads: ! 
1. Pronation of hand. The hand and wrist should be 
rotated toward the left far enough so that a ruler, laid 
across the top of the wrist, will make with the desk under 
the wrist an angle of less than 45 degrees. The old test, 
that of keeping the wrist so flat that a penny will ride on 
it while the writing is going on, requires more pronation 
than is necessary. 
2. Support of hand. The third and fourth fingers 
should carry the hand, serving as ‘“‘runners’”’ for it. The

expert often uses the nails of these fingers as a sliding rest. 
Pupils need not do this, nor need they be forbidden to let 
the wrist touch the paper, though it is desirable that it 
shall not. What is essential is that the hand shall not roll 
over to the right so far that contact with the paper causes 
the former to stick and “hitch” along instead of to glide 
and swing along. 
3. Contact of writing fingers with pencil or pen. The 
writing “fingers” are the thumb, index, and middle fingers. 
The index finger must touch the pen or pencil at a point 
lower than where the thumb touches it, and must make, 
at its middle joint, an angle greater than a right angle. 
The middle finger naturally touches at a point still lower, 
and may approach quite near the writing point. Pencil 
or pen holder should of course slant upward between thumb 
and index finger, and not between index and middle fingers. 
4. The grasp of the pencil or pen should always be loose. 
Figure 22 shows various positions of the hand that are 
permissible for children, and Figure 23 some inefficient 
positions that ought not to be allowed. 
Movement. — Three aspects of movement are important, 
(a) the progressive, or side-to-side movement already 
described, (b) the projective, or up-and-down movement by 
which letters are largely formed, and (c) rhythm, the varia- 
tions in speed from point to point, the poise and flight of 
the pen by which the writing is broken up into units of 
execution. The latter two require further study. 
(b) The big question here is whether to use-finger move- 
ment chiefly in the forming of the letters, or arm movement, 
the latter being the result of rolling the arm on its pad of 
muscular support near the elbow. The answer is, Use 
both, permitting either to predominate according to age, 
   
-P-A-G-E-166
   
         156 THE CHILD’S MIND 
ease of execution, personal preference, etc. Freeman, who 
used the motion picture machine to make an unusually 
careful study of writing movement, found that all writers, 
good and poor, and whether trained in arm movement or 
not, use finger movement to some extent. The poor 
writers distinguished themselves by using other movements, 
such as those of hand and wrist, in addition to employing 
the fingers and the arm. These ‘other movements” 
should be discouraged. A certain amount of side swing 
of the hand at the wrist, however, to aid the progressive 
movement, is found by some to be an advantage. 
Young children, many of whom cannot learn the arm 
movement even with training, should be allowed to form 
the letters with their fingers; but they must never be 
allowed to go hitching across the page as they do it. A 
smooth progressive movement is to be maintained from the 
beginning. 
(c) Rhythm in good penmanship is much like the rhythm 
in reading good prose. We start, and halt, and swing on 
again, and then run rapidly all the way through a long 
and uninterrupted cadence. Pauses (whether indicated by 
punctuation marks or not) divide the matter into rhythmi- 
cal units. Such units are not all of the same length, nor 
do all occupy the same time, nor do we read through them 
at a uniform rate of speed. But whereas a poor reader will 
have continual trouble with them, the skilled reader comes 
to feel that they are perfectly natural, and falls in with 
them without difficulty. 
So in writing: we may start off briskly (as in forming the 
small letter g), stop and swing back round a small loop, 
pause again, and then glide rapidly down its long and grace- 
ful tail and quickly up again to the finish. Pauses divide
-P-A-G-E-167
  PENMANSHIP 157 
the matter into rhythmical units. Such units are not all 
of the same length, nor do all occupy the same time, and 
the speed of the pen is never uniform. Freeman found 
that the poor writer moves in a jerky and irregular way, 
either failing to divide his writing into rhythmical units or 
doing it very awkwardly. The skilled penman spends a 
larger portion of his time pausing and poising than does 
the unskilled, but glides along, when he does move, with 
wonderful smoothness and regularity. 
Further, this difference in the execution of rhythmical 
units proves to be one of the sharpest dividing marks be- 
tween poor and good writers, and extends its influence 
even to the changing of the shapes of letters. The indi- 
cation is that rhythm (as here described) should be made 
an object of great attention in teaching. 
What not to teach. — Because so many useless and even 
harmful things are said and done in the name of penman- 
ship, it appears in place to point out a few bonds that 
need not be formed. 
To begin with, we are not trying to make expert penmen 
at any point below the commercial courses in the high 
school. If experts develop in the lower grades, we shall 
regard them as a happy by-product of our larger purpose, 
which is to give each child fair control of a good plain hand 
that he can write at the rate of a letter a second. We do 
not try, in the elementary school, to develop our pupils 
into expert public speakers or fine mathematicians, but we 
do try to teach them to read and “figure” well enough to 
meet the common demands of everyday life. And further, 
although in the everyday life of the outside world the pen 
may be mightier than the sword, it looks as if we shall have 
less use for both of them as time goes on. Thorndike has 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  
158 THE CHILD’S MIND 
made the very sensible suggestion of promoting to the 
typewriter those pupils who habitually write a fair hand at 
a fair rate of speed (Quality 13 on his Writing Scale, written 
at 60 letters per minute). It is increasingly true that those 
pupils who in after life are to do much writing or record- 
ing, even bookkeeping, will do it with a machine. 
This is a day of “‘minimum essentials” in all branches. 
To go on teaching expert penmanship to all pupils is a great 
a. waste. 
In the second place, we shall not insist on any one size or 
style or slant of writing. In one’s chirography there is a 
great deal of individuality when it is allowed to express 
itself.1 Lines may be thick or thin, shaded or unshaded; 
letters may be tall or short, ‘‘bold” or “timid,” round or 
otherwise. Extreme forward slant has proven most rapid; 
but vertical writing is most like print and so most legible, 
and can easily be produced, with the movement previously 
described, by pivoting the right arm a little farther out from 
the body. Even a back slant is not objectionable when 
written by some hands. 
In the third place, we shall not insist on details of position 
beyond what is essential to good movement. The fingers 
may slide down near the writing point if their owner feels 
any better about it — provided he does not smear himself 
with ink. Some of the fastest and best shorthand writers 
grasp the writing instrument very close to the point — and 
they still use a certain amount of arm movement. Neither 
1 Galton found that even between twins who closely resemble each other, 
one difference usually remains —a difference in handwriting. He recommended 
that graphologists who attempt to read personal traits from handwriting, 
should follow up this fact. Expert graphologists do read “character” from 
undisguised handwriting, with some success, although psychologists are unable 
to explain how it is done.
-P-A-G-E-169
  PENMANSHIP 159 
need the penholder point toward the right.ear, nor any- 
where else in particular; nor need it cross the first finger 
ahead of the knuckle joint, but may be allowed to sink a 
little into the hollow between thumb and first finger. 
Finally, we shall not insist upon “pure arm movement” 
wholly, either first, or last, or at any other stage. Such 
movement has been thought necessary for speed; but finger- 
movement writers are at least equally speedy. It has been 
argued that only through arm movement can one avoid 
cramp and excessive fatigue; but shorthand writers, who 
make large use of their fingers, can usually follow a speaker 
at his own pace for a longer period of time than any clerks 
or bookkeepers find it necessary to write without rest. 
And after all is said and done, a great many people, prob- 
ably the great majority, who have had long training in arm 
movement as the one movement, simply do not use it when 
they are intent on getting things down on paper. In a class 
in history of education, I recently observed forty-eight 
students writing. All had been trained in ‘‘arm movement”’ 
penmanship, and nearly all had taken a semester of normal 
school training in it and were prepared to teach it. Thirty- 
eight of them had been drilled in it before entering the 
normal school, and for a period averaging over four years. 
Yet only one was using arm movement purely, while three 
others showed traces of it, as one might say. This unhappy 
ideal of “pure arm movement” in our schools, gives to 
pupils’ writing a Jekyll-and-Hyde character, Hyde doing the 
writing in the writing class and Jekyll everywhere else. 
The good writer does not let his arm and his fingers 
quarrel as to which shall do the work. He expects them to 
odperate, like the members of a good office force. Pro- 
ressive arm movement he always uses, and a certain amount 
     
   
             
   
                         
  
-P-A-G-E-170
160 THE CHILD’S MIND 
of projective arm movement usually develops with practice, 
both in shorthand and longhand; but it should develop with 
mature muscular coérdination, and not be forced on young 
children. 
The left-handed pupil. — The general course to be pursued 
with the left-handed child has already been indicated (in 
Chapter VIII). Just because he is left-handed he needs 
special attention and help, for penmanship, the lighting of 
the room, etc., are planned for the right-handed majority. 
He must lay his paper ‘‘the other way” on the desk, so that 
his left forearm, instead of his right, will be perpendicular 
to the line of writing; and he must write toward himself 
instead of away from himself. 
This writing toward himself is awkward, and may prove 
difficult. We skate and dance symmetrically, to the right 
with the right foot, to the left with the left foot; but how 
about skating to the right with the left foot? In the same 
way, the right hand naturally makes the pen skate 
toward the right, and the left hand symmetrically skates it 
to the left. Fasten a sheet of paper before you with its 
hither edge parallel with the nearer edge of the desk. 
Take a pencil in each hand, and beginning with hands 
near together at the middle of the sheet, write your name 
rather deliberately with your right hand (moving toward 
the right, of course) and at the same time “‘tell”’ your left 
hand to move toward the left and duplicate every move 
made by its mate. (If you are left-handed, begin with 
hands wide apart and let them write toward each other, 
the left hand leading in the performance.) You will be sur- 
prised to find how easily you can write your name “twice 
at once.” The name as written by the odd hand is in 
“mirror writing.” i
-P-A-G-E-171
PENMANSHIP 161 
Mirror writing.1— Mirror writing is so called because it 
can best be read by holding it before a mirror. It is pro- 
duced naturally by about 1 per cent of left-handed children 
(being about one child in 2500) the very first time they try 
to write. This 1 per cent probably represents the extremely 
left-handed, who may be either boys or girls, bright or dull, 
defective in some way or normal in all ways. Further, 
these mirror writers seem likely to be children who are motor 
minded, that is, who are guided, in doing anything like 
writing, by the way it “feels” rather than by the way it 
looks. They reverse their figures as well as letters, and ap- 
parently learn to read their own writing, just as any one of 
us, if he takes up typesetting, has to learn to read the type 
“backward” as it lies in the composing stick or galley. 
This tendency toward mirror writing should, of course, be 
broken up. Parents and teachers should codperate to break 
it up just as soon as it appears, that is, when the pupil 
makes his first effort to write, or even when he scribbles in 
the wrong direction. Those teachers who have been most 
successful in handling this problem have taken pains to give 
strong guidance, both external and internal. The pupil’s 
hand is guided by the teacher’s own, and for as much of the 
writing period as possible. The child’s attention is also 
called to the way other pupils’ hands are moving as they 
write normally. Internal guidance consists in forming bonds 
between the way lines look and the way one moves in making 
them. Simple straight lines are made (with the left hand, 
of course, unless there is good reason for changing handed- 
ness), the first sloping toward the left, the next toward the 
    1 The facts of this discussion are drawn from Arthur L. Beeley’s excellent 
work, An Experimental Siudy in Left-Handedness. The reader is referred to 
his for further detail. 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  162 THE CHILD’S MIND 
right, and so on. Then simple curves are given, followed by 
ovals, e’s, m’s, etc., the mirror forms being omitted. As 
each new letter is taught, the teacher sees to it that he 
writes it in forward form, and not in reverse. To insure 
guidance in the teacher’s absence the pupil is told, for some 
time, not to write without a copy before him. If he were 
to write from memory, he would probably go wrong spon- 
taneously. 
What responses, related to writing, can the beginner 
make? — The beginner in writing cannot make so many 
responses as we could wish. The child cannot make as 
accurate movements, nor respond as quickly to a signal, as 
an adult. He can touch accurately, is more sensitive to 
contact (and probably to heat, cold, and pain) than an 
adult, because he already has all the nerves he will ever 
have, and they are spread out in a smaller skin (and body). 
But he lacks adult motor control, and he lacks the adult 
“sense of rhythm’ which, in the good writer, stands out 
so prominently. He naturally makes separate and distinct 
strokes rather than connected and flowing lines. Some sort 
of simplified printing would suit him better than a cursive 
hand in which the letters are joined together. In fact, some 
experts in child study would not have children taught to 
write till they are ten; and C. P. Zaner, an expert penman, 
says that ‘‘the child is not old enough to learn to write 
rightly until about ten years of age, and not old enough to 
master so difficult an art as writing until of high school 
age.”* 
Nevertheless, our beginner has already begun, very likely, 
* by scribbling for some years at home, perhaps practicing a 
bad hand position because his parents knew no better, or; 
1 Zaner Method Writing, Teachers’ Manual No. 1, p. 1.
-P-A-G-E-173
PENMANSHIP 163 
did no better, than to let him. If his reading lessons include 
script, the written letters are not altogether strange to him, 
though he probably has no bonds for them individually, but 
only for word-groups of them. Many children will be found 
to know the names of the letters when they enter school. 
And as soon as they begin to spell, the spelling and the writ- 
ing bonds ought to reénforce each other very happily. 
From old bonds to new, one difficulty at a time. — Writing 
is mainly a matter of sensori-motor bonds, and so it is 
easy. But these bonds are organized into inclusive units, 
and so it is difficult. Finished writing is a delicate and com- 
plex coédrdination of many movements, some of which are 
prominent in one person, some in another. There are tre- 
mendous individual differences. Consequently, we must not 
teach any one minutely organized type of writing as the only 
acceptable type, but insist only on those essentials which 
are common to all good types. 
Following our plan of taking first the bonds that are easiest 
to learn, that occur most frequently, and that prepare for 
‘the greatest number of other bonds-to-be, we shall consider, 
in the order named, Materials, Position, Progressive Move- 
ment, Rhythm, Letter Formation, and Self-Criticism.* 
Materials. On the old-fashioned farm, the beginning boy 
was usually given the poorest tool in the lot, on the ground 
that whatever he used would be ruined. Our child, in his 
struggle to write, must form no jerky, poor-pen, or rough- 
paper bonds. No unusual kind of material need be furnished, 
however. For the first grade pupil, some teachers prefer 
a pencil larger than usual. Pen and ink are used in some 
schools in the first grade. Most teachers prefer the pencil 
1 Substantially the order adopted by Freeman. See The Handwriting Move- 
ment, Ch. VI.
-P-A-G-E-174
  164 THE CHILD’S MIND 
until well toward the end of the second year, or early in the 
third. The ordinary “ink pen” is dauby in the hands of 
young children. If they could be furnished with well- 
behaved fountain pens with suitable points, not too fine, 
probably the pen could be used advantageously from the 
first. 
Position. This has already been described. Through 
several of the first lessons, attention will have to be centered 
quite largely on position of feet, body, arms, hand, pencil, 
and paper. Some teachers have a count or command for 
each one of these items which is used at the beginning of 
each lesson until the responses become automatic. Posi- 
tion, particularly the position of the hand, must not be too 
minutely standardized. Very early in the course, there 
ought to be a study of individual hand positions, with 
individual suggestions for individual needs. 
Progressive Movement. To teach both form (of letters) 
and movement at once is to introduce more than one diffi- 
culty at a time. Exercises in progressive movement are 
easy to execute; the movement is a part of all writing, and - 
so prepares the way for all the bonds-to-be. Many prefer 
to have the first work in writing done on the board. This 
usually consists of ovals, ete., followed quickly by the 
introduction of letters. Form is then taught at the board 
and progressive forearm movement at the seat, so as to 
separate the two difficulties. There is no harm in this 
method, as the pupil must learn blackboard writing some- 
time; but it is not essential to good paper work. Let the 
pupil practice as you want him to perform. 
The very first movements in writing may well be such 
as those illustrated in Figure 24. The hand at first merely 
swings from side to side, using the pivot point near the
-P-A-G-E-175
  PENMANSHIP 165 
elbow as a center. Then come the straight line, the wave, 
the jog, and at length, simple letters. At least a part of 
these exercises should be done to count or command, with

the rhythm strongly brought out. Similar exercises should 
form the introduction to every lesson that is given, for 
several weeks. 
Rhythm. The best way to introduce an exercise of this 
kind is by counting for the pupils, often putting words of  
-P-A-G-E-176
  166 THE CHILD’S MIND 
command in place of the numbers, as “Swing — jog — 
swing — jog — jog — swing.” The metronome and the 
phonograph are both useful, in the beginning, to relieve 
the teacher and enable her to make visits for inspection 
and aid. 
The nervous system is happiest and most effective when 
its impulses of energy are released with perfect regularity. 
This equality of time between beats cannot well be main- 
tained except in simple exercises. If it could, the rhythm 
of writing would be like the rhythm of poetry instead of 
the rhythm of prose. But by pausing at appropriate 
points, by making the downward-and-back strokes slowly 
and the forward-and-up strokes rapidly, and so on, we can 
bring into writing a ‘‘swing”’ that aids in letter formation, 
in movement, and in every other way. As we take up the 
more complex letters and combinations of letters, it is 
probably best to give up the use of the equal-time interval 
(together with the use of the metronome or other mechani- 
cal timer), and to substitute words of direction almost 
wholly for counting. In writing the, for example, one 
might lead his class with “Up, and up, down, up, and up, — 
cross,” pausing on the second wp, and on down, as one 
naturally would at the top of the loop and at the bottom 
of its finishing stroke. 
Letter Formation. There are four points in letter forma- 
tion — size, form, elements, and connections. 
Certain expert teachers of writing insist that young chil- 
dren should make large letters, not only at the board, but 
on paper. ‘‘Whether this is a justifiable pedagogical pro- 
cedure is questionable,” says Watson, ‘‘since by the time 
they reach the writing age fine finger movements are un- 
doubtedly possible: the child merely has to learn a double
-P-A-G-E-177
  
PENMANSHIP 167 
set of habits.”! Very likely the large writing is not only 
unnecessary but undesirable. 
It was thought by teachers of old time that when a child 
made a poor letter, he did it because his mental picture of 
that letter was incorrect, and so they centered their efforts 
on stamping the form of that letter on his mind. But 
letter form is comparatively easy to teach, especially since 
considerable individual variation in letter form is quite 
permissible so long as the writing is legible. It is the idea 
of the necessary movement that the child lacks, and also 
control of that movement. Each letter should be intro- 
duced by some kind of free movement exercise that naturally 
leads to it. 
Again, with their minds on form, the old teachers analyzed 
the letters into straight line, right curve, left curve, etc., 
and grouped the letters into classes according to their 
looks; whereas they ought to be classified according to the 
way they act, that is, according to the rhythmical units 
that stand out when we make them. For example, I should 
put a, d, h, q, t, and y into one rhythm-class (since they feel 
similar when I make them), , f, 7, 7, 0, v, and x into another, 
c, 7, 2, and perhaps s into another; k and p seem alike. I 
would even suggest introducing the classes of letters ac- 
cording to the simplicity of their rhythm plan. 
Capital letters and figures also need careful study. 
The connecting of letters compels the pupil to pass 
quickly, and sometimes confusingly, from the rhythm pat- 
tern of one letter to that of another which may have a 
different swing to it. Compare the smoothness of writing 
such a word as the, or had, with the jerks one must go 
through in writing park. Fortunately, in writing connected

-P-A-G-E-178
168 THE CHILD’S MIND 
letters, one can nearly always pause and poise when the 
pen has reached its highest point in any letter or unit part 
of a letter. The pupil should have his attention called 
very forcibly to this, and repeatedly. 
Four letters, 6, 0, v, and w (together with one form of r), 
need special attention; for the stroke which finishes them 
and connects them with the letter following does not start 
from the base line, but from a point whose height equals 
that of a small letter. These four bonds cause special 
trouble and need special drill. ; 
Self-Criticism. — We ‘“‘go on to perfection”’ fastest when 
we realize just where our imperfections are and try to 
remedy them. The pupil should see a good model before 
him, either flowing from the teacher’s fingers or furnished 
otherwise, and learn to criticize his own product with re- 
gard to the smoothness of his lines, the straightness of the 
line of writing, the shapes of the letters, their slant (espe- 
cially whether they all lean the same way or seem to be 
“dancing a jig’), the spacing between them (particularly 
as to whether it is uniform), and speed. We can keep 
these six points in his mind by leaving on the board for a 
time an outline something like the following: 
moothness 
traightness 
S hape 
lant 
pacing 
peed 
The child’s writing powers seem to develop with regu- 
larity; for measurements reveal continuous progress in 
both form and speed through the whole elementary school 
period.
-P-A-G-E-179
PENMANSHIP 169 
Readiness. — For writing in general, readiness is not a 
difficult problem, as children have ever-ready bonds for 
scribbling and for the writing movement; besides the idea 
of communicating thoughts on paper in a way that is a 
mystery to the ignorant has the charm of magic about it. 
In connection with lines like those that form the back of 
the fish (Fig. 24), Freeman uses the rhyme, 
To and fro sway the trees, 
Bending in the passing breeze, 
and for similar lines such as those that form the under part 
of the fish, the rhyme, 
How do you like to go up in a swing, 
Up in the air so blue? 
Playful ideas like these, the making of “engine smoke” 
(repeated ovals), and so on, keep things moving happily 
during the brief period before letters and words and short 
sentences can be introduced. 
One of the most difficult points is to get the pupil to do 
good writing, not only in the writing lesson, but in all 
lessons. In the early grades, children should not be assigned 
a task that will require writing when the teacher cannot 
supervise it, and all dictation should be given very slowly. 
Pupils under ten years of age ought not to write much. In 
higher grades, many teachers have gotten good results by 
telling pupils that their mark in writing would be made up, 
one half from the writing lessons and one half from the 
writing done in other lessons. 
Measurement of the writing by some standard scale (see 
below), and the challenge to “beat the last batch” are 
strong means of motiving. 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
    170 THE CHILD’S MIND 
Nor will the tactful teacher be above permitting the use 
of colored inks when they can be procured. Do you recall 
how it used to thrill you when you were permitted to write 
from the red bottle? 
Guidance. The best guidance of all is the teacher’s 
writing, together with her showing, such as taking hold of 
the pupil’s hand, adjusting it into good position, moving it, 
swinging his arm, ete. 
To teach form, Montessori used sandpaper outlines of 
the letters; Ellsworth used brass plates with the letters 
formed in grooves which guided the pupil’s pencil; and 
many teachers have well-made letters retraced again and 
again. This last is best, for extensive teaching of form 
without attention to movement and rhythm is wasteful. 
Some have the pupil trace the letters in the air. 
Exercise. — The time given to writing is usually fifteen 
or twenty minutes a day through several grades. Investi- 
gation seems to show, however, that the excellence of the 
product does not depend so much on time as on concen- 
trated attention and the teacher’s determination to get 
results. In general, attention to writing gets good writing 
and neglect begets scribbling. 
Special exercises may be necessary at times for special 
purposes. For instance, if pupils do not separate the 
writing fingers from the ‘‘runners,’”’ it may be well to have 
them curl the ring and little fingers under, thrust out the 
other three so as to meet at a point near the tips, and make 
repeatedly a movement “‘like a chicken picking up corn,” 
only not so jerky. This is a decided aid to projective finger 
movement. 
If progressive arm movement and rhythm are well taught, 
and the hand is kept in good position, a certain amount of
-P-A-G-E-181
PENMANSHIP 171 
projective arm movement — all that is desirable — will in- 
cidentally develop in time. No special exercise for ‘‘arm 
movement,” as this is commonly called, seems to be desir- 
able. 
To facilitate letter joinings and make sure that all bonds 
are practiced, pupils may be asked (if the exercise does not 
prove tedious) to write aa, ab, ac, on through the alphabet, 
ba, bb, bc, on though the alphabet, and so with all the fol- 
lowing letters. This may also help, at the proper time, in 
the learning of these letters, both as to form and name. 
Effect.— The method described in this chapter is especially 
wholesome in its effect; for it does not require strained posi- 
tion, nor impossible movement, nor the attainment of an 
ideal too far beyond the Alps. If we go only so fast as our 
class is ready to go, making due allowance for individual 
variation, the tonic of success will be felt from the outset. 
We can of course mount samples of best writing, and in 
other ways ‘‘recognize and reward the right response.” 
There is no more reason for using banners, buttons, pins, 
special diplomas, and other paraphernalia in this branch 
than in any other. But very likely it would be wise to follow 
the Boy Scouts and have a Merit Badge for high class work 
in every branch. 
Testing essential bonds. — Various scales have been de- 
vised for measuring the quality of handwriting.t The first, 
and one of the simplest, was that of Thorndike (published 
in 1910). It consists of a number of different styles and quali- 
1The Thorndike Scale can be obtained from the Bureau of Publications, 
Teachers College, New York City. The Ayres Scale is furnished by the Russell 
Sage Foundation, New York City. Strangely enough, neither of these widely 
used scales contains the figures; yet these are more important, in many places 
of business, than the letters.

ties of actual writing, arranged in order from best to poorest 
through a total of eighteen steps. Speed is commonly 
measured in terms of letters written per minute. 
Any sample of writing is rated by simply moving it along 
past the different standard grades until that.one is found 
which it appears to match most closely. Children can grade 
their own writing fairly well, and should be encouraged to 
do so from time to time, as the noting of progress, or the 
lack of it, constitutes a strong stimulus to improvement. As 
a further guide and stimulus, Freeman has provided a 
“Chart for the Diagnosis of Faults in Handwriting,’’! for use 
by teachers and pupils. The employment of means of this 
kind has been known to raise considerably the general level 
of writing throughout whole school systems in a compar- 
atively short time. 
The standards in speed and quality commonly quoted 
for each grade are as follows: 
Grade ee eee lays Vo OVE oS Vals Vane 
Speed (letters per minute) 20 31 38 47 57 65 75 83 
Quality (Thorndike scale) 65 7.5 82 87 93 98 104 10.9

The writing of the future. — Various investigators believe 
that some form of shorthand could be adapted to general use 
in a way that would greatly simplify the matter of hand- 
writing. This is probably true. Very likely, writing could 
be made simpler to learn and more rapid to write. At the 
same time, it could be made phonetic, so that instead of 
writing words as they are spelled, we should write them as 
they sound. As one result of this, the subject of spelling 
would practically be wiped out of our curriculum.

CLASS EXERCISE 
Analyze the small letters of the alphabet and put them into 
classes according to the rhythmical units! that appear in each. 
A good way is to begin with a, noting the kind of rhythm 
that appears in it when it is skillfully and quickly written, and 
place it at the head of a column. Next try 6: it has a different 
rythmical swing, and so is placed at the head of another column. 
So with c. D proves to be like a in rythmical make-up, and so 
is placed under it. H heads a new column, while f should probably 
be classed with 6. In this way, work on through the alphabet. 
Not all may agree as to the units of execution that appear in 
each letter. In such cases, let the majority (or plurality) rule 
as to how the letter shall be placed in a class with others. 
Which class of letters has the simplest type of rhythm? Which 
the most difficult to execute? Grade the classes in order as be- 
tween these two extremes. Would you teach the letters in this 
order? . If not, in what order, and why? 
If time permits, classify the capital letters, and also the figures, 
in the same way. Where there is more than one type of capital, 
use a very simple type. 
FOR FURTHER STUDY 
1. What has been the history of your own development in 
handwriting? How, if at all, do you wish your training had been 
changed? 
2. What shall we do about the many extra movements that a 
beginner nearly always makes when he writes? If they are not of 
an offensive nature (such as sticking out the tongue), do you see 
any objection to them? 
3. Watch some good writers as they pass from the left side of 
the page toward the right. Does the penholder remain parallel 
to its first position, or change its angle, pointing now to left and

now to right? What does the good writer do to keep the line from 
curving down at the end, roll his hand to the left (pronate it), 
bend his wrist, or what? 
4. Try shading your letters rather heavily and see whether it 
interferes with your usual writing rhythm. In the teaching of 
writing, shall we say or do anything about shading? 
5. Get some standard writing scale and measure your writing 
by it. Are the speed and quality of your writing such as a teach- 
er’s should be? (You can get the speed by writing steadily for 
two or three minutes and then counting the letters written. How 
many per minute?) If not, can you make them so? 
6. Try whether it is true that you can write various slants of 
writing, with the same general movement, by placing the elbow 
at different distances from the body. 
7. Some think it discouraging, and others think it inspiring, 
for a child to have before him the perfect copper plate writing 
usually found in copy books. What has been your experience 
in regard to this matter, and what do you think about it? Why? 
8. Certain systems of measuring the excellence of writing 
require that posture and movement be graded, as well as quality 
and speed. Is there any more reason for grading posture in 
writing than in reading? Or is good posture to be taken for 
granted, as a matter of hygiene, in all branches? What per cent 
of total teaching time can a teacher be expected to spend in meas- 
uring results, and what per cent should he spend in getting results 
to measure? 
9. To what extent should business men be allowed to fix the 
standard of writing which the schools shall be expected to main- 
tain? 
10. If a pupil can produce very good writing at a speed of (say) 
70 letters per minute, do you care by what method he produces 
it so long as he is not violating the laws of health? 
11. “The conditions of good writing are several, and rarely 
does one writer exhibit them all. Good writers usually have some 
unfavorable characteristics and poor writers are not usually so

hopeless as to have no redeeming traits.” (Frank N. Freeman, 
The Handwriting Movement, p. 31.) 
What does this indicate with regard to individuality in writing? 
12. Speed and quality of writing do not interfere with each 
other in the lower ranges of the two; but they tend to crowd each 
other out in the higher ranges, great speed interfering with the 
best quality and vice versa. What shall be our ideal? 
13. Do you know of any who have had very little training in 
penmanship but are nevertheless good writers? Any who have 
had long tuition and practice and still write poorly? What does 
this show as to native ability? Do you think there are any who 
never can learn to write well? 
14. Show how “touch writing,” similar to touch typewriting, 
the eye of the performer being kept on his copy, would be useful, 
to one who was going to spend his life addressing envelopes, 
making copies of documents, ete. How would you train a pupil 
in order to make him skillful in it? 
15. What practice should a pupil have, before he leaves school, 
in writing and thinking at the same time? Why?

Exercises. — 1. Count all the silent letters in the words of 
any good sized page or column of solid print. Find the whole 
number of letters, sounded and silent, in this page or column. 
(You can get the whole number roughly by finding the average 
number of letters per line in the first few lines and then multiply- 
ing this average by the total number of lines.) What per cent 
of letters are silent? Results for the class may be combined. 
One investigator finds that more than one half of all the errors 
made by children in spelling consist in leaving out silent letters 
where they should be or putting them in where they ought not to 
be. What can we do about it? 
2. Turn to a foreign dictionary, such as the French or Span- 
ish, and select six fairly long words to learn to spell. If you have 
no foreign dictionary handy, take six English words of about three 
syllables and write their spelling backward, as otatop; or select 
some strange words, quite hard ones, from the English dictionary; 
or, combine these ways of making up a brief word list. 
Learn the spelling of these words, watching how your mind 
works as you do it. What do you want to know about a new 
word? How do you feel toward it? How would you want a 
teacher to proceed in teaching it to you? Do you care to use it 
in a sentence? Can you write it easily as soon as you can spell 
it aloud? Try to discover and answer other pertinent questions 
about your learning process. 
How much that is true for you probably holds true for 
children when you teach them to spell?   Our fashionable spelling. — Words and clothes have both

Martha Washington. Fashion has had a great deal to do

with it, in both cases, while reason has often been shoved 
aside. In 1783, Noah Webster brought out his American 
Spelling Book (the one called ‘‘blue-backed” — though 
the front of it probably looked bluer to a child than the 
back did), and in 1827 his Dictionary of the English Lan- 
guage. These have both helped to put spelling into uniform. 
In fact, spelling has become so strongly standardized that 
there is no room left for individuality. Many of the original 
spellings that children invent are much better than those 
in the dictionary, but there is no way of enforcing them. 
A word will no more let you change its appearance than 
a soldier will let you pin anything on to his uniform. 
But there might be a better uniform. 
Which words shall we spell? — There are over 500,000 
words in the English language, and they all have to be 
spelled some way; but fortunately, no one has to spell them 
all, and no one person can. The old-fashioned spelling book 
went as far toward being a dictionary as it dared, con- 
taining in some cases as high as 15,000 words. The modern 
teacher does not try to teach more than about 200 words in 
a semester, or a total of 400 words a year. This means that 
unless we give more time to spelling than we now do (usually 
about 20 minutes a day), we can not hope to teach a child 
all the words he will ever use. But we should not need to, 
any more than we need to help him get, as he goes through 
the eight grades, all the dollars he will ever use. We must 
teach him how to master both words and dollars, so that 
he will always have at his command a reasonable number 
of each. 
What bonds shall we build? —Since the unabridged 
speller is no longer popular, what spelling bonds shall we 
form? 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
178 THE CHILD’S MIND 
Those that will be used most, surely. And which are 
they? 
To answer this question, quite a number of investigators 
have compiled lists composed of the words found most 
frequently in such writings and printings as business letters, 
newspapers, magazine articles, the Bible, classic authors, 
family correspondence, and compositions written more or 
less spontaneously by school children. One of the best 
known of these now rather numerous lists is that of “the 
thousand commonest words,” which Leonard P. Ayres pre- 
pared by combining the results of four other studies.' He 
reached the surprising conclusion that nine words reappear 
so frequently as to constitute one fourth of all we write. 
The most common ten words, named in the order of their 
frequency, are the, and, of, to, I, a, in, that, you, and for. 
Fifty words with their repetitions, all of them of one syl- 
lable, make up one half of all we commonly put on paper. 
An extensive examination of children’s vocabularies indi- 
cates that the mastery of 4000 or 5000 words will enable 
the average child to say neatly about all he commonly 
needs to say; and spelling experts have concluded that 
the duty of the elementary school is done when it has fitted 
up a child with a capital of some 3000 or 4000 well-selected 
words and taught him the use of the dictionary. 
Where can we find the best words? — If you had to make 
the acquaintance of some three or four thousand people only, 
you would want to know that they were worth while, the 
best in the country. Similarly, a child can not afford to 
spend his time hobnobbing with words of low caste. The 
best place to find “‘the four hundred,” or the four thousand,

Foundation, New York City.

or whatever number we wish to teach, is in a modern speller. 
Some teachers prefer to make up their own lists, and they 
ought to do so to the extent of supplementing the general 
list with local and special words and correcting grade 
errors;! but trial shows that beyond this, teacher intuition 
is not keen enough to detect the words that most need to 
be taught — nor the words that need to be taught most, 
that is, those that are most difficult for pupils to learn. 
Further, among the various word lists found in numerous 
good spellers or elsewhere, no one is sacred or supreme. 
To find the three thousand best words is like finding the 
three hundred best books. <A certain limited number will 
always be included; but beyond that, election is open to 
all. There is something much more important to do than 
to strain after the impossible one best list. 
Situation and response. — The ‘‘more important” thing 
is to teach the pupil to respond successfully to all spelling 
situations. The spelling situation consists in the would-be 
speller’s taking his pen, or his typewriter, or a sign-painter’s 
brush, or a printer’s composing stick, or a linotype machine, 
or a rubber stamp printing outfit, or some other instrument 
of expression, in order to say something in letters. The 
response consists in putting into each word just the letters 
that belong there, and in arranging them in the right order. 
The courageous, determined speller achieves this by making 
an attack on each new word as it approaches (if he expects 
ever to have use for it) no matter how thick its ancient 
1 Courtis gives a minimum list of essential words to be mastered with great 
thoroughness, and a list of supplementary words to be mastered, but not so 
automatically as the minimum list. In addition, each teacher spends one day 
a week on local and special words. See Teaching Spelling by Plays and Games, 
by 8. A. Courtis.

180 THE CHILD’S MIND 
armor of silent letters may be, and by taking it prisoner, 
perhaps in his notebook but certainly in his head. To in- 
sure success, he makes an alliance with a word book, usually 
a dictionary, attaches it to his Intelligence Department, 
and summons it to meet every emergency. 
It is not merely a spelling list, but a spelling habit that 
we want to leave with these young users of letters. Society 
makes it our duty to build up in our pupils a “‘spelling con- 
science” so keen that whenever a misspelled word flows 
from the pen, they will regard that pen as having stabbed 
and mutilated the English language. This spelling habit 
and spelling conscience both require the support of the 
dictionary. In the upper grades, the dictionary bonds 
should be practiced upon until the pupil comes to feel that 
his word book is a kind of brain annex. 
Stimulus and reaction. — More narrowly, and in the case 
of each particular word, just what is the stimulus and what 
the reaction that we want to establish? 
At first, and in school, the stimulus may seem to be 
“teacher pronouncing a word,” and the reaction, ‘‘pupil 
spelling it orally or in writing’; but at last, and out of 
school, the stimulus is usually ‘thinking of a word,” and 
the reaction, ‘writing the letters of that word in order.” 
This means that the stimulus for the spelling bond has been 
taken inside the brain, that is, has become what is called in 
psychology a stored stimulus, — stored in the brain cells. 
In other words, when we sit thinking, as in writing a letter, 
one bond in the brain sets off another. 
But what does ‘thinking of a word” mean, and how do 
words get inside our heads so that we can think of them? 
In general, there are, for words, two roads leading into the 
brain and two roads leading out. The roads in are through
-P-A-G-E-191
SPELLING 181 
eye and ear: by looking at words and by hearing them, 
we form eye bonds and ear bonds for them, so that we can 
“see them in the mind’s eye,’ form mental pictures of 
them, or hear them in the mind’s ear, when they are no 
longer in our presence. 
The word-roads that lead out of the brain run through 
mouth and hand: we speak words and we write words, and 
both the speech organs and the writing muscles report 
back to the brain every least thing they do. In this way 
we acquire very complex motor bonds (as we might call 
them) with stimuli stored in the brain. 
So it comes about that we can think of a word in four 
ways: how it looks, how it sounds, how we speak it, and 
how we write it — or we may combine these ways. As I 
write this on my typewriter, I find that the successive words 
seem to speak themselves within me. The next word that 
I want to write, floats, floats before me as a kind of 
little printed patch about so and so long, with the letter f 
sticking up at the beginning and the rest indistinct until I 
turn attention to each letter separately; but these eye bonds 
quickly start hand bonds. The word turns into a series of 
movements, the hand movements necessary to write floats 
on my machine, with the f-movement (that of the left index 
finger) leading off strongly. The word, for me, now has be- 
come a movement pattern. 
The most common stimulus seems to be ‘‘inner speech.”?— 
By inner speech is meant “‘saying a thing inside of us,” or 
at least making a movement toward saying it. The ear is 
connected very directly with the vocal organs, and largely 
controls them. The best voiced person would not be able 
to sing if he had been born deaf. Further, children hear 
and speak words for years before they are able to read and 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
        182 THE CHILD’S MIND 
  write. They (like many grown people) ‘‘think aloud,” talk- 
ing to themselves, and the inner talk is commonly kept up 
after lip movement and voice are inhibited. When reading 
begins, the words are, for a long time, the very ones the 
child has been hearing and speaking: eye bonds are con- 
nected with ear-voice bonds. It is no wonder that (as 
Huey found) reading is characterized by inner speech. 
Then, too, inner speech is an especially appropriate stimu- 
lus to spelling, for the pronunciation of a word is invariably 
the key to some of the most important letters that com- 
pose it. 
When you flash a strange word before a learner, his first 
question (at least as soon as the word means anything to 
him) is likely to be, “‘How do you pronounce that?” In 
studying and reciting spelling, pupils should be taught to 
use their lips (but not necessarily their voices) and to use 
them with a will, shaping with energy and precision first 
the whole word and then its separate letters. 
What bonds are necessary to spell a word? — To under- 
stand spelling in all its glory, we must not think merely of 
a single-track bond running from eye or ear to vocal cords 
or hand. There are many supporting bonds, as we may 
call them, sensori-motor paths that underlie and help or 
hinder the letter process. To make this clear, suppose you 
take a spelling lesson in Europe. 
A spelling lesson in German.— You are in a German 
school, and the teacher places before you Kahu and Sdlof and 
@bcfmaunt. Let us suppose you are so unsophisticated (as 
children often are with our English words) that you not 
only do not recognize these funny looking collections of let- 
ters, but you have not even had experience with the ob- 
jects they refer to. Well, then, the teacher had better take    
 
-P-A-G-E-193
  SPELLING 183 
you out for a ride in a Sahn (boat), let you explore the Sdjlop 
(castle) and have you meet the Gidea (nobleman), at the 
same time using these words many times and in many dif- 
ferent connections. After that you must learn the German 
letters by sight, and their names, and the various sounds 
they and their combinations may stand for. Then learn the 
order of letters in these three words, and you can spell them. 
But your troubles are not yet over, for the teacher wants 
you to write your spelling lesson. You must learn the 
German script. This will cost you some effort, and as it 
introduces more than one difficulty at a time, you will 
often misspell words that you ‘“‘really know how” to spell. 
Perhaps the teacher will scold you for carelessness. Besides, 
this elaborate script will change the appearance of the words 
you have by now learned to recognize in print: ®ajn and 
Sthlof and Cdelmann will now appear as Buf and Ufplefl 
and Zixtwanuc 
A complete outfit of spelling bonds. — From the beginning 
of experience, then, to the last letter in the spelling of a 
word, the following connections are necessary. 
1. Bonds for the object (action, or what not). 
2. Bonds between object and word, and between word 
and object. 
3. Bonds for word as a whole, heard, seen, and spoken. 
4. Bonds for letters of the alphabet, seen, named, and 
written. 
5. Bonds between each letter and its sound, or sounds. 
6. Bonds-in-series for letters-in-order, especially written. 
What responses can the child make already? — When 
spelling starts, say at the middle of the first year in school, 
the pupil has connections of the first three kinds, and usu-

  184 THE CHILD’S MIND 
ally quite a number of the fifth. In lower grades (I should 
say up to the seventh), the words for spelling should be se- 
lected from those that pupils already know in a general way: 
that is, they should already know the meaning of each word 
(bonds of the first and second classes), and they should 
have seen it often in print, and heard it and spoken it in 
conversation or class work (bonds of the third class). There 
comes a time, however, when it is foolish to limit the study 
of spelling to the words children have been found to use in 
writing letters or compositions: the question is, rather, what 
words would they use if they were made masters of them. 
There comes a time when a child is as eager for new words — 
often long and impressive ones — as a girl is for new dresses. 
Not to teach a word until children have been found trying 
to use it is to establish a situation like that of the Irishman 
who was struggling to pull on a pair of new boots: ‘Be- 
gorrah!”’ he exclaimed, ‘‘I’ll niver be able to get these boots 
on till I’ve worn thim a toime or two!” 
Our modern method of teaching reading, which leaves the 
names of the letters untaught, throws the teaching of the 
alphabet into the first grade spelling class. If you read any 
foreign language that has also a ‘“‘foreign”’ alphabet, such as 
German or Greek, you know that you can go on reading it 
long after you have forgotten the names of the letters, and 
even when you have so far forgotten their shapes that you 
cannot draw them well. Even in grades several numbers 
beyond the first, it is worth while to review the alphabet 
before beginning to spell and to use the dictionary. It is not 
difficult to find fifth and sixth grade pupils who do not know 
the alphabet, at least in dictionary order. 
Further, if words are to be written, the pupil must be able 
to recognize, name, and execute the written letters easily.
-P-A-G-E-195
SPELLING 185 
This should be taken care of in the writing class; but with 
the overspeedy ideal of writing and the faddish methods of 
teaching it that are abroad in the land, the writing process 
is a serious interference with the management of all matter 
that must be written, and it probably remains an interfer- 
ence up to the seventh grade or beyond. 
“About fifty per cent of the poor spellers will be poor 
writers also,’ says Courtis. There is evidently some con- 
nection between them. He advocates, for many of these, 
practice in writing legibly as a means of making their bad 
spelling good.! 
In bonding together the appearance of a letter and its 
sound (or sounds), the teaching of reading has helped 
greatly toward spelling. Most methods of teaching reading 
embody at least some study of phonics. By the time our 
little first-grader begins to spell, the sight of a consonant 
will usually suggest its appropriate sound, vowels are likely 
to suggest — something at least; and he will also be able 
to give the sounds of a number of phonograms, combina- 
tions of letters that carry a certain sound, as tion, ain, ead, 
— trunk line bonds that help in the spelling of many words. 
But we must keep in mind that these reading-bonds work 
from sight to sound; and we must now form the connections 
that run from the sounds of words and letters to their 
appearance, to their names, and to the making of them in 
script (as you had to learn the German script). 
Ready-made responses in upper grades. — If we dictate a 
spelling lesson, before it is studied, to any grade beyond the 
first, we find that some of the words are already known; and 
that the pupils can ‘‘almost spell” some of those they miss. 
Pupils learn, of themselves, to spell more words than the

        THE CHILD’S MIND 
  186 
teacher teaches them. Words already known need no atten- 
tion, and words partly known need very little. 
Tidyman’s plan ' is to dictate to the class, each Friday, all 
the words in the following week’s work. They are then 
spelled back to the children (at least in all grades above the 
third), who mark the errors. The teacher next asks how 
many missed each word, and counts the hands raised. As 
the children have been told that this has nothing to do with 
their ‘‘mark,” there is no temptation to cheat; but to insure 
care and accuracy, the papers may occasionally be checked 
by the teacher. The number of those who miss any word, 
written over the number of pupils present, in the form of a 
fraction, gives what may be called the index of difficulty of 
that word for that class. If desired, all these indices of diffi- 
culty may easily be converted into per cents. The teacher 
then concentrates her efforts on the words that have the 
highest index of difficulty, and each pupil concentrates on 
individual difficulties. Tidyman states that this plan has 
been used for years in his school, and that it takes no more 
time than the ordinary method. 
It would probably be better, in giving such a preliminary 
test, to tell the pupils not to write the word at all unless they 
were fairly sure they could spell it correctly. 
How spelling bonds are related to each other. — To learn 
to spell a word is to form a series of bonds for its letters, so 
that each letter sets off the next one. If letters and sounds 
corresponded, one for one, in the English language, as they 
nearly do in Spanish and Italian, spelling would be éasy for 
most people. But as it is, learning to spell such a word as

    SPELLING 187 
sounds, the task of learning them is much like that of learn- 
ing successions of numbers. Fancy yourself committing such 
combinations as 7-2-8, 7-3-9-0-3-1-4, ete., and you will 
see clearly just what an illogical and meaningless job un- 
phonetic spelling is. 
As already indicated, some trunk-line bonds are found; 
and it is very likely that not enough use has been made of 
them. We find the combination ough in cough, dough, rough, 
trough, tough, and some other words. Why not group all 
these words together, even if they do not all sound alike? 
Nevertheless, teachers of spelling must realize, and real- 
ize very keenly, that each word is largely an independent 
series-bond. A child may know well how to spell a thou- 
sand words and still not get, from all this bulk of knowledge, 
very much help as to the spelling of word No. 1001. 
Do rules help? — In view of what has just been stated, 
it is evident that we cannot bring English spelling under 
the control of a few high-level bonds, called rules. Rules 
there are, but they are fearfully and wonderfully made, and 
with such numerous flaws in them that many exceptions 
slip through. The best practice seems to sanction the teach- 
ing of only a very few rules, and nearly all of these relate 
to the endings of words, that is, to the forming of plurals 
and to the changes made in adding suffixes. The children 
should be led to inspect these things until they discover that 
words, like tadpoles, show some regularity in the way their 
tails behave. They can then roughly state the rule and 
appreciate the better, book statement of it. 
The grouping of words for teaching. — Since the list of 
most-used words has been sufficiently standardized for 
practical purposes, we have two problems remaining — 
the assignment of words to grades, and the arrangement
-P-A-G-E-198
188 THE CHILD’S MIND 
of words within a grade so as to make them easy to 
teach. 
Our principles of teaching first the bonds that are easiest 
to learn, that occur most frequently, and that prepare for 
the greatest number of other bonds-to-be, give us some help. 
Grades one and two should be characterized by words that 
are easy to spell from sound and that are frequent in the 
pupils’ use. Something can be done in the way of prepar- 
ing for other bonds-to-be: day naturally precedes daily, 
daylight, etc. But one can learn the spellings of words in 
any order. 
Both teachers and textbook makers disagree greatly in 
the matter of assigning words to grades. A study of five 
of the leading spelling books revealed the fact that not 
more than 19 per cent of the words in any one grade were 
common to more than two spellers. Some investigators 
have tried to find in which grade children actually do use 
the words first in their writing; but much depends on what 
words they have been taught and can use, and which they 
are encouraged to use. Beyond what common sense can 
readily tell us as to where a word belongs in the grades, the 
problem is certainly not one of the most vital importance. 
Within any one grade, the words taught have usually 
been arranged according to one of two plans — grouping by 
meaning, and grouping by common elements, mostly phonetic 
elements. I venture to say that there is a third plan 
better than either. Since our object is to spell, words 
should be grouped according to the way they are spelled. 
If dear and bear have similar spellings, let us put them to- 
gether whether they are pronounced alike or not. Pie should 
be associated with piece, and (perhaps) nice with niece. The 
easier letter forms will of course be placed first. I should 
     
   
       
   
                 
   
           
      
-P-A-G-E-199
  SPELLING 189 
think words similarly spelled ought to be associated in our 
dictations; for it is spelling we want in our first dictations 
that embody a word, rather than any deep meaning in the 
sentences. I should not hesitate to give such a dictation 
as, ‘‘Dear Bear: What do you wear? Will you eat a pear? 
Come near. I do not fear you.” Ete. 
Introducing but one difficulty at a time. — In addition to 
grouping the words so that they will reénforce each other 
and grade from easy to difficult, we can help matters by 
dividing them into syllables while they are being studied. 
As Courtis says, ‘‘It is easier to remember three syllables of 
three letters each than one long word of nine letters.”! It 
pays also to look for the tough places in words, such as the 
ie in “‘believe,” the e7 in ‘‘receive,”’ and the ich in ‘‘which,”’ 
and to put the effort right where the resistance is. 
But we must also grade the processes which pupils go 
through in committing and reciting a word. Investigation 
shows that it pays to use all the “word roads,” eye, ear, 
tongue, and hand. In class work, however, the hand should 
be used last; for it has had the least practice of the four, 
and may halt the process so much as to prove a hindrance 
to recall. 
Assuming that a child knows the meaning and pronuncia- 
tion of a word, and has a fair mental picture of it as a whole, 
we may proceed to have him print the letters of it on his 
brain cells by study, and have him reproduce them by reci- 
tation, using steps somewhat as below. 
Study — 
1. Recognition.of word among other words (“picking 
it out’’), in print or script or both, in book or on 
board. 
18. A. Courtis — Teaching Spelling by Plays and Games, p. 9. 
   
-P-A-G-E-200
190 THE CHILD’S MIND 
2. Pronunciation and spelling from book or board, 
first orally, then in writing. (This may be done in 
concert, with care, and repeated at pleasure.) 
3. Vivid picturing of word with eyes on it, then similar 
vivid picturing with eyes closed or with word con- 
cealed, with silent or whispered mouth spelling, fol- 
lowed by sight of word again to “check up.” 
4. Vivid picturing of word, followed by independent 
writing of it, then checking up by book or board 
to make sure it is right. 
5. Writing drill, slow at first, then faster. (This may 
be regulated by having each letter called as it is 
written.) 
Recitation — 
6. Oral spelling (perhaps with use of word in sentence). 
7. Written spelling, the words being given from a list. 
8. “Dictation.” Writing of sentences that contain the 
test words. 
Of course we need not take all these steps, and in this 
order, with all children nor with all words. 
Should vocabulary ever run ahead of experience? — As 
a rule, life should lead the way for language; we should 
experience a thing before we try to express it. At the same 
time, a new word is often a challenge to put our old experi- 
ence together in new ways. In unearthing ancient cities, 
hollow forms are sometimes found which, when poured full 
of plaster, show some interesting human figure. A ‘‘new” 
word (really as old, perhaps, as the ancient city) is at first 
such an empty mold in the mind; but if we can pour it full 
of meaning, we repeat the experience of those who first felt 
the need for such a word. So do we gain a new counter 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
    : SPELLING 191 
with which to play the game of thought, and a new tool 
with which to work our will on the world. For a word 
bears somewhat the same relation to the high-level pro- 
cesses that objects do to our low-level experiences. 
In my judgment, all children of good verbal ability should 
be deliberately encouraged, at the proper age, to enlarge 
their vocabularies as a key to the enrichment of experience, 
keeping a private word book for the purpose. 
Readiness. — A young man who entered a certain academy 
refused at first to do what he considered humiliating — to 
study spelling — but he finally consented to do this on con- 
dition that all the words to be spelled should be selected 
from the unabridged dictionary. We can soon convince our 
pupils that it is more of a disgrace to mutilate spelling than 
to study it. We can tell them such stories as that of the 
pupil who wrote to his former teacher, beginning his letter 
with, ‘‘My dear Cur,” and saying he was pleased to “‘except”’ 
the teacher’s invitation to visit him. 
Just as a strong motive for learning to read is the desire 
to read letters, so, very likely, a strong motive for learning 
to spell is the desire to write letters, and to write them 
without odium and disgrace. Indeed, one is not sure to 
be understood unless he can spell, as we can show by the 
old story of the man who wrote to a friend in Africa, asking 
that some monkeys be sent to him. He wanted two, but 
his poor spelling and writing made the word read too, 
which was interpreted as 100. He was much embarrassed 
when he found a hundred monkeys on his hands. 
Courtis has made extensive use of games in the teaching 
of spelling.1 Competition is the principal motive in them 
all, the class being divided into two teams. The games 
1§, A. Courtis — Teaching Spelling by Plays and Games. 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
192 THE CHILD’S MIND 
consist in ‘‘straightening out’? words whose letters have 
been jumbled, taking e e e 7 v rc, for example, and making 
receive out of it; in looking up a list of words in the dic- 
tionary and dividing them properly into syllables; in finding 
rhymes for words; in forming derivatives for words; in 
defining words; in filling in missing words, ete. 
Dr. Hollingworth motivated her work by a variety of 
devices. The children made a dictionary and received a 
reward for it; they played store, cutting out pictures from 
store catalogs and spelling the name of each article in large 
letters; competitive games were played with words; and 
each child kept a diary of whatever interested him, taking, 
special pains with the spelling.* 
The great difficulty with spelling is the same as with 
writing, that is, to get it to “carry through” the other 
branches. The majority of errors in everyday work are 
due either to lapses of attention, the mind being on some- 
thing else, or to failure to.follow the good old rule, ‘‘ When in 
doubt, get out.” Tidyman asserts that about two thirds 
of the errors in spelling would be prevented if children, 
when in doubt, would ask the teacher or consult a diction- 
ary. It helps greatly if they are trained in the habit of 
looking critically over what they have written, before pass- 
ing it in. Experiment shows that children know, as a rule, 
when they have spelled a word incorrectly. In addition, 
we can “mark off” for words found misspelled in other 
branches. 
Exercise: the use of spelling time. — Certain investiga- 
tions have made it appear that spelling is learned as well 
when studied incidentally, in connection with other branches 
when the new words come up, as it is when book and drill 
1 Leta S. Hollingworth — The Psychology of Special Disability in Spelling. 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
  
SPELLING 198 
are used. Almost certainly this is untrue unless the teacher 
is an expert in the incidental method. Almost certainly 
spelling is like eating: we can go munching through the day, 
thereby interfering with everything else, but it is better to 
stop at regular intervals and have a square meal. 
Twenty minutes a day is not too much to spend on this 
ragged and random art; but it seems to be enough. Some 
schools devote four days a week to the spelling-book words, 
and the fifth day to local and other special words. 
Class routine. — The general method of class work has 
been indicated above (see “Introducing but one difficulty 
at a time”). The oral spelling there provided for can 
usually be conducted rather briskly, the teacher pronounc- 
ing each word but once and assigning it, not in serial order, 
to some pupil who is judged to be just about able to spell 
it, the less able pupils listening. The pupil chosen should 
pronounce and spell it distinctly, preferably pausing slightly 
between syllables. 
Below the third grade, writing is still so much of a 
hindrance as to make the dictation of sentences inadvisable. 
The written spelling should consist of words in lists, and 
there should be a liberal time allowance. 
Tricking our tricky spelling. — Spelling is like love: it 
“must cling where it can, I say.’’ Probably there is no 
one of us who does not have some trick for remembering 
a specially difficult word; and very likely we can help our 
pupils by suggesting these tricks to them. It is better to 
form a nonsense bond than no bond. One student had 
trouble with Wednesday until she learned to look for the 
“Wed” in it. Another remembers believe and receive by 
thinking of the i and the ce in Alice. Connecticut takes 
the form of Connect-i-cut. Separate and grammar are set
-P-A-G-E-204
194 THE CHILD’S MIND 
right by the fact that pa is in one and ma in the other. If 
a pupil has any ‘‘head”’ for spelling, then I venture to say 
that some trick can be invented which will remedy any 
misspelling with which he is haunted. 
The tandem method. — Probably the nearest we can come 
to the tandem method in the teaching of spelling is to have 
the pupil ask the teacher or consult the dictionary in re- 
gard to a word of unknown spelling, and then to impress 
thoroughly that spelling. The teacher will often be busy, 
but the individual dictionary will not, and such a dictionary 
ought to be furnished and used from the fourth grade on. 
At first, special training in its use will be necessary. Per- 
haps the best way to begin such training is to have the 
pupil make a crude dictionary of his own. When he has 
learned how words are placed alphabetically in a diction- 
ary, he will know how to get them out alphabetically. 
Reviews. — These should come often, and be often 
written. 
Words are like people: some are total strangers to us; 
of some we say that we ‘‘know who they are”’; with others 
we have a “speaking acquaintance’ but not a writing 
acquaintance; many we ‘“‘come to know,” and forget, and 
recall again when we have business with them; a limited 
number we know so well that we can draw the details of 
their faces. 
Now, ‘old acquaintance’”’ must not be “forgot and never 
brought to mind.” Many teachers like to have a daily, 
or at least a weekly, review, a monthly review, a semi- 
annual or semester review, and an annual review. In addi- 
tion, each grade should begin its year’s work by trying its 
hand on the words of last year. 
But there seems to be room for an honest difference of
-P-A-G-E-205
SPELLING 195 
opinion and procedure with regard to so much reviewing. 
Dr. Hollingworth called a word learned by a pupil when he 
was at least able to spell it on five successive days without 
error. Tests given after eleven weeks showed no “‘consist- 
‘ent weakening of the bonds,” not even the beginning of 
forgetting. Indeed, her tests sometimes indicated gain, 
after a lapse of three months, and with “no intentional 
practice on the words involved.” 
Apparently the more mechanical teaching requires the 
more reviewing. The more interest in the beginning, and 
the more thorough the teaching, the less the reviewing. 
Best of all is the habit of “reviewing,” in the dictionary, 
a word whenever it is needed and unknown. 
Preventing errors.— In studying errors, we should ask 
two questions: What is the matter with the words? and 
What is the matter with the pupils? 
The great trouble with the words is their silent letters, 
and the vowels with their many variable sounds. Most 
errors occur among vowels; for the consonants of a word 
form a kind of skeleton of it, sticking up, and sticking 
down, and coming to the front, and being sounded, and 
having for the most part but one sound apiece. It is the 
fluid and varying vowels that cause the confusion. In 
general, too, long words are harder than short ones. Chil- 
dren nearly always get the first letter of a word correctly; 
and in long words, the first and the last syllable stand a 
much better chance of answering the roll call correctly than 
does any intermediate syllable. On the average, the hard 
part of a word is the part that attracts least attention, and 
that is its middle. 
These facts show us where to put the center drive in 
our teaching. 
   
-P-A-G-E-206
  196 THE CHILD’S MIND 
And what ails the children? Not special disability, for 
the most part. 
Over 80 per cent of the poor spellers in our Experimental Class spelled 
poorly from some cause other than special disability. General intellectual 
weakness, lack of interest, distaste for mental drudgery, intellectual inertia, 
previous learning in a foreign language, sensory defects, and bad hand- 
writing are doubtless the most frequent causes of poor spelling.t 
In general, the pupil who misspells a word either has not 
formed a definite series-bond for its letters, or something 
“switches him off” so that the wrong bond works, atten- 
tion being asleep at the switch. Re-teaching the word is 
the cure for the first condition, and the cure for the second 
is everlasting watchfulness and the introduction every- 
where of but one difficulty at a time. The causes of 
“switching off” are mispronunciation, faulty inner speech 
(as “quite” for “quiet,” or “athaletic’” for ‘‘athletic’’), 
similar sounds (s used for c), similar letters (when writing 
a, it “feels like” d and so the pupil writes ‘‘sd” for 
“sad’’), neighboring sounds (take a “peep” at the 
“people”’), or neighboring letters (‘the theeth” for the 
“teeth’”’). It appears also that some children become 
fond of a certain letter, perhaps as they do of a certain 
curl in their writing, and stick in that letter at every op- 
portunity. The poor spellers make the same kind of errors 
(only more of them) that the good ones make and need 
the same treatment. 
It has been found that merely calling attention to mis- 
spelled words by marking them conspicuously does very 
little good. A better way is to cross out the misspelling, 
write the correct form above, and have the word rewritten. 
1 Leta 8. Hollingworth — The Psychology of Special Disability in Spelling.
-P-A-G-E-207
  
SPELLING : 197 
Words frequently misspelled ought to be listed and brought 
into the spelling class for treatment. 
In addition, each pupil must be personally conducted 
through his spelling troubles. This is not so difficult, either, 
for each pupil has, on the average, only about 50 words 
that he chronically misspells. He should have them in his 
list, and look at the list often. 
Individual differences. — As we should expect, there is a 
great degree of difference among people in their ability to 
spell; ranging from the few who seem to need but one good 
look at a word in order to fix its spelling, through the aver- 
age many who must make average effort, and down to the 
other few who cannot learn spelling with any amount of 
effort. There is no tag by which we can certainly detect 
the speller and the non-speller without having them spell. 
Both good and bad spellers may be bright or dull generally, 
with good or poor general memory, with or without sensory 
defects. All these things may have their influence, but the 
essential difference is in the brain, and in that part of the 
brain which has to do with the ordering and holding of let- 
ters, and the expressing of these letters through the hand. 
Effect. — Probably this will take care of itself pretty 
largely. The social disgrace of being a bad speller and the 
honor of being a good one are commonly keener than they 
should be, even as things are. Within the demesne of the 
schoolroom, we shall need to direct our attention chiefly to 
the spelling done outside of the spelling class; and one of 
the best things we can do here is to see to it that the pupil 
is not overwhelmed with demands for words that he has 
not yet learned to spell. In addition, we must penalize, in 
some way, his misuse of words that he has had a chance to 
master.
-P-A-G-E-208
  198 THE CHILD’S MIND 
The testing of spelling bonds. — In addition to the pre- 
liminary test described above, to find out what words we 
need to teach, we must test again in some way to find out 
what words we have taught. 
Practice varies. Perhaps a monthly test, the words being 
delivered by column dictation, is a good standard to go by. 
Much depends on the reviews conducted, success in teach- 
ing the dictionary habit, the frequency of misspellings in 
regular work, etc. 
Standard tests do not measure accurately the amount of 
advance a class has made in spelling, unless such a test in- 
cludes all the words covered in the teaching. The reason 
for this is that each word is largely an independent piece of 
learning. In arithmetic, if a child can do long division, he 
can certainly do addition and subtraction; but in spelling, 
all bonds stand nearly on a level. No word stands for much 
of anything except itself. 
The spelling of the future. — It seems impossible that the 
English-speaking peoples will continue to carry the burden 
of their outworn spelling. Our spelling ought to become 
phonetic, and teachers should expend every effort to help all 
the agencies that are working in this direction. We can all 
help at least a little by using ‘‘fonetic speling” in our pri- 
vate correspondence whenever it will not cause too much 
shock, and by using, in the classroom and elsewhere, all the 
simpler forms that have received the sanction of any stand- 
ard dictionary.

FOR FURTHER STUDY 
1. How were you taught to spell? Shall you teach in the same 
way? Why or why not? 
2. Have you a dictionary of your own? 
Should pupils see their teacher consulting the dictionary fre- 
quently? Why or why not? 
3. Write a few words, especially some that are rather difficult, 
and then report on your method of remembering a word. Do you 
see it, hear it, feel yourself pronouncing it, or what? What do 
you do when in doubt? 
4. Let each report what tricks he uses in order to remember the 
spelling of words especially difficult for him. 
5. One expert would have pupils write words in concert, spell- 
ing aloud as they go. They repeat each word faster and faster 
each time through, until at last only the most rapid writers are 
able to keep up. Do you approve of this method? What effect 
would it be likely to have on penmanship? 
6. Why is it impossible to make any single best list of words 
for all children to learn? What should we attempt to do? 
7. Ifa pupil is ear-minded, and seems to misspell words because 
his pen follows his ear, suppose we tell him to imagine his mother 
or his next best friend pronouncing the letters into his ear. What 
effect do you think this would have if he would use the device while 
studying spelling? How could you find out?

8. If possible, procure a list of errors (as from a set of papers 
in some grade) and study them. What generalizations can you 
make? How would you plan to correct such errors?

dictionary? Why? (Practice is against much use of them in 
spelling books.) How should a pupil get the pronunciation of a 
word?

Exercise. — Following are quotations from experts as to what 
nature study is. From these, and from your own experience, 
try to determine the exact nature of the study and what is to be 
expected from the teaching of it. 
“Nature study is . . . a study of nature.’”’ — Comstock. 
“Many persons think they have tritely defined and disposed 
of the matter in saying: ‘Nature Study is the study of Nature.’ 
. Were we forced to define the term, we should say that 
Nature Study is a subject in which the teaching i is for the purpose of 
developing certain mental faculties, such as observation, compari- 
son, reflection, reasoning, Adement memory, intellect, and even 
the conscience, and in which the material used to secure this 
development consists of the objects and phenomena of Nature.’’ — 
Surface. 
“Nature study is not elementary science as so taught, because 
its point of attack is not the same. . . . In nature study the work 
begins with any plant or creature which chances to interest the 
pupil.”’ — Comstock. 
“Does ‘elementary science’ mean exactly the same as nature 
study? I am forced to that belief.” — Bigelow. 
“Nature Study is not the study of science, as of botany, entomol- 
ogy, geology, and the like.”’ — Batley. 
“T would by all means teach the young people the elements 
of the great sciences — geology, astronomy, and chemistry.’’ — 
Burroughs. 
“Tt should be clearly understood that nature study and science 
are not different subjects, but that they are two terms variously 
used to cover the same subject matter.” — Trrafton.

  202 THE CHILD’S MIND 
“These two things (nature study and agriculture) are one sub- 
ject; they have a common educational value, or else none suf- 
ficient to make them worthy of a place in the schools.” — Coulter 
and Patterson. 
“Nature study is really a method rather than subject matter.” 
— Downing. 
“Nature study is learning those things in nature that are best 
worth knowing, to the end of doing those things that make life 
most worth the living.’’ — Hodge. 
The man who would be king. — You recall the story of the 
young Roman of royal family who went with his brothers 
to consult the oracle, to find out which of them should be 
king. And the answer of the oracle was, ‘‘That man who 
first kisses his mother, he shall be king.’’ Immediately they 
all set off in great haste to find their mother, as a boy does 
when he expects strawberry shortcake, or a kingdom, or any 
other special prize. But one of them, wiser than the rest, 
pretended to stumble and fall when he reached the door- 
way; and as he fell, he pressed his lips to the earth. And 
so he became king. 
For old Mother Earth is truly the first mother of us all. 
The man who knows her best, he is a king among men. 
The French have decided that the greatest Frenchman is — 
not Napoleon, but Pasteur — Pasteur, the ‘‘germ man,” 
who taught us how to pasteurize our food, and control dis- 
ease. And this leader of his people gained his greatness by 
his intimate acquaintance with our great common mother. 
Nature study. — It is ‘‘natural” to study nature, since we 
are all sprung from her. And since we are alive, it is most 
natural, perhaps, to study living nature, the animals and 
the plants. In fact, that is probably what the term “‘nature 
study” first suggests to most of us. But even if we include 
all of inanimate nature, rock, weather, and stars, the phrase 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
NATURE STUDY 203 
is not the best one to fit all that subject matter which, in 
my judgment, should be regarded as one branch. 
A boy plays at a pool. He finds that a tadpole absorbs 
its tail. So far, this is nature study. He cuts an alder, 
makes a squirt gun, and tries to find out why the water 
“sucks up”’ into it when he pulls the piston back. Is this 
nature study? He winds up his toy boat, watches it propel 
itself across the water, and then takes it apart to “‘see how 
it works.” Is this nature study? Nature never made a 
spring boat. 
Elementary science. — Science ‘‘carries on’’ in the same 
spirit of curiosity, inquiry, and truth seeking as nature 
study, but has a much wider range of subject matter; for 
it adds all the man-made things and ideas. From nature’s 
round tree we pass to a cross section of it, which was the 
first man-made wheel; from plants and animals to foods and 
cooking; from eggs to the reason why a stale egg floats; 
from the rubber tree to bicycle tires; from water to water 
pipes, faucets, and boats; from air to ventilating appliances 
and the draughts on stoves; from a thunderstorm to elec- 
tric bells and the waves of the wireless telephone. 
But science, narrowly so called, must in its turn give way 
to a larger idea. For ‘‘a science teaches us to know and an 
art to do,” and in dealing with the environment, natural or 
man-made, we must either do or suffer, and in many cases 
do or die. What we want in the elementary school is not 
alone ‘‘elementary science,’’ but an elementary art, the art of 
dealing with all common things (and some uncommon things, 
perhaps) in a way that enables us to survive and be happy. 
To illustrate, let us take two stories from Woodhull’s re- 
markable book.! A firecracker, thrown into a little girl’s

lap, set fire to her dress. Her mother caught her up, rushed 
into the house, and put out the fire, but not until the little 
one had been fatally burned. Now, both mother and 
daughter may have learned in nature study that nature set 
the first fires by lightning or volcanoes, and they might also 
have learned in elementary science that if a bottle is low- 
ered over a candle, the candle soon goes out. But at any 
rate, the one thing they needed and did not have is brought 
out by the second story. In this case, a four-year-old girl was 
playing alone with a match. When it fired, she dropped 
it into her lap and her dress began to burn. But “she 
had many times been taught what to do if her clothes caught 
fire,’ and so when the mother came in she found the little 
one holding her dress tightly wadded together in her lap. 
A hole about a foot square had been burned in the front of 
the dress, but the little girl had not even singed her hands. 
In the United States, accidents have been carrying off 
children at the rate of 20,000 a year. More children of from 
ten to fourteen years die from accident than from epidemic 
diseases. What are the schools going to do about it? 
Life craft.— Life craft is the knowing and doing of those 
practical things that enable us to live, and to be efficient, 
serviceable, and happy. Probably the best present embodi- 
ment of it is found in Scoutcraft, the craft of the Boy 
Scouts. The Scouts are trained in certain useful parts of 
nature study and elementary science, in the tying of practical 
knots, in first aid, fire building and control, simple cooking 
(sufficient to get a good dinner in the open), swimming, 
money earning and saving, what to do when lost, ete. They 
have merit badges for good practical achievement in agricul- 
ture, angling, archery, astronomy, bee keeping, bird study, 
botany, camping, cooking, firemanship, gardening, personal
-P-A-G-E-215
     NATURE STUDY 205 
health, poultry keeping, safety first, and many other lines 
of achievement in which certain of their number may wish 
to excel. 
Life craft selects from the boundless store of stuff in na~ 
ture study whatever is most useful and important for chil- 
dren to know, together with whatever happens to be very 
interesting to the particular pupils to be taught. But not 
all children are interested in nature study, and there is no 
more reason for troubling them with its useless details 
than there is for troubling them with the Greek alphabet 
and vocabulary. As one glances through the average na- 
ture-study manual or textbook, he is impressed with the 
fact that a great deal of what is there included might bet- 
ter be omitted so far as everyday usefulness is concerned — 
how the Dobson hangs head down in the water, how the 
snail crawls and breathes, the anatomy of a feather, how a 
wasp builds its nest. These things may be ‘“‘nice to know,” 
if one has time for a nice education; but so also are the 
peculiar properties of numbers, the unlimited details of his- 
tory, the spelling of rare old words, and thousands of other 
things which have been omitted from courses of study for 
lack of practical use. 
How much of nature study does the average person really 
use? 
We should calmly ask the same question about elemen- 
tary science. We must disregard the somewhat extravagant 
statements of such men as G. Stanley Hall 1 and Abraham 
Flexner,? to the effect that this branch, or these branches, 
are or should be ‘‘central’”’ in the curriculum. No branch 
is or ought to be central, with all others subordinate, in

  206 THE CHILD’S MIND 
the curriculum of all children; but let us have a union, a 
United States of branches, each yielding all it can to make 
childhood healthy, self-reliant, and happy. 
What bonds do we want to form? — To help answer this 
question, let us refer to Woodhull.! He finds that many 
people, on looking obliquely into a mirror, have little idea 
as to where those objects are whose reflections they see, nor 
can they locate a star when seen reflected in a lake. He 
finds high school students who would as quickly use the 
short arm of a lever as the long one if they want to exert 
power, or take hold of a log by the middle instead of the 
end if they want to move it easily, or lift a heavy barrel in- 
stead of rolling it up an inclined plane, or stand on the out- 
side of a railroad curve rather than the inside if they wanted 
to be safe. He asserts that we should try to make nature 
and her ways seem natural, and quotes with approval the 
following from Kipling: 
And we all praise famous men — 
Ancients of the College; 
For they taught us common sense — 
Tried to teach us common sense 
Truth and God’s Own Common Sense 
Which is more than knowledge. 
Primary handwork and elementary environment work. — 
In primary handwork, we found that our aim was to form 
a set of bonds which need not be taught in any fixed order, 
and which may vary a great deal from class to class, but 
whose general effect is to make the pupil handy with his 
hands. In elementary life craft, or environment work, 
our aim is to form a set of bonds which need not be taught 
in any fixed order, and which may vary a great deal from 
1 The Teaching of Science, pp. 3, 82, 83. 
 
-P-A-G-E-217
NATURE STUDY 207 
class to class, but whose general effect is to make the pupil 
handy with his environment. 
Huxley used to say that science is organized common 
sense. Now, common sense is sense in common things. 
It comes, if the pupil has any capacity for it, from ex- 
perience with common things, here a bit, there a bit, here 
and there a bit. It comes, for instance, by a boy’s breaking 
hard-boiled eggs on his forehead, as we used to do at school: 
one soon learns to break the big end, and not the little one. 
Pupils who have had what we might call an extensive 
course in common sense can often give correct judgments 
when they are unable to give good reasons to support them. 
They just “‘feel that it is so.” Whence comes that feeling? 
From bonds formed long ago and no longer consciously 
working, but exercising an influence all the same. Further, 
such a child does not too early become known as a ‘“‘book 
worm.” ‘“‘Safety first,” in education, does not mean books 
first. It is a bad state a child has gotten into when he 
feels that everything must be done “‘just as the book 
says.”’ Back of the book lies the Great Authority, the 
authority of things-as-they-are. 
A brief catalog of essentials. — Following Spencer’s classic 
catalog of ‘‘What Knowledge Is of Most Worth,’ ! we 
may outline the essentials of life craft as follows: (1) Health- 
and-safety-first bonds. Here would be included what (and 
what not) to eat, drink, and breathe; how to quench fires, 
cross streets, dodge traffic, kill poisonous snakes, and so 
on. (2) Making-a-living bonds: which plants and animals 
are useful and which harmful, how to run a garden, the 
worth of waste paper, how money grows by saving, start- 
ing a bank account. (3) Taking-care-of-baby bonds: con- 
1 Herbert Spencer — Education.
-P-A-G-E-218
208 THE CHILD’S MIND 
sider the clean bottle and clean clothing, too much kissing 
and fondling, sunlight in the baby’s eyes, etc. Younger 
brothers and sisters, no longer babies, should also be con- 
sidered. (4) Society-at-large bonds: the killing of mos- 
quitoes and flies, losses by fire (a half billion dollars a year 
in the United States), how the automobile helps to make 
us sociable and the wireless unites the world, and the 
like. (5) Joy bonds: there is beauty in nature and in 
human nature; there is much that ought to be enjoyed 
whether it is otherwise useful or not. The appreciation of 
the universe and its parts is a large fraction of religion. 
Which ‘“‘branches” contribute most? — All the subjects 
we now have in our school programs branched originally 
Physical Science 
Hygiene 
Agricultural Science 
Biological Science 
Grades 1 2 3 4 Seo: 7 3 
Fig. 25. Distribution of phases of science throughout the grades. (Figure 
from p. 4 of Gilbert H. Trafton’s The Teaching of Science in the Elementary 
School.!) 
from a crude kind of life craft, from environment-study 
and human-welfare practice. It may help us to discover 
where most of our subject matter for elementary science 
and present-day life craft lies if we glance at some of these 
branches. Trafton’s diagram for making this clear ap- 
pears in Figure 25. But this should be regarded as sug- 
gestive only. For example, ‘Agricultural Science” would 
loom much larger in a country than in a city school. And

Company, copyright, 1918. Used with the permission of the publishers.

  NATURE STUDY 209 
further, looking at the matter from our present pragmatic 
standpoint, we should prefer to put “Art” or ‘‘Craft” in 
the place of ‘‘Science,’’ and speak of Physical Arts, Agri- 
cultural Craft, etc. Our study of the physical arts would 
include such practical doings as tying up a package neatly 
and breaking off the string by the adept method of the good 
clerk. 
What responses can the children make already? — In no 
other line of school work, probably, do we find the high 
and the low of the children’s achievements so far apart. 
We can take nothing for granted, yet in many a school we 
find pupils who can teach the teacher in some favorite 
field — bird lore, perhaps, or wood craft, or the ways of 
the wireless. Much may depend on whether a child has 
been brought up in city or country, and still more on 
whether he has really been brought up by someone who is 
himself an efficient life-crafter, or just allowed to come 
up like the stray stalk of corn that fights its way with the 
weeds at the edge of the field. 
What we must do is to find out, by trying, what our 
little people do and do not know, and we can often let those 
who know teach those who do not. If there is an outline 
of work for the course, we can at least find out, for each 
grade, some things that have not been taught. In the 
country, we shall find that many children know the com- 
mon plants and animals, from the humble hepatica to that 
spirited combination of morning music and sunset glow 
known as a robin. Everywhere, most children will have 
established at least a starting point for knowledge, through 
experience with a pet plant or animal, a stove or a gas 
meter, a doorbell or a phonograph, a bicycle pump or a 
violin. Many will even have performed that chemical

  210 THE CHILD’S MIND 
experiment, so dear to parents and teachers, of using soap 
to remove dirt from a soiled skin; and let us rejoice in 
the freedom of a branch that is not too closely organized, 
but leaves us at liberty to begin almost anywhere and pro- 
ceed to anywhere else at our pleasure. 
Relation of the desired bonds. — Children often like a con- 
tinued story, but not of the kind we find in the old-fashioned 
arithmetic. Abstractions, arranged in a complex logical 
order, make them educationally dizzy. Their brains grow 
best on sensori-motor bonds, simple or in series. Now, it is 
precisely characteristic of nature study, elementary science, 
elementary life craft, that most of its bonds are of the simple- 
and-single pattern. It is not, and of right ought not to be, 
organized like the science of the high school. To impose 
such organization on it is to commit one of the capital 
blunders of the day. We should look with commiseration on 
those who commit it, or who frown down on our well-meant 
courses and call them ‘‘scrappy.” 
Bonds in series are sure to appear in time, and it is Nature 
herself who introduces them, if we are her good disciples. 
We keep a. calendar of the weather from day to day, noting 
condition of sky, direction of wind, temperature, and down- 
fall; or we watch a seed, one side of whose growing-box is 
made of glass, and perhaps make drawings to show how it 
grows; or we watch a nesting bird, or the hatching of a hen’s 
egg, noting successive observations. By and by, we have a 
whole string of observations strung on a thread of reason. 
With older children, such a string may extend through an 
entire season, as when we keep a diary of the coming of 
spring.! Later, the chronicle may run from season to season, 
1It would add to the literary interest, perhaps, if we let Spring herself keep 
the diary: “April —. I started the pussies on the willows, and am getting
-P-A-G-E-221
    
NATURE STUDY 211 
or from year to year, as we record the coming and going 
of the flowers, the birds, the seasons, the sun and the 
stars. 
Trunk line bonds can be introduced according to the pu- 
pil’s age and interest. Without perplexing him with defini- 
tions or mathematics, he can be brought to see that a ball, 
and a stream of water, and a ray of light, and many other 
things, all ‘‘glance” in the same way from a surface that 
turns them back. Hot air rises; and just as we make use of 
this principle to ventilate our houses, nature makes use of it 
to ventilate the whole world — that is, to make the wind 
blow. Waves are found in air, and water, and electricity. 
If we feel pestered by flies and mosquitoes, let us learn that 
everything appears to be pestered: 
Big fleas have little fleas 
Upon their backs to bite ’em; 
And little fleas have lesser fleas, 
And so ad infinitum. 
From sensori-motor to high level bonds. — One of the 
curses that teachers frequently inflict on their pupils is that 
of requiring them to memorize “scientific” names and 
other very formal descriptive terms. They are like the 
parents who insisted upon having their daughter called 
Arabella Donatella when her playmates preferred to call 
her Belle. Children want to know how things work, and 
how to work them; but they also want, for the most part, 
what seem to them the shortest and most sensible names 
that will answer; and they should be gratified. 
ready to bring out the skunk cabbage at the edge of the swamp.” Ete. Such 
a diary helps also in the appreciation of time — last month, last year, many 
years ago. Here we help to form a basis for history, both human and 
natural. 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
    
212 THE CHILD’S MIND 
The use of an outline. — One of the first points to consider 
in teaching life craft is to have an outline; ' and one of the 
very next points is, not to use it too much. A good outline, 
like a good bill of fare, suggests to us what we can take, and 
the interests of the children, for the most part, decide what 
we shall take. To adopt as a whole an outline made for some 
other section of country, or to throw away good material 
because it does not happen to fit into our pretty outline — 
are both bad practices. 
But we can make our own outline, with a few simple 
principles to guide us. To begin with, there is the child in 
the center, and there is the environment all round him. 
Whatever he needs to know or wants to know or do about 
this environment should, in general, be taught to him. 
This will vary, of course, with his age, and it will change 
with the changing environment, particularly with the sea- 
sons. Since the younger children are especially attracted to 
things that are alive and pretty, it is customary to study 
with them animals and plants, particularly those that are 
the most conspicuous; reserving the study of physical and 
chemical topics, the weather and other aspects of inanimate 
nature, for the more advanced years. But the child is the 
compass to steer by; give him whatever he naturally notices 
and is curious about, together with what he must have for 
‘‘health-and-safety-first.”” 
The principal topics to be treated, as we pass up through 
the grades, are birds and animals, wild and domestic, in- 
sects, trees and forests, flowers and seeds, gardening, weeds, 
weather, health (including some measure of school hygiene), 
home activities, plays, games and sports, the simple physics

Gilbert H. Trafton’s The Teaching of Science in the Elementary School. 
 
-P-A-G-E-223
NATURE STUDY 213 
and chemistry of common things (“how they work’’), agri- 
culture, and social and public activities. 
So far as ‘‘one difficulty at a time” is concerned, almost 
any topic in life craft can be treated in an easy way or a 
difficult way. . Autumn leaves or gardening can be studied 
anywhere from the first grade to the university, depending 
on what we are trying to learn about the subject and how 
we go at it. 
Readiness. — If we make our minute lesson plan first and 
depend on creating the interest afterward, we may come to 
consider life craft a vile thing to teach. We ought rather 
to follow that good rule, ‘‘Begin where you are, when you 
are there.” It is a magnificent compensation for the rather 
loose organization of the subject, that we can follow such 
a rule. 
Miss Comstock says the reason why the wild flowers 
may be used as a starting point in the study of plants is 
because the children love ‘‘these woodland posies,’”’ and 
have spent their happiest hours in gathering them.! As a 
child, my teachers would have found me very ready to go to 
the dear old brook banks where the teaberries and arbutus 
grew, to the cave not far from the schoolhouse, to the oak 
and the boulder between which the early hepaticas ap- 
peared, or to the shop where we could make some new ‘‘con- 
traption.” Anything suggestive of these would have kept 
me awake in the schoolroom. We still study nature at 
our house, and we ‘“‘begin where we are.” From my study 
window I observe a sparrow alighting so heavily against 
the base of a dandelion stalk as to bend it to earth, making 
his way out along it to the fluff of seeds and putting them 
away properly. A robin brings two of her young, almost

-P-A-G-E-224
  214 THE CHILD’S MIND 
as large now as herself, tugs out earthworms and places bits 
of them in the young robins’ bills while they flutter with 
delight. Twenty-five yards back of the house, a wild 
young rabbit is feeding on clover and watching out for 
cats. In front, the maple trees have been attacked by 
woolly aphids. The ants are streaming up and down, 
tending these white “‘cows” of theirs—and we are con- 
sidering what we can do to wipe out the pests. 
But we can appeal to the instincts of children, too. Per- 
haps imitation is the strongest. In no other subject, 
probably, is enthusiasm so contagious, and an enthusiastic 
teacher so much of a necessity. Here seems to be the 
explanation of the fact that the best teachers of nature 
study are the most self-trained. 
The instinct for action finds its outlet in our walks, in 
gathering specimens, in drawing and photographing, in 
building cages or aquariums, in gardening, and in caring 
for plants and pets. 
Curiosity is a powerful motive. Many a lesson can be 
started with “I wonder—.” If children are inquisitive 
as to what Mother keeps in her bureau drawers, they may 
be more so as to what Mother Nature keeps in her secret 
places. 
Self-assertion, good-natured rivalry, will do no harm, 
even if it sometimes takes the form of ‘I know something 
you don’t know!” ‘‘Who can find the first of this or that?” 
We enter his name on our bird record, or flower calendar, 
and behold, his fame is like that of the discoverer of radium 
or of oxygen. 
The herd instinct, too, finds its place. Children even 
beseech their teachers, sometimes, to form a club. The Boy 
Scouts’ organization is one of the greatest clubs on earth.

Exercise. — Perhaps we cannot do better than to outline, 
in a suggestive way, the treatment of some.common topic.

birds:so as to deal with them according to. their, deserts.

of the birds, about their appearance, their/common, names, 
and something of their habits, so that we can judge; of their 
value to us. 
If itis spring, we can keep a calendar of) the appearance 
of the birds, with the names of their discoverers; if it is

216 THE CHILD’S MIND 
autumn, we can keep a calendar of their disappearance 
(though this is more difficult), or make a collection of nests. 
A good plan for any particular lesson is (1) a talk by the 
teacher, (2) field work if possible, and (3) after-exercises of 
various kinds to fix the bonds. 
The teacher’s talk is sneered at by some as a mere peddling 
of second hand information — and so it may be. But most 
of the information in the world is second hand, or third hand, 
or x hand, and our best teachers are frequently worth-while 
talkers. Sometimes one may have luck enough to call in a 
bird specialist with his projection lantern. Some classes 
may be in a location where they can visit museums or col- 
lections. Or we may draw on the school museum for speci- 
mens; and, if there is no school museum, we can begin col- 
lecting for one. If even a single specimen is obtainable, we 
can leave it where all the pupils will have a chance, at their 
leisure, to examine it. Lacking even this, we can fall back 
on charts and pictures! and blackboard drawings, taking 
care that they shall not mislead as to size. Perhaps we can 
have a canary in the room for a time. Any form of bird life 
helps. One class kept a hen sitting under the teacher’s desk 
and watched the hatching process. 
The field trip gives us a chance to use the tandem method; 
to initiate the pupils into the study of nature as the teacher 
enjoys it. Sometimes it gives the pupils a chance to initiate 
the teacher into the practice of freedom as they enjoy it. We 
can prepare against unsatisfactory results by letting the 
pupils know in advance that certain things are expected 
(perhaps notebook results), and by letting them find that 
those who violate their privileges cannot take passage on 
1 Good bird material, including pictures, can be obtained from the National 
Asseciation of Audubon Societies, New York City. 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
  NATURE STUDY 217 
such trips. The teacher is wise who makes a preliminary 
excursion alone over the route, and who does not, as a rule, 
attempt a “personally conducted tour” with more than 
twenty pupils. The ‘‘tour,’’ however, may be as short in 
time as ten minutes. Miss Comstock tells of an energetic 
teacher whose class studied all the common plants and trees 
in the vicinity of her school simply by means of brief recess 
excursions. Sketching is a valuable part of all such work; 
not for the sake of the sketch, of course, but to show what 
“gets through” from eyes to fingers.! 
The after-exercises may consist of coloring bird outlines 
(perhaps hektographed by the teacher), using a colored 
picture as a model; of freehand drawing or written work, 
or both; of games of various description, such as that 
of identifying birds whose pictures are shown; of feeding 
the birds, especially in winter; of making bird houses, . 
reading literature about birds, solving arithmetic problems 
based on their consumption of insects, etc., the celebration 
of bird day, and the forming and conducting of a bird 
club. 
Effect. — Life craft, when taught to those who are ready 
to learn it, should be, like virtue, its own reward; for it means 
more life. Now some of our school work, it is to be feared, 
means more death. Some budding spring twigs were given 
to two groups of children, and all were asked to sketch what 
they saw. One group was just entering school, at the average 
age of six. The children of the other group had been in 
school six years (but had had no nature study). When an 
outsider was asked to separate the good drawings from the

process following at leisure. Of course this is often highly desirable.

bad, he did so with ease. ° It’ was then found that all’ the 
drawings which showed keen observation’ of essential 'fea- 
tures and free expression of them on paper, had been made 
by the unspoiled six-year-olds. ° Drawings from the other 
group were’stiff'and conventional, and notable for the omis- 
sion of conspicuous features. The twelve-year-olds) ‘Shad 
become’ apparently so dependent upon’ outside authority as 
represented by teachers and books that when left alone they 
were at’sea with neither chart nor compass.”’! 
We know what “‘two-fisted”” means;)we want to make 
our pupil ‘two-eyed, so that he will'see straight no matter 
how many others see'crooked; and we want him tobe inde- 
pendent’ and’ self-reliant, so’ that’ he will have’ no: cringing 
fear of his environment, but courageously do:what needs ‘to

If our pupil feels that. he is becoming a real practico in 
pragmatics, he will not fail to ‘‘carry on.” 
Tests. — In a large part of life craft, the doing of the work 
is the test; If a child can tie a knot that, will hold, or give 
clear directions as: to how to go from his schoolhouse to X, 
some miles distant, or build:a bird house that birds are will- 
ing to live in,or raise beans where weeds grew before, he 
“passes” ipso facto.

ated down to millimeters, has fortunately been slow to make

CLASS EXERCISE 
Let each prepare some simple life craft, lesson — preferably one 
with an immediate practical application — and give it to the class 
as to a group of children, providing such apparatus as may be. 
necessary. 
The following are suggestions: Tying up a package (breaking 
the string, etc.). How to plant a seed of some kind (box with one 
glass side may be used). The use of a lever (may be applied under 
the edge of the teacher’s desk, with simple fulcrum): Behavior of 
stale eggs and fresh ones in water. Melting point’ of ‘butter and 
of oleomargarine. How’a‘ lock works ‘(shown by dissecting one): 
Diagram of best way to cross a street (at’ corner only, and not’ 
diagonally).. ‘How to! apply a‘bandage. 
If any boy or girl:with a‘hobby ‘can be found, he’ orshe ‘may 
be induced to give a demonstration before*the class,’as°if for a 
group o° schoolmates. 3

  * 220 THE CHILD’S MIND 
FOR FURTHER STUDY 
1. What is the difference, as you see it, between nature study 
and elementary science? What idea does life craft add to both? 
2. Why should no one branch be central in the curriculum of 
all children? But is there any child who, especially as he matures, 
should not have some one branch that becomes central for him? 
3. Why is a girl usually so helpless if anything goes wrong with 
her roller skates, or bicycle, a window blind, the lock of a door, 
etc.? What can be done to help this condition? 
4. Try to list some further bonds that you think should be 
taught, under each of Spencer’s five classes of knowledge that is 
of most worth. 
5. In certain schools, to forward the teaching of elementary 
science (or life craft), a “helper” is sent from a lower grade to a 
higher one to learn by helping, and an ‘‘assistant” from a higher 
grade to a lower one to learn by showing. Comment on the good 
and bad points of this plan, as you see them. 
6. Some teachers emphasize having the pupils work in groups 
in nature study and similar branches, while others lay stress on 
individual achievement. Which plan does your experience, read- 
ing, etc., lead you to favor? Or is one plan suited to one purpose, 
the other to another? 
7. Give examples of your own to show that consecutive obser- 
vations of natural processes, such as the growth of seeds or plants, 
must lead to the forming of bonds in series, and perhaps to the 
appreciation of cause and effect. 
8. ‘They can be brought to see that a ball, and a stream of 
water, and a ray of light, and many other things, all ‘glance’ 
in the same way from a surface that turns them back.” What 
advantage is there in forming such trunk line bonds as that? 
Can you give other examples of such bonds? 
9. Tell what you would do in the way of securing readiness, 
exercise, and effect if you were giving a lesson on the pet rabbit; 
the honey bee; forest fires; some garden weed or weeds; cooking 
an egg; how a burning glass ‘‘draws fire from the sun”; how a 
bicycle pump works.
-P-A-G-E-231
  
NATURE STUDY 221 
10. Show how a teacher can make use of nature study as a 
means to health and recreation. 
11. To what extent would you encourage or permit a pupil 
to “let his imagination run” in the study of things in nature? 
Why? 
12. Do you think children are more interested in what a thing 
is, or what it does, or what they can do with it? How should this 
influence our teaching? 
13. Show how life craft can be correlated with other branches 
of study; as reading, writing, drawing, arithmetic, language, 
local geography, primary handwork, and manual training.

  CHAPTER XII 
Drawine: ELEMENTARY GrapHic EXPRESSION AND 
Beauty Crarr 
Exercises. — 1. List as many different situations as you can 
think of —'actual life situations of a common kind —in which 
power to draw gives either a practical advantage, or pleasure, or 
both. List also common situations in which artistic taste is 
desirable, as in choosing harmonious colors or designs in clothing 
or wall paper. 
2. You want your pupils to be able to draw a robin in char- 
acteristic pose. They may either observe the live bird or a stuffed 
specimen., There are numerous pictures of robins, and you can 
easily hektograph the typical robin form. What would you do 
in order to stamp the form of the robin on their minds and have 
it. expressed by pencil (or crayon or brush)? In particular, 
would you direct, or permit them, to trace from a picture, copy 
a picture, trace the form in the air with a finger, cut out the 
hektographed form and mark around it, follow you line by line 
as you drew a robin on the board, or draw many robins (especially 
in the same poses) .before drawing other birds? Why or why not? 
A first word to the teacher. — Perhaps your heart fails 
you as you approach this subject. Artists are born, not 
manufactured — and can anyone but an artist teach art? 
The positive and decisive answer is, Yes. Practicing an art 
is one thing, and teaching it is another and very different 
matter. The essentials in teaching are personality plus 
pedagogy: With these, and ‘‘a liking for drawing”’ and ‘a 
willingness to work, many a teacher has beaten the artist in 
presenting to children his own specialty. If drawing “Comes

hard.’ for, you, even; that: burden may be made «a blessing; 
for you ‘will-know iso. much the better how to make: it \easy 
for-others. 
So, iif. you! will furnish the’ personality, we will proceed 
with good cheer to develop ‘the pedagogy. 
Drawing: graphic art.— Drawing is a language, and 
drawing is a joy... 
As the language of the hand, it enables us to express 
things which can be told better ina drawing than they can 
in words. You do not write out’a description of your ab- 
sent friend and put it where you will read it often; ‘you 
want'a photograph (a light-drawing) or a good sketch or a 
watercolor; placed’ where’ it will frequently recall him ‘or 
her‘at a°glanee: You do not ‘so much want'a verbal de- 
scription of'a horse fair; -you wait Rosa Bonheur’s picture 
of ‘it. -When anyone is especially apt’ in using words so as 
to/call up vivid and ‘beautiful visions in our minds, we call 
him’ 4 “word -painter’?—a fine compliment both°to him 
and ‘to painting. © But the graphic art has its more homely 
uses.’ Perhaps you are one of those delightful letter writ- 
ers who illustrate their letters with sketches. Or you may 
draw for the milliner the hat you want her to contrive; or 
forthe ‘smith or carpenter the peculiar iron. or block you 
want him to shape; or for your friend the mechanical device 
you'want him to understand, or the road map he is to fol- 
low.’ If you are’ teaching, seldom a day will pass but that 
you will have on your board’ some drawing to help you 
explain ‘things to the children. ‘‘Drawing,” said''a little 
girl, ‘‘is thinking, and then marking a line round the think.” 
And she hit it pretty well: 
But drawing is also a joy. Even the cave’men knew 
that, for they drew and colored many beauty pieces which 
 
-P-A-G-E-234

were not at all needed if the only purpose was to pass an 
idea from mind to mind. We love to live again through 
that which brought us bliss, from a good picnic dinner to a 
moonlight love scene, or to the yearning of the soul that 
feels the mystic clasp of its Creator. 
Let Fate do her worst, there are relics of joy, 
Bright dreams of the past which she cannot destroy. 
“To dream the old dreams over is a luxury divine” for all 
of us. The poet puts his dream into words, and the artist 
his into form and color. Sometimes an idea is so beloved 
and so meaningful that it is repeated limitless times in de- 
sign, on floors or in borders or capitals or friezes, as the 
lotus flower among the Egyptians, or geometrical forms 
among the mathematically minded Greeks. And it is not 
only memory that gets itself bodied forth in this way. Im- 
agination also bursts forth into expressive form to show us 
what the world might be if it were not as it is. A little boy 
was told not to draw a chicken with blue crayon because 
chickens never are blue. Said he, ‘‘If you will let me have 
the crayon, I’ll show you how a chicken would look if it 
was blue.” ! 
Beauty craft. — If you will glance around the room where 
you sit, you will get a sample of beauty craft or the lack of 
it. The walls are attractively colored or they are not; 
there are pictures or there are none; and if pictures, they 
please or repel. Not far away, perhaps, a man has built an 
ugly house. He ought to have had a little training in 
beauty craft before he left the public school. 
In this world, we all have a chance to appreciate a mo- 
mentous amount, and to choose a great deal, and to create 
1 Sargent and Miller — How Children Learn to Draw, p. 169. 
 
-P-A-G-E-235
  DRAWING 225 
at least a little. This appreciating and choosing and creat- 
ing of beauty is beauty craft. Which moving picture shall 
we approve, and why? Which Sunday supplement? Which 
magazine cover? Yes, and which advertisement? It is hard 
to tell, sometimes, where beauty leaves off and lewdness or 
ribaldry or a cheap commercialism begins. How shall we 
contrive to combine our clothing into a harmony with our 
personality? How make hat and head agree in what they 
tell to the world? Given a little ground around our dwell- 
ing, what shall we create there? New York City’s beautiful 
Central Park was not born of nature, but made by man, 
and made largely from a barren waste. “Laying out grounds 
may be considered a liberal art,” says Wordsworth, ‘‘in 
some sort like poetry and painting.” 
Beauty craft will help us, in some small or great way, to 
increase every day the sum of the world’s beauty. 
What bonds do we want to form? — We have already 
learned what bonds we want to form, and need only sum- 
marize. 
1. Under the stimulus of ‘‘something to tell” or ‘“‘some- 
thing to feel,’’ we want the response of picturing it on paper 
(or other medium), so that those for whom it is intended 
will catch the meaning or the feeling. 
This means that the pupil must be able to draw many 
things in nature, from leaves to landscapes; to draw con- 
structed objects, from toys to temples; to represent the 
figures of animals and perhaps humans; to do lettering; to 
make designs; to control colors. 
2. In any situation where the question is one of beauty 
or ugliness, harmony or discord, we want our pupils to re- 
spond by appreciating, choosing, creating the beautiful and 
harmonious. 
 
-P-A-G-E-236
  226 THE CHILD’S !MIND 
Of course all these things are to be done according to the 
ability of childhood.’ We are not’ trying to maké thé chil- 
dren into little old ‘mén' or’ women, nor into little old artists. 
Our pupil will need to‘acquire beauty standards’ for land- 
scapes, both natural and artificial; for lawns and gardens 
and other house-surroundings, for dwellings themselves, and 
for the architecture of town and country, for sculpture and 
pictures, for all dress‘and adornment. Surely this is‘a big 
program, but it means an omnipresent opportunity to do 
good. Any teacher who can ‘tactfully influence a‘ boy* to 
stop’ wearing a red necktie over! a purple shirt, or induce a 
girl to stop doing her hair unbecomingly, has scored'‘'a big 
stroke for beauty craft. 
What responses can the child make already? — Perhaps 
the Binet tests will help us to find what responses the child 
can make.at the start. ‘At three, a normal child points’ to 
and names familiar objects seen'in’a picture. By the time 
he enters school at’ six, he can tell which is the longer of two 
nearly equal lines, pick out from a number of geonietrical 
figures the one that is like a sample shown him,! copy a 
square fairly well; name the more common colors when he 
sees them, tell a pretty face from an ugly one when they 
are pictured, put two pasteboard right triangles together so 
as to form a rectangle, tell the right parts ‘of his body from 
the left parts, and discover what is lacking in’ an incomplete 
human face or figure (as when an eye! or an arm is omitted 
froma drawing): At seven, he can copy a diamond-shaped 
figure, and he also recognizes the action in a picture — ‘the 
little girl iserying,”’ ete. When eight or nine, he “explains” 
a picture, infers what it is all about: “the little girl is crying 
because ' the cat has eaten all the) milk,” ete.’ At ten or 
eleven, he performs the remarkable feat of looking, for ten

guistic ability, or general motor superiority, or even with 
achievement in handwriting. The one who draws well is 
likely to be a keen observer (especially with his eyes), apt 
at picking out the striking and beautiful aspects of things. 
He can usually hold in mind what he has seen, and can turn 
it over and shift it about mentally without confusion. He 
ean discriminate small differences in size and color, is a 
good judge of the beautiful, and is quick at selecting old 
forms and figures and combining them into new and beauti- 
ful compositions. 
Interest may indicate either talent or a high development 
of ordinary ability, and ‘‘is of immense practical importance 
as an index of the energy which one is willing to expend in 
the development of one’s ability and in practical achieve- 
ment.” 
‘“‘What previous responses will help with this lesson?’”— 
The teacher should consider previous responses whenever 
she puts pencil to lesson plan. Drawing serves all other 
branches, but it has also a continuity of its own. If you 
have drawn a robin, you can go a long way toward drawing 
a crow — or almost any other bird. The Indian wigwam 
prepares for the tent of the Arab. Water is water and 
maples are maples, no matter in what composition they 
occur. The children will often discover these old elements 
in their new projects, and the teacher can help them dis- 
cover still more. One very skilful teacher has her pupils 
sketch the outline of an egg as a means to drawing a bird, 
then building on the head and tail and wing, and starting 
the legs ‘‘away back” and coming forward (toward the 
head) with them before putting on the feet. I find I can 
teach my students to draw a brain by showing them that 
it looks like a boxing glove. 
 
-P-A-G-E-239
    DRAWING 229 
It is also a plan approved by experts to let children under- 
take, without previous instruction, the drawing of some- 
thing in which they are interested and which they are to 
study later more fully, and find what responses are called 
forth. If the drawings are done on the board, or otherwise 
brought before the children so that they can jointly and 
severally offer criticisms and suggestions for making im- 
provements, the exercise ranks as one of the most valuable; 
for it causes each to note what he lacks and how he can 
make good the lack. 
Relation of the desired bonds. — The bonds necessary in 
drawing are related in every way. When we add line upon 
line till some simple form is outlined, we have bonds in 
series. When we draw a box above the level of the eye, at 
eye level, and then below eye level, we form a trunk line 
bond which will help us in the drawing of any box-like 
object (such as a house) in such positions. And when we 
put a number of well-mastered objects together — wigwam, 
fire, canoe, and lake — to form a new picture, as we do 
in pictorial composition, we are working with inclusive 
units. 
Herein lies the undoing of many a teacher of drawing: 
-she introduces too many difficulties at a time. Quite com- 
monly, too, she regards art as some mysterious sort of soul 
expression, and fails to begin with the humble sensori- 
motor side of it. 
Beginning with sensori-motor bonds. — In the last chapter 
was quoted a case in which unspoiled children looked with 
honest eyes and drew with honest pencils what they saw. 
That native simplicity should be encouraged. The first 
failure is often in the looking. Before you can “think a 
thought and mark a line around it,” you must make that
-P-A-G-E-240
  230 THE: CHILD’S! MIND 
thought’ very” clear’ and vivid, and the: way: todo ‘that is 
to'‘look before you let your pencil leap. 
Agassiz used to say that a pencil is the best: of: eyes, 
meaning that one must look carefully before: he ‘can ‘draw 
definitely!) That great ‘naturalist’ and teacher once left) a 
student with only a fish and a pencil for three days of study. 
The student afterward said it was the best lesson in’ zoology 
he ever had’ — and very likely it: was the best’ lesson he’ever 
had‘in drawing, too. 
Nor is sight the only sense to use in the did hogan of 
drawing. ‘Although pupilscam not: hear much ‘of what they 
are to picture by drawing, nor smell it, nor taste it, they:can 
touch it, move it;/run their hands along its outlines, mold iit, 
build it, trace it) in the air, cut its form from paper with 
guide‘lines’ or without, trace it, copy it, mark ‘around a 
paper cutting of it, and so on.” If ‘it” is a person (perhaps 
in a‘painting), they often get a great deal of help by'acting 
or posing like that ‘person, and seeing others do‘so. !)In 
this way they “catch the spirit’ of what is to be expressed. 
One ‘difficulty at a time: ‘The one big idea to graspias'a 
guide to introducing but one difficulty at a time is that ofia 
graphic vocabulary: In order to talk fluently, we must have 
a vocabulary of words, that is}'a stock of words that we have 
used until we can use them easily. “In order to draw fluently, 
we must ‘have a vocabulary of graphic units, that is, of things 
we have drawn until we can draw them easily. “In the old 
days; ‘this graphic vocabulary consisted’ of point, straight 
line, curved line, triangle, square, ete., on which the pupil 
practiced until’ he could make them all very prettily.’ Then 
he took up the various solids — cube, cone, and the rest "and 
studied them in different positions; above the eye, below the 
eye, to right; to left; and so on:» When his graphic vocabulary 
 
-P-A-G-E-241
  DRAWING 231 
was complete; he was ready to draw anything in any position: 
a tower was just a cylinder with some extra fixing om top, 
a tree or a fire was a cone with variations, and a‘chicken 
coop was a triangular prism. For an interested adult who 
is ready to undergo any kind of drubbing in order 'to:master 
the graphic art, this is not a bad way to learn it — though it 
tends to make one’a bit stiff and mechanical in his: work. 
But children are like those students of! music who, on begin- 
ning the violin or the piano, want to play a tune right away. 
We must build up a different kind of graphic vocabulary in 
working with children than we would in working with adults. 
How to build the graphic vocabulary of children. — Wedo 
this by fixing first the bonds that’ are easiest and most inter- 
esting; that occur most frequently, and that prepare the way 
for the greatest: number of bonds-to-be. 
There is noone’ way by which drawing must be started, 
no one kind of subject that must be drawn first. “But we are 
not likely to get through even the first grade without taking 
up the principal. parts of landscapes — mountains, ‘hills, 
plains, rivers, lakes; and trees: How'many types of tree are 
there? Only three in the drawing class, the deciduous (with 
or without leaves); the evergreen, and the tropical (such:as 
the palm), with its curving branches at the top. A child 
who has drawn these three until he can execute them easily 
and quickly, so that they have become a part of his graphic 
vocabulary, will be able to make at least a fair representation 
of any tree'that grows: (Of course we shall not force upon 
him any type to which his limited experience has not: yet 
introduced him.) ‘The same is true of mountains. Here 
again there are but three types, ‘‘the volcano, ‘the: low- 
rolling mountain; and the jagged rocky mountain.”’ + “With

-P-A-G-E-242
  232 THE CHILD’S MIND 
these three trunk line bonds fixed, variations can be intro- 
duced. 
In undertaking any special field of illustration — such as 
that of Indian life — teacher, or pupils, or both, should make 
an inventory of the graphic units likely to be needed — wig- 
wam, trees, canoe, etc. — and make each familiar (if it has not 
been studied before) by suitable exercises. 
Is there a complete graphic vocabulary? — We need not 
worry too much about graphic vocabulary, any more than 
we would about mastering all the words in the dictionary. 
By turning back (in this chapter) to “What bonds do we 
want to form?” we can readily discover what is necessary 
to a good working graphic vocabulary. It should include 
typical samples of (1) natural objects such as trees and 
smaller plants, (2) the elements of the landscape, (3) con- 
structed objects with straight and curved lines, (4) animal 
and perhaps human figures, and (5) simple geometrical forms 
for lettering and designing. And just as there must be 
practice in putting words into sentences, so there must be 
practice, from time to time, in combining these graphic 
units into pictorial compositions. For example, if a child 
has mastered, as a part of his graphic vocabulary, tent, 
tree, boat, and lake, he may be asked to illustrate a story 
about a camping trip. 
The artist speaks in words of color. Our units of expres- 
sion should, from the very start, in the first grade, include 
color. Crayons are usually employed at first, though some 
use water color from the beginning. But in grade four or 
thereabout the average pupil sloughs off his old ways and 
takes on new ones — or tries to. He wants his work more 
truthful, accurate, harmonious than before, both in pictur- 
ing and in designing — especially in decorative designing.
-P-A-G-E-243
   233 
  DRAWING 
Many teachers like to seize this opportunity for introducing 
water colors. 
In grade six, we can disclose a little, at least, of the mys- 
teries of perspective; and in the following grade, the elements 
of the theory of color! and of design. 
One difficulty at a time in beauty study. — What is beauty? 
It is the experience we have, I take it, when all our nerve 
cells, or about all that are active at the time, are working in 
harmony and not in conflict. And that is beautiful, or has 
beauty (using the word now to refer to objects and situations) 
which can bring about such a result. A pig lying in a puddle, 
muddy water on one side and sun shining on the other, must 
enjoy beauty to the pig limit. So does a boy (to the boy 
limit) in a tree of ripe cherries. Evidently, there are many 
grades and individual variations in this matter of beauty. 
One great trouble with our “‘ Picture Study” and “‘ Art Appre- 
ciation” in school courses has been that we were too deter- 
mined to make children find beauty in what seemed beautiful 
to us — or at least what we are supposed and expected to 
find beauty in if we lay claim to culture. We introduce too 
many difficulties at a time. As a boy may begin, in books, 
with the yellow-back and gradually work up to those of 
blue blood, so he may begin in beauty with the gaudy show 
bill and work up, at length, to Millet’s Angelus. 
The problem of Beauty is the problem of Readiness over 
again. That is beautiful which strikes pleasingly the chord 
of our instincts, our abilities, and our old habits. If, then, 
we know what any child likes to play, to read about, to 
draw — to do in general — we know what is beautiful to 
him. Look in his scrap book, if he keeps one, and the pic- 
     
    
         
    1A. H. Munsell, in his book, A Color Notation, has presented color by a 
method which might well be adopted by teachers everywhere.

tures' there «will: give xyouothe key to his heart: Or take 
him to the art museum and let him stay longest in the 
department he likes best... He takes pleasure, especially 
atian early iage, in the simple recognition of things familiar 
—a toy, a house, a game; and for years, perhaps, the photo- 
graph of the! old swimming hole is much more beautiful to 
him than Corot’s landseapes. As the first grade child loves 
to read stories of animals and of child life, so he enjoys pie> 
tures of these things. We owe a great debt to those makers 
of:primary readers who have illustrated their books beauti- 
fully;;and have warned us that the pictures are to be read 
as well as the print. 
It would be a hazardous matter to lay out an absolutely 
fixed.course in beauty craft, and we should not allow anyone 
to! inflict! such a thing upon us. But we shall know what 
to.do/at; any time with any child if we watch his interests 
and, make our work in beauty craft an expression of these,

_ Reddiness. — Motivation should be very easy in greqihin 
art-and} beauty craft, for there is scarcely an instinct that 
we cannot tap — action; manipulation; curiosity to ‘see 
how it will look’’;' play, in pictures at least, and dramatiz- 
ing the picture; group spirit, as when each draws:his part 
of. ai picture at the board, or codperates in ‘some artistic 
project.) Wei can even assure the pupil, that! the work

with éase What you are’ struggling to represent is Jittle 
short of ati inspiration.’ The teacher’ who has not learned 
blackboard sketching should try to add it to: her cee 
tions: 
Many teachers are coming to believe that the astreidiéal 
motive of’all in the teaching of drawing is the story-telling 
motive.’ The’ “story” may be taken from any other sub- 
ject, ay redding, history, language, or geography. Naturally; 
we shall’ take whatever theme we find our pupils» most 
enthusiastic ‘about, if it fits in at’ all well with the course in 
drawing. And” it seems quite possible to teach most’ of 
what is really necessary in drawing by following judiciously, 
the lead’ of these ‘‘stories” that ‘are pushing for expression. 
For'example, both nature study and the graphic art take on 
a new interest’ when the pupil can picture with his pencil; 
from ‘time 'to time, some phases in ‘the life of his pet seen 
or the growth of his pet plant. 
Devices’ help, too.’ The camera, ‘and perhaps the stetbo- 
scope‘and ‘steréopticon and moving picture, should) aidoin 
the study’ and ‘choice’ and creation of beauty; and: that 
teacher will be” blessed) by many’ of ‘her pupils whol will 
show them how, by looking with one eye through a one-inch 
by two-inch opening cut in a three-inch by. five-inch;card, 
to find beautiful pictures scattered over various portions of 
the landscape. 
Some killers of interest. — One great difficulty comes froma 
the teaching, of bonds that are useless or out of place. 
Many names and rules and definitions are of this type. 
Such’ word+bonds' have ‘little to do’ with’ artistic execution. 
What. we want are observation and action.. Too’ much 
detail;,as;in,the dry,.description of pictures.or the robnling 
of lives of artists, is also a weariness to pupil flesh.
-P-A-G-E-246
  236 THE CHILD’S MIND 
Another blunder lies in traditionalism — doing only what 
is commonly done and leaving all else undone. Why 
forbid the use of ruler and eraser? Mass drawing (filling 
in an area without first drawing the outline) and ‘blocking 
in” (fixing the extreme points of a group of objects and con- 
necting them as if by a string drawn round them before 
drawing the objects) are methods that seem unsuited to 
children; but they profit by copying and tracing and 
taking dictation line by line from the teacher, and why 
should they not do so? These methods do not kill origi- 
nality or spontaneity, but rather furnish a soil for them to 
grow in.! 
Of course the monotonous is always out of place. ‘I 
am tired of tomato soup and Madonnas!” said a little 
girl. She had found one at home and the other at school 
for too many days at a time. But children do not tire so 
soon of their own choices, and they can often help to choose. 
Exercise. — Let us take a sample topic. Let us suppose 
the pupils, through nature study, have become so interested 
in birds that they wish to tell bird stories by drawing. 
The essentials in any such project are three: 
1. Purpose 
2. Materials 
3. Practice 
All three are very frequently neglected, so that many 
pupils do not know just what it is they are trying to do, 
nor do they see enough forms (pictures) of the general 
1 Tt will generally be found that when the instructor, casting aside the tra- 
ditions of the art school and the methods which the adult uses readily, will 
frankly accept the method natural to the children and will utilize its particular 
possibilities, good results will be speedily obtained. — Sargent and Miller. 
Op. cit., p. 180. 
 
-P-A-G-E-247
DRAWING 237 
kind they are going to make, nor do they have practice 
enough on any one form to fix it as a unit in their graphic 
vocabulary. 
Discussion clears up the first — discussion stimulated by 
very definite questions. “What is the bird doing?” If 
any similar birds have already been drawn, let us review 
their shapes. 
The children may have their own independent trial 
first —on the sparrow, say (producing results like those 
of Figure 26). Class criticism is then in order, each child, 
or at least several, placing his drawing before the class 
while the teacher asks just what can be done to make it 
better. It is often found that such class criticism is more 
helpful than that of the teacher. 
There is now a dawning ideal and a consciousness of need. 
Further materials are wanted — a new look at the birds, a 
view of stuffed specimens, pictures showing how sparrows 
have been put on paper by other people. The school mu- 
seum should accumulate collections of pictures, classified, 
so that material can be found on many subjects, from the 
sculpture of the ancient Greeks to the life of the ‘little 
frosty Eskimo.” Older children will collect notes on these 
things, in the form of sketches. 
A hektographed bird can be given out, to be traced (look 
out for good hand position and pencil holding). Turning 
the tracing paper over gives us a second view of the spar- 
row. (See B and C in Figure 27.) After several tracings, 
the bird may be cut out, and other freehand cuttings 
made. 
Perhaps we shall next trace the form in the air, or hold the 
hand so as to indicate the slant of certain lines, or lay sticks 
to outline the form. The teacher may then dictate the.

Figure »27.)) Perhaps. she will draw. several; sparrows ;on 
paper like that used by the pupils, then throw them away: 
Golor, if wanted, can be'laid on after the peneil,work is done.

but we shall go through some series of steps that) will im- 
press thoroughly: the form to be drawn, and which. ap- 
proaches the tandem method) in giving guidance and pre- 
venting errors. 
Suggestions as to beauty craft. — One of the. best) ap- 
proaches to the study of, pictures is through the project: of 
making pictures.» We want to draw a tree. ‘‘How did Rosa 
Bonheur draw trees?’’ And the same with other subjects. 
We have more respect for the work of the artist when! we 
see what we ourselves can do. 
Often the picture or other beauty piece can be left todo 
its perfect:work by simply being placed in the schooltoom. 
Some-teachers have a beauty corner and get the pupils: to 
‘Swatch ‘this':space,’’ for there appears one ‘zsthetic ‘speci> 
men after another — a shell, a bird, a sewing sample, a! box; 
a picture. Suitable pictures can be obtained. “‘for a song”

geography, nature study. Sometimes we can: get quite.a 
rushrof beauty feeling by a’ double process, suchas expos+ 
ing a picture of Spring and at the same time ‘singing the 
“Spring Song.” 
We must make this subject of beauty craft as useful as 
we can. We may go about town (tactfully, of course) pass- 
ing our judgment on architecture and parks and the laying 
out of streets, and chasing ugliness as the Dutch chase dirt.

choice of clothing, of wall papers and borders, of all that we 
hang on our figures or surround ourselves with. And this 
is about the only subject in the elementary school in which 
we have such an opportunity. 
Effect. — The grand effect is that of ‘‘There! I’ve done it, 
and it’s good.”’ It is a pleasure like that of the Creator, 
who looked upon his work and pronounced it good. 
There are, of course, the general conditions to be checked 
up. Is the environment artistic, at home and at school and 
about the neighborhood? Is our pupil in good condition, or 
has he no energy left with which to feel the thrill of beauty? 
Has the teacher any contagious enthusiasm? Is the draw- 
ing a natural expression of the pupil’s interests, or does the 
teacher (as a pupil of mine expressed it) ‘‘stick up some- 
thing in the front of the room and say, ‘Now draw that’”’? 
Is there a suitable special stimulus for each lesson? And 
are the pupils guided and practiced on appropriate work 
by the tandem method until they can produce something 
satisfying? 
When these conditions are carefully attended to, even 
children of moderate ability, finding that they can do what 
they had supposed to be away beyond them, often work 
with such a will that they equal the talented. Their in- 
creased willingness to attack future tasks is a real gain. 
Testing essential bonds. — The graphic art and beauty 
craft do not lend themselves so readily to finely standard- 
ized tests as do the more mechanical branches. But definite 
teaching welcomes definite testing. We can ask for repro 
ductions, by memory or otherwise, of the units of the graphi 
vocabulary we have taught, and we can require reasonabl 
recombinations of these old forms into new pictorial compo 
sitions.

An attempt to introduce standardized measurements into 
the subject appears in Thorndike’s drawing scale.! In Sar- 
gent and Miller’s excellent book appears a chapter on “‘In- 
terests and Standards of Attainment” — very practical and 
helpful. 
CLASS EXERCISE 
Let each prepare a very brief lesson in drawing or beauty 
craft to be given to the class as if to a group of children. Any 
simple subject may be taken — a flower, a hill, a toy, lettering 
or designing. Not all the steps outlined in this chapter need be 
taken, but enough should be presented to show how the work is 
planned. 
Some may present a sample of picture study, with so much 
about picture and artist as is thought suitable. Perhaps others 
will be able to introduce color harmony in wall paper, clothing, 
etc., or give at least a fragment of a lesson involving perspective. 
FOR FURTHER STUDY 
1. Do you think that having children copy and trace, dictating 
to them line by line, etc., will suppress their originality or free 
expressiveness? Why or why not? 
2. How do you explain Manuel’s findings, that talent in draw- 
ing has little to do with general intelligence, linguistic ability, 
general motor superiority, or achievement in handwriting? 
3. How comes it that an artist can paint one kind of subject 
well, but usually not all kinds? 
4. If you have an illustrated picture catalog, how can you find 
which pictures are best to order for your school? 
5. How were you taught drawing? Do you approve the 
method? Why or why not?

    Exercise.— Suppose you are in some foreign country — 
France, let us say. You know something, but not much, of French 
life and ways, and you have learned a little, but only a little, of 
the French language. As you have imitated the talk of the street, 
your speech is full of errors. Please grant also that you have a 
preference for gutter French as it falls from the lips of your 
cronies, and feel embarrassed and somewhat ashamed of yourself 
when circumstances compel you to adopt the correct and elegant 
kind. 
You have a teacher of French whose aim is to have you express 
yourself in good French whenever you speak or write. You speak 
a great deal and write a little, especially letters. What would you 
advise him to do in order to secure Readiness, Exercise, and Effect 
in your nerve cells? In particular, what exercises should he spend 
most time on, and in what order? Outline the method and indi-. 
cate the kind of exercises you would like to be put through. 
What is composition? — Suppose we look up the word in 
the dictionary. Com means with, or together; and the rest 
of the word means putting, or placing. Composition is sim- 
ply putting things together. The chef composes a fine salad 
for us by putting together tomatoes and lettuce and cucum- 
bers and dressing; and the salad is composed of these things. 
The bricklayer composes a brick house by putting bricks to- 
gether. The artist, as we have seen, has his pictorial com- 
position: he puts together lines and colors from his graphic 
vocabulary and composes a picture. The musician has his 
musical composition: he puts together tones, which are the

     units of his musical vocabulary, and composes a tune. The 
professional dancer puts together steps and trips and skips, 
which are the units of her dancing vocabulary, and com- 
poses a new caracole or gambado. We compose in language 
when we put together the units of our verbal vocabulary — 
that is, words — to tell what is in our minds, express our 
ideas and feelings. 
Just as we speak of drawing and related art as graphic 
expression, so we might well speak of composition as ver- 
bal expression, that is, expression in words. 
Whence came grammar? — Our old cave-man ancestors 
talked a great deal and did some drawing, but had no writ- 
ten language and no grammar. Later, when written lan- 
guage had become fixed and spoken language went on 
changing, it became necessary to have rules and other helps 
to tell what the old writings meant. You know how many 
disagreements have grown out of different interpretations of 
the Bible even to-day.! So, several centuries before Christ, 
the Hindus in order to preserve the sacred meaning of their 
sacred books, and the Greeks in order to preserve, intact, 
the written teachings of their philosophers, worked out the 
rules which their revered writers had apparently followed; 
and these sets of rules were grammar. When the language 
had become standardized in this way, other writers felt that 
they should keep to the same standards. Grammar became 
o important that it was regarded as the very ‘‘source and 
oundation”’ of the seven liberal arts of the middle ages, it- 
elf being the first of the seven. ‘‘Grammar,” said a lead- 
1 What does it mean to you when you read, in Psalms 88: 13, ‘In the morn- 
g shall my prayer prevent Thee,” or -in Psalms 119: 147, “TI prevented the 
awning of the morning, and cried’’? If you have had even a little Latin, you

ing writer, of that time,! ‘‘is the science which teaches us to 
explain the poets and historians; it is the art which quali- 
fies us to write and speak correctly.” He urged that it be 
taught in every Christian school. 
We must.remember that in those days there was no such 
thing as a dictionary as»we know.it: Grammar included the 
study of sounds and letters, syllables and words,’ sentences 
and figures of speech.; One who studies a modern spelling 
book or dictionary»is studying what was then grammar. 
For a long time the subject has been shrinking; and yet for 
a long time we have gone on teaching it as if) it. were as 
important.as' ever. 
What is grammar? — The study of grammar,:as: we know 
it, is hardly necessary to, teach us to understand! our pres- 
ent-day writers. If, we,see the words ‘‘eye’”’ and “glass” 
together; we can usually tell without any difficulty: whether 
the hero had:a glass eye or anjeyeglass.. And as:for speak+ 
ing and writing correctly, one of my college professors, who 
had meéver studied English grammar at all, lectured fluently 
and.well.and wrote)several books. 
Grammar is simply the rules of the language game as the 
best players play it.. You may do this and you may not 
do that.’ Why?, Simply: because Shakespeare, Milton, Ad- 
dison, and others have or have not done so. But:the ‘‘rules”” 
are: stated. in, difficult’ terms !sometimes, terms! which date 
back to; antiquity. . And. further, the rules of the language 
game, like those of other games, |change from time to time. 
For-instance, only: a: few hundred: years ago, it) was consid- 
ered the best of English to use the double negative: “They 
don’t show no! honor to no man” meant (as we’ would say) 
‘They’ show honor to no mian.’’ People of those days

COMPOSITION AND GRAMMAR 247 
assumed, just as children seem to to-day, that if one 
negative is strong, two or three must be stronger. 
Teachers spend many aching hours trying to rid their 
pupils’ speech of such ‘errors’; and must continue to do 
so, though many errors of the present will be good English 
idioms by and by. 
Relation of composition and grammar.— Not so many 
years ago, a chapter like this one would have been called 
“Grammar and Composition,” instead of ‘‘Composition and 
Elementary Grammar”; for it was supposed that, just as 
one had to learn his Latin grammar before he could do 
much with the Latin prose composition, so he had to master 
English grammar before he could do much with English 
prose composition. Even yet, my students often tell me, 
“You certainly cannot speak correctly until you have learned 
the rules for speaking correctly.” This is like saying that 
you cannot play ball until you have committed your rule 
book to memory. But even the referee has a rule book in 
his pocket — and excellent players may not be able to put 
the rules into words. 
A group of us once ventured to play football, and early 
asked the coach about the rules of the game. ‘‘Never mind 
about the rules,’ said he. ‘Learn the rules by breaking 
the rules.” This may have been rash advice, but it was 
his emphatic way of telling us that if we were going to start 
in by loading up our minds with rules and then apprehen- 
sively trying to obey them all, we should never get any- 
where with football. 
Sensori-motor bonds come first, and high-level rules 
later. 
Children should learn a game by playing the game. They 
should learn the rules by playing, picking up one new point

248 THE CHILD’S MIND 
at atime. And this holds true of the language game. We 
have been drawing too sharp a line between composition 
and grammar. Children should not realize where one leaves 
off and the other begins. The “rules” should grow naturally 
out of the ‘‘game,” and be practiced in one after another as 
they appear. 
Just as nature study and elementary science lead to life 
craft, and drawing and elementary graphic expression lead 
to beauty craft, so composition and elementary sentence 
science lead to word craft — the skilful use of words to at- 
tain our ends. Grammar, considered as the technical sci- 
: ence of the sentence, has no more place in the elementary 
school than has any other closely organized science such as 
physics or chemistry. We should no more separate gram- 
mar from composition and teach it as a pure science in the 
grades than we would separate ‘“‘elementary science” from 
nature study and teach that as a pure science, or separate 
from the study of drawing the abstract principles of art and 
teach them as a distinct subject in the eighth grade. Or- 
ganized, abstract science of any kind is not now taught 
below the high school — or better still, it is taught above 
the junior high school (ninth grade), where the more mature 
mind of the student is ready for it. The object of the ele- 
mentary school is to do things, and that requires a different 
form of organization for what we teach. It is word craft and 
sentence craft that we want here. 
What responses do we want? — The responses we want 
are those that our pupils will need most in their talking-and- 
writing future. The chief use most of them will ever make 
of the language lies in conversation in the family or social 
circle, over the telephone, in the office, ‘“‘on the job,’ or 
wherever else two or more are so situated that somebody 
 
-P-A-G-E-259
  COMPOSITION AND GRAMMAR 249 
can talk and somebody listen. So far as earning a living 
and doing the world’s work is concerned, there must be a 
great deal of giving and taking of orders and directions — an 
exercise in which there should be more practice, perhaps, in 
our schools. Closely associated with this is the rare art of 
hearing a story straight and passing it on straight, as we 
are all expected to do for truth’s sake, and as newspaper 
and business men must do for safety’s sake. 
The letter is the most common form of written composi- 
tion, and this is simply a one-sided conversation or business 
message put on paper. When it comes to wills and contracts 
and other important documents, we usually employ a law- 
yer —in other words, a specialist. But everyone should be 
able to write a news item, or keep the minutes of a meeting, 
or serve as secretary of any ordinary organization, or set 
forth simply his views (if he has any) on matters of public 
interest. 
These seem like modest demands. Probably the school 
could meet them with ease if it would proceed directly, 
sensibly, and simply. One great trouble with us teachers 
is that we try to teach all we know, or wish we knew, about 
each branch. We want to make great scientists of our pupils 
in the elementary science class, old masters of them in the 
drawing class, and great authors of them in the mother 
tongue class. No child can safely expand so far in so many 
directions. The present-day plan is that of abundant prac- 
tice in a few fundamentals. 
What bonds shall we form? — We want, says Sheridan — 
“1. To turn out pupils able to stand before the class and 
alk for a minute or two upon a subject within the range of 
heir knowledge or experience, speaking plainly, in clean-cut 
entences, and without common grammatical mistakes. 
       
                                            
      
     
-P-A-G-E-260
  250 THE CHILD’S MIND 
“2. To turn out pupils able to write with fair facility an 
original paragraph upon a subject within the range of their 
experience or their interests.” 1 
Such a paragraph is to be composed of real sentences, not 
of mere strings of words, should be free from “glaring gram- 
matical mistakes,’ with common words spelled correctly, 
common marks of punctuation used rightly, and words 
chosen and arranged fitly. 
Here, then, are the essentials: there must be an experience, 
and that experience must go aptly into words. We are to 
build experience-to-word bonds. Further, those bonds must 
work in any situation, especially (in case of oral language) 
in the presence of other people. We can readily see, too, 
that it is not enough to teach connections for words in isola- 
tion; one might “swallow the dictionary” and still speak or 
write poorly. There must be many bonds for combining 
words. A German who had several dogs of different sizes 
stated that ‘Der littlest dog was der biggest.” His wife 
begged indulgence for him, explaining that what he really 
meant was that ‘Der youngest dog vas der oldest.” The 
fact was that the youngest dog was the largest. 
Oral language requires that there be bonds for using a 
good quality of voice,’ for pronouncing words correctly and 
speaking them out clearly, and for giving appropriate expres-

question. Written language, ‘‘paper work,” requires bonds

child said, ‘‘to put a decimal point after every sentence that 
makes a statement.” He had, at least, the right idea. 
What related responses can the child make already? — 
The baby is born ‘with no language but a cry.” At one 
year of age, less or more, he begins to speak a few isolated 
words. A year later, he may have a vocabulary of 400 words, 
and babble interminably. According to the Binet tests, at 
the age of six (the usual school-entering age), he can carry 
out three simple commands all given at once; can repeat 
after dictation a sentence of fifteen short words; and can 
define common objects in terms of use, as when he says ‘‘A 
fork is to eat with.” Two years later, when we should ex- 
pect to find him in the second grade, he can define things 
in terms superior to use, can write an easy sentence from 
dictation, and has a vocabulary of words understood that 
reaches to about 3600. At third-grade age (9) he can find 
rhymes for simple words, and can use three words, such as 
boy, river, and ball, in one sentence. Some of his more 
marked achievements beyond that point are the giving of 
sixty words at random in three minutes and the reporting 
successfully of a news item which he has read (age 10-12); 
and (two years later) the putting together of dissected sen- 
tences and the discovery of the lesson in a fable which is 
read to him. 
We must guard against taking it for granted that our 
learner is skilled in reading, writing, and spelling just be- 
cause he is studying those subjects. The average pupil 
suffers considerable hindrance in all three branches, I have 
no doubt, up to the seventh grade. How long would it take 
you to learn to read, write, and spell the words of a foreign 
language so well that you would not be hindered in compo- 
sition? 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
  252 THE CHILD’S MIND 
The great trouble when the child comes to school, is that 
he has formed too many bonds, has made too many re- 
sponses already. In careless homes and in the still more 
reckless streets he has picked up ‘‘the English slanguage.”’ * 
He has broken all the rules of the language game, but he 
has not learned the rules themselves because there was no 
umpire there to tell him about his errors and inflict penal- 
ties. The teacher must now try, on the basis of a few 
minutes practice per day with the pupil, to beat an oppo- 
nent who has several years the start of her, and who prac- 
tices on him in about all the time there is. In our parent- 
teacher meetings, we must tell this tale and raise a violent 
ery of protest. Mothers must stop sending to us their bent 
and broken little twigs with the expectation that we can 
make stalwart trees of them; and business men must stop 
the pharisaic performance of binding applicants for positions 
with heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, in the way of 
office requirements in English, while they refuse to go home 
and so much as raise a finger to lift one of these burdens. 
The “failures” we teachers turn out are the little linguistic 
wrecks whom the wives of these business men sent in to us 
a few years before. 
Lispers and stutterers. — Some two or three per cent of 
our pupils fail to respond well in oral language because of 
lisping or stuttering. Lisping is the more common and the 
less serious, being often a mere continuance of baby talk. 
It consists in omitting or transposing or distorting sounds, 
as in the familiar case of pronouncing s as if it were th. If 
the lisping does not persist beyond the age of six, there is 
nothing to worry about. If it continues, the teacher must| 
not be too insistent on having each sound produced ac 
cording to standard, especially if the pupil shrinks fro 
     
                                                    
-P-A-G-E-263
COMPOSITION AND GRAMMAR 253 
speaking, or is nervous or self-distrustful, but should show 
the child in individual lessons how to correct his error. 
General hygiene should be carefully looked after, and so 
much special drill given on sound production as the child 
seems well able to bear. Often he can be shown, by ex- 
ample, just how to place his speech organs so as to master 
the baffling sound with ease. Lisping usually decreases 
rapidly from the first grade on to the sixth. It is usually 
caused by the child’s placing his tongue wrongly when his 
front teeth are missing — a habit sometimes continued after 
the new teeth have grown. Any case that proves unusually 
troublesome or persistent should be referred to a specialist. 
To stutter is “‘to utter with spasmodic hesitations or repe- 
titions,” or even not to utter at all. Most cases appear in 
childhood, and frequently before the age of six. It is three 
times as frequent among boys as among girls, the explana- 
tion being (in part at least) that so many more boys are 
left-handed and have their speech disturbed by being com- 
pelled to shift from the left hand to the right. The difficulty 
often dates from some disease or some mental shock such 
as fright. Scripture’s explanation, as shown in Figure 28, 
is that a brain connection is blocked by some emotional 
disturbance. This appears reasonable, for if the individual 
speaks in a high voice, or sings, he may not stutter at all; 
he is using a different set of bonds. Also, one who stutters 
when speaking his mother tongue is not likely to stutter 
when speaking a foreign language which he learned later. 
In nine cases out of ten, stuttering can be cured, and the 
cure can usually be effected in a few months. As the two 
great causes seem to be brain weakness (such as may re- 
sult from the exhaustion of disease) and brain blocking, 
the two great remedies are bodily hygiene and mental

the emotional blocking by using the high tones of “queer speech,’’ or if he 
sings, he may not stutter. The cure consists in establishing ‘normal speech”’ 
bonds. — Adapted from Scripture’s Stuttering and Lisping. The Macmillan

treatment. Considerable success has been won by special 
health schools. The mental treatment consists in removing 
all inhibitors, such as family comment, or school ridicule, 
or obvious pity; and strengthening all facilitators, espe- 
cially the feeling of confidence — ‘I can control my 
speech.” While a special teacher is desirable, the mental 
treatment, with simple and carefully graded speech exer- 
cises, can be given by any teacher who has the confidence 
of the pupil and the patience to work with him. More of 
the method is given in the class exercise at the close of 
this chapter. 
How are the wished-for bonds related? — First, as the 
baby learns to talk, come independent bonds for isolated 
words; but connections in series soon follow. Outside my 
window, young children are repeating, twenty times over, 
“Heny, meeny, miny, mo,” and all the rest of that classic 
rhyme. They have formed for it almost a circular reaction 
(see Chapter II). It means next to nothing, but so does a 
great deal of what we say in conversation when we repeat 
the old phrases. Series bonds are in usé whenever we memo- 
rize. It is easy to overuse them. We naturally suspect the 
mental ability of any one who memorizes his lessons instead 
of thinking them out. For the memorizer does not have a 
fighting command of the words in his memorized series; 
they are only entrained, and always in the same way. Be- 
fore he can really mobilize them and use them for his own 
varied purposes, he must break up his series into units, into 
words and phrases, and practice combining and recombin- 
ing them in ways that are new and varied. Material chosen 
to be memorized should be so dear to the reader and so fine 
that it will be read and conned over and over until it scarcely 
needs to be memorized at all. 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
    
256 THE CHILD’S MIND 
Trunk line bonds appear at every turn. All our conjuga- 
tions and other set forms are examples of them. The student 
who has learned the forms of amo finds that he has mastered 
the conjugation of many another Latin verb. Similarly, our 
pupils must be brought to see, when the time is ripe, that if 
they are faithful in fixing the forms of a few verbs, they 
thereby become rulers over many verbs — but the pupil 
should practice this as composition before he comprehends 
it as grammar. 
No one can use a language readily until he has learned to 
marshal numerous groups of its words as inclusive units 
and send them to their duty with a single mental command, 
as the muscian plays a complex chord or run by one act of 
will. Such phrases as ‘‘If I were you,” ‘‘ May I ask you for,” 
“In the circumstances,” and thousands of others, come to 
be, with practice, not so much collections of separate words 
as single utterance-units, all of a piece — standardized little 
vocal runs which, once started, will run themselves while we 
are thinking what next to say. 
The upshot of the whole matter is, that words are so many 
soldiers in our language army. On occasion, they may act 
alone; sometimes we may have them file by in fixed order; 
but we want most to be able to command them by squads, 
and platoons, and companies, or if we aim to be expert, 
perhaps even by battalions and regiments and divisions and 
armies, and to combine these units quite complexly. But 
the good drill master knows that a company is only a large 
squad, and an army only a large company. It is the ‘‘school 
of the soldier” as an individual, and the school of the squad, 
that count. We must aim first to get our pupils to master 
individual words, and especially to command these words 
easily and accurately in simple sentences and paragraphs.

COMPOSITION AND GRAMMAR 257 
From sensori-motor to high level — from experience to 
expression. — We have found that nerve currents run one 
way only; they are not reversible. Now, the way for com- 
position bonds to work is from experience to expression. 
The baby falls naturally into the right method: something 
round rolls out on the floor; he sees it, scrambles for it, and 
ejaculates ‘‘Ball!’”’ Romantic Lorenzo does the same thing. 
He enjoys the moonlight with Jessica and exclaims, ‘‘How 
sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank! Sit, Jessica.” 
And then he expresses to her still more of his experience. 
One who wishes to be facile in expression should at least 
make note of the phrases that flash into mind as the experi- 
ence is going on. A good time to describe a sunset is when 
you are right there in the presence of the sunset. Name 
its colors and describe its misty glow of glory and tell what 
thoughts and feelings it gives you. Authors have their com- 
panion notebook for such times, and let no good phrase es- 
cape. They even seek experiences as a stimulus to the 
pouring forth of words. 
Or, one may give himself up wholly to the event as it 
passes, live it intensely, and then call it back and describe it. 
John Burroughs tells us! his works have all been done in 
the spirit of play; that he would lose himself in a nature 
study trip of some kind by water, field, or wood, and later 
discover that all during this time he had almost unwittingly 
been gathering material for a new book. In writing the 
book he relived his trip, enjoying the literary reproduction 
of it more even than he had the original. 
Now, the method used in school is too often the reverse 
of this. We place before our pupils a picture which repre- 
sents no experience of theirs, and in which they may not be 
1 Wake Robin, p. xi.

  258 THE CHILD’S MIND 
interested, and expect that to inspire expression. Or we give 
them a model from some master author and hope the bonds 
will work from his words back through their experiences and 
so down through their tongues. The situation is much like 
that wherein one boy calls to another who is looking for a 
lost ball, ‘Pick it up first, Johnny, and look for it after- 
ward.” It is almost as bad to expect pupils to pick up 
words first and look for the experience afterward. 
Underscore this in your notebook: From experience to 
expression. 
One difficulty at a time — talk before writing.— The 
child as he comes to us is a natural babbler. How pass 
gradually from this stage to that in which he has the tongue 
of a ready speaker and the pen of a ready writer? One 
point stands out above all else: Talk before writing — and 
keep on with talking before writing even after the pupil can 
compose with his pen, as the best means to better writing. 
First of all, we must train the little people out of their 
baby talk; for no less than a fourth of them, when they 
enter the first grade, have not put away all their babyish 
habits of speech. They still lisp and are clumsy, and manage 
their little sound factories very awkwardly. It should be a 
part of the work in language —and one of the first parts — 
to train the tones till they are smooth and musical, and the 
lips and other organs to shape the sounds with a caressing 
kind of deftness and accuracy. 
Writing is a heavy burden added. Attention flies to pencil 
and fingers and paper and spelling and capital letters and 
periods. To make a new writer express himself in writing 
is much like having to send all your messages by flag sig- 
nalling or telegraph; or, if you are unpracticed in typewrit- 
ing, to compose all your letters on the machine.
-P-A-G-E-269
  
COMPOSITION AND GRAMMAR 259 
But further, our best writers seem to be those who talk 
to their readers. Some of them, while writing, bring the 
reader before them in imagination and speak to him directly, 
as you do, perhaps, when you write to a friend. (I am 
imitating these good writers by imagining you are here 
with me now.) Our pupils, then, are following a standard 
process if they discuss every subject before they write 
about it. Speech is more plastic than writing. We must 
shape our subject in the air before we let it harden into 
lines on paper. ; 
One step further: as speech comes before ability to 
write, so does thought come before speech. Thinking is 
not merely talking to one’s self,’ and even if it were, a little 
self-conversation would be the best of preparation for talk- 
ing to somebody else. To “think before you speak” is 
just another case of prevision in learning. Gradually, we 
pass directly from thinking to writing — ‘‘think what we 
shall write.”” The better we know the game, the better 
we can look ahead, anticipate what is likely to happen, 
and make it happen right. If children learn first to “feel 
the swing” of oral phrases and sentences, they will feel later, 
when they write, just where commas and periods should go, 
and with what effect their sentences will flow off the paper 
into the mind of the reader. 
1 Even experts sometimes assert that thinking is talking to one’s self, or 
speaking low, or sub-vocalizing; that the child who cannot tell a thing does 
not know it, ete. This is the error of one, probably, who naturally thinks in 
words. But surely thinking may be carried on in any kind of mental unit — 
in colors and shapes by the artist, in tones by the musician, in touches and move- 
ments by the motor-minded. The child who ‘knows but cannot tell” may 
prove to you by an action test that he does know. A stutterer may fly into a 
rage and rush round in a circle because he cannot utter what he has thought. 
And in what terms does a deaf mute think? 
   
-P-A-G-E-270
260 ‘THE CHILD'S MIND 
Standard courses of study give all the composition time 
in the first grade to oral work, and from about four fifths 
of it in the second grade down to about one half of it in 
grades seven and eight. 
Here, then, is another entry for your notebook: Talking 
before writing. Thinking before speaking. 
Which bonds shall we form first? — Which expressions 
are easiest and most interesting to learn, occur most fre- 
quently, and prepare the way best for all that we have to 
teach later? If you were in Paris, learning French, you 
would want to find out first how to say “‘Good morning” 
and ‘‘How do you do?” how to carry on table talk, call up a 
friend on the telephone or call on him at his home, ask 
for what you want at a store, carry on conversation at a 
party and leave politely at its close. The child, who is 
much like a little foreigner among us, so far as language and 
manners are concerned, needs, also, to know how to express 
his desires. To guide her through first and second grade 
language work, the teacher who needs it should have a 
little book on American daily life, patterned after similar 
books on French daily life. 
And you, teacher, you are the Great American in your 
grade — speak as you want Young America to speak. 
How few can say ‘“‘Good morning” and make the morning 
seem as good as it should! Make a play and a party of all 
these daily-life occurrences — dramatize them, not stiffly, 
leaving the feeling that there is only one way to do them 
and that we are in serious danger of missing that way; 
but with the kindly spirit of democracy and good fellow- 
ship in the foreground all the time. Let the pupils 
meet and say ‘‘Good morning,” enter the room, and leave 
it, make calls on each other, talk on an improvised tele- 
 
-P-A-G-E-271
  COMPOSITION AND GRAMMAR 261 
phone, hold a party, keep store, dramatize the reading 
lessons. Nor need it be all dramatics; there can be a real 
party, with real parents present, and perhaps with real 
sandwiches. 
From oral work to written.— How can we make the im- 
portant transition from oral to written work one step at a 
time? (1) Letter cards may be arranged so as to reproduce 
the sentences in the reading book. (2) The pupil may copy 
in writing some easy matter from the book, perhaps some- 
‘thing he has already formed with letter cards. (3) The 
children may be given hektographed copies, in the teacher’s 
handwriting, of a short and very familiar story, from which 
are omitted certain words that are to be filled in. (4) The 
teacher may write on the board a four-line memory poem, 
have it observed, and then erase all but the first and the 
last words of each line. Pupils are to try to reproduce the 
whole. (5) The children may form, with the letter cards, 
whatever words or sentences they please, have their work 
corrected, and then copy it in writing. (6) The teacher 
writes on the board a short, familiar memory gem, erases it, 
and asks the pupils to reproduce it in writing. ‘ (7) The 
class “talks up” a story paragraph of about three sentences. 
The teacher writes it on the board, has it observed, and then 
erases parts or all of it and asks the pupils to tell the story 
in writing. (8) A similar story, after being “talked up,” is 
dictated by the teacher. (9) A story, after being orally 
created, is written by the pupils without further guidance. 
Other exercises may be used, and some classes may not 
need such carefully graded steps and so much guidance. 
But the list will help us plan. 
Coaching the language team. — If we are coaching a tennis 
player or team, we may notice first that the service is poor,
-P-A-G-E-272
  
262 THE CHILD’S MIND 
and concentrate on that. Then perhaps our team loses 
because of a poor backhand drive, and we go after that. 
Lobbing is the next worst point, and we practice it hard 
for a time. So it goes through all the points of the 
game, and then we take them all up again, and again, and 
again. 
This is about what the teacher of composition must do — 
find the weak places in the work of her grade and strengthen 
them. A book on this subject, especially in lower grades, 
is a kind of necessary evil — necessary because most teach- 
ers do not have time to do their own planning. But we 
should feel perfectly free to skip about wherever we please 
in the book if we are to gain anything from it. This week 
we may attack mispronunciations especially, next week 
double negatives, after that the past tenses of verbs. If 
there is any such thing as an ideal course of study in compo- 
sition, it seems not to have been produced. The coach 
must decide what the team most needs — and what each 
player most needs. 
There comes a time, in the seventh and eighth grades, 
when the pupils can profit by a clear view of the sentence, 
element after element, subject, predicate, adjective modifiers, 
adverb modifiers, and so on through the list, systematically, 
one difficulty added at a time, with each difficulty mastered 
by composition practice. This is what is meant by ‘‘ele- 
mentary grammar.” The great majority of children like it 
when it is properly presented, as has been shown by actual 
vote sufficiently widespread to be representative. They 
should have what they need, in simple, direct, and effective 
form, discovering principles from practice and again apply- 
ing them in practice, to make sure that it is ‘‘composition- 
grammar.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
  
  COMPOSITION AND GRAMMAR 263 
Readiness. — Feeling is first, form follows, in language as 
in everything else. To make a train of thought move, there 
must be some fire at the head of it. 
Environment is the great motivator. Some go so far as to 
say that if a child has the right kind of social environment 
there is little need to teach him language, and if he does not 
have home surroundings which are conducive to good Eng- 
lish there is little use in trying to teach him to speak correctly. 
It is the herd instinct that controls the herd. Even the well 
educated feel rather sheepish and ashamed to use good Eng- 
lish where it does not prevail. We throw in a little slang or 
a few careless expressions as evidences of democracy and 
good companionship, to indicate that we are all on a level 
and understand each other. All-round-town English needs 
an annual Clean-Up Week about fifty-two times a year. All 
those who want to help the teacher bear his burden, can do 
no better thing than to look to their speech, especially when- 
ever they are in the presence of children. 
“Good English Week” and ‘‘Better Speech Week” indi- 
cate an effort in this direction. At such a time, talks on 
better English may be given, children may make posters in 
the drawing class, and each try to reform his neighbor by 
catching him in his evil ways. In all this enthusiasm of re- 
form, we must take care to exercise and strengthen the 
bonds for the good forms, and to let those for the bad ones 
sink out of attention as much as possible. 
But the atmosphere of the schoolroom is more directly 
under the control of the teacher. ‘‘Am I among enemies or 
friends?” is the question that wells up instinctively in the 
hearts of all of us whenever we join a group. When have 
you made your best speeches and conversed most volubly? 
When you felt that the audience or the party was made up 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
264 THE CHILD’S MIND 
of people who were friendly and sympathetic, and that you 
were having a good time with them. Now, somebody must 
create this spirit in your schoolroom, and that somebody is 
you. Do not lash yourself into that foolish over-sprightliness 
of manner that so many teachers assume and then wear 
yourself out by doing all the talking. Take rather the atti- 
tude of the good and sensible. hostess who entertains by 
getting her guests to talk. 
A suitable task and stimulus.— And what is it that 
“draws people out”? The feeling that they have something 
to say, and that somebody wants to hear them say it. One 
teacher states that the best oral language lesson he ever 
heard was developed by having the boys of the class ex- 
plain their games to the girls, and the girls explain their 
doings to the boys, both using blackboard drawings. Hz- 
perience before expression — and everybody’s experience has 
been different from everybody else’s. But we can hardly 
assign to a child the general subject of ‘“My Experience.” 
We can ask him to tell about ‘‘The Game I Like Best,”’ or 
“How I Would Spend a Hundred Dollars,” or even such a 
mundane matter as ‘‘The Best Thing I Ever Ate.” Com- 
position should be the verbal re-living of life. 
Special stimuli are many. The suitable task is itself the 
best. Language games are widely played, and some good 
teachers feel that they cannot be played too much. Many 
can be found in books,1 and we should not hesitate to invent 
others of our own. For instance, if we want to put an end to 
“hain’t got,’’ we may let one pupil be a man buying things, 
and the others have only those things with names beginning

       COMPOSITION AND GRAMMAR 265 
with a letter which the teacher puts on the board and 
erases while the buyer’s back is turned. He who is ‘‘It” 
then asks one after another, ‘‘Have you any ——?” It may 
be ‘‘books,” “potatoes,” ‘‘apples,’’ or anything else. The 
answer must always be “I have no ,’ or “T haven't 
any ” until the buyer asks for something the name of 
which begins with the lucky letter. Then the pupil ques- 
tioned admits that he has the goods, and in turn becomes 
“Tt.” So far as in us lies, we must arrange our games so 
that every pupil will exercise the very bond we want. 
Samples of written work should often be read to the class 
and may be hung up. The teacher may also ask for the 
repetition of good oral work to call special attention to it. 
The fine art of being a critic must be practiced at length; 
for here, as in the drawing class, pupils may learn much 
from each other, especially when it comes to the coining of 
phrases. But here also the friendly spirit ought to prevail. 
Let us take the attitude of trying to help each other. Also, 
as with other branches, pupils must be held responsible for 
good work outside of class, and may be marked on their 
everyday language, oral and written, as much as on the work 
of the composition period. 
Story-telling. — Story-telling induces readiness and pro- 
vides exercise at the same time. It is the teacher who starts 
these little dramatics, but the children will continue them. 
The first essential in story-telling is to choose a good story — 
and only the children can say what is good, for them. We 
must try out our tales and judge their merits by their 
effects, as a public speaker can detect his best jokes by 
watching how the audience laughs. 
The second essential is to enjoy the story with the children. 
This is the attitude of the best speakers everywhere: ‘‘Come,   
  
 
-P-A-G-E-276
   
         266 THE CHILD’S MIND 
let us enjoy this good thing together.” This means that we 
must know our story intimately, though not necessarily by 
rote, that we feel it as if it were all fresh and new, and that 
we make it vivid, ‘‘see the picture” ourselves and by good 
words and gusto make the children see it. In brief, do as 
you would be done by: tell a story as you would like to 
have it told to you. 
Exercise. — William Jennings Bryan has summed up the 
essentials of composition in three simple rules: (1) Have 
something to say. (2) Say it. (38) Say it so you will be 
understood. As we pass from experience to expression and 
try to ‘‘say it so we shall be understood,” we find that 
(just as it would be in a foreign country) some expressions 
are in common use and well understood, and others not. 
Every one of us must pick up the common forms by imita- 
tion —a word that should be printed in capitals in every 
composition book. In language study, imitation is the 
closest approach to the tandem method. Memorizing and 
repeating the words of some good thing that appeals to 
us is like tracing a picture which we like. Following the 
teacher as she speaks or writes is like having her dictate a 
picture to us line after line. Further, language pours itself, 
in ways too intricate to be traced here, into forms that are 
stamped on our minds. A boy was impressed by the story of 
Scrapefoot, in which the fox picks himself up and shakes one 
foot — no bones broken there; then another foot — no bones 
broken there, etc. Soon after, he wrote a story of a bicycle 
fall: “I tried the front wheel — nothing broken there; then 
the hind wheel — nothing broken there,’ ete. In com- 
position, we should have to go on a long hunt to find any- 
thing that is not, in some sense, imitative. 
One great trouble with “Exercise” is that there is too

much of it — of a certain kind, and that is the wntten, un- 
guided kind. In the first place, both common sense and in- 
vestigation give strong evidence that the average teacher is 
prone to assign teo much written work (to the ruin of pen- 
manship in many classes). And secondly, where the total 
amount is legitimate, the assignment is often by infrequent 
long themes instead of more frequent short ones. Snakes, 
some of them, can do well on one monster meal and then a 
long fast; but written composition grows best on the plan 
of little-and-often. 
Guidance can be given in many ways. Suppose we have 
passed from the babbling beginning to the point where the 
pupils have the ‘‘sentence sense” — can form good simple 
sentences readily, and we want to compose a three-sentence 
paragraph. Sheridan ' suggests that we call forward three 
children who have tops (that being the topic) and say to 
the first, ‘Tell me you have a top.’”’ He does so. Then to 
the second child, ‘‘Tell me the color of your top. Begin 
this way: ‘It—’” The child replies, ‘It is blue.” To the 
third child, ‘‘Tell me one thing it can do. Begin with ‘It.’”’ 
“Tt can spin,” is the reply. The teacher puts these sen- 
tences together and lo! a paragraph, “one difficulty at a 
time.” We can use such a plan for both oral and written 
work. 
In the higher grades, the outline of what is to be written 
takes on considerable importance. Perhaps this can best 
be approached from the standpoint of time order. If we 
simply tell a story as the events came to pass, we have an 
outline, a first, a second, and a last. A first rough draft of 
a composition, with attention wholly on matter and not too 
much care for correctness, should be permitted, and per- 
1 Speaking and Writing English, p. 52.
-P-A-G-E-278
  
268 THE CHILD’S MIND 
haps encouraged. But it should be followed by a second, 
smooth draft. 
Prevention and correction of errors.— ‘Correcting papers’’ 
seems to stand out more prominently in English than in 
any other branch. But it is guidance and prevention we 
want. Every new thing should be learned in the teacher’s 
presence till the ideal is clear; then the pupil can practice 
alone till the familiar form is fixed. 
The teacher can help herself out in various ways: by 
having correct forms copied from book or board; by giving 
dictation and then uncovering the correct form, previously 
placed on the board, and having pupils correct their own 
work under supervision; by guidance when papers are being 
written, passing from seat to seat and giving help; by run- 
ning rapidly over all the papers of a grade, not to correct 
them, but to collect the major errors so that these can be 
publicly condemned and the correct forms drilled in; by in- 
sisting that the older pupils keep tab on their own errors; by 
furnishing first hektographed (preferably printed) matter 
with blanks to be filled, and later the complete forms so 
that the pupil can do his own correcting; by having pupils 
correct each other’s papers — the teacher keeping guard 
over the process, of course; and by insisting that each pupil 
form the habit of correcting his own paper to the best of 
his knowledge and belief before handing it in.. To aid in 
this last process, a form, or outline, may be furnished, that 
no guilty point may escape.! 
It should be constantly borne in mind that careful oral 
composition is the best preparation for the correction of 
many written errors. The same errors (aside from misspell- 
ings, etc.) are made in oral as in written speech. Nearly 
1 For such an outline see J. J. Mahoney’s Standards in English, p. 35. 
 
-P-A-G-E-279
    COMPOSITION AND GRAMMAR 269 
half the trouble lies with the verbs, especially with common 
verbs like be, see, come, do, go, sit, can, lie, give, break, ride, 
and learn. Another large fraction (perhaps 30 or 40 per 
cent) of errors is found in the misuse of the pronouns (me 
for I, etc.); in mispronunciations; and in the use of double 
negatives. Following these are a comparative few in the 
form of colloquialisms, the misuse of adjectives and adverbs, 
etc. A knowledge of which errors are most common ! en- 
ables us to make the best use of our time and ammunition 
in fighting the enemy. The teaching of grammar, however, 
does not enable us to capture his strongholds. The errors 
and the grammar run along parallel as we go up through 
the higher grades. 
Effect. — Drilling without killing should be our motto so 
far as effect is concerned. The street urchin is often quite 
an orator in his way, for he has something to say, says it, 
and says it so that he is understood! But he does not care to 
have his words marshaled in precise military array, nor in 
stiff uniform; he prefers a kind of civilian army, hiking along 
in straggling companies. And do we not all secretly sym- 
pathize with him a little? Thought and feeling must take 
first place, and correctness second. Great authors leave 
their ¢’s to be crossed and 7’s dotted on rainy days some- 
times, while the pen dashes on to keep up with a nimble 
thought. The little author in the third grade may feel 
his enthusiasm quite damped if his fine thought is all over- 
looked because he has, somewhere, left out a period. Let us 
make it a rule to praise first and criticise afterward. 
The preceding parts of this chapter have probably made 
evident the conditions that are present when the best ner- 
vous effect is produced. In general, the work lies within 
1 W. W. Charters — Curriculum Construction, pp. 194-211.

  270 THE CHILD’S MIND 
the range of the pupil’s experience and interest, the spirit of 
the class flows in buoyant streams, there are conversational 
relations between teacher and pupil, variety spices the work, 
the children are faced by but one difficulty at a time, and 
all good work is met with a fitting meed of praise and 
congratulation. 
Testing essential bonds. — If we look over the list of bonds 
we want to form, we shall know just what responses we 
want to test out. Whenever we can, we measure responses 
by selected samples of those very responses. We want to 
measure skill in composition by carefully chosen, nicely 
graded samples of that very kind of composition, ranging 
in quality all the way from zero to the highest. 
For written composition, such measuring scales have been 
constructed.!. By saving and grading samples from her 
pupils, a teacher can form a scale of her own which, for se- 
curing the ends of justice, has great value. Actual samples 
of work from each school grade, very helpful as a guide to 
what can and should be done there, are found in the excel- 
lent works of Sheridan and of Mahoney (already referred 
to). 
Oral composition, which is still more important, is more 
difficult to measure. For standards of this kind, we must 
depend on the phonograph. 
1 The Ballou Scale can be obtained from Harvard University. The Hillegas 
Scale and the Trabue Test are furnished by the Publication Office of Teachers 
College, Columbia University, New York City. The Trabue Completion 
Language Test, as its name implies, is rather a test for language in the narrow 
sense than a scale for measuring original compositions. It is also a test for 
thought.

CLASS EXERCISES 
I 
Examine rather carefully the following rough outline of Scrip- 
ture’s method of curing stuttering: 
1. Teach control of breath, and simple singing, as the singing 
of octaves. (Stutterers do not stutter when they sing; for the 
singing is controlled by brain paths other than those used in 
ordinary speech, connections that have not been blocked by any 
disturbance.) 
2. Have the subject sing, and then speak, slowly and distinctly, 
familiar matter, one syllable on each beat of the metronome, 54 
per minute. Use a tone of voice different from the old, stammering 
voice. 
3. Develop expression through imitation. 
4. Drill until the new voice and expression have become 
habitual. 
5. Work for very simple original speech. (a) Teacher and 
pupil read together, taking alternate lines. (6) Simple question 
and answer. (c) Telling a very simple story. 
6. Speaking under gradually more difficult conditions, as before 
another person, over the telephone, in the presence of a group, etc. 
7. Working for clear thought as a means to clear speech. Es- 
tablishing the habit of keeping a clear head at all times. 
Study the above as a sample of introducing but one difficulty 
at a time. Then prepare an outline of carefully graded steps 
whereby you would hope to develop in a very socially timid pupil 
the power to speak before an audience.

Let each try (outside of class) to invent a language game. The 
games may be presented to the class, criticised, and so far as time 
permits, played. Remember, the object is to give each pupil as 
much exercise as possible on the point or points which the game is 
to strengthen.

FOR FURTHER STUDY 
1. Make a list of the more common daily uses for oral speech. 
Of the more common uses for written composition. 
2. Give the history of any lispers or stutterers you have known. 
3. Tell what you would do to help a child who had difficulty 
in giving the sound of p, t, f, th, m, ng, etc. What would be the 
effect of suggesting a familiar word in which the sound appears, 
as sing to bring out the sound of ng? 
4. In teaching composition, what use would you make of 
models written by great authors? What difference does it make 
whether the model (a) describes something which falls within the 
child’s experience and which he wants to describe, or (b) deals 
with something which he has never experienced and does not care 
to talk or write about? 
5. When we want guidance and help in some piece of drawing, 
we may study an excellent sample of similar kind done by a 
superior artist. What is the analogous situation in composition? 
6. Think of a few words, phrases, or forms of expression that 
you have acquired lately. How came you by them? 
7. Which should you prefer as the best route to good oral 
English in adult life, a childhood spent where you heard none but 
correct language, but with no later study of grammar as a science; . 
or a childhood in which you picked up much bad English, followed 
by intensive study of grammar at the age of eighteen? Why? 
8. Make a list of twenty or more composition subjects that 
would certainly fall within the range of experience and interest 
of fifth grade pupils (about eleven years old). 
9. What importance would you attach to having pupils indi- 
vidually keep a list of their own errors? What use could be made 
of it? 
10. If we use such terms as subject, predicate, noun, verb, etc., 
in our composition work, are we then necessarily teaching ‘formal 
grammar”? Explain.
-P-A-G-E-283
    COMPOSITION AND GRAMMAR 273 
11. Show how interesting material discovered in other sub- 
jects can be utilized in the composition class. 
12. Show how you could make composition and spelling re- 
enforce each other; composition and writing; composition and 
reading. 
13. What have you learned in this chapter that might help 
you in teaching English to foreigners? 
14. Make a list of everyday doings that could be enacted in 
the schoolroom so as to get practice in good language. For 
instance, let the teacher act: as mother and a small child ask for 
a lunch. 
15. In drawing, we found that we must teach the pupil to 
observe as a preliminary to good expression. Is there any similar 
necessity in composition? Discuss. 
16. From the standpoint of composition, what value do you 
place on the keeping of a diary? How can one draw on it for 
other composition work? 
17. Show the benefits to be gotten by having the pupils of one 
class, grade, or school, correspond with those of another, perhaps 
in a foreign country. 
18. How would you attempt to break children of the “and” 
habit (using too many ands)? Are there many ands in the 
Bible? How is this? 
19. Some think that ain’t will some day be good English. 
What do you think? From the standpoint of ease and con- 
venience, should we not drop the apostrophe and then put the 
word in the dictionary? 
-20. Tell how oral recitations should be carried on in all branches, 
if we want the latter to help toward oral composition.

COMPOSITION AND GRAMMAR 275 
APPENDIX TO CHAPTER XIII 
The following list of topics is offered as suggestive of the amount 
of technical grammar which may well be woven into the course in 
Composition and Grammar in grades seven and eight. 
1. Subject and predicate, including subject as word, phrase, 
or clause. 
2. Classes of sentences according to meaning; including a 
clear notion of the sentence in practice, its beginning with a 
capital, and its closing with a period or other punctuation mark. 
3. The parts of speech (without minute subdivisions) and their 
use. Under this head there should be included the proper noun 
and adjective, in order to teach their capitalization, the division 
of verbs into transitive, intransitive, and copulative, and the dis- 
tinction between coérdinating and subordinating conjunctions. 
4. Dependent and independent clauses. Noun, adjective, and 
adverbial phrases and clauses. 
5. Sentences classified according to form. 
6. Construction or building up of sentences, gradually increas- 
ing in complexity, the expansion of words into phrases, and 
phrases into clauses, and the condensation of phrases and clauses 
into words. 
7. Analysis of simple sentences with no more than two phrases. 
8. Analysis of compound sentences containing two simple 
clauses 
9. Analysis of complex sentences containing one dependent 
clause. 
10. Synthesis, or combination of two or three short sentences 
containing related ideas into one sentence of appropriate form. 
11. Principal parts of verbs commonly misused in the vicinity, 
to be studied by drills in the use of the past tense and past par- 
ticiple in sentences. 
1 The list is taken from Reports of Two Committees of the Allegheny County 
(Pa.) Principals’ Round Table on Essentials in English and in Oral English.

276 THE CHILD’S MIND 
12. Conjugation in the indicative mood, including verbals 
treated as parts of speech according to their use in the sentence; 
paradigms to be built up. 
13. Declension of relative and personal pronouns, and of nouns 
in the plural and possessive. 
14. Comparison of adjectives and adverbs. 
15. The agreement of verb and subject and of pronoun and 
antecedent. 
“The test of a pupil's knowledge of grammar should be his ability 
to make use of it in speech and writing.” 
Charters, after his study of errors made by children in speaking 
and writing, examined the language texts used in the Kansas 
City schools and stated that the following might be omitted from 
them: the exclamatory sentence, the interjection, the appositive, 
the nominative of exclamation, the nominative of address, the 
objective complement, the objective used as a substantive, the 
adverbial objective, the indefinite pronoun, the classification of 
adverbs, the noun clause, conjunctive adverbs, the retained objec- 
tive, the infinitive except the split infinitive, mood (except possibly 
the subjunctive of ‘‘to be”), the objective subject, the participle 
(except the definition and present and past forms), the nominative 
absolute, and the gerund. It was also recommended that two 
topics be added, the pronoun ‘‘what” and proper and numeral 
adjectives.*

  CHAPTER XIV 
READING 
’ Exercist. — Imagine that you are in Greece, Russia, Palestine, 
or some other country, the language of which you cannot read, 
and the alphabet of which is strange to you. You know the 
common words of the language by sound, and can speak them in 
simple sentences. You wish to learn to read the books and other 
printed matter of that country — or at least you are made to feel 
that it is your duty to do so. In general, what kind of reading 
‘matter would you prefer to begin with? And do you think you 
would like to be taught the alphabet first, or to begin with some 
of the words that you can already understand and speak? (Let 
us suppose the language has many silent letters, etc.) Outline 
briefly the general method of teaching that you think would 
work best in your case. 
A child is similarly situated with regard to the English alphabet. 
and language. Would it be safe to take your conclusions from 
the above and apply them to him? Why or why not? 
The why and wherefore of reading.— Man wrote, and 
then he read. He first folded a meaning, an experience, 
into his composition, and then unfolded it, reproduced it 
out of his reading. He has had two main reasons for writ- 
ing: one is that stone surfaces and clay tablets and paper 
books hold a record more accurately and lastingly than 
brain cells do; and the other is that, under favorable con- 
ditions, people distant in time and space can from the writ- 
ten symbols reproduce the experience. Writing is putting 
an experience into lasting symbols for purposes of record 
or communication. Reading is the reproducing of expe- 
rience from such symbols.

  278 THE CHILD’S MIND 
The most vital and perfect way to receive most messages 
is by personal presence and the living voice, that ‘‘most 
expressive organ of the soul.” The phonograph and the 
radio telephone are working wonders in this direction, and 
will no doubt ease the eyes of coming generations very ap- 
preciably. ‘‘ Visual education” and auditory education will 
do team work. Where direct talk can not take place, ex- 
pert writers, as stated in the last chapter, seem to summon 
the reader, in imagination, and talk to him on paper. Plato 
and Shakespeare and others of the greatest writers have ad- 
dressed their finest writings to the ear rather than the eye. 
Great literature is greatest when it is voiced. What would 
we not give to hear Shakespeare read from his plays for an 
evening, or Dickens read from his own works! ! 
Situations and responses. — What are the reading situa- 
tions in everyday life, and how do we respond to them? 
There are those who say that reading aloud is a very in- 
frequent occurrence outside of the reading class. I earnestly 
pity those who live in an environment where this is true. 
Outside of the school, the foundation institutions of our 
civilization are said to be the home and the church, and it 
is in these places, probably, that our most precious reading 
is done. ‘“‘At home,” says Huey, ‘‘there is scarcely a more 
commendable and useful practice than that of reading much 
of good things aloud to the children. Scudder, in his Child- 
hood in Literature and Art, says there is no academy on 
earth that can compare with this practice. Thinking the 
same subject together gives a bond of union which binds the 
family together; and the most blessed memories of many 
of us cluster about the spell which held us as we listened 
1It has been suggested that our books may some day be made of a kind of 
phonograph film by means of which the speaker’s voice can be reproduced. 
 
-P-A-G-E-289
  
  READING 279 
time and again to mother or father or grandparent reading 
in the dear familiar voice.”’! 
At a mothers’ meeting, a teacher of the second grade 
was urging the mothers to read more to their children, and 
suggesting stories for the purpose. ‘‘But,” said they, ‘we 
cannot read as you do. The children will not listen when 
we read” — and that is another pitiful story. The great 
majority of our girls are sonte ¢ day going to run these little 
private kindergartens. They should be able to read aloud, 
and to read well enough so that the children will listen. 
Many other situations there are, too many to mention, 
where skillful oral reading aloud should be the response. 
Surely, everyone should be able to read aloud in a satisfac- 
tory manner the ‘‘minutes of the previous meeting,” or the 
report of a committee, or a newspaper article when there is 
but one copy for the family circle or a circle of friends. 
There are many who prefer to read aloud at times, either 
for better understanding or for pleasure, even when reading 
for themselves only. Abraham Lincoln was one of these. 
He explained that he understood better what he was read- 
ing if he got it through two senses, the eye and the ear, 
than he did if it came to him through the channel of the 
eye alone.” 
In most reading situations, we are either compelled to 
proceed silently for our neighbor’s sake, or wish to do so 
for our own purposes. In many cases, especially if we 
have been well schooled in oral reading, we learn to “re- 
produce the experience,’ or as much of it as we want, 
1 Edmund Burke Huey — The Psychology and Pedagogy of Reading, p. 334. 
2 Perhaps the movement of the lips should be counted as a third sense. 
Children seem to learn their spelling lessons more quickly and effectively if 
they move their lips, forming the letters energetically, even while studying 
“to themselves.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-290
280 THE CHILD’S MIND 
without the aid of the voice, just as a pupil who has had 
much practice in thinking-talking-writing will at length 
write his thought silently without the middle step of talk- 
ing, at the same time testing out by inner speech how his 
sentences will feel and sound when his reader lifts them from 
the paper. If we are willing to sacrifice what the voice 
contributes, we can also gain in speed, for if we uncouple 
our talking machinery and let the inner speech run on 
alone, it keeps on going when we are breathing in as well 
as when we are breathing out, and even faster than when 
the lips are moving. We often wish to ‘‘skim through” 
our reading matter; for much that is printed is to be 
“tasted” only — it is not all real literature by any means. 
And even if it were, we may want to glean from it some one 
theme and not to grasp it as a whole. Such gleaning and 
skimming is likely to be a rapid, flitting kind of process, 
with words slurred, half pronounced, or omitted, and so it 
can best be carried on silently. 
No response and over-response.— In a middle western 
automobile-manufacturing town, hundreds of people, day 
after day, having performed their six hours of labor, were 
seen lying for hours in the park just across from the public 
library. They were not there to rest, but were in that 
nervous small-boy condition of ‘don’t know what to do.” 
It did not seem to occur to them to enter the library. 
On the other hand, there are those who abuse their edu- 
cation by reading too much, reading when they ought to 
be doing independent thinking, or going about their busi- 
ness, or engaging in sport. They get drunk on print as 
others get drunk with the “movies.” 
It is the old story of power without purpose. We want 
to graduate readers who, because they have a purpose in 
 
-P-A-G-E-291
READING 281 
life, will read to fulfil it, and who consequently will know 
when they have had enough and will stop at that point. 
What bonds do we want to form? — Our aim in regard to 
forming bonds in reading is just the reverse of what it was 
in the teaching of composition. There, we were forming 
connections to work from experience to words; but now we 
are building word-to-experience bonds. And there is a cor- 
responding danger and caution; just as, in composition, so 
many have an experience worth relating but cannot com- 
mand the train of words to express it, so in reading there is 
danger that a train of words may run through the mind with- 
out carrying and delivering their load of meaning. Teleg- 
raphers can “‘receive,”’ putting down word after word as the 
clicks come in, and not know, when they have finished, what 
the message is which they have recorded. So children can 
“receive,” either orally or silently, word after word from a 
page, without getting the meaning. If you have ever 
pronounced every word in a Latin or other foreign-language 
sentence without being able to give the meaning of that 
sentence, you know how such a thing can be, even when the 
meaning of each word, taken by itself, is fairly clear. As 
in composition we must form bonds for words-in-groups, 
phrases, clauses, etc., so must we in reading. Our pupil 
must be made to feel, from a to tzzard, that unless the 
combinations of words of the book mean something to him, 
and something definite, he is not reading; and that it is 
possible to pronounce all the words of a book without ever 
reading it at all. : 
Imitating Sheridan’s statement of aims in composition, 
we may say that we want, in teaching reading: 
1. To turn out pupils able to stand before the class and 
read a page or two of some selection within the range of 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
  282 THE CHILD’S MIND 
their knowledge or experience, speaking plainly, in clean- 
cut sentences, and with reasonably good expression. 
2. To turn out pupils able to extract and arrange in 
order with fair facility the essential facts of an article within 
the range of their experience or their interests. 
We may well add a third point: to turn out pupils who 
will go on reading so as to go on growing. 
Related responses that are ready.— We shall some day 
improve our practice, and not start children to reading 
merely because they have started to attend school. Since 
we are forming word-to-experience paths, there cannot be 
much reading until there has been quite a bit of experience. 
G. Stanley Hall, in his classic study of ““‘The Contents of 
Children’s Minds on Entering School,” ! showed how 
poverty-stricken many of these little minds are. He warned 
against assuming that they know much of anything that is 
of value from the teacher’s standpoint when they appear 
at the schoolhouse door, and asserted that a few days spent 
in the country at the age of five or six has raised the level 
of many a city child’s mind more than a term or two of 
schooling would have done. 
A child should get a deal of sensori-motor experience and 
he should do a deal of talking about it, before he starts to 
read. If he has not enjoyed these two luxuries, we should 
treat him to them, so far as we can without violating too 
much the traditions of the community, before he tries to 
breathe life into the dead bones of a book. In general, 
it would be desirable if we could go ahead for the first 
half year with our school-habit forming and construction 
work and play and nature study and drawing and singing 
and talking before starting reading at all.

  READING 283 
Some of the ready responses we should be able to build on 
are a vocabulary of limited size and a love of talk, an 
insatiable appetite for stories and pictures, and a passion for 
play. The extent to which these natural desires have been 
fed and the children developed at home will be found to 
vary from zero to the upper limit. Some will even be 
found to have read a little, and others will know the 
alphabet. Teachers sometimes object to these crude 
home beginnings in reading; but the wiser way is to take 
advantage of whatever a pupil can do and push on to 
further conquests. 
Some necessary responses that are unready. — There are 
two important habits which must be acquired gradually, 
which cannot be taught very directly, and for which there 
may have been little preparation previously. These are 
inner speech and eye movement. Inner speech grows out 
of outer speech. Attention has already been called (in the 
chapter on Spelling) to the fact that children think aloud, 
talking to themselves. They naturally “talk right out loud” 
in school. Voice is first inhibited, and later the lip movement 
should be, in reading at least; but the “feeling” of saying 
the words inside still goes on, and in most adults it never 
oo out. 
The eye, as we read, does not glide smoothly from end to : 
end of a line, but goes by jerks, or strokes, the lengths of 
which vary and depend on how much, at any point, can be 
taken in at a glance. Place a finger on your closed eye and 
read with the other, and you will sense these jerks very 
plainly. The eye works hard to master the most efficient 
movement, and must be given time for gradual progress, 
with plenty of rest. The nearer the book, the less eye-jerks 
to the line. Children try to ease the eye by bringing the

book very close. But it should be kept at proper distance, a 
foot from the face,’ unless physical defect makes this too 
great a distance, in which case eye correction is needed. 
A very few children cannot learn to read because of what 
is known as ‘‘word blindness.” They may be normal in al! 
other respects, eyes and all, but appear to lack, in their 
brains, the cells necessary to ‘‘map,” that is, respond to, 
printed words. 
One difficulty at a time.— In colonial days, and for a long 
time after, it was thought that the least possible difficulty 
for a beginning reader would certainly be a letter, and ac- 
cordingly the alphabet was taught. Then came two-letter 
combinations, three-letter combinations, and so on up to 
sesquipedalian words.” 
But we must teach first the-bonds that are easiest and 
most interesting to learn. The child already knows a number 
of words and sentences as they have come in through his 
ears and gone out through his mouth. The easiest and most 
interesting thing for him is to take in these same words and

?In imagination I can see the school-dame of my boyhood days, as she 
called her several pupils and classes. First came the little alphabetarians, one 
by one, to whom, in regular order, the whole twenty-six letters were admin- 
istered at a dose, — just four times daily; — the teacher pointing at the letter 
and pronouncing it, and the pupil repeating it after her, — the only variation 
consisting in an occasional snap upon the ear for inattention. For days, and 
weeks, and months, — perhaps for years, — was this operation continued 
before the letters were fairly understood. Then came the little boys and girls 
in b-a, ba, b-e, be, b-i, bi, b-o, bo, b-u, bu,ete., up through baker and cider, until the 
oldest had received their turn. If the performance was attended to just four 
times daily, the requirements of parents and committees were met, and all 
was considered right. — From The T'eacher’s Assistant, by Charles Northend, 
published 1866.

sentences through his eyes, and then switch into the old 
tracks, using the same mouth bonds as before. The teacher 
finds it easier to teach him the word little, already familiar 
to his ear and tongue, than to teach him the single letter J, 
to which he is wholly a stranger, and which, standing alone, 
cannot mean much. 
How children recognize words.— Children recognize 
words at first much as you do people with whom you are not 
yet really familiar. There is that tremendously tall man — 
you can’t forget him — or the one with the long nose, or the 
‘funny eyes. In the same way, your beginner may know 
that the longest word teacher writes on the board is ‘‘bumble- 
bee,” that the one with the two round eyes in the middle is 
“book,” and so on —and that may be practically all he 
does know about them. A word, for a beginner, is more of an 
object, like a toy, about so long and so wide and with prongs 
sticking out here and there. They often recognize a word 
with equal ease whether the card that holds it is right side 
up or upside down, just as they know the dog when he is 
lying on his back, and as you can recognize a Ford car even 
when it is upset. One child, on being asked to find “shoes,” 
said that ‘‘dress” looked so much like ‘‘shoes’”’ she was 
afraid she would make a mistake. These two words are of 
the same length, both curly at the end, and each has one 
letter that sticks up at the beginning. Glance at a page of 
strange-looking Hebrew, or Russian, or Greek, and try to 
pick out the same word in several different places, and you 
will have the child’s experience right over. It may be the 
length of the word that will help you, or the first letter, or the 
last, or some peculiar letter, or the general blackness of the 
work — anything to make it look “funny” and different from 
the rest. 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
286 THE CHILD’S MIND 
How children must learn to know words. — If you have 
twins or other close similars in your class, how do you tell 
them apart? You must analyze their respective make-ups 
quite minutely if you want to tell “which from t’other” 
and be sure of your result. There comes a time when children 
must do the same with words. One pupil had trouble to 
distinguish ‘‘sing”’ and “song.’’ When she had finally 
mastered them, she was asked how she knew which was 
which. “By the looks,” she said. When questioned further, 
she put her finger on the 7 and the o. 
Printed words are made of letters, and these letters stand 
for sounds. As soon as our pupils can be brought into readi- 
ness for it, they must be shown how to take words apart, 
and they must form bonds between the sight of a letter and 
its sound (or most common sounds). Even then we do not 
need to teach them the names of the letters; but when m 
appears as stimulus, the pupil should respond by giving or 
thinking the characteristic sound of m, etc. 
If each letter had but one sound, and if that sound were 
always represented by that one letter, the child who had 
formed his letter-sound bonds would have a key to the 
pronunciation (all except accent) of every new word he 
met. Let us hope English will some day be that kind of 
language, strictly phonetic. But it is not now, and so we 
have to play catch-as-catch-can with it. 
Which phonetic bonds first?p— At once the question 
arises, Which phonetic bonds shall we form first? And 
the answer is, Those that are easiest to learn, that occur 
most frequently, and that prepare for most other bonds-to 
be. The consonant bonds are easier than the vowels be- 
cause most consonants have but one sound, while the 
vowels have several each. Further, the consonants occur 
 
-P-A-G-E-297
READING 287 
most frequently in strategic places, and so give better 
preparation for the learning of the many new words that 
are to follow. The explanation is this: experiment shows 
that we recognize words largely by their first letters and by 
the letters that stick up above or down below the others. 
These (together with its length) fix a kind of outline for the 
word, which we come to recognize at a glance, as we do the 
outline of a friend. Now, first letters are much more 
frequently consonants than vowels, and the letters that 
protrude are practically always consonants. We can act- 
ually leave out most of the vowels and still read very 
well, as the writers of Hebrew and of Pitmanic shorthand 
. often do. 
Then there are the “‘phonograms,” groups of letters that 
remain together in many different words, as ap in cap, nap, 
rap, and tap. These make many words seem as much alike 
as brother and sister, and so we speak of word “‘families,”’ 
as the ap family or the at family, and either teach them or 
collect and review them in this way. 
Summary of word mastering.— Some teachers, in order 
to keep story and meaning prominent from the start, prefer 
to begin with whole sentences, dividing these into phrases 
and the phrases into words. But however we begin, we 
soon arrive at what must always be, for the beginner, the 
unit of meaning and of mastery, the word. Words are the 
counters with which we play the reading game. 
The usual procedure is to teach from fifty to a hundred 
“sight words,” that is, words recognized by sight as so 
many different objects would be; and at the same time 
start exercises for the training of the ear, pronouncing 
Cora, Fannie, the names of objects, etc., in such a way as 
to bring out the first sound and finally isolate it. After a 
 
-P-A-G-E-298
  288 THE CHILD’S MIND 
few weeks, enough consonant sounds and phonograms have 
been studied to give real aid in working out new words. 
The general process of mastering new words so as to intro- 
duce but one difficulty at a time may be diagrammed as 
below. 
Sight Words Phonic Parts New Words

can | ce an cat, SS RST Cpls 
The work in phonics is kept up through the second grade 
and, often, well into the third, making ready for the use 
of the dictionary in the fourth. 
From. sensori-motor to high-level bonds. — In begin- 
ning reading, a printed word is a stimulus that must 
set off three kinds of bond: the reader must (a) recognize 
the word, (b) pronounce the word, and (c) get the meaning 
of the word. We. can illustrate in this way. Suppose a 
little girl sees a soldier with a blue hat-cord. She may 
recognize the blue cord, know that she has seen others like 
it, and yet not be able to name the color or tell what it 
means. Or she may take the second step, naming the 
color, and still attach no significance to the cord. Finally, 
she may recognize the color, name it, and know that it 
means “infantry,” recalling at the same time memories of 
her visit to an infantry camp. 
We must take special pains with this third kind of bond, 
the word-to-meaning bond. Sometimes we try to supply 
meaning by using other words, or we tell an older pupil 
to use his dictionary. This may often help. But if the 
little girl has not visited the camp, it will not help much to 
tell her that ‘‘blue indicates infantry.”’ She may even

think it has something to do with infants. G. Stanley 
Hall (in the study above mentioned) found the children 
saying that butterflies make butter, or that it comes from 
buttercups, that grasshoppers give grass, kittens grow on 
pussy-willows, and honey comes from honeysuckles. 
If we were to outline the steps by which we can pass with 
greatest ease from concrete to abstract in building a word- 
to-meaning bond, they would stand somewhat as below. 
1. Word used in presence of object or experience. 
2. Word used in dramatization of original situation. 
8. Word with picture (perhaps moving) of object. 
4. Word dwelt upon when read, with suggestions to call 
up vivid mental pictures, concrete ideas. 
5. Word read rapidly, giving a quick flash of meaning. 
The inclusive unit in reading. — For words following each 
other in single file we would seem at first sight to need bonds 
arranged in series. The fact is, however — and it is one of the 
biggest facts in all teaching of reading — that the key to skill 
lies in the mastery of inclusive units, of groups of words. 
We can illustrate this best, perhaps, in the case of oral read- 
ing. If one attempts to look at each word and pronounce it 
before gathering in the next with the eye, his reading is 
pretty certain to be mechanical, jerky, balky, and without 
expression. This is likely to be the trouble with those 
children who are said to be mere word pronouncers and not 
real readers. If one is to run an automobile smoothly, or 
read smoothly, or do almost anything else smoothly, he must 
be looking ahead. Eye and voice can no more travel at the 
same rate of speed in reading than the chauffeur can keep

290 THE CHILD’S MIND 
his eyes on the wheels. The eye must go ahead and scoop 
in the phrases quickly, delivering them (so to speak) to the 
voice as fast as it is ready to utter them. A good oral reader, 
like a shorthand writer, must carry on a double process, 
and a very complex one. The stenographer keeps taking in 
through his ear a flow of words from the speaker, while his 
pen comes along a phrase or so behind and puts them out 
on paper. The reader keeps taking in through his eye 
a flow of words from the page, while his voice comes along 
a phrase or so behind and puts them out into the air. It 
has been found that the eye is usually ahead of the voice by 
from three or four to seven or eight words; more just after 
a period, and less and less if the eye is blocked by difficult 
words, until the voice catches up completely. 
Mastering the inclusive unit. — Studies in the learning of 
telegraphy, and typewriting, and everything else of the sort, 
show that there is first a letter stage, and then, as the bonds 
go on working better and more codperatively, a word stage, 
a phrase stage, and in the case of the very skilful, a still- 
larger-unit stage. In fact, the size of the unit that can be 
handled as a unit is the royal mark of skill. Binet recognized 
corresponding stages in the reading of French children, and 
thought it wise to base on such a gradation a measuring 
scale for reading.!. As a matter of fact, these stages of prog- 
ress are found in the reading of all children, but our im- 
proved American method tends to cover them up.” 
1 Alfred Binet — Les idées modernes sur les enfants, p. 26. 
? There are some writers and teachers whose words and methods seem to 
indicate that they believe a child never should be made attentively conscious 
of letters, or sounds, or words, but that he should be encouraged to attempt 
some kind of plunge from his state of inexpertness to the method of the expert, 
forgetting words as such and going directly to meanings from the start. One 
might as well tell a beginning dancer not to think about his steps, but to swing 
   
-P-A-G-E-301
  READING 291 
This improved method introduces but one difficulty at a 
time by separating the work of the eye and the voice. “Read 
it to yourself first, and then look at me and say it. If you 
need any help, tell me.” Such is the common direction — 
the teacher giving so much help as she thinks is wise at that 
time. The pupil reads his short sentence silently, then 
voices it with good expression. Gradually, dramatization 
and oral composition make the talk work easy; and still more 
gradually, as more and more words are drilled upon, as 
phonics are mastered, and as old and easy pieces, full of 
familiar phrases, are read, the eye learns to skip nimbly 
along the line, until at length eye and voice are so well trained 
that both can work at the same time and the pupil can “talk 
out of a book.” 
Work first for accuracy.—In mastering this process of 
prevision in reading, the pupil should be neither hurried nor 
allowed to dawdle. Weshould make very clear to him, partly 
by doing it ourselves, just what a good reader has to do, 
keep his mind on this goal, and then have him work most of 
the time for accuracy — reasonable childhood accuracy — 
and only occasionally push him for speed. But rejoice, O 
Teacher, when he begins to “rattle it off” to show you how 
fast he can go. He has mounted to a higher level, and is 
reveling in the luxury and freedom of phrase mastery. 
Oral reading, if given more than a small amount of practice 
in the upper grades, is sometimes condemned because of the 
into the full waltz from the first, or tell the young violinist not to think of his 
bow or his hand, or his finger board, but just strike up and play tunes. In the 
conscious stage of learning, we want as much healthy, directive attention as 
we can get on each item, one at a time. Later, the skilled performer can 
“forget all about it’’; but the learner who attempts to plunge through and 
skip the conscious stage is a blunderer, and the teacher who encourages such a 
performance is — not so skillful as he might be.

supposed necessity of fixing the eye rather slowly on word 
after word. I cannot see that either oral or silent reading 
necessarily has anything to do with this phase of the subject. 
» One may gather words by large or by small units when read- 
ing either way. Certainly, good oral reading requires the 
largest possible inclusive unit. ‘‘Look up from your book 
and out at your audience just as often and as long as you 
can,” so the good teacher directs the upper grade pupil: 
“Scoop up a big eyeful and then say it off to us just as if 
you were talking to us.” 
Judd has made the excellent suggestion that primary read- 
ing books be ‘‘printed with meaningful phrases separated 
from each other by spaces wider than those between words 
so as to induce in learners the habit of seeing phrases.” This 
would give a kind of punctuation by spacing, would make 
our print look like our talk (if one may put it so), and ought 
to help both silent and cral reading.! 
Readiness. — Since reading is the verbal re-living of life, 
there are in it as many sources of interest as there are in 
life itself. We can call attention here to but a few. 
Rousseau makes his little educational hero, fmile, receive 
“notes of invitation for a dinner, a walk, a boat-ride, or to 
“see some public entertainment.” There is no one to read 
~~ them until too late — the affair is over. Emile then picks 
up a little reading and at length receives other notes. “Fi- 
nally, after a great effort, the half of one note is deciphered, 
and it speaks of going out to eat cream to-morrow; but 
where or with whom, no one knows. What an effort is now 
made to read the rest of the note!” 
There is the point: reading is the road to what we want, 
and our first grade friends can be made to feel it very

  READING 293 
keenly. And if one cannot read, there is the sting of dis- 
grace. A young man of about twenty-seven found himself 
called upon to read aloud, before the lodge to which he be- 
longed, a part of its proceedings, and was forced to confess 
himself unable to do so. He felt the humiliation so keenly 
that he at once hunted out some one to teach him to read. 
He became later a prominent superintendent of schools. 
The forces that most rally or retard the reading of chil- 
dren are the story, the teacher, the method, and the book. 
Let us glance at each. 
The story. In-days gone by, there has been quite a con- 
test between ‘‘content readers,” that is, readers that laid 
the main stress on the story material, and ‘‘form readers,” 
which sacrificed story interest somewhat to secure a better 
graduation of phonics and other forms of word study. The 
content reader has won. Or more accurately, authors have 
found it possible to produce fine stories for little people with- 
out using more than five hundred or six hundred words in the 
whole first year’s work, and to build up this reading vocabu- 
lary very gradually and according to phonetic relationships. 
When you find, in the reading period, the pupils curling 
the pages of the primer, rolling pencils, and pulling play- 
things out of their pockets, in spite of all the efforts of th® 
teacher, the chances are that there is something the matter 
with the story. It is said in the apple market that “‘the 
mouth merely eats the apple; the eye buys it.” The child 
merely reads the book; the teacher or the superintendent 
buys it. When McGuffey was writing his good old readers, 
about the middle of the last century, he called in the chil- 
dren of the neighborhood and tried out his literature on 
them. It would be well if we could still have committees 
of children to help in making selections.  
-P-A-G-E-304
    
294 THE CHILD’S MIND 
Children have an instinctive interest in animals. In 
grades one and two, the animal story is the favorite, and 
ranking close to it are stories of home life and familiar 
things, of toys and parties and Christmas and vacation 
doings — just such as the little folks have lived through or, 
if they could, would like to live through. In the third grade 
a new interest blooms, the interest in fairies; and in the 
fourth appears another love, that for myth and adventure. 
The teacher. The teacher’s manner and her reading are of 
chief importance. If her interest drones, the reading of the 
pupils will drone, too. In this expressive art of reading, 
what the pupil catches by reflex influence is very large. 
You will see classes almost transformed merely by the teach- 
er’s getting up, making a few suggestive gestures, and show- 
ing by voice and eye that she has caught the spirit of the 
story and is living and enjoying it. 
And if she can read — read with her eyes off the book 
more than half the time, read so realistically and expressively 
that it makes the tingles run up and down thirty little spines 
— then she can motivate the reading lesson mightily. 
The method. As you would expect, the method must be 
such as to rouse the instincts, abilities, and old habits. 
Dramatizing appeals to play, and to the instincts for move- 
ment, rhythm, and vocalization. (It is well if the teacher 
is a bit of an actor. She will then fall more easily into the 
spirit of a child’s dramatization.) Curiosity is whetted by 
the plot of the story — for most stories for children should 
have plots. ‘‘We must find out what happened next.” Self- 
assertion is of course always at work. A first grade child of 
low mentality but strong physique took home a book and 
compelled her elders to help her read thirty or forty pages 
an evening. She advanced to the A section of the class and 
   
-P-A-G-E-305

held her place there. Phonic drills are supposed to be kill- 
ing; but I have seen them conducted so well as a game that 
pupils were willing to give up their play time in order to go 
on with it. 
The book. You are no longer in the baby class when 
you carry home a book! The first grader will strap up 
three or four if he can get them, and carry them home, just 
to gain caste. But it is probably best that the daily reader 
does not go home, for somebody there will read it through 
and again. But there ought to be plenty of supplementary 
readers and library books at hand; and the teacher soon 
learns the trick of reading a little way in one and then ask- 
ing, ‘‘Would any one like to take this home and read the 
rest of the story?”’ A score of hands fling up reply, a score 
of voices (if permitted) answer ‘‘I.” 
But we must see that all books, both for home and school 
use, are good books, standard as to illustration, and paper, 
and type, and every other essential point. What with per- 
sistent school boards and compliant publishers, we seem 
likely hereafter to have little trouble about such matters.’ _ 
Does oral reading kill interest? — Oral reading is some- 
times ridiculed? as fatal to interest because all have the

2 Let. me advise the young teacher not to fear ridicule. It is the favorite 
resort of the ‘‘smart set’’ in education who pride themselves on having ‘the 
latest ideas” and are a little fond of putting everybody else out of countenance. 
Beware also of the educational lecturer who substitutes ridicule for reason. 
He is very often more ridiculous himself than anything at which he points his 
weapon.

book, know just what is coming next, and still must keep 
their eyes on the line while some “unfortunate victim” 
struggles through, only to be crucified on a cross of criti- 
cism at the close. But it is easy to find classes where 
children would leap from their seats, if discipline did not 
restrain them, in their eagerness to be the ‘‘unfortunate vic- 
tim.”’ As for knowing what is coming, if that is objection- 
able, we must eliminate all preliminary story-telling by the 
teacher, and all preliminary dramatization. Children re- 
peat, and love to have repeated, by the hour, the good old 
things. You knew what was coming when you attended the 
Shakespearean play, when you sat down to read ‘‘The Lady 
of Shalott,” when your classmate demonstrated the nth 
proposition in geometry, or your mother served oatmeal 
for breakfast, or ten athletes in succession tried the long- 
distance jump. Is it a bad method, in a foreign-language 
class, to let all have the book and follow with the eye 
while some one translates or reads aloud? One object 
of reading is to increase vocabulary, and the very best 
way to learn a word is by using both the eye and the 
ear on it at once. Further, children, like the lower animals, 
do learn sometimes more from each other than they 
can from the teacher. They undoubtedly receive great 
help from hearing each other read. We have also found 
expert teachers of certain branches (drawing, for example), 
asserting that children —-and they may all have drawn 
the same thing, so they “know what is coming” — often 
learn more from criticisms and suggestions given by each 
other than they do from those given by the teacher. 
All that is necessary is that the criticism be animated 
by the spirit of helpfulness. This does not mean that 
individual work should not be done also, nor that bright

     READING 297 
children should be compelled to mark time while. dull 
ones advance. 
Exercise: the tandem method in reading. — Huey, in his 
admirable discussion of ‘‘Learning to Read at Home,” 4 
speaks very highly of what we would here call an approach 
to the tandem method. It might also be called the ‘‘moth- 
er’s knee method.”’ The children grow into reading as they 
learn to talk and usually become ‘‘the best and most 
natural readers of all.’ (Let us remember this in our talks 
with parents.) ‘‘The secret of it all lies in parents’ reading 
aloud to and with the child.” The little one follows the 
pictures, finds ‘‘where it says’ so and so, watches the 
parent’s finger as it points along the line, learns to keep his 
own finger ‘‘on the place,’”’ gradually comes to recognize 
a few of the outstanding words, memorizes jingles, and at 
length is able, with the help of pictures, etc., to make out 
new jingles and stories for himself. ‘He likes, too, to sing 
his favorite songs along with mamma, from the printed 
page, and learns to read these readily in this way.” 
The typical school exercises. — As a rule, do not feel that 
there is only one way to do a thing. Opinion and practice 
differ much as to whether the teacher shall, in the begin- 
ning, print or write on the board, when the pupil shall first 
use a book, just when to introduce phonics, and so on. But 
if you are clear headed as to just what you are trying to do, 
and very much in earnest about it, you may invent a better 
way of doing it than any now in existence. 
One very good and very common way of starting the 
work at school is to tell the class a story, preferably the first 
story in the primer, so as to give practice on the very words 
they are to meet in the book. The children may then tell 
1 The Psychology and Pedagogy of Reading, Ch. XVI.     
  
-P-A-G-E-308
    298 THE CHILD'S MIND 
the story to class and teacher. Most teachers then prefer 
to have the pupils play the story, that is, ‘dramatize 
it” simply. At any rate, it is talked over considerably, 
after which two or three simple statements are questioned 
out by the teacher and printed or written on the board. 
The mother wit of the pupils enables them to tell “where 
it says” this or that, until at length a few phrases or few 
words are isolated and partially mastered. Before many 
lessons are over, there are enough words in the treasury so 
that the work in the book can begin. 
Getting the story and enjoying its repetition are, of course, 
the motives always at the top of the child’s mind. To you, 
as teacher, the aim will be “‘reading for the meaning.”’ As 
aids to this ultimate object, the chief exercises to be con- 
ducted are (1) the drill on sight words and phrases, (2) the 
study of phonies, (8) the application of phonics to the mas- 
tery of new words,! (4) reading for expression, and (5) the 
mastering of large inclusive units. 
Beyond what has already been given, we cannot here 
discuss these processes. In the teacher’s manual of any 
good system of reading will be found guidance that is ‘‘posi- 
tive, definite, and detailed.” 
As the reading book is usually the first book that any 
pupil undertakes to study alone, special attention should be 
given to preparing for this momentous step. But if the 
book is a good one, the transition will be very smooth. 
Teacher and pupil will already have worked together through 
many a happy “‘study-recitation,’ the teacher doing ever 
less and less and the pupil more and more. He is likely to 
show quite clearly when he is getting ready to try his wings. 
We must see that there are no unusual word difficulties or

involved meanings ahead to wreck him. We must give him 
a hint, perhaps, as to what is coming, and let him fly. 
Oral and silent reading in the reading class. —It has 
often been stated that, since in after-school life there is 
so much more silent than oral reading, silent reading must 
be taught in the schools and must receive, as soon as the 
mechanics of reading are mastered (say from the third or 
fourth grade on), much more time than oral reading. To 
both of these statements I demur: silent reading has 
been taught for untold years by good teachers as both 
incidental and preliminary to oral reading, and it is already 
receiving about*98 per cent of the pupil’s total reading 
time. 
As previously described, the child is taught from the very 
beginning to read each sentence silently before he attempts 
to voice it. This is also teaching him to study. Later, 
when he can study alone, he goes over the whole lesson si- 
lently (but not slowly unless the piece is difficult) in prepa- 
ration for his oral reading. As to time, we may figure that 
if an upper grade pupil spends five or six hours a day in 
school, he probably sits at his desk, reading silently, during 
periods amounting to two hours. To this we may add an 
hour of silent reading at home. On the other hand, if a 
period of forty minutes is given to oral reading, each of a 
class of twenty can haye no more than two minutes during 
which to exercise his voice in the expression of the finest 
sentiments that have ever found form in the English lan- 
guage. Not poetry only, but much else in our literature, is 
akin to music. It can be read and enjoyed silently, but it 
has its most pleasurable and uplifting effect when it is 
voiced. Oral reading, with the conversational discussion 
that so fitly accompanies it, is one of the most valuable 
‘

moral-social exercises the school can maintain. The time 
given to it should if possible be increased. 
Silent reading as teaching to study.— Everyone reads 
different kinds of material, literary, scientific, etc., at a 
different rate. One who reads a novel rapidly may slow 
down when he attempts a medical article or an arithmetic 
problem. It is not primarily a question of eye movement 
or of lip movement, but of brain action; and as there is a 
bond for everything and everything has its bond, we should 
practice on the very kind of matter we wish to perform on. 
What most students need is practice in grasping the impor- 
tant thoughts in what they read silently. Such thought- 
getting means rapid reading. Teaching silent reading should 
be thought of rather as teaching to study, and the place to 
teach it is in the very class in which the studying is to be 
done. The silent reading of arithmetic should be taught in 
the arithmetic class, of music in the music class, and of science 
in the science class. Beginner’s silent reading (as previously 
described), together with the outlining, etc., of literature, 
we should continue to teach in connection with reading. 
Effect. — Probably it is easier to bring about an agreeable 
effect in reading than in any other branch; for there is no 
interest in child life which cannot secure through it some 
degree of satisfaction. The social environment also re- 
enforces us strongly, for while it will tolerate a great deal 
of bad language and general ignorance, it points its finger 
at one who ‘‘can’t even read.” If reading is not begun 
until the pupils are ready for book work, if the ‘“‘stories” 
are good and well graded, if the teacher is adaptable and 
does not rush her class to keep up with some externally 
imposed standard or with competing grades, there is likely 
to be no trouble. .

Standards and tests. — First, what is the ideal as to speed? 
Much depends on whether we want our knowledge to be 
thorough, and how long we care to keep it. We willingly 
pay a large price for goods that last a long time. A cele- 
brated English lawyer, on being asked the secret of his success, 
replied that he resolved, when beginning to read law, to 
make everything he read thoroughly his own; that many 
of his competitors read as much in a day as he did in a week; 
but that at the end of twelve months, his knowledge was 
still fresh while theirs had glided away. Romanes tried 
out the reading rate of various highly distinguished men in 
science and literature and found most of them to be slow 
readers. He also found that each individual has his own 
characteristic rate of reading, which, he concluded, depended 
on their inborn rate of brain action, and not on “any merely 
accidental differences arising from greater or less facility 
acquired by special practice.” ! 
Another of Romanes’ findings was that those who natu- 
rally read fast retain more (temporarily at least) than those 
whose rate is slower. On this fact has been based the 
superficial conclusion that children should be speeded up 
in their reading so that they too will retain more. Tilden 
may be fast in tennis, and the Mayo brothers in surgery, 
but the beginner can do nothing worse than to attempt 
a speedy game or a speedy surgical operation. It is also 
true that those who memorize fastest remember best, for 
nature has given them better memorizing machines; but 
this does not mean that every man’s memory machine will 
do better work the faster it runs. Every careful study of 
learning has shown that the earnest learner who fixes his 
mind on accuracy and lets speed, for the most part, take

302 THE CHILD’S MIND 
care of itself and come as a by-product, finally excels not 
only in accuracy but in speed also. Further, our “‘rapid 
silent reading” may be only rapid silent cramming. Lin- 
coln, when a new thought came, ‘‘bounded it north, and 
bounded it south, and bounded it east, and bounded it 
west.” Our rapid ‘‘reading for thought’? may be only 
reading for a flash of ideas, a kind of substitute for the 
moving picture show, reading to escape thought.!. Until it 
is proved that, among children of equal intelligence and 
native reading ability, there is greater permanent acquisi- 
tion and actual use of what is read among those who train 
for speed, we must regard the rapid methods as quite pos- 
sibly a dangerous infraction of the speed law. 
The whole matter, as I see it, may be summed up this 
way: Each has his own inherited rate of reading, and ten- 
dencies as to forming associations while he reads. He 
should be trained into his natural speed and habits gradually, 
and chiefly by methods that stress accuracy. He should 
be shown how rapid readers attain their speed, and be 
given opportunity for extensive reading along the line of 
his choice. 
The rate at which a pupil reads can be measured suffi- 
ciently for practical purposes by starting him off by the 
watch and calling time at the end of, perhaps, three minutes, 
at which time the words can be counted. If the reading is 
silent, the whole class can be measured at once, each count- 
ing the words from his stopping place back to the common 
point of beginning. Questions, oral or written, will give 
a fair idea as to the thoroughness of the reading. More 
accurate measurements can be obtained through the use

to Read, Ch. XV.

of standardized tests... Approximate standards of speed 
per minute for the several grades are given below.

The quality of oral reading, while not hard to judge 
roughly, is difficult to measure accurately. The phono- 
graph can furnish us graded samples of oral reading to 
serve both as standards for measurement and for inspira- 
tion. Reading is not the getting of ideas merely, but of feel- 
ingsalso. To a skillful teacher, oral reading constitutes the 
best of all tests for determining how much of a selection 
a pupil has really assimilated into his personality.

1. What is your definition of reading? Why do you like this 
definition better than others? Does it give any guidance as to 
the proper method for teaching reading? 
2. We have decided that we will not try to bring the children 
to the expert stage in writing, or drawing, or even spelling. Should 
we try to make them expert in oral reading? Silent reading? 
Why or why not? 
3. Doctors tell us that health and vigor depend not so much on 
hew much we eat, as on how much we assimilate. Is there any- 
thing analogous to this in our reading habits? 
4. How comes it that in spelling, children are helped by moving 
their lips, studying aloud, etc., whereas in reading (beyond the 
beginner’s stage at least) they are said to be hindered by it? 
(See what differences you can discover between the two processes, 
especially the difference between feeling that you are “talking to 
yourself,” and feeling that you are talking to an audience which 
must be properly impressed and may be critical.)

6. Can you remember your experience in learning to read? 
If so, how, if at all, would you change the method used in your 
case?

such as the reading of shorthand, or the telegraph code, or per- 
haps a foreign language, give others the benefit of it. What

teach a child a sight word (that is, a word to be bee as a 
whole and not phonetically analyzed). 
9. Show, by giving successive steps, that composition and 
reading are the reverse of each other. 
10. If possible, examine several sets of reading books, especially 
those for the lower grades. Select the series you think the best 
and give reasons for your selection. What do you look for in 
the ideal reading book? 
11. What is the value of oral reading as a language exercise, 
especially when the selection is easy to read? (Consider the 
introduction of but one talking difficulty at a time by having 
words all supplied and phrases formed.) 
12. What would you think of having each pupil in the seventh 
or eighth grade bring a newspaper or magazine and read from that 
in the reading class? Do periodicals furnish good material for 
silent reading? Why or why not? 
13. Though we teach good penmanship in the penmanship 
class, it often fails to ‘carry over” to other classes. If we teach 
silent reading in the reading class only, is that likely to carry 
over? Should we not have a certain amount of oral reading in 
other branches? 
14. Where do we get most of the new words that we add to 
our vocabularies? Discuss reading as a means of increasing 
vocabulary. Those children who read much silently and not 
much orally are said to pronounce badly. Can you see any reason 
why this should be? If it is true, how can we correct it?

Would you advise having a certain number of pages of script in 
reading books? 
16. Good newspaper reporters are expected to put all the es- 
sentials of the “story” in the first paragraph. Good writers of 
all literature quite commonly open each paragraph with a “text 
sentence” and close it with a summarizing sentence. Show how 
these facts help us in silent reading, or skimming. 
17. Why do people like to open their Bibles and follow with 
the eye while the minister reads? Can a child get any similar 
experience from a piece of literature which another is reading? 
18. Tell some things you would do to secure good expression 
of what is read. What should be the effect in expression of turn- 
ing back to a favorite old piece, now grown easy to read? 
19. Huey found that the rapid reader is marked (and in the 
order following) by excellent visual perception, practice from 
childhood, power of concentration, mental alertness as shown by 
rapidity of original composition, and scholarly ability as shown 
by college records. (Op. cit., p. 174.) Which of these seem 
inborn chiefly and which acquired chiefly? 
20. How fast can we understand by ear when listening to a 
lecturer, a radio broadcaster, or a good phonograph? (The 
average lecturer speaks from 125 to 175 or rarely 200 words per 
minute.) Can we understand, at that rate, anything that requires 
much thought? Do you think we can understand any faster 
when the words come to us through the eye? Why or why not? 
What does this have to do with our ideal of speed in reading?

Music 
Exercises. — 1. Which would you prefer, to have a pupil 
finish his music course with a fine voice which he uses habitually 
in conversation, but with poor achievement in the reading of 
music; or to have him graduate from music able to read it with 
ease and perhaps sing well, but with a disagreeable conversational 
voice? Why? Do you know of any good singers whose conversa- 
tional tones are faulty? 
2. Go through the chapter on Reading, and then through that 
on Composition and Elementary Grammar, making note of all 
the points where you think a parallel should appear between the 
teaching of music and the teaching of these subjects. Note also 
points of difference which you think should give rise to a difference 
in method. Be ready to report. 
“Can I teach music?” — In regard to music the case of 
many teachers is much like that of the athletes Virgil tells 
us about: ‘They can because they think they can.” In 
the teaching of music, some cannot because they think they 
cannot. Music has come into the schools more recently 
than many other branches; and so not all of us have grown 
up through several years in that as we have in reading and 
arithmetic. Consequently, we suspect it of all sorts of dif- 
ficulties, and fail to realize how simple the essentials really 
are. 
Music can be taught by anyone who can sing the scale 
and who can tell when others, notably children, are not 
singing it. Indeed, I have known teachers who could not

MUSIC ; 309 
sing even that much, yet who were able to teach vocal 
music successfully, in fact much better than some who sang 
with ease. They did it by letting the more musical children 
lead in the practice. The necessary theory, notation, etc., 
like a simple problem in arithmetic, can be mastered by 
anyone, singer or non-singer. The untaught teacher can 
even teach herself, working ahead of her class and picking 
up her knowledge as she goes — though the picking up bus- 
iness is of course rather bad in any branch. But there are 
many roads to success: the phonograph and the piano never 
refuse their aid; the supervisor may give special help; some 
musically minded enthusiast in the community may come 
to the rescue if welcomed; or one may escape by trading 
work in music with a neighboring teacher for work in some 
other subject. 
Why music? — A traveler in Norway heard a sweet voice 
singing, and ventured to enter the lowly house from which 
it sounded. He found a peasant woman singing to her new- 
born babe. Said she, ‘“‘I wanted music to be the first thing 
my baby should ever hear in this world.’ Over the grave 
of the great musician Lassus (whose name means literally 
“weary”’) was placed the inscription Hic ille est Lassus qui 
lassum recreabat orbem. (‘Here lies that famous Weary One 
who refreshed the weary world.’’) All the way from birth to 
death we should go, as the old negro song has it, ‘Singin’ 
all the way, Lord, singin’ all the way.” 
Music may not at first seem to have much to do with 
“direct self-preservation”; yet P. P. Claxton, when United 
States Commissioner of Education, said that “among a 
practical, industrial, and commercial people, like ourselves, 
good music is necessary not only for enjoyment and recre- 
ation, but also for inspiration and for salvation from death

in the din and dust of trade.”! War shows us how essential 
is music to relieve and inspire a strenuous life, and it is 
worth no less in peace. He who can live without it and not 
miss it is half dead already. 
It counts, too, toward indirect self-preservation; for it 
insures the ‘‘ wise use of leisure,” and many are they now who, 
in whole or in part, make their living by it. In the ‘‘rearing 
and discipline of offspring” music is a virile force; for vocal 
music, which was the first kind of music, probably evolved 
among lower animals and primitive men as a sex call, and all 
kinds of music still serve as lovers’ language. Internation- 
ally, it is the most widely understood of all languages, and 
has throughout Europe and America a common notation. 
As an adornment to life it is supreme. 
In short, the final fact in life is feeling, and music is the 
language of the feelings. Wherever there is a message of 
emotion, it is not only well to “say it with flowers,” but 
also to express it in music. 
Situations and responses. — Almost every situation is a 
musical situation. Even in school, see how music thrills its 
way through all other branches. It enlivens literature: a 
poem is still more poetic when it is sung. Among the early 
Greeks, music and literature were not two branches, but one. 
In geography, the spirit of far-away peoples comes floating 
to us through their songs, as in history the soul of bygone 
times is made immortal in its music. We almost know the 
negro when we know his melodies, and a boy may catch 
more of the spirit of ’76 from ‘‘ Yankee Doodle” than he does 
from seventy-six pages of history. Music and physical 
culture are boon companions, not to be separated. We even 
sing the multiplication table.

MUSIC 311 
Let us list the responses: to listen to and appreciate 
music, to sing, to play an instrument, to read notes, to com- 
pose music. Our most progressive schools are including all 
of these in their programs. Music in public schools, how- 
ever, is usually vocal music; for a larynx costs nothing, being 
furnished by nature; and further, we all play the larynx more 
than we do any other instrument. But the time is coming 
when every child will have the chance to learn, in school, the’ 
piano, or violin, or any other standard instrument he may 
choose. Some school districts already provide instructors 
in instrumental music, and furnish instruments, requiring 
only that a class of minimum number be formed to take 
advantage of their services. 
Music has its literature, its classic compositions, as 
English has; but there are not so many of them, nor are 
they so long, nor is it so necessary to be able to read them 
for one’s self; for while it would not be easy to get the 
English classics by hear-say, it is very easy and agreeable 
to get the musical classics by hear-sing and hear-play. So, 
also, musical composition corresponds to English composi- 
tion; but as there appears to be less daily necessity for it, 
we spend less time on it. Music is a language of feeling 
rather than of ideas. We might compose a little melody 
and post it to a friend, so that when he sang it or tried it 
over on his piano he would know how we felt; but when 
we wish to express our sentiments, we can usually find 
some ready made composition, ‘Annie Laurie,” or ‘Sweet 
Summer’s Gone Away,” or what not, into which our feeling 
will fit very well. 
The school has given most of its attention to singing, 
and to the reading of vocal music, and on these phases we 
shall concentrate here.
-P-A-G-E-322
    
312 THE CHILD’S MIND 
What reactions, and to what stimuli? — Three things 
stand out, Voice, Scale (sung but not seen), and Notes 
(more accurately, Notation). 
Voice first. We take careful thought to make dress and 
face beautiful. The tones that issue from our faces, our 
vocal personality, should be no less so. If everyone could 
be compelled to speak into a dictaphone for an hour and 
then listen to himself, it would lead to a great deal of re- 
form. If we can get our pupils to speak musically, we 
have succeeded royally with our vocal music — beyond 
praise. ; 
Knowing the scale means that when any note of it is 
sounded, as la, or mi, the pupil can then sing all of that 
scale, from high do to low do; also, that he can jump from 
any note of that scale to any other note at will, singing 
do-sol, or la-fa, or any other combination requested. The 
tones have then taken on what the musicians call tonality, 
that is, the feeling that they are just so far above or below 
certain other tones. 
Finally comes the reading of that peculiar notation which 
has grown up with the history of music, each note in proper 
pitch, rhythm, and time, and the whole sounded with suit- 
able expression. In the simpler selections, our pupil should 
be able, given his key pitch, to read at sight both music 
and words together. 
What responses are ready? — As to voice, all children 
under twelve are sopranos (though some, owing to adenoids 
or other ailment, may not at first seem to be), and so should 
sing the higher tones and not the lower ones. The larynx 
grows rapidly until the age of six, but does not change 
much after that until comes the change of voice at the period 
of puberty.

MUSIC 313 
   
   
   
                                     
   
     As to scale, few if any six-year-olds will know it as such; 
but many of them will be found able to carry a tune, if the 
tune is not too heavy. Music, like language, comes at 
first wholly by imitation. To hear and to utter are almost 
one process, not with gossips only, but among all mankind. 
Ear and vocal cords are so closely connected as to consti- 
tute, for some purposes, almost a single sense organ. Con- 
sequently, the children who have heard much singing are 
very likely to have done some. And again consequently, 
most children are able to ‘‘match tones,” that is, to sing a 
tone like any that is sung to them if it is within their range. 
However, there may be found quite a fraction of first 
graders (and of higher graders if they have not previously 
had music) who go on responding with the same tone no 
matter what note is sounded as stimulus, and so are called 
“monotones.”” 
But nearly all monotones can be trained to sing, and 
usually within a few months. Cases that do not respond 
to training should be referred to the school physician, as 
the difficulty is often due to nose, throat, or lung trouble. 
Only one or two in a hundred lack the essential kind of 
ear, or larynx, or bonds between them, and so cannot be 
taught to sing. Such “tone deafness” seems to correspond 
to the ‘“‘word blindness” which sometimes prevents read- 
ing. 
Our pupil’s experience should have given him a start, 
too, in the appreciation of rhythm, so necessary to song 
whether by ear or from notes. And finally, whatever else 
he has or lacks, he is pretty sure to have feelings, emotions, 
land these are to vocal music the very river of life. 
What relation have music bonds? — Few music bonds 
re simple and single; every tone and every rest relates to
-P-A-G-E-324
  314 THE CHILD’S MIND 
that which stands with it. In fact, this is exactly char- 
acteristic of music. Few of us can remember an absolute 
pitch, any more than we can keep in mind an absolute 
color well enough to go to the store and match it. We must 
have a sample with us. Just so, if we sound do without 
an instrument to-day, it is not likely to be the same note, 
when tested out by a piano, as the do our brain cells put 
forth yesterday. We must have a sample, as from a pitch 
pipe, to start us.'. Using this as a standard, we can jump 
from it to other notes. In music, we think in terms of 
“jumps,” intervals between notes.” 
When we teach a melody, a tune, or the running up and 
down the scale, we are forming bonds in series, a com- 
paratively simple matter for one who is safely out of the 
monotone class. Singing the various intervals of the scale 
may be thought of as mastering a great trunk line bond 
from which all tunes branch off as variations. But as in 
reading English, so in reading music, the inclusive unit is 
essential. Eye must travel ahead of voice. And singing 
introduces, sooner or later, a double difficulty; for the eye 
must pick up both words and notes. 
This means practice, practice almost ‘‘without stint or 
limit,’ and for each and every pupil who is expected to 
learn. But there never need be more than one difficulty 
at a time, for the work in music can be graded to the inch, 
so perfectly that the pupil feels he is moving along on the     
          
   
               
   
        
     
   1“ Absolute pitch” is defined by Gardner as “the ability to recognize and 
intonate any tone indicated.” He recommends that the student carry on his 
person a tuning fork (A at 435 vibrations) and sound it as often as opportunity 
permits. In this way many can acquire absolute pitch. (Carl E. Gardner— 
Essentials of Music Theory, p. 51.)

level rather than up grade. And although the words are an 
added difficulty, it is found that vocal reading adds, among 
other things, a push to the work in vocal music.! 
From sensori-motor to high level. — In the study of read- 
ing, we found that a child should have a deal of sensori- 
motor experience, and do a deal of talking about it, before 
he attempts to read. Similarly, he should have a deal of 
sensori-motor experience and do a deal of singing about it 
before he is expected to interpret symbols, either in the form 
of printed notes or the oral note-names. He must form ear- 
voice bonds first, as in language. Then he can hitch the eye- 
bonds onto these old tracks, as in teaching reading. The 
general course of the pupil’s progress in vocal music is from 
songs to notation, and then from notation back to songs, 
just as in reading he passes from story to printed page and 
then from the printed page learns to get his own stories 
again. 
In practice, this means that we must teach first a great 
many songs by imitation, ‘‘rote songs.” From rote to note is 
the motto. The repeated singing of such songs helps to fix, 
by a sort of drill that partakes of pure joy, tones, intervals, 
rhythm, and expression. As talking leads to the inner speech 
of reading, so the rote song leads to what may be called 
inner song, so essential to the reading of music. One must 
learn to get the feeling before singing it, just as one must 
look ahead and catch an idea before reading it aloud. 
Teaching the scale.— Half the time given over to the 
subject during the first year, perhaps, will be spent on rote 
1Says Dr. Hollis Dann, “Good oral reading is the greatest possible help to 
school singing; therefore, the music supervisor and teacher should assist in 
every possible way in bringing about the correlation of Music and Oral Read- 
ing from the first grade through the High School.” — Hollis Dann Music

   songs, for they are easiest and most interesting to learn. 
But the scale fixes the bonds that occur most frequently, and 
prepares the way for most other bonds-to-be. How shall we 
teach that? 
We may introduce a simple rote song whose words merely 
run down the scale and up again. After this, the pupil may 
sing loo, loo, loo, or coo, coo, coo, down and up. He then has 
only to learn the do-ti-la names and he can sing the scale. 
Next, the teacher should loo-loo or coo-coo in one direction 
or the other, until the pupil can tell with ease which way 
she is going. All is then ready for writing the scale on the 
board and reading it off again. 
In general, as just illustrated, the steps are (1) Imitation, 
(2) Recognition, (3) Representation, (4) Interpretation.' 
This means (1) ‘Sing what the teacher has just sung,” (2) 
“Sing the syllable names for the tones that she has just 
loo-loo-ed,”’ (3) ‘Write (or learn to write) what we have 
sung,” and (4) ‘Sing what we have written, or something 
else that is no harder.” 
Interval should be studied by the same plan. The easiest 
interval to recognize is the octave jump between low do and 
high do, and after this the chord intervals such as do-mi, mi- 
sol, sol-do. An easy way to introduce such an interval as do- 
mz is to write the two notes in their places on the staff with 
a light little re between them, barely touching the latter with 
the voice in passing it, and then omitting it altogether. 
Intervals of a second (from any note to the one next to it) 
can be drilled by singing do re, re mi, mi fa, ete., or do re do, 
do re mi re do, and so on till the top of the scale is reached, 
when the process may be reversed.

Reid Pierce, in Public School Methods, Vol. III.

Tonal vocabulary. — In drawing, the pupil has his “graphic 
vocabulary,” in reading and composition his vocabulary 
of words, and in music his tonal vocabulary. What is the 
unit in vocal music which corresponds to a word in reading? 
It is a jump, an interval between tones. But the size of this 
vocabulary of jumps is very limited as compared with verbal 
vocabulary ; for within the major scale it is only possible to 
pass from each of 8 tones to each of 7 others, a total of 56 
different jumps. A singer is expected to cover a range of 
about two octaves wherever his voice lies on the great staff, 
and we must also consider all the half tones of the chromatic 
scale; but even these additions leave the total tonal vocabu- 
lary comparatively small. 
Tones and notes cluster into phrases, as words do, forming 
inclusive units for both the ear and the eye. One can hardly 
hum any three tones at random without being reminded of 
apart of some old song. The more we sing, the more wealthy 
we become in tonal vocabulary. 
What further difficulties? — Rote songs taught and the 
mastery of the scale fairly well undgr way, the worst is over. 
We must still teach rhythm, time (meter), expression, part 
singing, and (if we are so ambitious) musical composition. 
The chief value of the last is that it is a means to appre- 
ciating and interpreting what others have done. But in 
each case it is easy to introduce only one difficulty at a time. 
In teaching rhythm, we can remove all difficulties as to notes 
and intervals by taking some piece that is simple to read. It 
helps, too, to remember that there are, in general, but two 
kinds of rhythm, the even and the odd, the walking (or 
marching) and the waltzing. Both rhythm and meter 
should be felt first and analyzed for accuracy afterward. 
Expression, as in reading, comes best with the familiar

  318 THE CHILD’S MIND 
pieces, where there is little left to do but express. Part sing- 
ing may begin with so simple a matter as having each group 
hold one note of a do-mi-sol-do chord; and throughout, the 
rule, of course, is separate singing of parts before synthetic 
recitation.! : 
In general, we must take the attitude of coaching a music 
team — finding whatever our pupils are weak in, and work- 
ing it up. 
Readiness. — Nature has made children ready to sing, and 
so has saved the teacher that trouble. They are few, from 
monotone to master, who will not ‘‘come out” on the kind 
of song that appeals to them. But special conditions may 
balk the work. Perhaps music has just been introduced, 
and the big boy is shy and half ashamed to be caught per- 
forming at it. It may be that his voice is changing. Per- 
haps the teacher is pushing the technique too fast, and not 
permitting singing enough. In one school where the girls 
“struck” on singing, the teacher at length discovered that 
the boys had told them they did not look pretty when they 
stretched their mouths for the high notes. (I do not know 
how this was remedied.) 
Someone has classified music as ‘‘foot music, heart music, 
and head music.”’ We can try out these kinds on the chil- 
dren, give them what they want, and gradually lift them, 
as we do in literature, to a higher level. 
Readiness for the individual piece can usually be gotten 
by ‘‘painting the picture.” Here we havea lullaby. ‘‘ Baby 
is going to Slumberland. All is still. The chickens are on    
    1 For details, both as to course of study and methods of teaching, a teacher’s 
manual is needed. Dr. Hollis Dann’s Complete Manual for Teachers (American 
Book Company) is excellent; but the work for the pupil is rather advanced in 
grade (as I think), and should be followed, in the average school, a year or so 
in the rear.

the roost, and the last little bird has stopped chirping and 
put his head under his wing. Hark! Mother sings the 
sleep song, very softly. Show us how.” 
Have your pupils feel that they are singing to you, or let 
one group or person sing to others. This puts vitality into 
the tone. ‘It is this sympathetic quality that pleases when 
we hear it, although we may not know what it is. With- 
out it, the most perfect voice and most perfect vocal technique 
is cold and fails to touch our hearts.” + 
The community counts for much in the creation of 
musical spirit. The Meistersingers of Germany saturated 
their country with music until sweet song flowed every- 
where. We may expect new devotion to music to arise 
from our community singing and from our National Week 
of Song. 
Exercise. — There is not enough musical exercise. Music 
teachers rightly demand individual recitations in music as 
in other subjects, and if possible, daily. Were the value of 
vocal exercise to the speaking voice more generally under- 
stood, there would be greater interest in school singing. 
The voice stands first in importance. The teacher must 
use good voice throughout the day, and in teaching music 
use the upper tones, even if the teacher is a man who sings 
bass. As a rule, do not sing with the children, as your ear 
must be open for their errors. Singing with a good phono- 
graph properly pitched approaches the tandem method if 
the record is made by a voice suitable for imitation by chil- 
dren. All experts agree that children’s singing should be 
done wholly in light, soft, head tones, so light (as one puts 
it) that 60 or 70 children, singing in a room with doors and 
windows closed, would not be heard outside. The range of

mean vocal damage beyond repair.! 
The first lesson. — “Playing engine”’ is a common way to 
start. The teacher, guided by pitch pipe or piano, gives a 
toot (perhaps on the C an octave above middle C) and 
asks all the children to toot the same way, passing quickly 
from seat to seat, listening carefully to each, and making a 
record of those who fail to ‘‘match tones.” From this time 
on, the teacher’s time will be divided between song work 
with those who are ready to sing, and special individual 
work with the monotones. By the end of the year there will 
probably be only one or two monotones left in a large grade. 
Until we can ‘‘guide the nerve current repeatedly along 
the right path” in this way, there should be very little sing- 
ing with the piano, in kindergarten or elsewhere; for thereby 
the monotones are wearing deep the wrong paths. 
Dealing with monotone and change of voice. — Experts 
differ as to how to deal with monotones. Some have faith 
in training by listening, supplemented by individual effort, 
asking the pupil to think of higher and lower tones, ete. 
Others stress the pupil’s own efforts. Gebhard claims that 
a cure can usually be worked at once by having a child who 
can sing stand before one who cannot, directing the poor 
singer to watch the mouth of the other and imitate him as 
he sings the desired tone. Other suggestions are to have 
the monotone imitate the sounds of nature, such as the 
note of the cuckoo; or to slide his voice anywhere, up or

down, until he hears himself sounding a variety of tones, at 
least. 
It is said that more voices are damaged during the period 
of change of voice at puberty than at any other time, and 
that girls, whose voice change is so gradual as to be often un- 
noticed, frequently suffer worse than boys. The change in 
the girl is shown by a slight hoarseness, roughness, or huski- 
ness. During this period of change, a pupil’s voice may 
shift rather rapidly, down, and up, and down again, result- 
ing in the singing of alto to-day, soprano to-morrow. If 
care is taken, it seems unnecessary, during this time of vocal 
variation, for children to stop singing altogether. Strain is 
the great danger. Sing softly is the great precept. 
The three essentials of voice culture. — Young children 
should think little of their throats, or diaphragms, or other 
parts of their anatomy; they should speak and sing imi- 
tatively and let nature do the rest. But as they grow, they 
can gather much of vocal culture in a very simple form. 
There are three essentials to be considered by one who 
would produce the best voice he is capable of — best as to 
quality, hygiene, and ease and endurance in singing or 
speaking. They are (1) diaphragmatic breathing (‘‘breath 
support”’), (2) the open throat, and (3) “‘voice placement,” 
the centering of the voice at the point (apparently low in the 
nose or high in the front mouth) where the sound of m 
seems to be when one hums it. Toward this point the 
voice should be directed whenever it is used for any pur- 
pose.! : 
        
                                    
     
       
  1The word “home” is an ideal one for vocal culture: the A is naturally 
thrown all the way from the diaphragm, the o opens the throat like that of a 
singing canary, and the m locates the “hammer point” on which the voice 
should be centered. 
       
-P-A-G-E-332
    322 THE CHILD’S MIND 
It is true, of course, that the accomplished singer or 
speaker “does not know he has a throat.” But he prob- 
ably knew it once. Many have to grow through a stage of 
conscious skill. The best age for this period of conscious 
management seems to be unknown. 
Effect. — Effect, like readiness, naturally takes care of 
itself. Music is its own reward, and one gets, from the 
beginning, without much labor, a large portion of the kind 
of enjoyment that is ultimate — the joy of the master. A 
class that does not take to the technical drill should not be 
rushed, but may spend more time on musical appreciation, 
selecting records for the school phonograph, taking up the 
stories of the operas — gems in themselves — and solving 
problems based on classic samples, such as ‘“‘What name 
would you give this?” or ‘‘What does it make you feel like 
doing?” 
  Testing essential bonds. — As before indicated, one very 
practical test (for both teacher and pupil) is the use of a 
pleasing voice in voicing anything. So far as mastery of 
the scale and the reading of music are concerned, the course 
itself can be made largely its own test; for it is a course of 
graded action, and one can tell pretty definitely whether or 
not the successive acts can be performed by each pupil. 
Prognostic tests, developed by Professor Carl E. Seashore 
at the University of Iowa, have attracted international at- 
tention. By means of them he attempts to discover mu- 
sical talent, especially among school children, and to deter- 
mine to what degree such talent warrants development.!

2. What needs to be done, in your school, to improve musical 
facilities? Is there any way to get this done? 
3. Give instances from child life to show that ear and vocal 
cords ‘constitute, for some purposes, almost a single sense organ.” 
4. State some of the means by which you would expect to 
train pupils to use the inclusive unit in reading and singing 
music. 
5. In your judgment, what place has silent reading (of notes 
especially) in the study of music? 
6. Give an original illustration to show how you would lead 
children through the steps of Imitation, Recognition, Represen- 
tation, Interpretation. 
7. Suggest, if you can, games or near-games that could be used 
in the teaching of music. Do you think it would be possible to 
have pupils opera-tize a musical story, singing their parts, as in 
reading they dramatize a story by saying their parts? 
8. Mention situations that may have come to your notice, 
such as possibly in Sunday Schools, where children are sometimes

a monotone? Why? 
10. Do you suffer from hoarseness or sore throat after using 
your voice for an hour? If so, test whether you speak with open 
throat, and with your voice directed to the m-point in your

as he goes about his daily life? 
11. Tell or show how you would teach a rote song.

APPENDIX TO CHAPTER XV 
A Brief Statement of the Theory of Music 
In the origin of music, voice came first, and may well stand 
first in the explanation of it. 
Man’s “voice box” is so made that he could sing continuously, 
like a siren whistle, from his lowest note to his highest and vice 
versa;! but he prefers to go up and down by steps, separate tones 
with jumps, skips, intervals, spaces, steps, between them. Further, 
he dislikes monotony, and so does not want all these steps to be 
equal, but puts in a half step here or there. Just where the half 
step shall be sung is a matter of taste and habit among different 
peoples. Arabian music, for example, has a scale different from 
ours, richer, and in some respects more accurate. 
The musicians of the early Church, probably building on and 
changing the old Greek scale, finally placed a half step between 
the third and fourth notes of the scale, and another between its 
seventh and eighth tones. In particular, a Benedictine monk 
named Guido (best pronounced Gwee-do) who lived and sang 
about the year 1000, fixed upon a scale which is substantially the 
one we use now. 
In order that bass voices may sing low and soprano voices high 
and still sing the same tune, it is convenient to have in vocal 
music note-names which do not indicate a fixed pitch, as notes do 
on the staff, but only tone relations: that is, they enable us to 
make the proper jumps, or steps, between notes, no matter what 
11t is strange that musical instruments have not been invented to produce 
more of this sliding music. The slide on the violin and on the Hawaiian guitar 
suggest the fine possibilities that lie in this direction. Music should have its 
curves as well as its angles. 
   
-P-A-G-E-337

the pitch. These names are like pronouns: just as I or me may 
be any person in the world, so do may be any tone in the world. 
We may sing any tone we please, call it do, and go on with our 
scale from there. (In the school room, we must of course begin 
with pitch pipe or piano, so as not to get our scale too high or too 
low for the children’s voices.) Guido felt the need for such note- 
names, and used for them the first syllable of each line of a Latin 
hymn to St. John, Ut, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, — music as he wrote 
it requiring but six names. The Italians later changed ut to do 
(though the French have not) and added tt. 
These names for vocal notes may also be likened to numbers: 
we could just as well sing ‘‘One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, 
eight,” as to sing “Do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do,” except that the 
Latin syllables are sweeter and less awkward. We should then have 
to remember that there is a half step between notes three and 
four (mi and fa), and between notes seven and eight (ti and do). 
To write music, a “Great Staff” was used originally, consisting 
of eleven lines, as shown below, and the first seven letters of the 
alphabet were used instead of syllables. A clef is simply a sign 
to show where we are going to pitch our music on the big staff, 
high up, or in the middle, or low down. The treble clef, or G clef 
G

F G 
(looking like a written capital S made backward, but really a 
modification of an old letter G, to show that the second line of the 
treble staff represents the pitch G) indicates that we are to use the 
upper part of the great staff. The bass clef (looking like a capital 
C, but originally a letter F used to show that the fourth line from 
the bottom represented that pitch) indicates that we are to use

the lower part of the great staff. The third clef, the C clef; is at 
present little used. 
Now, the notes as written on the staff mark fixed pitches. If 
we begin our vocal scale on C, call that do, and mount the staff, 
all goes smoothly; for in music as written there is always a half 
step between F and G, and another between B and C (as shown by 
the absence of black keys at these points on the piano), correspond- 
ing to the half step between mi and fa, and that between ti and do. 
But if we start on any other pitch letter and call it do, we get into 
trouble: for the steps and half steps of the scale as fixed in letters 
on the staff do not correspond with those of our vocal scale, and 
the vocal scale has been so thoroughly drilled into us that we can 
not well change it. To unriddle this trouble, sharps and flats are 
used on the staff to ‘‘raise” and “lower’’ its notes wherever neces- 
sary until its intervals correspond with those of the vocal scale. 
For this reason, it is just as easy to sing a piece with a signature 
of three or four sharps or flats as if it had none; for given our do, 
our key note (always the first note of any scale as that scale is 
written on the staff), we go ahead and sing the same old vocal 
scale with the same old intervals. 
(For further insight into the relations between the scale as 
sung and music as written, work the Class Exercise of this 
chapter.) 
Enter now the instrumentalists, aided by the students of physics, 
with their measurement of each tone in terms of vibrations per 
second. They have proven what the vocalists vaguely felt, that 
upper do is “the same” note as lower do, except that the upper 
has just twice as many vibrations per second. Our modern 
musicians have established their “equally tempered” scale by 
starting from the A above “middle C” and agreeing that this tone 
shall be one of 435 vibrations per second. The A an octave higher, 
then, must have 870 vibrations per second. They now divide 
this interval between the two A’s, consisting of 435 vibrations, 
into 12 equal parts, half steps, and distribute the 11 intervening 
tones accordingly. Result: the so-called chromatic scale, run- 
ning (to use our vocal-music names again) from low do to high 
do, and all the way by half steps. 
In addition to the scale which has a half step between the third 
 
-P-A-G-E-339
  MUSIC 329 
and fourth notes, and between the seventh and eighth, and which 
is known as the Major Scale, there are two scales called Minor. 
They differ from the major scale in the matter of intervals, or 
jumps between notes. The relation of the scales is shown in the 
following diagram, where the circles stand for tones, those in the 
upper line being a half step apart.

HeattH Epucation 
Many years ago, Disraeli, keenly alive to influences affecting national pros- 
perity, stated: ‘“ Public health is the foundation on which reposes the happiness 
of the people and the power of a country. The care of the public health is the 
first duty of a statesman.” It may well be claimed that the care of individual 
and family health is the first and most patriotic duty of a citizen. — W. H. 
Tart? 
Exerrciss.— ‘In the suburb of Plainburg there were two 
families which we may call the Grumble family and the Humble 
family. The members of the Grumble family were a thin, whin- 
ing, complaining aggregation, who looked as if their meals did not 
agree with them or do them much gocd. In contrast, the Humble 
family were well-nourished, happy, smiling, and contented. Both 
families ate in the same dining room at an apartment house. The 
Grumble family paid strict attention to business during meals, 
conversing only to complain about the food and seldom taking 
over fifteen minutes to a meal, while the Humble family always 
ate twice as long and made their meals occasions fer laughing, 
joking, and having a good time. The members of the Grumble 
family said they had indigestion and wished to move because of 
the food. 
“Tf you were the head of the Grumble family, what would you 
do?” 
The need for health education. — Health education is a 
continuation of life craft; for health is the condition of a 
body that is rife with lasting life. Health education com- 
bines ‘“‘physiology and hygiene” with “physical culture”;

for these two are united in purpose, and that is the deepest 
kind of union there can be. 
The situation is this: Man, made in the image of his 
Maker, has become the most mongrel breed on earth, and 
badly distempered at that. Near 40 per cent of the young 
men of America have been found unfit for military service, 
and it is thought that the women, judged by female stand- 
. ards, are in a worse condition. About 75 per cent of our 
school children, some 16,000,000 of them, are said to be 
suffering from one or more physical defects. Roosevelt, it 
is said, speaking of the common ignorance and neglect of 
health measures among the people, expressed himself as em- 
phatically as an ex-president is permitted to, exclaiming, 
“Tf the darned fools only knew!”” Now, the school is sup- 
posed to put an end to this particular kind of fool, the kind 
that fools himself; but many schools are still training them. 
There is good evidence to show that school life is likely to 
interfere with growth, hinder nutrition, induce bad breath- 
ing by bad posture, adulterate the blood, cause mental de- 
pression, cumulatively fatigue its pupils and reduce their 
grade of health. 
What responses, and to what situations? — Action is the 
response we want in health education, and to every situation. 
Mr. Hasty Hypocrite pinned his prayers to his bedpost, 
pointed to them morning and night and said, ‘“O Lord, 
these are my sentiments.’”’ When a child gets up in school 
and recites, ‘‘Eat slowly. Brush the teeth at least twice a 
day,” and then throws his lunch down the trap door of his 
esophagus and leaves to his tongue the brushing of his 
teeth, that must please the Evil One as it does when Hasty 
Hypocrite goes out and cheats a widow. The text for both 
is, ‘This do, and thou shalt live.”
-P-A-G-E-342
    332 THE CHILD’S MIND 
Asleep, awake, by night, by day, we are practicing health 
or ill-health every minute. How can we see to it that our pu- 
pil does himself good, and not evil, all the days of his life? 
What are the health responses? — A body has more cells 
than any country has citizens. To control it and keep it 
healthy is a more complex task than to govern a nation. 
We must beware or we shall be lost in the multiplicity of 
prescriptions as our legislative bodies sometimes lose them- 
selves in a labyrinth of legislation. We need a table of sim- 
ple health commandments. 
Such a table has been prepared,! and is here presented. 
The Sixteen Rules of Hygiene 
ies Age 
1. Ventilate every room you occupy. 
2. Wear light, loose, and porous clothes. 
3. Seek out-of-door occupations and recreations. 
4. Sleep out of doors if you can. 
5. Breathe deeply. 
II. Food 
6. Avoid overeating and overweight. (Or, for 
children, ‘‘Keep up your weight, but don’t get 
too fat.’’)? 
7. Eat sparingly of meats and eggs. 
8. Eat some hard, some bulky, some raw foods. 
9. Eat slowly. 
10. Use sufficient water internally and externally.

Life Extension Institute. It is quoted here from How to Live, Ch. V. 
? Among children, there is frequently a serious problem of undernourish- 
ment. In view of this fact, Dr. Eugene Lyman Fisk, Medical Director of the 
Life Extension Institute, has suggested (in personal correspondence with me) 
that Rule 6 be more accurately adapted to children by the change indicated.
-P-A-G-E-343
  HEALTH EDUCATION 333 
III. Poisons 
11. Eliminate thoroughly, regularly, and frequently. 
12. Stand, sit, and walk erect. 
13. Do not allow poisons and infections to enter 
the body. 
14. Keep the teeth, gums, and tongue clean. 
IV. Activity 
15. Work, play, rest, and sleep in moderation. 
16. Keep serene and whole-hearted. 
The essentials, then, are simple: Air, Food, Poisons, 
Activity — as we deal with these our lives are made or 
unmade. But the rules are comprehensive: each of the 
sixteen, if expanded, would form a whole chapter or treatise. 
The above are individual responses. Self-preservation 
first. But no one lives to himself alone — gets ill, or well, 
or dies alone. After the child has learned to inspect him- 
self, or be inspected, and care for himself for his own sake, 
he must help to inspect the community, or see that it is 
inspected, and care for the public health for the sake of the 
general good. Some of the bonds we want to form are 
community bonds. 
What reactions already? — There are many wrong re- 
actions. As in good English, so in good health: the reason 
why it takes so long to educate our pupils is because we 
must spend so much time untraining them. It is too bad 
that the command, ‘‘Children, obey your parents”’ cannot 
be made to read, ‘‘Children, imitate your parents.” The 
plain fact is that in health education we hardly know 
whether to begin with the parents or with the children. 
The average specimen of human young is a pitiful waif,

form of civilization. Time was when he could participate 
with his parents in many types of happy activity, such as 
the work of the farm. But these occupations are gone, 
and the hours hang empty, or may be filled with evil. 
Surveys show that about half the children observed out- 
side of school are loafing, ignorant even of play. 
Many children sleep without a window open, and not

conditions. A considerable per cent eat too much of the 
wrong foods and too little of the right ones, and so are 
undernourished. (See Figure 29.) Often they do not

is a woeful weed.

      HEALTH EDUCATION 335 
Nevertheless, the case is a cheerful one. Children have 
a wealth of instincts which, under right guidance, drive 
directly for health. For instance, the greatest problem of 
childhood is that of proper feeding; and if there is any one 
thing children love to do, it is to eat. We shall take up 
the native responses under ‘‘ Readiness.” 
From ready-formed bonds to new connections. — The very 
existence of so many cranks shows us that the health bonds, 
like those of nature study, must be rather numerous and 
largely independent — the air-eating crank, the chew-it-to-a- 
fluid crank, the water-soaked crank, the muscle-minded 
crank,.and many another. Health depends on a number 
of habit-factors, and almost any habit may be formed first. 
Grading, in the usual sense of the word, is scarcely neces- 
sary. Of course we shall pass from sensori-motor to high- 
level bonds, with practice first and principles afterward. 
But we shall feel free to teach ‘‘whatever comes along” 
that is easiest and most interesting for our pupils to learn, 
or, sometimes, whatever they perforce must learn if they are 
to keep their grip on life. At the same time, we may be 
sure that the bonds formed will function very frequently, 
aiding in all after acquisitions. Health is like wealth: the 
more you get, up to a large limit, the easier it is for you to 
get more. : 
How induce readiness? — How to induce readiness is one 
of our largest questions, for many children do not love health 
for itself alone. A teacher, on returning to a town where 
she had taught some years before, inquired of a parent about 
his son. ‘He is dead,” was the reply, ‘‘and the reason is 
that we were never able to teach him to take care of himself. 
Athletics and exposure brought him to an early grave.” 
Such cases are all too numerous. Consequently, we must

often follow the indirect method, the method of health-by- 
stealth. 
Influence of environment. — Ingersoll proposed to improve 
the world by making health catching, instead of disease. 
It is catching: in any town where the grown-ups have 
caught it, the children are almost sure to. It must be 
noised abroad that the secret of success has been dis- 
covered, something which successful people always carry 
with them, and without which no one can hope for per- 
manent success. Play days and field days rouse interest, 
several towns, perhaps, uniting in the sports. The Parent- 
Teacher Association and other organizations will help take 
the ‘‘ease” out of disease, and when the conscience of the 
community is prepared, perhaps a sanitary survey can be 
put through — for the school system, at least.' 
Further, we can, without offense, ask some very searching 
questions at school, perhaps making a health survey of the 
children.? Terman thinks the teacher should make a sleep 
survey each year, and says she will find something to sur- 
prise her. The Junior Red Cross or the Modern Health 
Crusade?‘ will carry the work home. And when Daddy and 
Sonny are doing the same health stunts in comradeship, the 
force is irresistible. 
If any disease wave dashes through our community, let 
us use it to float our health instruction — not to stir fear, but

to explain causes, to make pupils careful for themselves and 
others, and to create confidence that hygiene means high 
health. 
Condition of learner. — Perhaps health is the one thing we 
learn best when we are sick. It is then we feel most keenly 
our hygienic blunder (or accident) and resolve that it shall 
not occur again. A similar feeling attaches to the discovery 
that one is undersize or underweight ! (though inheritance 
should always be considered in this connection), or that he 
is ‘below par” in anything. It is said that all boys want to 
be athletic and all girls beautiful. We must build on such 
wants. A nutritional class, with special milk feeding in 
school, is often a real wonder worker. 
The teacher.— The time is at hand when none but the 
healthy teacher will be permitted to teach. But that is not 
enough: she must regard her little charges as so many young 
things to be brooded into healthy maturity — and brood 
them, practicing with them, so far as possible, the essential 
habits with regard to air, food, poisons, and activity. Per~ 
haps the conscientious teacher offends most frequently 
through overwork and its effects. She does not “work, 
play, rest and sleep in moderation,” and so fails to ‘‘keep 
serene and whole-hearted,” loses the power to enjoy her 
work and her pupils. The only way to cure some teachers 
of overwork is to amputate the conscience — the enlarged 
and work-infected part of it. 
Task and stimulus. — If we could pass health around on 
a platter, everybody would take a large piece. But of noth-

  338 THE CHILD’S MIND 
ing else, probably, is Goethe’s statement so true, that you 
must ‘‘earn your inheritance in order to possess it.’’ What 
instincts and abilities will set our pupils to work to do this? 
The instinct for action appears in games and exercises, and 
many of these involve ryhthm and voice, as singing. Music 
of any kind is always a strong reénforcement. There should 
also be action in the form of pupil participation in ventilating, 
lighting, and perhaps heating the schoolroom, and if possible 
in preparing the school lunch. 
Curiosity can be aroused and satisfied by experiments. 
What happens to the candle or the plant that has no air? 
What will a smoking piece of blotting paper show as to just 
how the air is flowing through the room? Heat oleomargarine 
and butter to see which melts first. See if you can blow 
easily through various pieces of cloth. If not, they are unfit 
for clothing. 
Play is the health educator’s mighty magazine of energy. 
If we glance at the time commonly given to recess and 
physical training (see table in the Introduction to Part II of 
this book), we find it near the upper limit. If we add to this 
the time the child spends, or may spend, playing during the 
noon hour, before and after school, and during vacations, 
we shall find it amounts to more than all his time in school. 
As science is just common sense organized, so play is just 
animality organized and directed. Play that more defi- 
nitely expresses ideas is found in dramatization: let one band- 
age another’s arm, or tie up a finger supposed to be cut — do 
not wash it, as water is bad in the ordinary wound — or 
show (if the children are strong enough) how the fireman 
carries a man on his back. 
Imitation, self-assertion and competition, wholesome fear, 
the herd instinct — all of these forces we shall tap to drive 
   
-P-A-G-E-349
  HEALTH EDUCATION 339 
home our sixteen points. Other branches of study, since 
they are helped on by health, should return the favor. In 
construction work, cut out and mount pictures of model 
postures; in drawing, make health posters; | in composition, 
compose health stories; let the spirit of health flow through 
all branches. 
Exercise. If we want to “‘guide the nerve current 
repeatedly along the right path,” book work must be second- 
ary, for we are not building many book bonds. Actual prac- 
tice must lead, seconded by experiments and demonstrations. 
If there is any subject in which the teacher should be ashamed 
to fail of approach to the tandem method of teaching, it is 
health education. Her daily life should be a living embodi- 
ment of the ‘‘sixteen rules,’ and she should have some results 
to show in her own health — it is of no use to employ bald- 
headed drug clerks to sell hair restorer. 
Our whole school practice can be a tandem project. In 
the morning, we will ‘‘ventilate every room we occupy.” 
Later, when we are ready to take our exercises, we will 
ventilate the room still more. If the weather permits, 
monitors may throw the windows open. We peel off our 
coats or sweaters so as to wear, for a time at least, “light, 
loose, porous clothing.” If at all possible, we “‘seek out-of- 
door occupations and recreations” by going outside for our 
exercise. We stand and walk erect, and we breathe deeply. 
It is out of school that the “errors and exceptions” will 
worry us. To head them off, and to lead the pupils to 
practice as they will perform, we must keep asking them,

“Now can we not do all these things at home in just this 
way?” At the same time, we must avoid shocking or 
offending these homes too seriously, for that interferes with 
our usefulness and actual service. A morning inspection 
will help us to find out what is going on, or a survey may be

conducted by the children themselves. Sometimes a health 
club is formed, and the officers conduct the inspection 
according to a “Score Card for Hygienic Living.” ! 
Organizing for health education.— Arrangement of pro- 
gram is one of the first considerations. Schools that have

-P-A-G-E-351
  HEALTH EDUCATION 341 
plenty of health education and handwork can safely lengthen 
the school day as compared with those that do book work 
only. Recesses, if taken ideally, would be short, and timed 
at intervals of about an hour; such recesses, however, 
under ordinary conditions, would probably have a serious 
interrupting influence. But whenever the recess, the 
teacher should enjoy it with her pupils, teaching and lead- 
ing whenever necessary, and seeing to it that pupil play 
leaders are brought into service as they are needed and are 
able to serve. 
Playgrounds are often so limited that the play can only 
be a small sample of what it ought to be. In such cases, 
it may be well to take recess by sections that occupy the 
grounds on some plan of alternation. Some prefer to keep 
boys and girls apart in their play. It is more important 
to separate the younger children from the older. Ap- 
paratus is desirable but not indispensable. Where manual 
training is given, home made apparatus, such as see-saws, 
swings, and slides, can be constructed. But the essential 
thing is that the pupil’s larger muscles shall come into play 
until he breathes energetically and his circulation quickens, 
without throwing him into a sweat. 
Plays and games. — Formal exercises, carefully graded and 
usually taken by count or command, are very fatiguing and 
are now used but sparingly. The great reliance of health 
educators is rightly placed on plays, games, sports. The 
teacher who can lead children in play may almost be called 
well equipped. 
Johnson, in his excellent little book,! distinguishes five 
stages of play-and-game development. The first is three

Company. The book gives many games for children of all ages.
-P-A-G-E-352
    
342 THE CHILD’S MIND 
years in length, and is characterized by playing with the 
body and whatever objects may be about. Typical games 
are “This Little Pig Went to Market,” and ‘“ Pat-a-Cake.” 
The second period (ages 4-6) is individualistic rather than 
social. It calls for many toys, and enjoys personal freedom 
and activity. The child does not take up many formal 
games except under the leadership of adults. But he can 
be induced to play chasing games, such as “Tag” and 
“Drop the Handkerchief.” 
The third period (ages 7-9) is still individualistic, but 
skill and competition are marked. Very welcome are such 
games as ‘‘Puss in the Corner,” hoop races, and simple ball 
games. 
Period four (ages 10-12) is one of great bodily activity, 
“self-assertion and apparent selfishness,” and keen interest 
inrunning. The beginnings of organization appear. Good 
sample activities are relay races, ‘‘Cross Tag,” “Follow the 
Leader,”’ and ball games. 
In the fifth period (ages 13-15), sex differences in games 
stand out, and there is a strong tendency toward organiza- 
tion into teams and gangs. Ball games of all kinds are en- 
joyed, with swimming and the usual athletic events. 
Of course these periods are not sharply separated by 
birthdays; but a knowledge of general trend of develop- 
ment will help greatly in guiding our games. 
Set exercises. — Exercises need not be “set” at all. If 
you keep in mind the essential feature, which is to work the 
large muscles of trunk and limbs, the exercises you devise 
for your children will sometimes be better than the intricate 
and carefully graded ones found in the books. Two com- 
mands are usually given for each unit-movement, a pre- 
paratory command, given rather slowly and with voice
-P-A-G-E-353
  
HEALTH EDUCATION 343 
gliding upward, followed some two seconds later by the 
command of execution, given in a slightly higher tone and 
so sharply as to be almost explosive. Thus, ‘‘Hands on 
hips” “Place!” Pupils must not move before the 
second command comes. 
Such exercises are likely to be uninteresting and fatiguing. 
Take them out of doors if possible. Within doors, substi- 
tute, frequently, some such exercise as marching or swinging 
through seats. But a real out-of-door frolic is best of all. 
Effect. — One reason why the teaching of health has not 
been more successful is because health has been taken for 
granted, and illness as a special visitation of Providence. 
We have not taken the trouble to stand up and be measured 
as to health. Many a man has been chagrined to find 
himself turned down by a military examining board as 
unfit to fight. The pupil must know whether he is ‘‘turned 
down” or not. 
There are many ways of accomplishing this. One is the 
morning (or periodical) inspection, with scoring, already 
spoken of. Another is the reporting of weight to parents, 
month by month, along with grades in arithmetic and read- 
ing. (Parents can be brought to take as much pride in a 
fine child as in a good dog, or the family car.) Weighing 
contests at school picnics have been made use of. A posture 
test may be given (heels, hips, and shoulders should form a 
straight line, with head erect, when the pupil stands) and 
ithe results scored, and one may “‘take off’’ for notably bad 
itting or standing posture during school hours. Many 
eachers get from the Bureau of Education (Washington, 
.C.) a ‘Classroom Weight Record,” hang it in the school- 
oom, and let children make the entries on it as they “play 
he game,’’ trying to win a gold star for normal increase in   
         
   
                   
    
-P-A-G-E-354
  344 THE CHILD’S MIND 
weight. It is found that, in order to win, they become 
willing to eat wholesome foods which they have once despised. 
Tagging the children when they are weighed interests both 
them and their parents.! 
We can teach health if we think enough of it, and keep 
other things from crowding it out; and children will pursue it 
if they find that others, whom they respect, are also in the 
chase, and that the results are real. A child will even brush 
his teeth with soap (a good dentifrice, if it is pure) if he finds 
that it wins him release from the dentist’s chair with the 
verdict, ‘‘No cavities this time.” 
Tests. — If we teach physiology and hygiene from a book, 
have the pupil recite to us, and then give him a written. 
examination, his situations and responses are not directly 
those of health practice at all. Not that book study is worth- 
less: the hygiene I learned in this bookish way in a country 
school years ago has kept coming back to me ever since in a 
way most helpful. But such medicine needs to be rubbed in 
with deeds. 
What we want to know is whether the pupil is practicing 
his sixteen rules, and others related to them. The tests and 
surveys and score cards already suggested will throw a part 
of the information before us. The attendance record will 
reveal more. How many days have the pupils (and the} 
teacher) missed because of illness? Tests such as those fo: 
good air can be applied. Is it pure, moving, moist, and cool

and ears and various other organs, all of which help to show 
the working of health bonds or the lack of them. 
Signs of illness. — Practical tests or symptoms that show 
lack of health should also be in the teacher’s ken, that she 
may know when to summon the physician, isolate the pupil, 
or perhaps exclude him from school. Such symptoms are 
great paleness, unusual dullness or sleepiness, sickness at 
stomach, frequent requests to go out, chills, high tempera- 
ture, discharge from eyes, nose, or ears, eruption of any 
unusual nature, sore or inflamed throat, cough if at all se- 
vere or peculiar, enlarged glands, headaches, “‘fits,’”’ very 
bad breath (especially if with other symptoms), dizziness, 
or failure to eat as usual. 
Signs of fatigue.— The teacher should also practice the 
recognition of those pupils whose tissues are being consumed 
by too much work of brain or muscle; in other words, those 
who are fatigued. Extremes of condition appear: the figure 
is either slouchy, with a constant tendency to seek support 
of some kind, or it is overtense; the gait drags or shows spas- 
modic quickness; the face is pale or carries a nervous flush, 
but is not healthily rosy; there may be much yawning and 
sleepiness, or insomnia; ideas refuse to come at all or come 
with such a rush as to confuse utterance; the fatigued per- 
son may be precipitate, fiery, and rude in dealing with others, 
or become too tired to meet them with comfort. Which of 
these opposite symptoms appear depends largely on the stage 
of fatigue. Fatigue poison, like alcohol, usually starts an 
increased liveliness, followed by depression. 
The eyelids often droop, the lines of the face turn down- 
ard, and the smile is forced or absent. Temperature may 
e high, and headache or tightening in the head is common, 
ometimes accompanied by palpitation of the heart, indiges-

tion, and dizziness. Attention wanders from the lesson to 
the pupil’s own condition. He may work feverishly, with 
many errors, or slow down altogether.

Teacher, will be found a score card for hygienic living. This 
should give great help. Those who believe that health practice 
really makes for health should modify the program to fit their in- 
dividual needs. keep it conspicuously in their rooms, and follow it. 
FOR FURTHER STUDY 
1. In my boyhood study of physiology, I learned the name and 
location of each bone in the body. Do you advise this practice? 
What is its relation to health? 
2. Suggest how you would have your pupils, at the proper age, 
begin to inspect the community and do something about improv- 
ing unsatisfactory conditions.     
    
   
      
    3. What, as you see it, is the relation between mental and 
bodily health? 
4. What do you think of the “case method of studying hy- 
giene,”’ as illustrated in the exercise at the opening of this chapter? 
Give an illustration to show how you could use it in presenting to 
your class some other point of healthy living. 
5. What do you think the community should do in the way of 
keeping its teachers healthy —for example, seeing to it that 
sanitary residence and good board are obtained at fair prices?

GARDEN-AND-FarM CRAFT 
Exercises. — 1. Do you think there is any culture in agricul- 
ture? What was the original meaning of culture? (See diction- 
ary.) About one half the people of the United States live in the 
country, and there are more people engaged in agriculture than in 
any other one industry. What importance does this give to farm- 
ing? If all farmers should strike, or refuse to sell their product 
except for a very high price, what would be the effect? What 
future use is the country child likely to have for the farming bonds 
that we build into his education? The city child? Should agri- 
culture be taught in city schools? Why or why not? 
2. Imagine yourself in a section of country far removed from 
your own, where grow crops that are strange to you. For example, 
if you live in the North, imagine yourself in the cotton belt. 
What are the chief questions you would ask, and the principal 
things you would want to learn to do in order to raise a crop there?! 
A good place to begin an education is right where Adam 
and Eve learned their lessons together, in a garden. Now 
a farm is just a garden grown big, and farming is a serious 
and extensive kind of life craft. Agriculture is man’s way 
of drawing his living out of the ground — and out of the 
air. He must learn to do it without spoiling either the soil 
or himself. (There seems to be no danger of spoiling the 
air very soon.) Even city children should Jearn something

goes on a farm and how to teach it to him, see Aretas W. Nolan’s The Teaching

-P-A-G-E-360
350 THE CHILD’S MIND 
  about farming — enough to appreciate farmers and give 
them a square deal on election day and all other days. 
Situation and response. — The situation is a piece of 
ground (or means of getting it), and the response is doing 
whatever is necessary to make that ground bring forth as 
many fold as possible. ‘Agriculture,’ however, is now a 
broad term, including animal husbandry as well as the care 
of plants. To help us get our. bearings, let us glance over 
its divisions. 
Agronomy is a general study of soils and crops. Animal 
Husbandry deals with different breeds of cattle, hogs, sheep, 
poultry and other farm animals, and how to care for them. 
Horticulture is literally gardening, and treats mainly of 
vegetable gardening, landscape gardening, orcharding (‘‘po- 
mology”), and the propagation of plants. Farm Manage- 
ment takes up such topics as labor, equipment, records, and 
markets. In addition, courses are sometimes given in Farm 
Physics, or Engineering, Improvement of Plants and Animals, 
Rural Life, etc. In some sections, Forestry is studied as a 
part of agriculture. 
What bonds shall we form? — In the elementary school, 
we can attempt only a limited program of farm-and-garden 
eraft. It will form so natural a continuation of the work in 
nature study and other elementary science that the children 
will not know, as they come up through the grades, where 
one leaves off and the other begins. We may take topics 
from any or all of the branches of agriculture; but we shall 
choose always from among those that loom large in the 
community, which our pupils can be interested in, and which 
they can master. 
Let us take a very representative topic as a sample: What 
bonds shall we build for gardening? Our little farmer must
-P-A-G-E-361
  GARDEN-AND-FARM CRAFT 351 
} 
(1) select his plot so that his plants will have light, heat, air, 
water, food; (2) select and test his seed; (3) prepare and 
plant his seed bed; (4) cultivate his crop, and protect it 
against weeds, insects, and diseases; (5) gather seed early, 
perhaps, and later harvest the crop. If he is gardening for 
profit, he will also need to study marketing. 
Proceeding by this simple method of time order, it will be 
equally easy to list the bonds necessary to put through any 
other project. 
As we give our pupil a graphic vocabulary in drawing and 
a musical vocabulary in singing, so we want to give him an 
agricultural vocabulary of farm bonds, the units of farm 
activity. By this means we shall hope to leave him so that 
he will go on growing whether he goes on schooling or not, 
so that he can profit by the farm bureau, farmers’ conven- 
tions, farmers’ bulletins and farm literature. If he casts in 
his lot with the farm, we want also to leave him with high 
agricultural morale, so that he will see the farm as the 
foundation of civilization, and himself as an important 
social servant, holder of a great human trust. As such, 
he will not only try to improve his own homestead, but 
join with his neighbors to create an improved community 
ife. 
Many related responses. — It is hardly a new subject we 
ave to teach, but old ones continued in a way that adds 
ariety and charm. We have taught our pupil to seek out- 
f-door occupations and recreations, and have taken him 
n nature study trips. He has identified fruits, flowers, 
aves, vegetables, has cut out their pictures, drawn and 
colored them. He has observed where plants grow best, 
d perhaps what happens if they lack light, heat, food, 
cultivation. He has learned that toads and most birds 
       
                 
       
   
-P-A-G-E-362
  352 THE CHILD’S MIND 
are friends, and that weeds and many insects are mischief 
makers. He may even have had an eggshell garden right in 
the schoolroom.! 
From old bonds to new. — It is not difficult to introduce 
but one difficulty at a time, for the connections we want to 
form are related largely in the form of similar series. Raising 
a house plant is farming on a small scale, for it requires a 
very similar series of reactions. 
From our eggshell farm, the flowering of bulbs, and 
plants in window boxes, we may pass to the school garden; 
from school garden to home garden; from gardening (espe- 
cially if in the country) to the farm club with its projects 
in poultry, swine, fruit canning, or anything else that is 
related to the farms of the community; and from these to the 
more systematic and extensive study of agriculture with 
book and field work. 
Having fixed first a number of sensori-motor bonds that 
are easiest and most interesting to learn, that occur very 
frequently, and which prepare best for what is to follow, we 
can map out a two--or three-year course in agriculture for 
our upper grades.? One very sensible plan is that of devoting 
one year of the course to plants (simple studies from agron- 
omy and horticulture) and the other to animals. In schools 
where there is pressure for time, these courses are given in 
alternate years. Where pupils are mature, interest high, 
and the work in nature study well under way, a three-year 
course may be attempted, the third year being given to far 
     
   
             
      
   
    1 The younger children like this. Each brings an eggshell, and has his nam 
written on it. A hole is punched in the bottom to let out excess water, th 
shell is filled with soil, and the child then plants some such seeds as lettuce 
radish, cabbage, wheat or buckwheat. The shells are best kept in a pan o 
soil or moist sawdust. See Trafton’s The Teaching of Science, p. 130. 
2 For suggestive courses, see Nolan’s The Teaching of Agriculture, pp. 204

GARDEN-AND-FARM CRAFT 353 
management, roads, the ‘‘country beautiful,” and other 
life-bearing topics. 
Perhaps the very peak and top of the course would con- 
sist in trying out new seeds and plants, in attempting to 
produce improvements and new varieties in plants and 
animals. Children have time for this which their busy 
parents may not have, they are old enough to feel its fascina- 
tion, and they are capable of producing results of mighty 
value. A neighbor of ours, by planting the seeds of potato 
“balls,’’ brought into existence a new variety of potato that 
proved popular in the region for many years. 
Readiness. — Man developed through a hunting and fish- 
ing stage, and there seems to be a hunting and fishing 
instinct. Man also developed an agricultural stage; and 
whoever will watch his feelings from the time when he 
first sees verdure and smells fresh dirt in the spring till 
the crops are fetched in in the fall, will probably agree that 
there is something approaching an agricultural instinct. 
The start is easy. That work of art, the modern seed 
catalog, is enough to inspire enthusiasm. Most girls and the 
younger boys prefer the flower garden, the older boys the 
vegetable garden. The presence of seeds is a challenge to 
plant.1 The presence of weeds, however, is not always a 
sufficient challenge to pull them. Enthusiasm may die 
as the sun gets high. For this reason, it is well to put in 
crops that will mature before school is out, or else arrange 
for summer supervision. Prizes may be offered (perhaps 
1 Seeds are furnished by the Children’s Flower Mission, Cleveland, Ohio, at 
a penny a packet, transportation paid. The teacher may secure blanks from 
the Mission. 
2 Where there are several teachers, one is sometimes employed to remain 
during the summer and look after the gardens. If there is a teacher of agricul- 
ture in the school system, this duty usually falls to him.
-P-A-G-E-364
  354 THE CHILD’S MIND 
donated by interested people), a contest inaugurated, a 
club formed, the farm bureau agent and other speakers or 
demonstrators invited in, literature provided, reports pre- 
sented of what others have done, sample products shown, 
school credit given for certified out-of-school work, exhibits 
prepared for the county fair, visions raised as to financial 
and other returns. 
Where the work is new, you may have to win your com- 
munity first; for farmers often object to having farming 
taught. “I can teach my boy that at home,” is the gruff 
judgment. ‘‘I want the teacher to show him what I can’t,” 
—and that may mean just what is necessary to get the boy 
off the farm and ready to ‘‘make his living with his head”’; 
for many discontented farmers still feel that this is highly 
desirable. 
Our object, of course, is not to keep all boys on the farm, 
but to get and keep all there who naturally love the life 
and so belong there, whether from country or city. As 
with every other vocation, it is a matter of taste and talent 
on the part of the individual, and of need and reward on 
the part of society. The farmer has not been getting the 
reward he deserves. We must all do everything in our | 
power to see that he does get it. 
That the love for country life may grow, we must sing 
farm songs, look at country pictures, magnify country 
joys, and read country literature. 
An old lane, an old gate, 
An old house by a tree, 
A wild wood, a wild brook, 
They will not let me be. 
In boyhood I knew them, 
And still they call to me.
-P-A-G-E-365
  
GARDEN-AND-FARM CRAFT 355 
So many of us do not seem to idealize the country till we 
have left it, nor our companions till death has called them, 
nor our occupations till we are deprived of them. We must 
learn to idealize the everyday real.' 
Exercise. — Garden-and-farm craft, handled by the tan- 
dem or near tandem method, is not difficult either to teach 
or to learn. The trouble is to find teachers who have 
themselves mastered it, and then to give them time and 
materials enough to pass on their learning. 
In addition to the school practice, the chief aids to learn- 
ing are the textbook and other literature, demonstrations 
and experiments, field trips, home work, and club projects. 
Helpful literature can be procured in quantity, and covering 
almost every subject, from the Bureau of Education, the 
Department of Agriculture, and the Federal Board for 
Vocational Education, all of Washington, D.C.; and also 
from your state college or university at which agriculture 
is taught. Demonstrations are not so much to give proof 
(for the children do not usually doubt our word) as to make 
the truth so impressive that it will be remembered and used.? 
Let us not give these merely because they are pretty lessons 
that teachers are supposed to present in order to appear 
professional, but let us do that which aims straight for the 
best of all demonstrations, a good crop. 
Home work and club projects are pretty much of a 
piece. If you have not handled them — or even if you 
have — write to your farm club leader, at the state college 
1 The Division of Farm Life Studies, United States Department of Agri- 
culture, has made a study of country planning and country art, and can furnish 
information on the subject. Landscaping is promoted by the Bureau of 
Plant Industry, of the same Department. 
2 Many suitable demonstrations are found in an excellent little textbook, 
First Principles of Agriculture, by Goff and Mayne.
-P-A-G-E-366
    356 THE CHILD’S MIND 
or the state capital (state department of education), and 
you should receive precise information as to just how to 
proceed. 
The beautiful thing about this subject is that, granted a 
chance to supervise, we can have the pupil practice exactly 
as he will perform. The farm has been called the ‘greatest 
laboratory in the world.”’ But it is more than a laboratory, 
for it takes us away from the pettiness of man to the large- 
ness of nature. 
Effect. — That which rouses readiness ends with effect. 
Our visions are fulfilled or they are not. To end the season 
with a garden grown to grass may mean a much better one 
next year, or it may mean none at all. But he who has eaten 
the fruit of his own labors, even though it cost him the 
sweat of his brow, has had a taste of something that goes 
much deeper than his tongue; and he who sells his product 
bulges his heart at least as much as he does his pocket- 
book. 
We must see to it that our little gardener succeeds. We 
must also help to see to it that the big gardener succeeds, 
that farm success shall mean as much as business success, 
or academic success, or legal success, and lead as directly 
into legislative halls and other centers of influence. 
Tests. — Agriculture is full of tests, for soil, for seed, for 
eggs, for the products of the field, for animals, and what not. 
All of these, together with the fact that the whole under- 
taking lies right out before us in objective concreteness, 
make the measuring of the results of teaching compara- 
tively easy. 
“But academic standing is not the true measure of 
success, either in the teaching or in the study of agriculture. 
That measure is found in the performance of those who 
 
-P-A-G-E-367
  
GARDEN-AND-FARM CRAFT 357 
actually go to the land, live there, and succeed; for after 
all, the fundamental purpose of our great system of agri- 
cultural education is to insure a better agriculture and to 
make a country life as nearly perfect as possible.” ! 
CLASS EXERCISE 
1. Make a rough agricultural survey of the region in which you 
are. From the Bureau of the Census, Department of Commerce, 
Washington, D.C., may be obtained “Statistics” for your state, 
abstracted from the returns of the last census. This contains 
tables of farms and farm property, ‘‘value of all crops and prin- 
cipal classes thereof,” etc., for the state and its counties. (If you 
are in a city, select some rural county for study.) If time and 
purpose permit, a more detailed survey can be made. For a form 
that will help in this, see Nolan’s The Teaching of Agriculture, 
p- 167. It may add to the interest to visit farms. 
Which are the major crops in your county? The minor? 
2. Make a list of the agricultural topics that should be taught 
in the elementary schools of the county. How should they be 
arranged so as. to suit the season of the year? About how much 
time would you give to each? 
3. Discuss at pleasure the equipment and methods most desir- 
able for teaching these topics. 
FOR FURTHER STUDY 
1. Suggest some correlations between gardening and agriculture 
on the one hand and other school subjects on the other. 
2. Why is there no time allotment for this subject in the table 
given at the beginning of Part II of this book? (The data there 
shown was collected from cities.)

teaching of agriculture.! 
4. How would you try to get the support of the homes for your 
school work in agriculture? 
5. Which would you prefer to be, a second Luther Burbank or 
a second Napoleon Bonaparte? Why?

CHAPTER XVIII 
PracticaL HoMEMAKING AND SHop Work 
Exercise. — Consider a rather complex home plant, consisting 
not only of the house and its outfittings, but of barn and garage, 
with fences, garden tools, etc., and with a shop so outfitted that 
lively boys can there work out their numerous mechanical projects. 
1. Make a list (illustrative if not complete) of the things that 
gitls below the high school age can do in such a plant to help with 
the food, clothing, and housekeeping. 
2. Make a list of the things the boys will need to do if they help 
to keep the home plant in repair and also work out such projects 
as the building of wireless apparatus. 
3. What, if anything, should the girls and boys learn in con- 
nection with these things besides the doing of them? 
Here we are with two new and nebulous subjects on our 
hands, and all the mists of the morning about us. Homemak- 
ing and shop work have been passing from society over into 
the school for a long enough time to have found their fixed 
and definite place, yet we are not even agreed as to what 
to call them; and as school branches, like Indian children, 
are commonly named according to the nature they show 
as they mature, it appears that we are not yet clear as to 
what we are trying to teach. It must be a large part of 
our quest in this chapter to find out what our quest is, 
to box the educational compass and find out whither away. 
Situations and responses. -— This subject, like that of 
nature study, has many large situations and many varied 
responses. Substitute for our limitless natural surround-

we see at once there is more that might be taught than any 
learner can possibly learn. 
The general situation may be pictured as in Figure 31. 
Let us devote a topic to each circle of activity that environs 
the school. 
 
-P-A-G-E-372
    362 THE CHILD’S MIND 
Activities of the home plant: homemaking. — There is 
great need for simple courses of study and textbooks that 
begin the study of homemaking with a common-sense 
discussion of where a dwelling house should be located, how 
it should be built, of what materials, with what rooms, and 
for what purposes. Not all, of course, are privileged to 
choose a location and plan their own building; but most of 
us have the opportunity, some time or other, to say where 
we will or will not buy or rent, and what kind of dwelling 
we will consent to abide in as home. Health education 
(sanitation) and beauty craft must here be linked up with 
homemaking. | 
Home furnishing might next be considered. We cannot 
expect harmony or beauty if we bring together, inharmo- 
niously, wall paper, rugs, and pieces of furniture picked up 
here and there, any more than we can pass as well dressed 
if we combine a frock coat with golfing trousers. 
After the home is furnished, we must give a great deal 
of attention to food, clothing, and housekeeping, that great 
body of educational material which has so often shrunk, 
in the average school, to “Cooking and Sewing.” Cook- 
ing should be rather “Studying and Preparing Food.” 
Even in the elementary school, we can teach a few of the 
more important things about food production, sanitation 
(as of milk), food values, marketing, housewifery (cleaning, 
use of refrigerator, canning, utilizing left-overs, etc.), and 
cooking. Marketing, in particular, has been neglected, and 
the childish bride with her ignorant buyings has been the 
prey of business greed and the target for newspaper fun all 
too long. She must know how to provide “balanced ra- 
tions,” how to turn such tricks as the substituting of beans 
and peanut butter for luxury-priced meat, how to gratify  
-P-A-G-E-373
PRACTICAL HOMEMAKING 363 
the feminine love for bargains (if haply it exists as reported) 
by finding (or making) a real bargain every day. 
Clothing can be studied under captions similar to those 
for food, following processes and products all the way from 
the cotton field, or the sheep’s back, or the cocoon of the 
silk larva to the thrusting of the worn-out garment into 
the rag bag—and beyond. Under this plan we would 
take up the topic of clothing production, with a study of 
sample textiles made from cotton, silk, and wool; sanitation, 
perhaps with special reference to sweat skops; clothing 
values, both from the standpoint of health and beauty and 
of durability and economy; marketing, for we have great 
need of a balanced wardrobe as well as balanced rations. 
What should a wardrobe contain, and where and when can 
we buy it (or make it) so as to get a penny’s worth for every 
penny? Housewifery and husbandry, the care of clothing, 
how to clean, press, darn, patch, and make over — there 
is evidence on every hand that these are needed, and there 
is no reason why a seventh grade pupil cannot do all the 
elementary things that are necessary to keep clothing in 
good condition. Sewing should include something of mil- 
linery and of dress designing and pattern study; for a girl 
can often make a hat or gown that will beat those made by 
the milliners; and training in these matters is needed for 
purposes of appreciation and the forming of the buyer’s 
judgment. 
Hand sewing, outside of school, is giving way to the work 
of the machine; for why should we sew with fingers alone 
when we can just as well do it with the aid of the feet, or 
with an electric motor? Much hand sewing, like weaving, 
has a killing monotony about it; and if it is at all fine, it 
requires muscular coérdination more accurate and difficult

  than is needed to run a machine. Coarse hand sewing forms 
a good introduction to needle craft, but as compared with 
machine sewing the hand process should receive, in the 
elementary school, little attention. Yet quite a fraction of 
the schools that teach sewing have failed even to mention 
the machine. In others, machine work is carried on success- 
fully in grades five and those following. 
Home budgets and buying, judgments and ideals.— A 
stream of earnings and income flows into a home, and a 
stream of expenditures flows out. How high the family 
welfare can rise is determined largely by the relative sizes 
of these two streams. The budget bond is certainly one 
that we want to form. To begin with, every upper grade 
pupil should have his own little income and expense account; 
yet strangely enough there is not one of our common 
branches in which such an important matter is likely even 
to be touched upon. ‘‘Get as you can and spend as you 
please” seems almost to be the American motto. Certainly, 
many children grow up by it. But it is a poor motto for a 
home. Probably Cupid would not find his business slowing 
down even if our young people should acquire a fairly clear 
idea as to what constitutes a marriageable income, and of 
what fraction of it is usually laid out for rent, fuel, food, 
clothing, and the other departments of the family budget. 
“Consumer’s judgment” is a phrase that ought to grow 
in circulation and in power. Such judgment, if it is to de- 
velop, must have exercise, and have it in relation to an tdeal: 
What would be most desirable; and what, if we consider 
income, and have regard for all other expenses, can we take

and pay for? We can both develop these ideals and judg- 
ments at school, and encourage parents to practice their 
children in them at home. It has been estimated, by good 
authority, that the average wife is the expender, for food, 
clothing, etc., of three fourths or more of the family in- 
come — and most girls become wives. 
Activities of the home plant: shop work.— Every good 
home should have at least a few tools, and somebody to use 
them. How many and how varied shall be the tools and 
the processes in the home shop depends on the home. Some 
find it to their advantage to do nearly all their own repair- 
ing, even on the family automobile. Some build, not only 
chicken coops and dog houses, but additions to the home. 
How much the school shall teach of all this must depend 
on what the neighborhood needs, and on the equipment and 
talent available. Schools that have extended the work to 
a very wide range have put in woodworking (‘manual train- 
ing”’), painting, shoe repairing, sheet metal work, plumbing, 
printing, forging, machine shop work, electrical work, work 
in clay, cement and concrete, and foundry work, with its 
molding and casting. While the average school must be 
satisfied with much less, yet there come opportunities every- 
where; such as that for painting a door, or soldering a leak, 
or putting in a window pane, which are highly illuminating 
to pupils even when practice in the process is impossible. 
Materials can be studied by the plan suggested for foods 
and clothing, tracing them from the point of production to 
that of final use. Everyone should know such things as the 
qualities of a few of the more common kinds of wood, pine, 
hemlock, oak; the difference between hard coal and soft 
coal; and the properties of the different forms of iron, cast 
iron, malleable cast, and steel. 
 
-P-A-G-E-376
  366 THE CHILD’S MIND 
Industrial and social activities of the local environment. — 
It is said that the boy who has made a coat hanger is likely 
to hang up his coat at home; that the one who has made a 
seed tester is likely to take a new interest in agriculture; 
that making a fly swatter leads to the swatting of flies, 
making a tree protector to the care of trees, and erecting 
a bird house to a new feeling for birds. By such means 
do we pass from school to home, and from home to com- 
munity. 
The visiting and studying of shops and industries is fre- 
quently set down as so much geography. Little matter, 
perhaps, what we call it; but the boy’s tinkering in wood 
should lead him to the carpenter shop and the sawing and 
planing mill— perhaps to the lumber woods. The girls 
should see “‘the latest’ in the house outfitting and furnish- 
ing stores, and study its use. All, if they can, should visit 
the canning factory, find out why canned goods are so 
cheap, see what their advantages and Piotr are, and 
how the commercially canned product compares with what 
we ‘“‘do up” domestically. These are only suggestions; your 
teaching environment will give you many more. f 
World situation and personal vocation. — Getting the pupil 
into touch with home industries and having him try his 
hand at their typical operations so far as possible, helps 
him in two ways: it develops his industrial vocabulary, 
action bonds and word bonds, in terms of which he will 
understand the world’s work; and it indicates to some 
degree whether he has any yearning ability ‘to undertake 
some particular part of that work as his own life job. 
The junior high school, that great finishing school for 
so many working men, is responding to this need by putting 
in more extensive courses in shop work, Hae so chosen
-P-A-G-E-377
  PRACTICAL HOMEMAKING 367 
as to include many of the typical operations performed by 
the industrial worker. The object is not to turn out 
laborers who are skilled and finished in any one line, but 
to give such prevocational samples as will help the young 
worker to understand the world’s industrial work and 
himself in relation to it. All this is reénforced by courses 
in economic and vocational civics, until by and by the 
embryonic citizen has glimpsed, in groups at least, the 
10,000 different occupations of this country, and perhaps 
feels a warming of the heart toward some of them. 
What related responses are ready? — Plenty of related 
responses are ready —so many that in most cases there will 
be no difficulty whatever. This is especially true where the 
children have come up through several grades of construc- 
tion work. It is only a step from whittling out dice or lay- 
ing out a game board to the planning of a larger project in 
wood. Drawing has mapped the way to so much of mechan- 
ical drawing as is necessary, and arithmetic by this time has 
furnished the figures. Nature study, elementary science, 
life craft, and geography have all brought forward the prob- 
lems of eating, clothing, and dwelling, have familiarized the 
pupil somewhat with foods and materials, and have pointed 
the guide figner of learning out toward the world-wide view 
of humanity, its homemaking and its industrial doings. 
Relation of the desired bonds. — On the whole, we may 
say that the desired words are related rather loosely. True, 
we can find connections in series such that a must come be- 
fore b, as the making of a joint must precede the construc- 
tion of a piece of furniture. Some trunk lines appear; such 
as measuring in cooking (or in anything else), the effect of 
materials on each other, and of heat on all. In the more 
complex work are inclusive units to be mastered, as when  
-P-A-G-E-378
  the homemaker must think in terms of a meal at a stroke; 
but the unity is seldom an inviolable and rigid aly mechanical 
adjustment of elements. It is adaptable, and can be suited 
to circumstances. 
Which bonds first? — We shall begin, of course, with 
sensori-motor connections, and build out from them, ask- 
ing how primitive men and early settlers must have carried 
on their homemaking and industrial work, how it is done 
now in various parts of the world, and perhaps how future 
man seems likely to improve on all this. But there is no 
good reason for beginning with the primitive form of any 
kind of work unless it furnishes bonds which are easy and 
interesting to learn, which occur frequently, and which 
prepare best for what is to follow. Probably there never 
was a farm boy who felt as much interest in pulling up 
grain or grass, or in using a sickle, as he did in his father’s 
mower or reaper; or as much interest in scratching the 
ground with a stick or a shell as he did in a sulky plow, or 
even a walking plow. What girl ever cared to spend her 
time cooking soup by dropping hot stones into it? Such 
a process certainly will not occur often in future learning, 
nor does it give any superior preparation for what is to 
come. The child-as-primitive-man idea has been entirely 
overworked. Both the child and the primitive make for 
crude, simple responses to their environment; but that is 
no reason why they should be the same nerponises unless 
the principles of learning so dictate. 
So far as practical projects are concerned, no course of 
study has won common assent; but each school system 
does that which seems good in its own eyes. Sewing, 
cooking, and manual training are introduced in almost 
any grade from the fourth up, and the exercises appear in 368 THE CHILD’S MIND
-P-A-G-E-379
       PRACTICAL HOMEMAKING 369 
almost any order. In sewing, for example, dresses, kimonos, 
nightgowns, buttonholes, crocheting, darning, aprons, 
ironholders, patching, etc., are introduced anywhere from 
the first to the fourth year of work. Sometimes the making 
of the same article is repeated for three years. 
The study of clothing has commonly preceded that of 
cooking, but for no good reason that anyone can discover. 
Simple cooking is the easier to learn, and the “effect” is 
better, as successful cooking brings an appealing result 
almost immediately. Foods simple in composition and 
easy to prepare should come first, and are best studied when 
they are in season, or perhaps when the pupil’s interest 
runs high for some other reason. In the study of clothing, 
it is desirable that experience with textiles shall precede 
the study of patterns and dress designing, just as in shop 
work it is to be hoped that we can interest children to some 
extent in materials before they attempt to decide, in any 
large way, how these materials shall be used, worked, and 
joined. 
The practical plan on which our schools will settle is 
probably that of passing from the construction work and 
life craft of the early grades to the forming of easy, interest- 
ing, and almost miscellaneous bonds in homemaking and 
shop work (or ‘‘manual training’’) in grades five and six, 
often of such a nature as to illustrate other branches. In 
grade seven will begin a two year study, or in junior high 
schools a three year study of these subjects, as serious and 
systematic as the development of the pupils will permit. 
Readiness. —In psychology, we sometimes speak of a 
constructive instinct. Apparently there is. such an instinct; 
but unfortunately for us teachers, it does not always lead 
pupils to construct that which we suggest and when we  
-P-A-G-E-380
          
                                         
   
              THE CHILD’S MIND 
  370 
suggest it. The result is that for years teachers of these 
subjects have been organizing their work more and more 
about the children’s interests as a center. Schools that 
have attempted to make woodwork pay by having the boys 
make drawing models, nature study apparatus, and so on, 
have found themselves drifting — or progressing —in the 
direction of kites, windmills, bows and arrows, and ball bats. 
This solves the problem by removing the problem — a great 
triumph for education. Luckily, these branches are so 
broad and so flexibly organized that they permit us to 
follow the interests of the pupils without wrecking the 
subjects. . 
If in addition to this superlative demand for a suitable 
task we check up the other conditions of readiness, with 
which we are now so familiar, especially seeing to it that 
the teacher can do with confidence and skill what is required 
of the pupil, we shall probably find our children as often 
overready as not ready enough. 
Exercise. — Readiness expresses itself in the desire to 
“make something.” Sometimes the pupil becomes enamored 
of some object, such as an airship, that is beyond his powers 
of construction. In such a case, we can show him how to 
make his beloved ship in a very simplified form; or lead off 
in it ourselves and let him assist; or get his attention on 
something else, perhaps showing him that a boomerang is 
a kind of detached propeller and getting him to try that; 
or if the worst must happen, let him try his ship and get 
disgusted with his failure. 
But in general the teacher proposes and the child chooses. 
Perhaps she will propose a bird house, a bookrack, a kite, 
a swing, a coat hanger, a flowerpot stand, a milking stool, 
a sleeve board, a water wheel, a windmill, a window box.
-P-A-G-E-381
  PRACTICAL HOMEMAKING 371 
If books of exercises are at hand, these are sometimes 
handed out and the pupils encouraged to select whatever 
they think they would like to try. Quite often, some 
play interest is uppermost, and toys or play apparatus 
such as a seesaw will be made, perhaps for the school 
playground; or there is a home interest to be satisfied, 
and something is selected to surprise and please the home 
folks. But the school is a social home, and children are 
often almost romantically altruistic in their desire to serve 
it. They will repair its breaks, oil its floors, gild its radi- 
ators, make window boxes and bookcases for it, and pre- 
pare its lunches, or sandwiches to serve or sell at social 
affairs, with right good will. 
Combining project and drill. — The logically ideal way to 
teach these subjects, and the method which the early 
teachers of them tried to establish, is to select the simplest 
bonds, such as the making of easy stitches in sewing and 
of easy operations in woodwork, drill these in thoroughly, 
and proceed to the next step, a trifle more difficult, until 
at length the hardest and most complex operations have 
been mastered. Then, but in general not till then, would 
the pupil be permitted to make the things that thrilled 
him with enthusiasm. 
We now realize that the enthusiasm must come first, and 
is even more important than extremely careful grading. 
This is what is meant by saying that a plan of teaching 
must be psychological, appealing to the pupil, even if it is 
not strictly logical. ‘You can see that it is the old problem 
of the music teacher right over. Shall the pupil sing and 
play scales, or tunes? The answer is, Both. Combine the 
two by providing tunelike exercises, each of which presents 
but one new difficulty, and master that difficulty as a part
-P-A-G-E-382
| pis

372 THE CHILD’S MIND | 
| 
of the tune. In the same way, in our homemaking ana 
shop work, we are ‘‘doing things” all the time; but the 
teacher uses her ingenuity to steer the pupil into things 
which hold but one new difficulty, be it a new stitch, or the 
use of an oil stove, or the holding of a plane. The pupil 
is then made to see that if he wants to put through his 
project, he must do a little drilling. “If you want to make 
a window shelf, you must first learn to saw off a board, and 
saw to the line.” “If you want to make buttonholes, you 
must first practice the buttonhole stitch until you can do 
it well.” Accordingly, we first spend a little time drilling 
in the new process, delightful in itself, perhaps, but at any 
rate carried through by zeal for what is to follow. 
The tandem method and the prevention of errors. — Many 
a boy has learned a great deal about the sawing movement 
by taking one handle of a big crosseut saw with his father 
managing the other. It would be a piece of pedagogical 
good fortune if we could have tandem tools of many sorts. 
But the teaching of “‘the practical arts,” as they are some- 
times called; is comparatively easy so far as the actual 
operations are concerned, for guidance can always be 
external or imitative. If the boy pushes his plane straight 
against the wood instead of giving it a draw cut, or if 
the girl pushes her sewing machine treadle with a jerk, the 
teacher can give a demonstration, and if necessary guide 
the process. 
Since in all these branches there should be as much work 
as possible done at home, care must be taken to see that the 
pupil does not lose, by careless practice alone, what he gains 
from the teacher’s tuition. But “the proof of the pudding 
is in the eating”; in most cases, the product itself is a 
pretty good proof of the process. | 
 
-P-A-G-E-383
  PRACTICAL HOMEMAKING 373 
Practice and final performance. — The ideal place for a 
homemaking department is in a dwelling house, with all 
the rooms and equipment of a home. The centralized 
rural school may be able to use its teacherage and its shop 
equipment to good advantage. But tools and processes 
do not change much as one transfers them from place to 
place. Even the one-room rural school can afford a few 
dollars’ worth of shop tools and cooking utensils, make its 
own work bench, and cook its own lunches, perhaps pre- 
pared in part from its own school garden. Sometimes a 
neighboring home will open its door — at least its oven 
door. Sewing machine companies or dealers sometimes 
furnish, at little or no cost, for the sake of the advertising, 
one or more machines to help start the work. 
As the school garden leads to the home garden, so should 
school domestic art become thoroughly domesticated by 
making its way into the home. Shop work should pass to 
the home shop. If there is none, let us encourage the boy 
to develop his own little kit of tools. It is fortunate if 
the major part of the practice work can at all times be 
carried on in the home, or in a club outside of school, re- 
serving the limited school hours for the gaining of informa- 
tion, solving problems, and developing an appreciation 
of homemaking and industrial work the world over. 
Finally, the teacher ought not to feel, as teachers some- 
times do, that the work is a failure if it is not of a kind that 
is popular at the time. If a girl can be taught to toast 
bread or a boy to mend his shoes, there is the true spirit 
of the real economic worker. Where time is short, perhaps 
only one year of work can be given at a time; and there is 
no reason why boys should not learn cooking — camp cook- 
ing at least — and enough sewing to fasten buttons where
-P-A-G-E-384
  374 THE CHILD’S MIND 
they belong, or why girls should not do a little shop work. 
For what is a kitchen but a cook shop? 
Effect. — Work of this kind is not merely lodged in the 
pupil’s brain and hand as so much skill, but can be placed 
on exhibition and carried home and elsewhere to attract 
attention and speak for itself. The eating of the well- 
prepared dish, the wearing of the garment, the use of the 
shop product in play or work — these make this kind of 
learning, like virtue, its own reward. Our main concern 
is to see that a proper project is undertaken, and that it is 
carried to successful conclusion. 
Testing essential bonds. — Our examinations in home- 
making and shopwork can be eminently practical, consist- 
ing of a sample piece, a typical product, with as much on 
paper as is necessary to bring out information, thought, and 
appreciation. 
Samples saved from the work of various classes can be 
formed into a rough scale that is nevertheless very helpful, 
and for the nicer measurement of the material product 
standardized scales are appearing.! The citizen efficiency 
that flows from these branches, sympathy for the laboring 
man, justice to the capitalist of the large-minded kind, an 
appreciation of our homemakers and of laws necessary for 
their protection and support — these will always be most 
valuable and most difficult to measure.   
1 The measurement of hand sewing, in particular, has been made the object 
of an extensive investigation, reported in Dr. Katharine Murdoch’s The 
Measurement of Certain Elements of Hand Sewing, published by Columbia Uni- 
versity. See also Chapters VII and VIII of Home Economics in American 
Schools (University of Chicago), and the pictured scale for measuring machine 
sewing, found in its latter pages.

CLASS EXERCISES 
1. Let groups or individuals visit the various departments 
of homemaking and of shop work in elementary, junicr high, or 
high schools that may be within reach, and report on them as to 
courses, equipment, aims, etc. Discussion should follow as to 
what suggestions from this report can be adopted by teachers of 
elementary grades, especially grades seven and eight. 
2. Assume that the class has been asked to serve as a commit- 
tee, and make recommendations to a school board as to what in- 
dustrial work it shall put into a junior high school. The object is 
to include such materials and processes as are common to a num- 
ber of important industries, so as to give as much industrial in- 
sight as possible and also form such brain-hand bonds as will 
enable pupils most quickly to become proficient in any of the more 
common industrial occupations. 
Perhaps it will be well to proceed by making a list of materials 
and one of processes, deciding then what work will at once include 
most that is typical and also make the strongest appeal to the 
pupils. 
FOR FURTHER STUDY 
1. Do you think it would be advisable to include in home- 
making at least a little work in nursing? Why or why not? If 
so, how can it be managed? 
2. Should we have industrial readers, as we have geographical 
readers? What good or harm might they do? 
3. Show how the practical arts discussed in this chapter can 
be correlated with the other elementary branches. 
4. Which is more important to give to children, training for 
skill in the processes of home and shop, but nothing more, or a 
large and thoughtful appreciation of the place of home building 
and industry in the world’s work, but without the skill? Why? 
5. What is the object of a Consumers’ League? What should 
you think of organizing a school into a consumers’ league, for a 
time at least, and studying consumer’s facts?

6. Comment on your own education in ies or han-

7. Should the elementary school teach any fancy sewing? 
The high school? Why or why not? 
8. Tell, in a general way, how you think the work of the high 
school, in the practical arts, should differ from that of the ele- 
mentary or junior high school. 
9. How is it that most industries (away from the home plant) 
have become specialized while so much unnecessary housework is 
still done in many homes? Do you think cooking will ever be 
done in a public cookery and the meals sent in to the family as 
laundering is now done in a public laundry and the clothes sent in? 
Could not large dwelling establishments, perhaps covering a city 
block or two, provide for a plan of this sort, leaving the housewife 
free for other duties? 
10. The typical girl marries and becomes the mistress of a 
home. Is that a sufficient reason for teaching homemaking to all 
girls? Give reasons. 
11. Should married women be employed on the same basis as 
single ones? What has this to do with the teaching of home- 
making? And what has motherhood to do with both? 
12. In the text, the junior high school is spoken of as “a finish- 
ing school for working men,” and a little later the statement is 
made that its object is “not to turn out laborers who are skilled 
and finished.” How reconcile these statements? If a boy while 
in the junior high school finds his vocation, what training ought 
he to have beyond that?

Exercises. —1. The practical use of the slide rule or of a 
table of logarithms in computation is rather simple; but the 
derivation, the theory, the full mathematical explanation of 
either of them is quite complex. If you were to study either, 
should you prefer to begin by testing out a few multiplications, 
roots, ete., to convince yourself that it does work, and then use 
it, leaving the full understanding of its intricacies to develop 
with more mature mathematical growth; or first understand its 
rationale, reason out its principles and commit its tules, following 
this with practice in solving problems? Why? 
Which method would work better with a class, especially a 
class that is somewhat immature, some of whose members find 
even simple mathematics difficult? 
2. A boy who played a great deal of baseball, and who was just: 
picking up the use of the slide rule, spent several hours computing 
with it the percentage standings of different teams as game after 
game was played. How do you think he would have responded 
to a demand to reckon on the intricacies of interplanetary dis- 
tances or of foreign exchange, in neither of which he felt any 
interest? 
List a few kinds of mathematical problems that you care to 
solve. What should guide us in selecting problems for pupils?

Arithmetic and intelligence. — Among the members of a 
certain tribe in West Africa, to say to anyone, ‘‘ You don’t 
know nine times nine” is equivalent to saying, in an 
378 
 
-P-A-G-E-389
  ARITHMETIC 379 
insulting way, ‘‘You are a dunce.”’ In a Siamese law 
court, if a witness cannot count or reckon with figures up to 
ten, he is not allowed to testify. 
Among us, too, arithmetic has been regarded in many 
quarters as a kind of test of intelligence, and the study of 
it was thought to be one of the surest means of developing 
mental power. There is some basis for this belief. But 
“intelligence” and ‘‘mental power” are rather vague 
terms. There are different kinds of intelligence, which 
we may clasify according to the subject matter they deal 
with, as intelligence in mechanics, in art, in social affairs, 
etc. In other words, there are different sets of fibers, in 
various portions of the brain, which respond, each to its 
different kind of subject matter, with varying degrees of 
success. We are not surprised if we find the mathema- 
tician rather “slow” when it comes to managing political 
parties, or even dinner parties. 
Accordingly, one of the first things to find out about 
arithmetic is whether it develops a kind of intelligence that 
is used a great deal in the everyday life of the people; and 
one of the best ways to get light on this matter is to inquire 
what problems the average person is solving from day to 
day as he goes about his business. 
Situation and response: the social use of arithmetic. — 
Investigation has yielded quite an extensive answer to this 
question. Wilson * found that 83 per cent of all daily-life 
problems involved money. The great bulk of these were 
concerned with buying and selling. Outside of buying and

These six included a little over 90 per cent of all the processes. 
The process that stood next in importance was percentage, 
but this appeared in less than 2 per cent of the problems, 
and no other process involved as many as 1 per cent of them. 
In addition, there were usually not more than three or 
four numbers to be added; and in both the addition and 
subtraction problems most of the numbers consisted of 
but two or three figures. Most multipliers were of but one 
place, and none reached-five places. In division, most of 
the divisors were of two places, and but one reached five 
places. Fractions appeared frequently, but there was 
seldom a problem that contained more than a single frac- 
tion, and that was usually small. The fraction + made 
up almost 663 per cent of all. Ten simple fractions con- 
stituted more than 95 per cent of the total. These, stated 
in the order of their frequency, were 3, ?, 4, 4, $, &, % $4, 4. 
Yet we must not conclude in a hurry that children should 
be taught only the wee bits of arithmetic. On the principle 
of “six-foot training for a five-foot jump,” the principle by 
which we insist that teachers of arithmetic should have 
studied algebra, the principle by which we know that our 
future occasional and unpracticed performance in every 
direction will surely fall short of our present highly cul- 
tured best, we must teach beyond the margin of the nig- 
gardly need of the day. And this is especially true of a
-P-A-G-E-391
  ARITHMETIC 381 
subject like arithmetic, in which growth is likely to stop 
with schooldays; in which, after teacher and pupil have 
parted, there is no newspaper to keep up a kind of cor- 
respondence course in it, as there is, for example, in history 
and geography. 
Then there is the matter of mathematical-social reform. 
We may or may not want the metric system, or the octaval 
system,! or some other system; but if we ever do decide 
on something superior, we shall need to create sentiment 
for it by teaching it — to the brighter pupils, at least — 
just as we create sentiment against alcoholic drinks by 
teaching our children about them. 
Stimuli and reactions. — In general, the stimulus is any 
problem of moderate difficulty, and the response consists 
in performing the right operation with numbers and getting 
the answer. 
To perform this right operation in mathematical problems 
that appear in daily life, the following bonds seem to be 
required: 
1. Bonds for counting, and for the number symbols, 
both words and figures, including enough of the Roman 
notation for the reading of the clock face and the chapter 
numbers of books. 
2. Bonds for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and 
dividing (a) whole numbers of three or four places, (b) simple 
common fractions with denominators with at least two 
places, (c) decimals to two or three places, and (d) the more 
common denominate numbers involving at least two kinds 
of unit, as feet and inches. 
1 For an account of Octic Arithmetic, address E. M. Tingley, Raymond Ter- 
race, Elizabeth, New Jersey. Theoretically, it appears to have advantages 
over the metric system.
-P-A-G-E-392
    382 THE CHILD’S MIND | 
| 
3. Bonds for the simpler cases of that special form of 
(common and decimal) fractions known as percentage. 
4. Bonds for the application of the above to suitable 
problems: that is, bonds for ‘thinking,’ ‘analysis,’ 
“veasoning.”’ | 
Bonds to avoid. — Although simple statements of the bare 
necessities in arithmetic, such as the preceding, have for 
years been placed before the teaching public, many who 
have been fed or surfeited with a more inclusive diet will 
still think the above too meagre. Accordingly, let us list 
a number of the bonds with which the modern teacher of 
the subject deliberately refuses to waste time or retard the 
development of her pupils. Such are the connections in- 
volved in certain operations, such as those in square root 
and cube root, most of ratio and proportion, greatest com- 
mon divisor and lowest common multiple — except as they 
can be determined by inspection — complex and compound 
fractions, and difficult reductions of denominate numbers. 
Commonly omitted also are tables, measures, and problems 
which are either obsolete or of narrowly limited use, as in 
troy weight, apothecaries’ weight, partial payments, partner- 
ship, exchange, annual and compound interest, longitude 
and time, and those selections from solid geometry which 
have gone under the name of mensuration. Further, all 
through every topic that is taught, the teacher must take 
pains to avoid forming bonds for the rare and unimportant, as 
in the use of long and confusing problems, or problems based 
on situations untrue to real life and uninteresting to chil- 
dren, words unfamiliar to the pupil and unnecessary to the 
subject, numerical expressions seldom used (as fractions 
with such denominators as 11, 13, and 17), or finicky dis- 
tinctions that contribute nothing toward the getting of
-P-A-G-E-393
  ARITHMETIC 383 
results, like the refined discrimination (for young children) 
between a number and a figure, or the discrimination by 
anybody, young or old, between concrete and abstract 
numbers before permitting himself to perform operations 
* with them.! 
What related responses can children make? —In the 
lower animal mind there seems to be almost no idea of 
number. Country people, even Yankees, used to believe 
that a hen can count three, and so they left three nest eggs 
in the nest. But the hen’s number requirements appear 
to be satisfied by one egg, and a china one at that — or 
even by no egg if other conditions are favorable. Some 
of these lower animals sense the outside world much as 
we do; but number does not exist in the outside world. 
Matter, quantity, is there; but number is no more attached 
to it, before the mind of man comes into contact with it, 
than a child’s name is born with him. It is the mind of 
man that names the child, and that numbers the parts 
of the material universe. 
Accordingly, we can easily understand why the inborn 
power to use and understand numbers is not an instinct, 
but an ability. Arithmetical operations are not a sensori- 
motor activity which we enjoy, to any considerable extent, 
in common with the brute creation, but a high-level per- 
formance so different from anything they know that whither 
1See E. L. Thorndike’s The Psychology of Arithmetic, Chapter 1V. Herein is 
quoted a problem from E. C. McDougle, which states that the number of 
ladies and gentlemen in the class equals the number of cabbage heads in a cer- 
tain garden, and asks “chow many cabbage heads in the garden.’”’ The black- 
board solution, as given by normal school students, always takes this form: 
29 ladies 
15 gentlemen 
44 cabbage heads

we go they cannot come. The absence of arithmetical 
ability in a young child ought not to surprise us so much as 
its presence does. And the safer error to perpetrate, al- 
ways, is to introduce arithmetic, and the various topics of 
it, needlessly late rather than needlessly early. No child 
can thoroughly understand our number system any more 
than he can our railway system. Teaching him to use 
numbers is much like teaching him to start and stop a 
trolley car; he may soon learn the trick, but he will not 
know why it works. Nor need he know, for his purposes; 
it is number craft he wants. 
What a bright child, when he comes to kichool, can do 
with number, depends largely, of course, on his pre-school 
environment. Most children hear the number names ap- 
plied frequently to collections of things and to houses, 
streets, and so on; hear and perhaps repeat number rhymes, 
such as 384 THE CHILD’S MIND 
One, two, 
Buckle my shoe; 
“count,” at least in the sense of repeating in order the 
first few number names as in games; are interested in their 
age, the ages of others, birth dates, dates of holidays, and 
the like; see watches and clocks and have some idea of 
time; notice distances or spaces, and one or two space- 
measuring units, such as the yardstick; come into contact 
with pounds, quarts, and so on; handle and know the 
value of the minor coins; and may even approach the 
meaning of a few fractions. | 
At what must have been a pre-school age, I counted the 
fingers on my father’s hand and on my own and received 
a shock of surprise which I have never forgotten when I 
found that his big hand had no more fingers on it than my
-P-A-G-E-395
  ARITHMETIC 385 
little one. Also, my mother used to ‘quarter’ a great 
many apples and give me some of the quarters. I was 
again surprised to find that such a quarter was included 
among the fourths, or quarters, which the teacher and the 
arithmetic book tried to explain to me. 
According to the Binet tests, about three-fourths of the 
six-year-old children can count thirteen pennies, and know 
by name the penny, nickel, quarter, and dime. At a still 
earlier age, they can tell which is the longer of two lines 
whose lengths are 1% inches and 22 inches and which is the 
heavier of two weights of 3 grams and 15 grams, can 
pick out from a number of geometrical forms one that is 
like a sample shown them, copy a square, put together two 
right triangles of the same size and shape so as to form 
an oblong, and give their age. 
One difficulty at a time. — The system of paths which we 
must form in a pupil’s brain and which represents his knowl- 
edge of arithmetic when we have finished with him, is 
probably knit together with greater regularity and thorough- 
ness, with more cross connections from each point to other 
points, than is the case in any other of the common branches. 
This is at once both dangerous and glorious for the teach- 
ing of the subject. Dangerous because the unskilled teacher 
will have her pupil rambling here and there through the 
maze, meeting a dozen difficulties at once, getting nowhere 
and ending in confusion, like a stranger lost in a subway 
system; glorious because the teacher who has clear pre- 
vision of the subject as a whole can soon make her pupil 
acquainted with trunk lines and express methods, and can 
grade the whole course with such gentle progression as to 
make its mastery a delight. 
Let us lay down two general cautions: (1) Use no un-
-P-A-G-E-396
  386 THE CHILD’S MIND 
necessary terms, either literary or arithmetical, and see 
that those which are used are thoroughly understood. 
“Arithmetic is the science of numbers and the art of com- 
putation’’ — such was the statement, in black-faced type, 
that met my eyes when I opened my first book in arith- 
metic. If you ask children, in a room where there are 
chairs, to tell you what a chair is, they will probably say, 
“That is one.” We must give them that kind of defini- 
tion: ‘‘} is a fraction, ? is a fraction, 4 is a fraction,” etc. 
So simple a term as ‘‘equals’”’ may be harder for a child to 
master than would be, for us, such expressions as ‘‘feed-back 
circuit,” or ‘commutator,’ or “grid leak.’ Also, we 
must shun problems the language or situations of which 
are strange. A pupil who is asked to figure on rutabagas 
or the harvesting of alfalfa may be nonplussed, not because 
he doesn’t know the arithmetic, but because the botany 
and agriculture are too much for him. Much more bungling 
and halting than we have suspected have come from the 
fact that pupils do not get the meaning of the problems 
placed before them. And here is another reason for not 
introducing arithmetic, at least book arithmetic, until the 
difficulties of primary reading are well out of the way. 
(2) In introducing any new topic, choose such numbers 
and processes as will be very easy, familiar, and clear, 
leaving the one new point outstanding as the only one 
demanding attention. If we are teaching the telling of 
time, and the Arabic figures are more familiar to our class 
than the Roman letters, let us use an Arabic-figured clock 
face. We can further simplify matters by putting only 
the hour hand on the clock at first, practicing with this, 
and later adding the minute hand. In teaching new 
processes, from addition right on up, we will begin with
-P-A-G-E-397
  ARITHMETIC 387 
such small and simple numbers that our pupils’ attention 
can be fixed wholly on the new operation; yet in teaching 
division of fractions we shall hardly choose 4 as one of the 
first divisors, for when inverted it will probably look and 
feel, to some of our pupils, more like a whole number than 
a fraction. In many other cases — in fact in all cases — 
it is wise to think out our illustrative numbers and procedures 
quite carefully in advance. 
Relation of the desired bonds. — We may almost say that 
there is no such thing as an isolated fact in arithmetic. 
Every number bond stands related to every other, and 
related in many ways. All we can do is to form those 
bonds that are most important for practical use. 
Bonds in series are found in the fundamental process of 
counting, with which the race began its arithmetic, and 
with which children are happy to begin. When we count 
by 2’s, 3’s, 5’s, 10’s, or n’s we simply take every 2d, 3d, 
5th, 10th, or nth member of the original counting series 
and form them into a new series. All our tables, our frac- 
tions, our decimals — everything in arithmetic — can be 
placed in serial order. But it does not follow that all must 
be learned in serial order; probably the individual numbers 
should be, just as we count them off; and probably all 
tables should not be. 
The great trunk line bond in our number system is that 
for handling numbers by tens. The successive groups of 
ten are like the successive octaves in music: each number 
and each note repeats the corresponding one in the range 
1 We could, of course, begin by teaching a child five before we teach him one, 
and some have suggested such a procedure. We could explain that five means 
“as many as you have fingers on your hand,” have him bring us five objects, 
show him how to write the figure and the word five, and so on.
-P-A-G-E-398
  388 THE CHILD’S MIND 
below it, but with something added. This not only makes 
it easy for the pupil to count by tens, but helps him also 
in addition and subtraction. The teacher should point 
out and arrange a series of problems to emphasize the 
fact that adding 8 and 6 (for example) is much like adding 
18 and 6, 28 and 6, 38 and 6, and so on. A similar process 
should be used with subtraction. 
Another trunk line bond, one that runs through all 
mathematics and which should be used in arithmetic as 
early and as widely as possible, is that of the equation. If 
we explain that the sign ‘‘=’’ means the same as “‘is,” 
“are,” “makes,” or other similar word, even first grade 
children can be trained into its use, and no matter how old 
they get in mathematics they will never depart from it. 
To translate a problem from literary language into the 
language of the equation is the first and fundamental step 
in solving it; and the * or the ? or the x that we have to 
leave on one side or the other of our equation shows us 
better than words the nature of the answer and how it is 
related to the other, the given numbers. | 
Other trunk line bonds that should be kept before the 
pupil’s attention as he takes up topic after topic are those 
of the fundamental processes, addition, subtraction, multi- 
plication, and division. Strange as it may seem to the 
mature mathematician, many children, as they progress 
through the course, fail to see that they are constantly 
performing these old operations, first on whole numbers, 
then on fractions, decimals, and denominate numbers; 
and many a pupil spends months on algebra before he 
discovers that he is doing over again with letters what he 
did in arithmetic with figures. 
All our generalizations and practical ne of procedure
-P-A-G-E-399
  ARITHMETIC 389 
(when stated in lively, familiar English) should also be 
fixed as trunk line bonds. ‘‘ Always turn the divisor upside 
down and multiply,” and ‘‘ Any number times zero is zero,” 
are examples. We have our slogans, war cries, mottoes 
and “yells” in mathematics as elsewhere. The good 
teacher distinguishes herself by discovering which are the 
trunk line bonds and then inventing a ‘“‘catchy”’ phrase to 
make them stick. y 
Inclusive units are found in the very nature of number. 
It is the fundamental feature of our decimal system, or tens 
system (decimal is from decem, ten), that it groups units 
into bunches of ten, bunches of ten into a larger collection 
of 10 xX 10, ete. Practice favors the forming of inclusive 
units in all operations: adding leads us to see 7 and 3 as 10, 
and to hold in mind what we must carry as we pass to the 
next line of figures; subtracting and multiplying and divid- 
ing all require that we keep a partial result in mind as we 
go on manipulating our figures; and so on. We must analyze 
our own quick performances rather minutely to discover 
these difficulties, and put the pupil through each process, at 
first, slowly and deliberately. 
From sensori-motor to high level. — It is said that all 
learning should start from life—that is, the concrete— and 
come back to life with its applications. All our arithmetic 
should start with sensori-motor bonds, pass into a high- 
level, abstract performance, and return to the concrete, the 
sensori-motor, for verification and application. It is the 
sensori-motor bonds that put the “under” in understanding. 
However, it must not be thought that the intermediate, 
abstract stage of progress is dead, or disagreeable to children. 
They prefer working with abstract numbers rather than con- 
crete; but this may be due in part to the very concrete non-  
-P-A-G-E-400
    390 THE CHILD’S MIND 
sense they are often required to go through in the way of 
labeling and ticketing each number, in solving a problem, 
as so many days, dollars, pounds, mules, or pineapples. 
The materials we use for our concrete work ought to be, 
if possible, such as children would naturally care to count, 
add, subtract, and so on. One great supply of such material 
is commonly neglected, namely, the children themselves. 
They can come out on the floor and count, add, subtract, 
multiply, and divide their own groups— in short, dramatize 
each process as they approach it. But we should not confine 
ourselves to any one kind of material; just as we must make 
it clear that a number is not a name for any one object, but 
that ‘‘three,” like a pronoun, is passed around from one to 
another in a group as we count in different orders, so we 
must make it clear that neither number as a whole nor any 
particular operation is always to be associated with any one 
kind of concrete material, but that we can number steps, 
inches, claps of the hand, cupfuls, and minutes as well as 
persons, pennies, crayons and pencils. | 
If denominate numbers had always been called concrete 
numbers, perhaps we should have made a more concrete 
use of them as an introduction to our Ce tables. 
Thorndike rightly calls our attention to the advantages of 
practicing with quarts and pints when learning the table of 
2’s; on yards and feet with the 3’s; on gallons and quarts 
with the 4’s; nickels and cents with the 5’s; weeks and days 
with the 7’s; pecks and quarts with the 8’s; and square 
yards and square feet with the 9’s.1 | 
Steps toward the abstract.— In the very beginnings of 
number work, it may be advisable to pass by rather gently 
graded steps from material object to immaterial number. 
1E. L. Thorndike — The Psychology of Arithmetic, p. 142.
-P-A-G-E-401
  ARITHMETIC 301 
Beginning with ‘‘sure enough” pennies and putting two and 
three together to make five, we may then pass to pictures 
of pennies, drawing on the board two circles and three circles 
followed by a group of five circles, later use merely a mark 
to represent a penny, after that the written words, and 
finally the figures. The children should be made to realize 
that these are all different ways of saying the same thing. 
The final passage to the abstract may be made somewhat 
as follows: ‘‘How many are three apples and two apples?” 
“Three boys and two boys?” “Three hours and two hours?” 
“Three anythings and two anythings?” “Three and two?” 
The abstract answer will usually be forthcoming. 
But it is easy to use objects so long that their use becomes 
a positive hindrance and a great waste of time. The teacher 
can discover, by watching the class carefully, when it is 
safe to give them up. Nor need we always resort to objects 
in order to make a process concrete in the sense of feeling 
real, reliable, and familiar to the pupils. We can build on the 
highest bonds that are well fixed. For example, we can base 
multiplication on addition, putting down three 4’s and add- 
ing them to show the meaning of 3 X 4. Ina similar way, 
the more abstract operations of algebra are made real by 
reference to the more familiar processes of arithmetic. But 
of course we can always resort to objects when they are 
needed — and that will often be at the end of a process, to 
verify it, as well as at the beginning to introduce it. 
Sensori-motor beginnings in advanced topics. — We must 
not think of the concrete in arithmetic as confined to the 
use of peanuts, marbles, and toothpicks when a child begins 
to count, add, and subtract. On the contrary, let us recall 
that a sensori-motor beginning is one of the trunk line 
bonds in all teaching. In studying trade discount, we can

Which bonds first? — 
The counting bond is the 
most easy and interesting 
for the learner, occurs most 
frequently, and prepares 
the way for most other 
bonds to be. It was the 
practical interest in “how 
many” that led the race 
into arithmetic through 
counting; and looking at 
the matter from this prac- 
tical standpoint, all our 
arithmetical processes — 
adding, subtracting, and 
so on—are just so many

-P-A-G-E-403
  ARITHMETIC 393 
a terrible task this reckoning by counting must have been 
before modern invention produced our faster and easier ways. 
Counting leads to addition; for to add is simply to remem- 
ber what you get when you count so many and then so many 
more, as three and then two more. Having demonstrated 
with objects, it might help to draw on the board a line 
(like that below) the divisions and large figures of which 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 
represent the ordinary counting series, and to show that if 
we count three and then start in from there and count two 
more, we land at five — and the same with all other addi- 
tions. Subtraction of course works in just the opposite way, 
and multiplication is a quick way of adding, and division a 
quick way of subtracting. In teaching, however, it is prob- 
ably better to associate division closely with its opposite, 
multiplication. 
Boundaries between topics. — It is probably best to regard 
arithmetic as one whole subject, an orderly system of bonds 
whose purpose is to count, to bunch the units into groups 
of tens, hundreds, etc., and then to handle them in such a 
way as to get results quickly and easily. We certainly 
should not try to teach all of counting or of addition before 
taking up anything else, but should at all times and at every 
point form any bond next that seems to fit in next, and which 
promises to bring us out where we want to arrive. To stay 
within the circle of 10 this year and of 100 next is like having 
a child travel all over a ten-mile circle this year, a hundred- 
mile circle next, etc. There may be greater difficulties 
within the ten-mile area, if we travel all over it, than would 
be found in taking an express train and crossing a continent.  
-P-A-G-E-404
  304 THE CHILD'S MIND 
For example, if a child thinks of a hundred as a unit, he can 
add four hundreds and two hundreds as easily as he can add 
four apples and two apples. 
As stated before, denominate numbers should not be 
wholly segregated and then concentrated as one topic, but 
introduced, a bit at a time, wherever those bits will fit in 
and strengthen other bonds. Dollars and cents should come 
before decimals, serving as an introduction to that subject; 
and as the handling of decimals differs from that of integers 
in nothing save the placing of the decimal point (a matter 
made very easy by modern devices), and as the meaning of 
tenths is illustrated by dimes, and that of hundredths by 
cents, it would seem, theoretically at least, that the subject 
of decimals should precede that of common fractions. The 
simpler fractions, but not very extensive operations with 
them, will of course have been introduced, one after another, 
almost from the beginning. 
How addition prepares for subtraction. — There is a beau- 
tiful definiteness about the teaching of the fundamental 
operations, for every much-used combination, and especially 
all combinations of one-figure numbers, can easily be inven- 
toried, catalogued, and isolated for special drill. Although 
the number of these combinations is limited, the thorough- 
ness with which each must be taught is almost without 
limit. Every one of them must be made to work with per- 
fect accuracy — and this means that the bonds will work 
slowly at first; but later they should be brought to a fair 
degree of speed. If separate tables had to be taught for 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, the 
labor would be enormous. 
By teaching subtraction as the opposite of addition, and 
division as the opposite of multiplication, we can reduce 
 
-P-A-G-E-405
ARITHMETIC 395 
the number of necessary tables to two, the addition and the 
multiplication tables. The pupil then subtracts by adding, 
that is, by the so-called Austrian method, the method of 
“making change.” 
Change-makers commonly start with the price of the 
article purchased and add to it until they reach the amount 
laid down to pay the bill. For example, if we buy a 17-cent 
article and lay down 50 cents, the change-maker will prob- 
ably say ‘'17, 20, 25, 50,” handing out, as he adds, 3 one- 
cent pieces, a nickel, and a quarter. 
The child who has mastered, in addition, the problem 
4 
+5, learns to ask himself, when he meets in subtraction the 
9 
problem —5, ‘What must I add to 5 to get 9?” or “5 
and what make 9?” At a later stage, after sufficient drill, 
of course the very sight of such a problem sets off the answer 
directly and spontaneously, with no self-questioning or 
further thought. 
How multiplication prepares for division. — As the addi- 
tion tables enable us to subtract, so the multiplication 
tables enable us to divide. The child who has learned that 
7 X 9 = 63 will soon learn to ask himself, on seeing 7 as 
divisor and 63 as dividend, ‘‘7 times what = 63?”. When 
9 X 7 has been learned, the sight of 9 and 68 in this divisor- 
dividend relation will set off a similar question. Finally, 9 
and 7 as factors and 63 as product becomes so intimately 
bound together as to bring the answer automatically in such 
exercises. 
From the cases that “‘come out even” we proceed to divi- 
sion with a remainder. Thorndike would have us teach the 
uneven divisions of all numbers below 20 by 2, all below 30

Such bonds prepare the way for short division, and are use- 
ful for other reasons. 
. Order of teaching tables. — The “‘logical’’ way of master- 
ing a table would seem to be to take it “just as it stands,” 
keep it in graded order, and so avoid skipping any items of it. 
For instance, we can easily build up our addition tables from 
Oey 2.3 Oc eb. 20-3 OT) 22.35 a5 
+0 +0 +0 $0 ote, or $1 +1 +1 +1 ete, to+9 +9 +9 +9 +9 19 ete. Daa hs LEE? 8s 4 9 10 11 12 13 14 
Crossing out the combinations that are duplicated as table 
after table is added, we have left 55 different combinations 
of two digits each. But we should only befog a child by 
beginning with zero plus zero, or perhaps with zero plus 
one, as we mystify him when we begin, in multiplication, 
with ‘“‘one times” a number; this probably does not seem 
to him to be multiplying at all. 
When you have to learn the names of thirty pupils in your

grade, you would not like to commit them from your seating 
list until you could say them off, row after row, and not 
get acquainted with their owners until afterward. You 
take first the more striking personalities and the names 
easiest to remember. The tall boy is Tony, Flossie is the 
one who came to see you before school opened, Mary Golden 
has golden hair and smiles over her book, etc. Later, when 
you know them all individually and as a room-full, you can 
name off from memory row after row. 
Items of an arithmetical table have also their personalities, 
some striking, interesting, and easy to master, others more 
prosy and flat and difficult. 2 x 5 is easy, for one carries it 
about on his two hands all the time. In fact, most combi- 
nations that include 5 or 10 are easy, and should be marked 
for early mastery. Also, nearly every table contains one or 
more items which have been mastered before in a different 
form. A pupil who has learned the multiplication table of 
3’s should welcome, in later tables, the sight of 4 x 3, 6 x 3, 
and so on. Finally, all items of the multiplication tables 
beyond 9 x 9 can be postponed until the little learner is 
more mature; and as we never have to use them in written 
multiplication, it would do no great harm if they were not 
taught in the elementary school at all. 
Readiness. — Investigation brings out two peculiar facts 
about arithmetic: it is popular, generally, among children — 
as a rule is better liked than any other branches except the 
manual arts, drawing, certain forms of gymnastics, and 
history; yet more children fail in it than in any other branch. 
The solution of this apparent contradiction seems to be that 
the subject is in itself attractive to pupils, but that our time 
and method of presenting it are such as to make the children 
suffer where they love.  
-P-A-G-E-408
  398 THE CHILD’S MIND 
Very likely one of our fundamental faults is that of teach- 
ing it — much of it — at the wrong time, that is, too early. 
Children of grades four to six or seven, when asked what 
uses of numbers they make or notice outside of school, have 
spoken of football signals, spots on dominoes or dice, count- 
ing in games, adding up the store bill and making change, 
reading numbers on houses, automobiles, watches, pages, 
time-tables and ice cream checks, counting time in music 
and dancing, keeping a personal account book, and making 
‘out bills for work done. Most of their extra-school arith- 
metic is included under counting and the reading of numbers. 
At the same time, they delight in manipulating abstract 
numbers, and “mechanical drill is a pleasure.” !_ The con- 
viction seems to be growing that many of our “practical” 
problems are very impractical for children and that applied 
arithmetic, that is, arithmetic as applied to anything except 
what children are immediately interested in, may well be 
postponed to the junior high school period. 
The second great destroyer of readiness is the too pro- 
found “‘explaining” which so many teachers still persist in, 
but which their pupils do not call for nor profit by, and 
which only obscures matters and bewilders the children, 
especially when they have to repeat it themselves. This, 
together with other formalisms, such as the copying of 
all problems to be solved, too great a quantity of written 
work, and the writing out of a concrete interpretation of 
many numbers all the way through the solution of problems, 
has made arithmetic and a good time very far apart. 
Formerly, the achievement of children in foreign schools, 
especially those of Germany, was often compared with that 
1See Noon’s investigation as reported in the Journal of Educational Psy- 
chology for November, 1919. f 
 
-P-A-G-E-409
ARITHMETIC 399 
of our own, to the apparent disgrace of the home product. 
But we should also compare the number of suicides among 
German school children with the number in the United 
States. There is a question as to how much pressure 
should be put on the rising generation if we want it to rise 
to its best. 
We can, of course, make the same appeal to the stock 
instincts and old habits, in the teaching of arithmetic, that 
we can make in the teaching of other branches. Number 
games, in particular, are found to be very effective. Smith 
makes the statement that more people in the history of the 
world have learned the elements of number through dice 
than in the public school.! Perhaps it is unfortunate that 
we can not furnish each pupil a dice box and a set of 
speckled cubes without shocking the parents. 
But the peculiar charm of arithmetic lies in its appeal to 
something not found in the lower animals, and which may 
almost be called man’s intellectual instinct. Its ideas are as 
perfectly bounded as billiard balls, and move with the same 
precision and accuracy; it requires no workshop or gather- 
ing of field specimens, is “‘all in your head,” yet gives mar- 
velous control over the outer world; and its problems require 
the exercise of a perfect mechanics of thought. If we can 
take advantage of this appeal along with others, can make 
our pupils feel the fine sense of mastery that its drills develop, 
can secure variety by introducing new topics without loss of 
continuity, and —it may be added —if we can procure 
textbooks with the same quality of type and illustration 
that we have in reading books, perhaps with sprightly line 
drawings to provoke a little arithmetical humor occasionally, 
1 David Eugene Smith — The Teaching of Arithmetic, p. 88. For a variety 
of number games, see Chapter XIV of the same book.

  400 THE CHILD’S MIND 
the nerve fibers of most of our pupils will be a-tingle with 
readiness. 
Exercises by the tandem method. — Guidance, we can see 
at once, must be largely internal. The old way of providing 
it was by putting the pupil through what we may almost 
call the advanced logic of arithmetic, which consisted of just 
such explanations as one expert mathematician might be 
expected to use in presenting his discovery to another. But 
it is not so much the connections for mathematical logic 
that we want to form; it is bonds for number craft — quite a 
different thing. | 
The nearest approach to the tandem method is by imita- 
tion, ‘showing.’ The old-time teacher was warned so often 
against doing the pupil’s work for him that she came to 
think of ‘‘helping”’ as robbing him of his chance of origi- 
nality, initiative, independence, and pioneering power. Then 
came the ‘‘discovery” method, by which the teacher was 
supposed to lead the child to find out everything for himself. 
But no one of us, in traveling, cares to ‘“‘discover”’ the art 
gallery, the landscape, and everything else which common 
sense tells us thousands of people must have seen before. 
What we want is a good guide who will lead us directly to 
the most advantageous view, from which we can get a 
masterful idea of the whole. | 
Weare teaching subtraction with borrowing, say, when the 
pupils already know subtraction without borrowing. We 
have begun by subtracting 2, 5, etc., from 10, setting the 
problems down on the board and showing that, since we 
cannot take the 2 or the 5 from 0, we must borrow the 1 
to go with it. They know the result in advance, and can 
easily ‘‘see through” the process. Next, let us subtract 15 
from 40. ‘‘See how I set the numbers down, just as we 
   
-P-A-G-E-411
  ARITHMETIC 401 
always do. I cannot take 5 from 0, so I get a 1 to put with 
it, as I did before. Five and what make 10? Five, and I put 
it down. Now comes the only new thing you have to learn. 
Look: I add a 1 to the 1 below, and say ‘2 and what make 4.’ 
Two. I put it down, and I have my answer. To prove it, 
add 25 to 15 and see if you do not get 40.” 
“Now watch me and help me while I do some more ex- 
amples like this. Subtract 18 from 42. Tell me how to 
write the numbers, George.” (Call at first on bright pupils 
only.) “What do we think first, Mary?” ‘Eight and what 
make twelve? Four’ — and I write it. ‘‘Now, who can 
tell what to do next?”’ Ete. 
After we have done a number of examples in this way,— 
“Who will come to the board and try to do one all alone?” 
Later, the whole class will try. ‘‘Tell me if you are puzzled. 
Don’t do anything unless you are pretty sure it is right.” 
We hardly need to formulate a rule for this method. If 
we have one at all, it will be a very simple admonition, 
and in child language. The teacher may ask, time and 
again as the lessons go on, ‘‘What must we always be sure 
to do after we borrow 1 and subtract?” ‘‘Add one to the 
next number below.”’ Later, ‘‘What do we do if there is 
no next number, or if itis 0?” Ete. 
No explanation is necessary beyond showing the pupils 
that it works, and this they can find out by counting or add- 
ing. If they want the explanation in terms of tens and units, 
and ask for it, give it to them, showing that the same effect 
is produced whether we decrease the tens in the minuend 
or increase the tens in the subtrahend. But such talk as 
this, when they are not ready for it, would throw most of 
their little brains out of gear. What they want is bonds for 
working the example rather than for understanding the  
-P-A-G-E-412
    | 
402 THE CHILD’S MIND > 
process; and as a rule it is easier to go from the working con- 
nections to the understanding bonds than from the under- 
standing to the working. 
Drill and oral work. — The total amount of time given 
to drill has some influence, of course; but investigation 
shows that regularity and even distribution of time, day by 
day, is still more significant. Right concentration of effort 
has much to do with lowering the purchase price of success. 
As already stated (see Chapter IV), the most economical 
way to fix any bond is to give it a number of interested 
repetitions at first (perhaps ten or fifteen for the ordinary 
mathematical fact), then a constantly decreasing number, at 
constantly increasing intervals, until there’s no such word 
as fail, so far as that connection is concerned — or at least 
until failure is very rare. Of course there are differences in 
difficulty, and we do not know yet just how great those 
differences are. But at critical points, as in teaching the 
addition and multiplication tables, we can place each item 
on a separate card, discard the easy as fast as they are 
mastered, and reserve the difficult for concentrated bom- 
bardment. 
If somebody would only invent a way of drilling on the 
fundamental operations without loss of time and in such > 
manner that the pupil would know at once whether his 
result was correct, it would be one of the greatest blessings 
arithmetic could receive. The nearest approach to it now 
_ is the printed practice exercise.! 
Oral work was long considered so important that it was 
taught from a separate book and at a separate period. But 
we do not want pupils to form a separate system of brain 
1 The Courtis Practice Tests, which have been found effective, may be pro- 
cured from the World Book Company, Yonkers, N. Y.
-P-A-G-E-413
    ARITHMETIC 403 
paths for it. For all common calculations, there should be 
tongue bonds as well as hand-and-pencil connections. Fur- 
ther, these tongue bonds ought not to involve long and com- 
plex ‘‘oral analysis,” as in the old “Mental Arithmetics,” 
but should be direct and simple, that the pupil may practice 
as he will perform. Imagine Smith going into a store and 
seeing a price tag, 65¢. ‘“‘If one yard costs 65¢, 24 yards 
will cost 24 times 65¢. In 1 there are 2 halves, and in 2 
there must be 2 times 2 halves, or 4 halves, etc.” No; Smith 
doesn’t say that. He probably thinks, “Two yards would 
cost me a dollar and thirty cents. Half a yard would add 
33¢, and that would make a dollar sixty-three.” The 
superintendent of schools has no right to assert that learning 
has lost its dignity if he finds pupils saying the same thing. 
Oral work, being rapid, enables us to ‘‘guide the nerve 
current repeatedly along the right path.’’ Our best teachers 
advocate giving a little time during each recitation — per- 
haps five minutes — to rapid, spirited oral work. Most of 
this time should be spent on work with abstract numbers; 
but here is also a golden chance to correlate arithmetic with 
what is going on in other branches, and to relate it to the 
environment. Local arithmetic is needed, as well as local 
geography, and the pupil should become familiar with it 
before he sallies forth to conquer the world numerically. 
Preventing and correcting errors. — In the matter of cor- 
rection, both pupils and teacher suffer from the blues of the 
blue pencil, and to little purpose; for correcting the paper does 
not correct the pupil’s brain paths. In the study of Compo- 
sition (Chapter XIII), we discover several ways in which the 
teacher of arithmetic can help both herself and her class: by 
having correct forms copied from book or board — a, limited 
number of them, as in making figures, setting down problems 
 
-P-A-G-E-414
SE RL ST PRN Te CRE Cae a EAN MITT IRR EMRE EYE YP" og Ir PERRET ETer AT 
404 THE CHILD’S MIND > 
in addition, and so on; by giving dictation, as ‘‘ Write all 
the numbers from 1 to 50,” later uncovering the correct 
forms on the board and having pupils correct their own work 
under supervision; by help when work is being done; by 
special attention to common major errors during the class 
period; by having many short problems on the board and 
correcting them quickly as a part of the class work; by 
having pupils (under supervision) inspect ea¢h other’s work; 
by furnishing at first hektographed or printed matter with 
blanks to be filled, and later the complete forms so that 
the pupil can do his own correcting; and by insisting that 
each pupil form the habit of correcting his own paper to 
the best of his knowledge before handing it in. 
This last has given rise, in the modern teaching of arith- 
metic, to the process of checking. Addition is checked for 
correctness by adding again in reverse order; subtracting by 
adding remainder and subtrahend to get minuend; multipli- 
cation by reversing multiplicand and multiplier, and multi- 
plying again; division by multiplying divisor and quotient | 
to get dividend. These methods, together with other simple 
ones which various texts present, should be taught, and 
taught thoroughly. They enable the learner to know, and 
to know that he knows —a state of mind conducive to 
wisdom, peace, courage, and efficiency. 
Practicing for future performance. — The subject matter 
of arithmetic is often considered under two heads: Pro- 
cesses, such as the fundamental operations, and Problems. 
Some schools stand high in one, some in the other. With 
the processes there ought to be little trouble where drill is 
thorough, for we perform these the same way in school and} 
out. Here is a fixed and limited system of brain paths, an 
if we form them well they work well. Nor do problem
-P-A-G-E-415
ARITHMETIC 405 
present such an infinite variety if they are common-sense 
problems stated in simple, common language. But the 
makers of problems too often feel that they must bring in 
something novel or sensational for pupils to figure on, and 
that their language must have all the formal dignity of a 
state paper. It has been found that a problem can be made 
nineteen times as difficult for children, by just a few changes 
in its phraseology — another reason for postponing difficult 
problem work till the children have some mastery of English. 
What makes a good problem good? A good problem is 
one which conforms to our familiar laws of Readiness, 
Exercise, and Effect. Firstly, it should present some situa- 
tion which the pupil cares about. Whether that situation 
is real or imaginary makes little difference; but it must be 
interesting to the child. Secondly, it should contain (in 
the early years, at least) but one point of mathematical 
difficulty, and no points of linguistic or other difficulty, and 
it should lead the pupil just as directly as possible to exer- 
cise himself on that one mathematical point. Finally, its 
solution should give the pupil something he wants —- yield 
him a supply of satisfaction. 
The way to teach a child to think, to analyze problems, 
is to practice the problem with him. Thinking is not so 
mysterious as we sometimes suppose it to be. It is just a 
matter of having one’s brain rich in bonds, with discrimina- 
tion switches to guide the nerve impulse here and there until 
it issues in the right response. Learning to think is much 
like learning the roads about the country and putting up 
guide posts to help us find the way next time. Teacher and 
pupil should together lay the discrimination switches, set 
up the guide posts. ‘If it takes two men three days to do 
a piece of work, how long will it take four men to,do it?”
-P-A-G-E-416
  406 THE CHILD’S MIND 
Here the old bond of “two times two”’ may be set off, giving 
the answer, “Six days.” “But if Johnnie helped you with 
a piece of work, would it take you longer than if you worked 
alone?’”’ We must form a new bond, “The more workers, 
the less time” — and a good brain under good conditions 
will have the discrimination switch properly set next time, 
and not make the same mistake again. 
Effect. — Since arithmetic, well taught, is popular, and 
arithmetical mastery brings its own flush of pleasure, I shall 
only make brief mention here of certain matters which com- 
monly interfere with this fine effect. Such are confusion 
from involved ‘‘explanations,” or from going too fast. The 
prime arithmetical virtue is clearness and definiteness. To 
secure it, pupils should practically be allowed to take their 
own pace, so long as they have a pace. 
Fussiness on the part of the teacher is another destroyer 
of pleasure. This may take the form of needle-point accu- 
racy, whereas all we want is such accuracy as society com- 
monly demands in any case. Neatness, virtue that it is, may 
be overdone: the pupil must be allowed his first rough draft 
preceding the final finished copy in this as in composition. 
Sometimes a form of “‘analysis,’’ and especially written 
analysis, is followed to the point of tedium. Let the pupil 
“explain”? very much as he would to a fellow pupil who 
needs help. Sometimes the fussy teacher tries too hard to elim- 
inate, from the very beginning, those extra thoughts or move- 
ments which always characterize early learning. Let the 
pupil write down, for the time at least, the number he bor- 
rows or has to carry; or say, in adding, “Seven and five are 
twelve, and six are eighteen,” instead of “Seven, twelve, 
eighteen.”” An energetic mind, fixed on its purpose, will 
drop these useless things as soon as they are useless. 
|  
-P-A-G-E-417
ARITHMETIC 407 
A simplified course of study, an attractive book well 
printed and illustrated, a clear-headed teacher, and no work 
inflicted on the pupil unless it contributes to necessary bond 
building — these will bring something better than the pot 
of gold at the foot of the rainbow. 
Testing essential bonds. — In no other branch, probably, 
is it so easy to isolate and define precisely what we aim to 
teach and, at the end, just what we think we have taught. 
For this reason, arithmetic was one of the first branches in 
which reliable tests were standardized. These tests are of 
two kinds, corresponding to the two divisions of subject 
matter. Accordingly, we have tests of fundamental oper- 
ations, and of reasoning.! These differ in that some are 
designed to test speed and accuracy in performing a number 
of operations of about the same degree of difficulty, while 
others present a “ladder” of increasingly difficult steps up 
which the pupil climbs until he reaches his limit. The uses 
of these tests are in general the same in arithmetic as in 
other branches: to make our teaching more definite and help 
us to use the most work on the hardest points, to enable us 
to make comparisons of schools, methods, etc., and to give © 
the pupil the stimulus of knowing and trying to beat his old 
record — no small inducer of readiness.’ 
1 Attempts have also been made to formulate diagnostic tests, to find out in 
advance how much mathematical ability a pupil has. See, for example, the 
Rogers Tests for Diagnosing Mathematical Ability, Bureau of Publications, 
Columbia University. 
2 Two of the most widely used tests in arithmetic are the Courtis Standard 
Research Tests for the fundamental operations, to be obtained from S. A. 
Courtis, 82 Eliot Street, Detroit, Mich.; and the Stone Reasoning Tests, 
which can be procured from the Bureau of Publications, Columbia Univer- 
sity. Various others have been produced, and doubtless more will be. As 
the field of tests and measurements is one of rapid change, it is well to watch 
its developments through the educational journals and the more recently 
published books in that special department.

1. Are you satisfied with the way arithmetic was taught to you 
in the elementary school? If so, what were the strong points of 
the teaching? If not, what are you going to do differently when 
you teach it to others? 
2. So far as possible from memory, describe the kind of arith- 
metical problem you most enjoyed in your elementary school 
days. The kind you most disliked. 
3. Run through the list of ‘Bonds to avoid” and state what- 
ever reasons you think there may be for including them; for 
omitting them. | 
4. Give reasons why you think tables should or should not be 
learned, from the beginning, in serial order; why they should be 
learned backward or why not. 
5. Take some problem and show, by example, that ‘‘to trans- 
late a problem from literary language into the language of the 
equation is the first and fundamental step in solving it.”

tables beyond nine times nine. Of what value in practical life 
is the table of 11’s? 
7. Show the value of having pupils approximate the answer to 
a problem — “It would be about so much’’ — before working it 
out precisely. How would it help, for example, in first placing 
the decimal point, so as to be sure to avoid absurdly great or 
small answers? : 
8. Should textbooks contain answers to problems? 
9. Review the method of teaching and learning a spelling lesson 
(in Chapter X) and see whether you find anything that can be 
applied to the teaching and learning of tables in arithmetic. 
What are the points of likeness and difference between learning a 
list of words and learning the items in a table when both are 
understood? 
10. Devise a game number, or report on one with which you 
are familiar. 
11. What is the special value of problems formulated by the 
teacher or brought in by the pupils? 
12. Try to tell what you mean by explaining and proving. 
How would this do? — “To explain or prove a thing to anyone is 
to show him that it fits in with the bonds he has already formed.” 
Give cases, as that of the white man explaining the steam engine 
to the Indian by telling him there was in it a kind of giant who 
had to be treated in a certain way, etc. 
What does this have to do with the kind of explaining and 
demonstrating we do in arithmetic?

CHAPTER XX 
| GEOGRAPHY 
, Exercises. — 1. How do you practice geography? (Note that 
we can answer such a question easily when it is asked of most of 
} the common branches.) Make a list of daily-life situations in 
_ which the average person, child or adult, needs geography. It is 
not enough to say that one uses sugar at the breakfast table and 
this sugar comes from the South and from various islands. List 
only those’situations where geography makes a difference, where 
a geographical response is necessary and the individual will suffer 
to some extent if he cannot give it. 
2. You have been transplanted to some strange planet, per- 
haps Mars. Make a list of the chief things you want to know 
about that planet in order to live on it successfully. Granted that 
sources of information similar to those on earth are available, 
such as newspapers, libraries, means of travel, etc., how do you 
prefer to find out what you want to know? 
What is geography? — Geography is the study, in the 
large, of what nature has done here, and of what man is 
doing as a result. It is the general story of how man makes 
a home for himself here on earth, and of how he lives in it 
when he gets it made. 
When geography began, it was more literally ‘writing 
about the earth,” as its name indicates. Only a small part 
of the earth had been found. Every new discovery was a 
mighty marvel, and started dreams of fabulous fortune. 
Now that we have found both ends of our little oblate 
spheroid and learned its limitations, and especially since we 
have come to realize, with great pain, that God has made 
of one blood all the nations of the earth, and that, being 
411

  412 THE CHILD’S MIND | 
such close neighbors as we all are, we might better study 
and understand each other and coéperate than fight it 
out, the human interest is highest. 
If there were no people in any other part of the earth, we 
should care as little about its remote regions as we do about 
the geography of the moon. But put human characters into 
the plot anywhere, and immediately the play of interest is 
on full swing. 
The result is that geography is coming to overlap other 
subjects considerably, as biology in the study of plant and 
animal life, and history in the treatment of human events. 
But our branches of study are like the rooms in General 
Charles Lee’s house, separated by chalk mark partitions. 
It is rather a convenience to be able to step easily from one 
to another. 
What good is geography? — When snvabatee of the sub- 
ject undertake to convince us of its great practical use for 
all children, they usually have a stuttering time of it. The 
plain truth is that the average child in a good home has very 
little need for what is commonly taught as geography; and 
the average man, too, can grub along pretty well from day 
to day and still know as little geography ‘ed Christopher 
Columbus’ critics did. 
But do we want to grub along? It is in Li higher and 
more intelligent type of life that geography gives its best 
service. There is direct self-preservation. As “weather 
comes from the west,’ so many of our worst diseases, 
cholera, smallpox, influenza, come from the East. When 
the newspaper tells us such a disease has reached the ports 
of Europe, it is time to take extra precautions. There is 
indirect self-preservation — making a living. The eastern 
farmer is foolish to pit his garden patch ndetst the western 
 
-P-A-G-E-423
  GEOGRAPHY 413 
plains. Let him raise, rather, the perishable stuff for the 
great cities near by. Then there is the rearing of offspring. 
My neighbor’s daughter was threatened with tuberculosis. 
He sent her to Colorado, where she studied and recuperated 
for a year, returning then to the East, where she has had 
no further trouble. In maintaining proper social and po- 
litical relations, geography gives superior service. In a 
world that somebody sets fire to every once in a while, we 
must know who carries the matches and where he gets them. 
But man does not live by bread alone, nor on the crust 
of the earth alone. His view of life and his attitude toward 
the world he lives in may be more important than what he 
eats, or even whether he eats at all for a time. Suppose you 
were a citizen of Columbus’ day. The world might be for 
you a little flat thing, with falling off places all round, and 
outlandish animals to gobble you if you strayed far from 
home. Water boiled in the southerly seas. Men, if they 
lived on the underside of the world at all, had to hang head 
down, in constant danger of falling off into nowhere. A 
ship that ever slid down over the bulge could never sail ‘‘up 
hill” and get back again, and the Atlantic Ocean was known 
as the “‘Sea of Darkness.” 
Geography is a “liberal art,’”’ a liberating science. It is 
the life craft of the race. It is environment study which 
expands our environs from the dooryard to the starry 
heavens. It should be taught as such a subject. 
Situation and response. — The situation is any disturbing 
or rousing condition, individual, national, or racial, which 
can best be mastered by forces of a terrestrial-human kind.! 
1 Here we might add, “and which is not dealt with in any other branch of 
study.” As it is difficult to separate geography sharply from other branches, 
so it is to characterize exactly the geographical response. But the quest 
brings insight. 
   
-P-A-G-E-424
    414 THE CHILD’S MIND | 
The response is finding and applying those terrestrial- 
human forces that will win success. 
“Food will win the war.” We respond by bringing more 
food out of the ground. The coal supply of the world will 
some day be exhausted. Very well. Then future generations 
will have to find something to take its place, or change their 
way of living. 
What bonds to form.—If one is to make use of these 
terrestrial-human forces, he must know what they are, how 
to get at them, who controls them, and how. Now, the best 
key and most interesting approach to all this lies in what 
the people are doing. Man, like a plant, must have heat, 
light, air, water, andfood. In addition, he must have activ- 
ity of some kind, especially play and recreation. To satisfy 
these needs, he must work. The fundamental human geo- 
graphical needs and necessities, then, are food, clothing, 
shelter (including fuel), work, and play. To answer these 
necessities, in whatever country or clime man finds himself, 
he uses, up to the limit of his intelligence, all the resources 
nature has placed there. Watch what he does the world 
over and you will see the terrestrial-human forces in action. 
The essential bonds to be formed in connection with any 
country or region can be discovered by answering the fol- 
lowing questions: ! 
1. What kind of people and about how many live there? 
2. What are they doing? 
3. Why are they doing it? 
4. Why do they do it that way? 
Answering these questions will lead to the answering of three 
or four others of importance. (1) What has Nature done 
1 Questions 2, 3, and 4 were suggested by an address | (though not on a 
geographical subject), by Dr. Frank E. Spaulding. |

  GEOGRAPHY 415 
there? What has she placed under the soil in the way of 
minerals, in the soil or the waters in the way of fertility, 
above the soil in the way of climate? (2) What is she 
doing there now? Rain or snow, calm or blow, volcanoes or 
vegetation? (3) Why does she do it? The Sahara is a desert, 
and Florida is too rainy to raise cotton. Why? 
We start with people because human interest is the lead- 
ing interest with us all, children especially. What we give 
as the answer to each question, from games to governments, 
will depend on how old our pupils are. Geography is an 
exhaustless subject, and cannot be systematized for young 
pupils. Give what is called for. We may take up further 
questions with older pupils: What should the people do, in 
such a land, that they are not doing? What of the future, 
the outcome of these terrestrial-human forces at work? 
How is it all going to affect us, our country, the world at large? 
A further question which we shall want to answer in connec- 
tion with locations that are vitally interesting to us is, How 
can we get to that place, and from there to other places? 
This involves forming bonds for direction, distance, maps, 
latitude, longitude. Somewhere in the course, we want to 
see that our pupil gets a unified view of the world as a whole, 
as a great ball spinning through the heavens, of the general 
distribution of land and water, and of that which affords 
man his food, clothing, shelter, work, and play. 
Less important bonds. — We have said little of names, 
nice definitions, exact locations, precise boundaries, capes, 
and the bends in the rivers. The old botany was bent on 
names; the new botany tries to understand plant life, and 
takes names as necessary incidentals. In the same way, 
the new geography (which is old enough now to be grown up) 
teaches a limited number of names and locative details as
-P-A-G-E-426
  416 THE CHILD’S MIND 
| 
necessary incidents, but fixes its eye firmly on terrestrial- 
human life. 
What related responses are ready? —In general, not 
many related responses are ready. The pupil may be able 
to understand “what kind of people live there,” for an 
American child is likely to see, on the streets or pictured in 
the movies, many kinds of people. He may himself be any 
one of many kinds. But until he has come into contact 
with many occupations, and in particular, until his ex- 
perience has made him appreciate economic needs, he can- 
not go far in geography. I think we have been forcing it 
on him too early, and that the book study of it, in anything 
more than story form, should not begin before the fifth 
grade. 
At the same time, he is not without resources. He may 
have cut out and drawn and constructed many things from 
many lands. He has read of the | 
Little Indian, Sioux or Crow, 
Little frosty Eskimo, 
and may have sung the songs of other lands. His nature 
study (and perhaps gardening) has been a direct introduc- 
tion to the study of terrestrial-human activity. Some will 
have formed many geographical connections through travel. 
Others will scarcely have gotten ten blocks from home. 
Among other interests that may have started geographical 
* brain-paths are the weather report and map, the ball games 
played in this city and that, travelers, the aT map, 
mail, and the radiophone. 
Relation of the desired bonds. — Most of the facts we 
teach in geography are either independent of each other, 
or can be taught independently. That is to say, there is
-P-A-G-E-427
  GEOGRAPHY 417 
no intricate network of connections that must be formed as 
we go along. Gradually, however, as the pupil matures 
and the course progresses, the whole subject will be bound 
together by associations this way and that way into one 
organized whole. The better the book and the teaching, the 
more perfect will this process be. Cotton in the United 
States will be compared with cotton in India and in Egypt, 
and cotton everywhere will be related to soil and to climate 
— especially to frost and rainfall. 
Trunk line bonds are formed by what is known as ‘‘type 
studies.” A type study is a very careful study of anything 
—a mine, a mill, a forest, a region — in order to gain an un- 
derstanding, through it, of all other things like it. If our 
class studies agriculture in one region, it then knows a 
great deal about agriculture in all other regions that are at 
all similarly situated. 
From sensori-motor to high level bonds. — In construction 
work, drawing, nature study and all other branches that we 
have taken up so far, the pupil has, or may have, his object 
at hand to react on. The ideal way to study geography 
would be to travel over the earth, and visit every point 
studied, with an expert who knew just how to point out 
whatever is most interesting and important. But our pupil 
must respond to things at a distance, must pass from 
knowledge of things seen to the study of things not seen, 
and he must master these unseen things largely through the 
use of maps, pictures, and print. 
How can this be done? By two processes: (1) Study 
home geography. (2) Express this home geography in 
symbols, that is, maps, pictures, print, etc., such as 
the pupil will have to interpret when he studies remote 
geography.
-P-A-G-E-428

418 THE CHILD’S MIND 
How to study home geography. — Study home geography 
by finding out what kind of people live here, what they 
are doing, why they are doing it, and why they do it that 
way. Follow up the interest of food, clothing, shelter, work, 
and play. Find out what nature has done here in the past, 
below the surface, in the surface, above the surface, what 
she is doing now, and (so far as little folks can follow) why 
she does it. Go straight after the things that make a dif- 
ference, and form as many sensori-motor bonds as possible. 
In doing this, we are forming connections that are easy 
and most interesting for the pupil, that will occur most fre- 
quently, and that will prepare the way for all that is to be 
taught later. For the geography of all the rest of the world 
must be understood in units of what is Mehered here at 
home. A young woman, reared inland, went to Atlantic 
City on her wedding trip. ‘‘Why!”’ she exclaimed, on first 
viewing the ocean, ‘‘you can’t see across, can you!”’ (It is 
like the sea of matrimony.) As we build up a graphic 
vocabulary for drawing and an agricultural vocabulary for 
farming, so we have to form in our pupil a geographical 
vocabulary in terms of which maps and pictures and other 
aids can tell him of the wide, wide world. 
Here again the Boy Scout method is a good one: work up 
some genetic geography. Go out into the woods and learn 
how to find your way. Build a fire without matches. Make 
a bed of boughs. Find your own food. Harn a dollar and 
save it. You will learn to appreciate food, clothing, shelter, 
the elements of life craft, of which geography is the big 
expansion. 
Expressing home geography in symbols.— Perhaps the 
best way to picture home geography is to make a few pages 
of a very elementary geography as if for some foreign group 
 
-P-A-G-E-429
GEOGRAPHY 419 
of children — who can read English. Visit your farms and 
industries, railroads and other roads, land and water forms, 
buildings and council chambers, and take kodak pictures, 
make drawings, collect views, make notes. Include every- 
thing that you think your foreign cousins should know about 
the region. For your own future purposes, it is fine, of 
course, if you can find a sample of every kind of geograph- 
ical subject which you want your pupils to interpret, by and 
by, from the ready-made geography which you are going to 
place in their hands. The descriptive part can be worked 
up in the language class (and the teacher may manage to 
get it into typewritten form). Crude the whole thing may 
be, but illuminated with photographs and cut-out views, post 
card pictures and maps, it will not be without its charms. 
We must make maps of every kind that is later to be inter- 
preted from the book. The outline map, with direction and 
scale indicated, will be taken up later (see the Class Exer- 
cise at the close of this chapter). To give the idea of relief 
and cross section, procure plastic material — sand, clay, 
paper boiled to a pulp, flour and salt, putty, plasticine — and 
model some very familiar contour such as the old coasting 
hill. Cut down through it, say along the line where the 
road runs over the top, take away one half, and study the 
side so exposed. Draw this cross-section view. 
Readiness. — As one glances through the Geographic News 
Bulletin,: he is struck by the fact that almost every one of 
its many illustrations shows samples of mankind, or of the 
striking works of man, or of the animals in which man is in- 
terested. The keynote is life, human life — and that is the 
keynote of interest in geography.

  420 THE CHILD’S MIND | 
If we keep to the forefront kinds of people, what they are 
doing, why they do it, and why they do it that way, then 
it is hard for anyone to prevent himself from being interested. 
Geography becomes the study of man at home in his world. 
To take a course in it is to call on our neighbors, and to get 
many hints as to how we can keep house ourselves. The 
interest we feel is an expression of something deeper than 
any one instinct, or ability, or habit; it is the urge of the 
original will to live, from which all instincts have developed. 
As we should expect, then, there is no source of readiness 
which we cannot tap. We can play the games of foreign 
people, sing their songs, build their huts, tents, and so on, 
of snow and other materials, imitate their dress, dramatize 
their doings. We can arouse curiosity: “How do you sup- 
pose they ever manage to—?” Along with this goes sur- 
prise: Iceland is not a land of ice, but of fire. The Icelanders 
import ice. ‘‘Why are they doing it?” To keep their fish 
from spoiling. Then there is the exploring, migrating, 
traveler’s instinct which man has felt ever since «his 
nomadic ancestors moved north and south with sun and 
rain, to feed their flocks. A wholesome fear is aroused as we 
contemplate nature’s mighty works, followed by the feeling 
that we must work in harmony with her. The works of other 
nations stir up emulation: ‘‘How does our country stand 
in—?” But the social instinct and the world view should 
lead the pupil to feel, finally, that man is one, as the world 
is, and that the house should not be divided against itself. 
Devices help. The moving picture and the radiophone 
bring us the sights and sounds of the far away, but are not 
always available. A post card projector can be bought for 
a few dollars, or even made at home,! and some of the

school supply houses furnish cards from all over the world. 
Certain phonograph records are valuable. The stereoscope 
must not be forgotten, maps are an aid, and books of travel 
and other similar books are geography itself. Correspond- 
ence with other classes at a distance is now frequent and 
successful. Periodicals, with their pictures, are often a kind 
of geographical news letter. Short trips can often be made, 
and volunteer automobiles are making longer ones possible. 
Higher grade classes sometimes conduct a money campaign 
during the year and then at its close take a tour. 
Exercise: the beginnings.— Nature study, elementary 
science, life craft, gardening, agriculture, geography — 
these are all one branch in the beginning, and through the 
first three or four grades. When we are ready to put a 
stronger geographical swing into the work, I should say a 
good way to start it would be to raise the question, ‘‘ What 
do all our daddies do?” taking care, of course, to carry the 
feeling that all useful work is good, and to avoid embarrass- 
ing anybody. From this we can proceed to why they do it, 
that is, find out what the various industries are for. Later, 
perhaps, we can make trips to some of the work places and 
find why the workers ‘‘do it that way.’’ Nor must we for- 
get the activities of the mothers, nor of the children them- 
selves. Of course all this, together with the study of the 
land and water forms, the watching of the course of the sun, 
keeping of temperature records, etc., will be done in a very 
simple way. We can next pass to the making of our geog- 
raphy for the far-away children, as already described. 
From home geography to the outer world. — In making 
the passage from home to the outer world, we need not 
follow any road that lies on the surface of the earth, pass- 
ing from town to county, county to state, and so on. A
-P-A-G-E-432
  422 THE CHILD’S MIND 
better highway is that of the children’s interests, from postage 
stamps to presidents. They may or may not care to follow 
up the industries as they leave their home region. Probably 
they are more likely to follow the call of the wild. But one 
thing we may be sure of: they always like a good story, and 
they are pretty sure to vote for any kind of geography that 
can be put into the form of a good story — good for them. 
Luckily for the teacher with little time, the authors of 
textbooks are making use of this story interest. We are so 
often admonished not to follow the book ‘“‘slavishly” that 
teachers come to feel the teaching must be old-fashioned 
and inferior if they do follow the book. There are two an- 
swers. One is that in many places there are still so many 
slavish things about teaching that the teacher has no time 
for original work. The other is that an author should not 
write a book that cannot be trailed pretty closely with 
plenary profit. What is a guide book for but to be followed? 
Somewhere early in the course should come a view, not 
detailed, but in the large, of the earth as a whole, that is, as 
a globe, with light falling on half of it all the time, with cold 
belts and warm belts, and with large masses of land and 
water. With a little trouble, a crude globe can be made of 
rags and some kind of plastic material, and a few locations 
marked on it. I would have a large globe standing or hang- 
ing always in the schoolroom, and with its axis pointing in 
the general direction of the north star. If a small globe can 
be afforded for each child, so much the better. General rela- 
tions, sizes, directions, and distances will be learned from 
the globe better than in any other way, and are worth much 
more than the small fry of facts. ! 
Maps, areas, names, and locations. — We do not size up 
our neighbor’s doings by drawing a precise map of his farm
-P-A-G-E-433
  GHUOGRAPHY 423 
and placing an indicator for each stone row. We like to 
know, in a rough way, whether his farm is as large as ours, 
whether he is likely to strike oil under it, whether it borders 
on water where there is good fishing, and so on. Is not that 
the attitude we should take toward our national neighbors? 
We want to know that which is significant, which makes a 
difference. 
There is no good reason for drawing many maps, and some 
of those we do draw might just as well be traced from the 
book. Areas we shall learn only in a relative way for the 
most part, as by taking our own state or country for a 
standard and then measuring others by that unit. Here 
again a good globe beats all other maps, for all are cor- 
rectly represented on its curving surface, and all are drawn 
to the same scale. 
Most of the names and locations that one needs to know 
(probably all that we adults carry in mind) can be learned 
in connection with the study of current events. A child 
brought up in a good home, where newspaper and magazine 
lead directly to the atlas and the globe, both supplemented 
by intelligent conversation and such travel-reading as most 
of us naturally care to do, seems to fare very well so far as 
his education in locative geography is concerned. Why not 
follow this pleasant plan in school? The jigsaw map puzzle, 
too, with its ‘‘Please hand me Nevada,’’ and ‘‘ Where does 
Missouri go?” is a real helper. If we can arrange for a great 
deal of practical handling of geographical material, enough 
of the names will cling, and not much deliberate drill memo- 
rizing will be necessary. 
The tandem method and the right brain paths. — The next 
best thing to traveling over the earth with a wise guide is to 
traverse it, in imagination, with a good teacher. By con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-434
  424/62 THE CHILD’S MIND 
versation, by setting problems and working out their solu- 
tion with the class, and with the help of the many devices 
already mentioned, she will see that right brain paths are 
formed and wrong ones avoided. And which are the desired 
bonds? Not word bonds, for the child can ‘‘learn” his ge- 
ography in Latin words, or even in English words, and not 
know it at all. It is mental picture bonds we want; when- 
ever we study a region, we want our pupil to see what is 
going on there, and to be able to think in terms of these 
mental pictures until he can tell what action is appropri- 
ate. When he can do this, be knows his geography. 
Regional geography. — History and geography are the two 
hemispheres of one whole subject. A great deal of history 
is the extension, backward in time, of geography; and a 
great deal of geography is just the hither end of history. 
Both are the study of man and the earth and their doings 
with each other. 
But history is the study of human-terrestrial forces, with 
the emphasis on the human, and geography is the study of 
terrestrial-human forces with the final emphasis on the 
terrestrial. History begins with a naked world and gradu- 
ally covers it with people and political boundaries. Geog- 
raphy begins with the people and political boundaries, but 
progresses toward natural boundaries and nature-made 
regions, the coal region, the cotton belt, the Mexican plateau. 
As the course in geography progresses, these regions should be 
emphasized more and more. Since our ultimate object is 
to understand and use forces and materials that are first of all 
terrestrial, let us learn to think in terms of these forces and 
materials as units, placed primarily just as nature placed 
them. For this purpose, we need the regional map and the 
region taken as a unit of study.   
  
 
-P-A-G-E-435
GEOGRAPHY 425 
Practice and final performance. — How does the adult 
“perform” in geography? Something ‘‘sets him to think- 
ing.” He goes for his globe, maps, atlas and other reference 
books, quizzes his friends, writes here and there. By and 
by comes the solution. 
Early problems in geography must be very simple and 
brief, the answers easily at hand. Later ones may require 
a longer campaign. The members of one class ‘‘went” to 
South America by the investigation route; one going as 
consul, another traveling for the National Geographic So- 
ciety, a third as the representative of a rubber tire company, 
and so on. One boy, in his effort to get material, wrote to 
different firms and agencies some thirty-two letters! He 
later presented this work, showing samples of raw rubber, 
ete., which he had collected, to other classes. 
Perhaps we may hope that some day pupils will leave the 
geography class with a clear view of world resources, and of 
how they should be unified and directed for world welfare. 
Effect. — “How far is the sun from the earth?” was asked 
of a man who was taking an examination to prove his fitness 
for a position. ‘I don’t know,” he replied, “but it isn’t 
close enough to prevent my doing this job well if I get it.” 
He got it. Here is one reason why the effect of geography 
teaching has not always been so agreeable as we could wish. 
We have catechized on too many details that have nothing 
to do with the terrestrial-human job. We must not study 
geography with a microscope. 
We shall get our best effect by keeping the human inter- 
est in the foreground, by following the lead of the pupil’s 
interests, especially in passing from home geography to the

outer world, by careful grading according to his time and 
ability, and by conversational methods—#in brief, by 
teaching this human subject in a human way. 
Tests. — Geography is a large subject —as big as the 
world. No one of us knows it all, nor ever will. Further, 
as we teach it to children, it cannot be a very systematic, 
closely reasoned, and intricately organized subject. Conse- 
quently, it is very difficult to pick out a limited number of 
bonds which will show, by their performance, the degree 
to which the whole subject is mastered. Both the individual 
teacher, for her local purposes, and the devisers of standard- 
ized tests, should keep to the things that are fundamental, 
connections which one must have made if he has formed 
any clear idea at all of the world as the dwelling place of 
man. | 
A beginning has been made in scale building, but it is 
perhaps a compliment to geography if the subject proves too 
big to be measured easily.! |

Chapter XXI of The Teaching of Geography, by Branom and Branom.

CLASS EXERCISE 
The purpose of the exercise is to practice the process of drawing 
the first map with children. 
Materials needed are a compass, two large sheets of paper such 
as strips of wrapping paper two feet by three feet, yard stick, and 
pencil. 
Someone may be appointed to conduct the exercise as if with 
a group of children. It is assumed that they know the points of 
the compass, and the simple arithmetic necessary. 
1. Project: to draw a “kind of picture” called a map, of our 
schoolroom. (If the sides of the schoolroom run very nearly 
north and south, go to the south end of it, or otherwise vary the 
exercise so that when the map is hung up, the north end of the 
map will not be at the top.) Lay down a large sheet of paper on 
the floor, the “children” disposing themselves so that they can 
see. Make sides of paper run parallel with (‘the same way as’’) 
sides of room. Measure the room. 
Can we draw the room full size on our paper? Solution: let 
a half inch on the map stand for a foot in the room. Develop 
idea of scale. 
Lay yardstick approximately parallel with sides of paper and 
have children draw lines and mark off the proper lengths. Put 
in a few marks for desks, ete. Why not put in windows? 
2. Place the map on the wall as if for hanging. ‘“‘It is agreed 
by all that the top of a map shall (nearly always) mean ‘north.’” 
Is the north end of our schoolroom map toward the top? How 
can we get it so? 
3. Solution (introduced by questions): find north by the com- 
pass. Lay down another sheet so that sides of paper run north 
and south. Lay yardstick parallel with sides of room and repeat 
map. Hang it. Does “up” mean “north” on it now?

Exercises. — 1. An historical vault is soon to be sealed, not 
to be opened till a hundred years from now. You are to place in 
this vault such records as you think will best enable the people of 
a century hence to understand and appreciate the present times. 
You may include phonograph records, photographs, written let- 
ters, diaries, newspapers, books, or practically anything else you 
please. What will you put in? Why? Should both Republican 
and Democratic (and perhaps other) records of political events 
goin? Catholic, Protestant, Hebrew (and perhaps other) records 
of religious events? English, French, German (and other) ac- 
counts of international affairs? 
If you were to open such a vault, sealed a hundred years ago, 
what would you wish to find in it to enable you to understand the 
life of that time? 
If you were transported to another planet, what kind of history 
and how much would you want to study in order to enable you 
to do your duty as a citizen there? By what means (books, 
traditions, monuments, etc.) would you attempt to get at the 
history of the people of that planet most reliably? 
2. Would you rather live in a log cabin settlement as in colonial 
days, but with good, trustworthy neighbors, or in modern material 
luxury, but in a community where you could not trust the good 
will of the people? | 
In your judgment, which does the world most need, more 
scientific research, inventions, etc., or more training of human 
nature to make a moral use of what we do have? Why?

  HISTORY AND CIVICS 431 
Should history and civics be taught together? — The 
uniting of the names of two subjects in the title of this 
chapter is not meant to indicate that they should be taught 
as one. In my judgment they should be so taught in the 
lower grades, perhaps through the first six. However, ex- 
pert practice varies on this point, and you will have to 
make up your own mind about it. 
What the chapter title does indicate is that a common 
spirit runs through the two branches. Their great and 
mutual purpose has been well expressed in the phrase, 
“socializing the child.’”’ Geography, as we have found, is 
another branch that helps greatly in the socializing process, 
and some educators there are who think that geography 
and civics should be taught, if not together, at least in very 
close relation. Again, history and geography have at various 
times been listed together and taught almost as one subject. 
Sometimes these three, geography, history, and civics, are 
grouped together under the name of “‘social studies.” One 
of the healthiest tendencies of the modern school is to 
make social studies of all branches; that is, to make 
them contribute to the socializing process just as much 
as possible. 
We may think of civics as the action side of history, 
particularly of present-day history, with special reference 
to government as the prime means for securing coédpera- 
tive action. What all of us teachers of these subjects 
want is to get the child to understand and appreciate the 
social situation in which he is placed, and to do something 
about it. 
General nature of history-civics. — The study of civics 
no longer covers the mere anatomy of state and local gov- 
ernment, with a record of the salaries of officers and their

length of term in service. As Barnard points out,! it is 
more like hygiene than anatomy. It is a study of social duty, 
emphasizes function rather than structure, and has a course 
of activities as well as one of studies. 
History, as already stated, is similar to geography. As 
geography is the study of terrestrial-human forces, with 
emphasis on the terrestrial, so history is the study of human- 
terrestrial forces, with emphasis on the human. It, of course, 
takes us into the past; for history, as one writer puts it, 
is ‘everything that ever happened,” ‘‘the past itself, what- 
ever that may be.”* Many of man’s past doings can be 
explained by reference to his environment. Wide seas or 
towering mountains blocked him here, open rivers and 
pleasant valleys caused him to migrate there. Yet he has in 
some sense a will of his own, and cannot be wholly explained 
by what lies about him. A nation, like an individual, is 
the product of its inheritance and its environment. Many 
historians have not taken sufficiently into account the 
blood of the historical actors. For instance, here are the 
Persians and the Hebrews, both situated in territory often 
invaded. Why did the Persians become 80 warlike under 
this stimulus, while the Hebrews have always been so com- 
paratively peaceful? Because of the difference in the 
breed. 
Further, we must not leave our pupils with the idea that 
“history repeats itself”? in the sense of aimlessly retracing 
an empty circle, like a cat chasing her tail. It does repeat 
itself; but the repetition is spiral and progressive, widening 
into larger circles and rising to higher levels. We want our

pupils to appreciate this progress and deliberately to help 
it on. 
Situation and response: mental attitude.— In the first 
place we aim, not at word bonds merely, but picture bonds. 
Even some feeble-minded children can recite pages and 
chapters of words just as they stand in the book. But we 
want our pupils, so far as possible, to see the picture of the 
past, or, more strongly still, to reconstruct and relive that 
past, and to feel it as a living thing. 
The historian asks us to cultivate in the children what he 
calls ‘historical mindedness,” and that means an interest 
in history and an appreciation of it. The man of historical 
mind has many facts at command, but not statements that 
he has swallowed, open mouthed, from every source. He 
asks of each history and historian, ‘‘What does this mean? 
Is it true? How do you know?” He tries to think out the 
application of these facts, especially to present problems: 
“Shall we have a League of Nations? What has national- 
ism done to us and for us? Internationalism?” Ete. But 
most important of all, perhaps, historical mindedness means 
that we will not take sides first and then try to drag the 
facts over after us, but will see on which side the facts are 
and then let our feelings follow them. 
Historical appreciation — and that is a general name for 
the feelings left in our souls by the study of history — is one 
of the most valuable and dangerous products of all educa- 
tion. For instance, here is a fine quotation from a great 
American: ‘‘Americanism,”’ he says, ‘‘is entirely an attitude 
of mind; it is the way we look at things that makes us 
Americans.” Yes, but so was the old Germanism an attitude 
of mind; it was largely the way they looked at things that 
made them world-fighting Germans. After the World War 
 
-P-A-G-E-444
434 THE CHILD’S MIND 
was over, a warning was issued to Prussian teachers and 
superintendents of schools against the misuse of history 
teaching for nationalistic ends. Instead of using history to 
incite peoples against each other, they were to present facts 
with broad historic setting; and all books tending to glorify 
wars as such were to be removed from the school libraries. 
The dominant feeling that courses in history have most 
frequently tried to cultivate is patriotism; and that has 
meant loyalty to prince or king or emperor or form of 
government. This is far ahead of cultivating the selfish 
individualism that encourages each to rush into a cut-throat 
struggle for personal power and success. Still, we are going | 
to see that no petty program of nationalism will suffice. 
As we have taught the subordination of self to nation, so 
we must teach the subordination of nation to society at 
large, and that means ‘‘all people that on earth do dwell.” 
As in geography we want the pupil to get a view of the whole 
earth, so in history we want him to get a view of the whole 
past, and of all the peoples of the present. Socializing him 
means, finally, teaching him to subordinate his selfish pro- 
pensities to the welfare of the whole, as our soldiers in the 
World War sacrificed their personal welfare and fought to 
make the world safe for democracy. 
The essence of historical mindedness, then, consists in 
sincere devotion to the facts and Te to hu- 
manity. 
Situation and response: action.— We want our pupils to 
practice history. How can they do it? 
The situation can be presented in terms similar to those 
used in discussing geography. It is any disturbing or rousing 
condition, individual, local, social, national or racial, which 
can best be mastered by forces of a human-terrestrial kind.   
  
 
-P-A-G-E-445
  HISTORY AND CIVICS 435 
The response is finding and applying those human-terres- 
trial forces that will win success. 
Now, what are the big things that determine the welfare 
and happiness of a people — of the whole world-full of peo- 
ple — and concerning which we must learn to act, by voting 
and otherwise? First, there are the material things, such as 
environment, property, food, clothing, shelter, and mechan- 
ical contrivances like railroads. And secondly, there are 
what we may call the moral-social factors of civilization, 
such as home life, education, and the spread of the spirit of 
the brotherhood of man. We cannot sharply separate these 
two, but the distinction is one that our present-day world 
seems to stand in need of. 
Let us arrange the principal topics under each head in the 
form of an outline which may be called 
Tue Cuier Factors or HumaAN WELFARE

“Place and people” includes such matters as location and size 
of territory, climate, soil, the blood of the people by descent, 
their number, etc.
-P-A-G-E-446
    436 THE CHILD’S MIND | 
“Property,” which has stood out so prominently in our law 
making, sometimes more carefully cared for than human life itself, 
suggests food, clothing, shelter, production and distribution of 
goods, with all the manufacturing, ‘business,’ and so on, that 
all these make necessary. 
“Progress through invention’’ is largely mechanical progress 
by means of machinery — railroads, automobiles and other inven- 
tions. We should consider here also related types of labor. 
“Health” must be mental as well as bodily. 
“Home” includes the sex life of the people, their method of 
mating, whether eugenic or the opposite, the position of woman, 
the attitude toward children, and all other matters related. 
“Higher life” brings in religion, philosophy, science, art, liter- 
ature. Ideals are not a luxury; without them, individuals become 
as lower animals, and nations die. 
“Vocation. Station. Recreation” is ry another name 
for opportunity for self-realization. Can each serve according 
to his nature and talents? Are there castes or classes, occupa- 
tional or other? Are the people a playful and happy people? ; 
“Education” raises the question as to how the people pass on 
their social inheritance to the next generation and whether they 
try to make it better than their own. 
“Politics,” using the word in the good old sense without a 
party stain on it, takes up questions of citizenship, law, crime 
and punishment, government, and the relation of nation to nation. 
“Progress through socialization”’ includes everything that grows 
out of the spread of the spirit of kindness, of service to humanity 
for the common good, and of practical codperation spreading from 
the neighborhood to a world-wide limit. 
This last item is in some respects the most important of all, 
and yet it is one in which we can begin to train the children at 
the earliest school age. Whenever we can get a child to pick 
up a banana peel from the sidewalk, to use chalk for writing 
on the blackboard but not for scribbling in improper places, 
or to keep the rubbish in the rubbish can, we are scoring a 
triumph for history-civics. 
   
-P-A-G-E-447
  HISTORY AND CIVICS 437 
Applying to the present what was vital in the past. — We 
can throw no light on the future that does not shine 
from the past. We keenly want to know what it was in the 
past that made a difference, that made the present what it is. 
If we can find this out, we shall have some hope of making 
the future what we want it to be. What bonds for the past 
shall we form in our pupils? What things shall be empha- 
sized in the history course? 
We can get at this best by asking of each nation or group 
that we study a few simple questions, somewhat as follows: 
1. Who are you? 
2. How are you? 
3. How did you get that way? 
4. How can you get more that way or less that way? 
“Who are you?” refers to blood, descent, nationality, 
number of people, relation to other peoples, ete. 
To answer the question, ‘‘How are you?” we should run 
through our outline of the material and the moral-social 
factors of human welfare, noting the distribution of prop- 
erty, health of the people, ideals, citizenship, education, and 
the rest. 
“How did you get that way?” is a question which we 
might well apply to the Germany of 1914. How did she 
get that way? It is said that American civilization is pro- 
ducing slums and millionaires, and that the quarrels of 
capital and labor are a serious menace. If this is true, how 
did we get that way? 
Naturally the question arises, How can we change things? 
How get more that way if conditions are good, less that way 
if they are bad? The good citizen wants light as to what 
makes a difference, so that he can make his mite of power 
count toward improvement.  
-P-A-G-E-448

438 THE CHILD’S MIND — 
Before we finish, we must apply these search questions to 
the world as a whole. What a motley, mongrel lot of people 
in it! What crazy behavior, self-conflicting and brutal! 
How did it get that way? Yet it has its good points. How 
shall it get more of some qualities and less of others? It is 
useless to say that the average citizen in a democracy has no 
influence on world affairs. | 
Has history been well written? — In many respects, his- 
tory has been well written, but too few historians have writ- 
ten with the purpose and the courage to throw prominently 
before us the big things in the past that have made a, differ- 
ence, so as to enable us to make more differences and guide 
our fate. 
Let us take a simple illustration from the facts of material 
civilization, the devising of the iron horseshoe about the 
fourth century of our era. Trivial as it may seem to nail a 
piece of iron to a horse’s foot, this invention was probably 
as important, in its day, as that of the automobile in these 
latter days; for as Shaler tells us, it completely adapted the 
animal ‘“‘to the conditions of our higher civilization by re- 
moving the one hindrance to its general use in the work of 
war and commerce.””! Yet so important an event is likely to 
receive less notice from our writers of history than the doings 
of a despot. | 
What does our boy or girl — or we ourselves — associate 
with the decade 1840-50? The Mexican War. Yet in 1846 
occurred something of much greater importance. It was 
the discovery of the anesthetic properties of ether and their 
application to surgery. Before that day the patient had 
simply to be strapped to the operating table and submit to 
the cutting and the pain. The discovery of the value of 
1 Nathaniel 8. Shaler — Domesticated Animals, p. 92.
-P-A-G-E-449
  HISTORY AND CIVICS 439 
ether saved vastly more lives than were lost in the Mexican 
War — just as Pasteur has saved more lives than Napoleon 
destroyed in all his wars. The average length of human life 
in the United States has increased from about fifteen years 
to about fifty years. ‘‘How did we get that way?” and 
“How can we get more that way?” 
Whether or not our historians have wished to create ill 
feeling toward England, myriads of children have left our 
common schools embittered against that country. Yet little 
is made of the fact that she and we have lived at peace with 
each other for over a century, and that we have both gotten 
into the way of leaving our long common boundary line un- 
fortified. How did we get that way? How can we get more 
that way — with all peoples? 
The position of women and children, the use of alcohol, 
graft in government, the value and increase of education — 
how is the child prepared by his study of history to think 
and vote on such things as these? No matter what minor 
issues (such as that of a protective tariff) the politicians 
may try to point attention to, we want our young voter, 
when we have educated him in history-civies, to runover in his 
mind his own outline of material and moral influences and 
keep big things to the front. In particular, so long as material 
conditions afford a reasonable foundation for the higher life, 
we ought, in my judgment, to concentrate on the moral- 
social side of civilization and see that our statesmen and 
office-holders do likewise. 
Less important bonds. — If the important things are those 
that have made a difference, then the unimportant are those 
which have not greatly affected either material or moral- 
social civilization. Probably we shall never all agree as 
to where to draw the line between the important and the
-P-A-G-E-450
  440 THE CHILD’S MIND 
unimportant. Some seemingly insignificant matter may be 
the key to a great situation, or may be valuable for the grip 
it has on the pupil’s interest. Martha Washington, at a 
ball given in her honor, wore homespun garments. What 
of it? She did it, so we are told, ‘‘as an example of economy 
to the women of the Revolution.”” And so the incident is 
not only interesting in itself, but throws a great deal of 
light on colonial war conditions. 
In general, our dangers are too many dates, and too many 
details of government and war. It does not matter precisely 
when most things happened — only that they happened — 
nor just which battle won the war. Wedo want to know what 
the people were fighting for, and who won. In general, 
history does not tell us enough about the living conditions 
of the common people, whether they were starving or thriv- 
ing, their health, home life, daily mode of living, education, 
and progress. 
Another group of bonds which, though important indeed 
to the advanced student, must be ruled out of the elemen- 
tary course, lies in the study of history as a science. Ele- 
mentary history is like ‘‘elementary science’’: it has not the 
rigid organization of science, nor does it assume that the 
pupil is to be taught to investigate everything for himself, 
seeking original facts and drawing original conclusions as the 
expert does. We must not trouble him much with matters 
that lie on the borderland of doubt, nor with our ‘‘external”” 
and “‘internal”’ evidences and criticisms. What we must do 
is to give him, from among those facts that are pretty thor- 
oughly established, what is most interesting and important 
for him to know, so far as he is able, at his development, to 
assimilate it, and to try to build up in him P hardy kind of 
historic-civic common sense. | 
 
-P-A-G-E-451
  HISTORY AND CIVICS 441 
What related responses are ready? — In studying history- 
civics, our pupil must respond to three kinds of fact. They 
are— 
1. The environment and its doings. 
2. People and their behavior. 
3. Human thoughts and feelings. 
Even a young child can appreciate much of the environ- 
ment and its doings, for there it is around him now; and 
the same is true of people and their behavior. He can follow 
us if we describe a storm, or Oliver Cromwell’s walking up 
to the throne and laying his hand on it. According to the 
Stanford-Binet tests, a six-year-old should comprehend and 
react to such situations as “house on fire,” etc., and a ten- 
year-old not only sees the absurdity in such descriptions as 
that of a road which “‘is down hill all the way to the city and 
down hill all the way back home,” but can read an ordinary 
brief account of a city fire and report on his reading quite 
accurately. 
Not until the child is twelve, however, is he expected to 
give even a conversational definition of such terms as “pity, 
“revenge,” “charity,” and ‘‘justice.” In other words, if one 
would understand fully the mental side of adult history, 
from simple wonder about “the great spirit” to the writing 
of Newton’s Principia, he must be an adult. What the 
younger child gets of it will be simple, feelingful and in 
high contrast, as when he reads that ‘‘the people loved the 
kind prince; but hated the cruel king.” 
Indications of a developing sense of time are found in the 
Binet tests for age nine, when the child is expected to give 
the present date at least approximately, and to name the 
months of the year. I am inclined to think that no one of 
us, child or adult, can feel remoteness in the past very
-P-A-G-E-452
  
  442 THE CHILD’S MIND 
‘keenly; but order of events is the important matter, vhether 
present or past. We want to know which came first, the 
preaching of Peter the Hermit or the Crusades, just as we 
want to know which comes first, the thunder or the light- 
ning. Such temporal ordering of events as is necessary for 
the understanding of the history of any country is probably 
possible for most children by the time they are ten years of 
age. | } 
As in so many other branches, we must censor our text- 
books for language difficulty. It is not enough that the 
words be simple and familiar. Their inclusive units, the 
phrases, sentences, and paragraphs, must form the sketch 
lines of historical pictures that are concrete and vivid, simple 
enough to be understood, and interesting enough ee 
Relation of the desired bonds. — There is danger that 
many of the desired bonds will be shapla and single, repre- 
senting isolated facts that each stand alone in the child’s 
brain like the spelling of unrelated words. One reason for 
this lies in the teaching of so much detail that we have no 
time left to discuss, to associate, to relate facts to each other. 
But time puts events in a series, and surely we should not 
do less for our pupil’s learning. Nese we ought always 
to keep one eye on the present, that series of | local, national, 
or universal events which make up the Now, and the other 
on that past series which we are studying, the events of 
Then, and never let a lesson go by without discovering what 
Now and Then have to do with each other. ‘‘Now-Then,” 
or “Then-Now,” should be our teaching slogan. In this 
way we shall not only help to “make the past real,” but we 
shall make it even more “‘real,” in the sense of more mean- 
ingful, than it was to those who a ed through it; for we 
shall see it in relation to how it all came out. They were like 
: |

-P-A-G-E-453
  HISTORY AND CIVICS 443 
soldiers who die in the struggle, whereas we have lived to 
witness the defeat and the triumph. 
In fact, I think this should be our great trunk line bond in 
teaching history for the purpose of the larger citizenship, 
this bond of Then-and-Now. It should stand out as the 
equation does as the organizing center of algebra, and the 
sentence as the organizing center of grammar. 
Other trunk line bonds appear in our type studies. Mas- 
sachusetts may be studied as the type of the New England 
Colony, Pennsylvania as the type of the Middle Colonies, 
etc., the rest being ‘‘the same only different.’ One battle 
may stand as a type for all the rest, and so we can shorten 
the war considerably — in our study of it. 
Inclusive units of various kinds appear. A date, perhaps 
an inclusive date, such as 1825-1830, may be made the 
center of association for a whole cluster of important events, 
thus saving the strain on the learner’s date memory. Topi- 
cal recitations compel the pupil to group like facts. Admin- 
istrations, ages and epochs, come in time to take on the 
group character, as when we speak of the age of Pericles, 
or the civilization of the Romans. We must be sure, how- 
ever, that the pupil has facts enough to make these group 
phrases mean something before we require him to put 
meaning into them. One of the most common forms of 
inclusive unit is that of the outline. Used properly, it is of 
the highest value. ' 
From sensori-motor to high level. — As we first study home 
geography and then pass from that to the geography of other 
places, so we should first study present home-civics and 
then pass from that to the history of other times and places. 
Indeed, geography takes one of the first steps for us, for

  How study home history-civics? — Our standard geogra-

learn where our grandfathers or other ancestors came 
from, why they came here, how many there are of us, and 
the like. Next, ‘‘How are we?”’ Here we take an inventory 
of our “Factors of human welfare,’ material and moral- 
social. Are there property and money enough to go round? 
Are we progressive? Have we paved our streets, lighted 
them well, and so on? Are we healthy? Have we good 
schools, a public library, good town officers? Are we pull- 
ing together for the common good? 
And how did we get this way, — whatever way it is? 
What natural resources, what industries, what public spirited 
men or what selfish rascals have brought us to what we are? 
Finally, when the children are mature enough for it, let us 
consider what we can do to get more this way or less this 
way. We need not be too dogmatic, but can allow plenty 
of room for freedom of opinion and of discussion. 
Expressing home history in symbols.— When one of us 
reads a page of history, looks at historical maps and pictures, 
or goes through a museum, he must form, as best he can from 
these symbols — print, picture, map, relic, and sculpture— 
a picture of the past. As the child needs to express home 
geography before he can interpret foreign geography, so he 
needs to produce a little home history as a means to inter- 
preting the history that others have produced. If all the 
members of a class write up some such event as a political 
rally, and perhaps collect related pictures of men, buildings, 
etc., they will understand very well why histories disagree 
or vary even to the pictures. 
Introducing but one difficulty at a time in the history 
course. — Just what is the ideal grading for a course in 
history is a problem not yet solved. One plan very com- 
.
-P-A-G-E-456
446 THE CHILD’S MIND 
monly adopted is to devote the first three grades to study 
of home and community activities and problems, the observ- 
ance and meaning of holidays, and the presentation of the 
problems of food, clothing, and shelter as illustrated in the 
life of primitive man, especially tree dwellers, cave men, 
Eskimos and Indians. Grades four and five are occupied 
with a sketchy history of the United States, from 
exploration and colonization down to the present. In grade 
six is given a sketchy history of Europe, with selected topics 
from the life stories of Greece, Rome, England and other 
countries, all designed largely to furnish a background for 
the further study of American history. In grades seven 
and eight, the history of the United States is gone over 
again, this time less as a story and with more attention to 
cause and effect. 
With the coming of the junior high school, the most 
appropriate arrangement, as it seems to me, is the study of 
history-civics as one branch through the first six grades, 
followed in the next three by two branches, the first being 
history and the second consisting of other social studies, such 
as civics and the elements of economics. The essentials of 
’ United States history should be finished in grade seven, to 
be followed by more detailed study of it by those who go 
through high school. Grades eight and nine should present 
a sketch of world history both for those who are to leave 
school and those who continue, showing how man has 
struggled to make a happy home here on earth by conquer- 
ing his environment and subduing himself. The young 
citizen ought to be left finally face to face with present 
problems and the question of what to do next. 
Readiness. — It is not difficult to rouse interest in history. 
It is often the boy’s best branch, and among children gen- 
   
-P-A-G-E-457
  
HISTORY AND CIVICS 447 
erally it stands by vote near the top of the list of favorites. 
We must take care not to chill this love by an unfit text- 
book — for the textbook is one of the strongest influences 
in the teaching of history — nor by making the subject too 
dry because of its separation, in ideas or language, from 
the pupil’s experience. 
Some of the methods and devices that have proved most 
effective as aids to readiness are story and biography, includ- 
ing accounts of local characters and events; the celebration 
of holidays; the use of diagrams and pictures, whether found 
in textbook or historical album or brought out by stereoscope 
or lantern; the viewing of models and relics, collected in 
a school museum or found elsewhere; historical excursions; 
the writing of letters, diaries, news, etc., as if of the time 
being studied; referring to source books, to old newspapers, 
original letters, diaries, and so on; dramatizing historical 
scenes, and learning and reciting famous speeches; side 
readings, not only of history proper, but of novels, 
essays and poems of historical spirit; and other problems and 
projects of a suitable nature. 
Sometimes the civic side of the study receives a special 
stimulus through the requiring of certain practical achieve- 
ments for the passing of the work, such as the use of correct 
language, good conduct at social gatherings, and codperative 
participation in school organizations, or community work, 
or both. 
Exercise: the beginnings. — Suppose we are in Honesdale, 
county seat of the extreme northeastern county of Pennsyl- 
vania. Our pupils have learned from geography what the 
people are doing and why they are doing it. We can make 
the transition into history by raising the question, Who are 
we? Have our people always lived here? If not, where did  
-P-A-G-E-458
  
448 THE CHILD’S MIND 
they come from? The children discover that most of their 
families have lived here for years, but that a few hae come 
more lately from ‘‘the old country” or elsewhere. Many 
came from a place called New England, and there are 
numerous stories of ancestors who fought in a big war called 
“the Revolution.” We find that there is a strong ‘‘D. A. R.” 
in town. What does this mean? How many of us are there 
in Honesdale? Ete. 
Next, How are we? There is quite a bit of money here. 
There are comfortable homes, and we have several banks 
that hold between five and six million dollars for people who 
live in and near here. We have no street cars, but we have 
little need for them; and we have some of the prettiest parks 
and finest playgrounds that can be found anywhere. We 
are healthy. Bad diseases like influenza do not sweep through 
here as in some places; but there are things we can do to make 
us more healthy. What are they? We have very good 
schools, and we are making them better. The streets are 
clean. Who keeps them so? Can I help? People call this 
“the Maple City.’”’ Who planted all these maple trees? 
How long ago? What is it that kills some of them? How 
can we stop that? Should we plant more trees? 
In due time comes the question, ‘“‘How did we get this 
way?’’ And the first answer is, ‘‘Coal.”’ But there is no 
coal under us. No, but this was once the best way from 
the Lackawanna coal fields to the New York markets. We 
go to see the old road bed of the gravity railroad, and the 
tall chimney of the stationary engine that drew its cars up 
the grade. Here where you see this big black bank was the 
largest coal storage (‘‘the biggest pile of coal’) in the world. 
Two million tons of coal went through here every year. At 
this point it was loaded onto canal boats. There are the
-P-A-G-E-459
HISTORY AND CIVICS 449 
square-looking banks of the old canal, with paths still at the 
side for the mules that pulled the boats. Right here ran 
the first locomotive that ever was run in America, the 
Stourbridge Lion. And see, here is its picture in one of our 
newspapers. Some day, when you go to Washington, the 
capital of our country, you can see, in a big museum there 
  Fig. 33. The Stourbridge Lion, the first locomotive to turn a wheel in 
America. It first took the tracks at Honesdale, Pa., August 8, 1829. 
(the Smithsonian), all that is left of the Stourbridge Lion.— 
It was largely the shipping of coal that made our town 
what it is. 
Finally, when the pupils are old enough to think on the 
matter, we shall ask how we can go on growing and prosper- 
ing, now that the coal goes by a different route. We must 
bring industries here, work to develop the county agri- 
culturally, ete. — And all this is but a specimen fragment of 
what we shall hope to accomplish in our history-civies class. 
 
-P-A-G-E-460
  450 THE CHILD’S MIND 
our town was very different. How we wish the school children 
or somebody else had kept a record of the way it grew, with 
pictures of persons and places. Here is a letter written when 
the Stourbridge Lion ran, telling how flags flew and people 
cheered when it started, and some careless boys set off a 
cannon and injured one of their number. Let us write 
the history of what happens here this year, for the people 
to read a hundred years from now. What shall we tell about? 
How shall we tell it? Shall we put in letters? Diaries? 
Pictures? Can we climb to the top of Irving Cliff and take 
a picture of the whole town? Do you know of anything 
that you think will be a relic or a valuable model in a hundred 
years? Let us put in the things that will tell people i in other 
towns what is going on here. And when we get it all done, 
we will give it to the Wayne Historical Society. Perhaps 
they will keep it more than a hundred years. 
Textbooks and teaching. — Having written some History; 
we are ready to interpret what is written by others. In the 
teaching of history in the United States, the textbook fre- 
quently determines the course of study, and usually has 
much to do with the method as well. No teacher should 
feel ashamed to ‘‘follow the book.’’ Book courses in history, 
with appropriate recitation and discussion of facts, leave 
in the minds of pupils a very solid growth of historical fact 
and feeling. But the teacher should be ashamed if her 
pupils do not learn how to use the book. To see that they 
do learn how, she had better spend with them, especially 
at the beginning of the course, a number of study-recitation 
periods in which the art of getting the big facts from pages 
into brain cells is taught by the tandem method. 
Following our chronological study, or perhaps along with Writing history for the future. — A hundred years or a ago, 
  
 
-P-A-G-E-461
  HISTORY AND CIVICS 451 
it, should go the study of outstanding topics. Here the 
facts are pulled out of their time order and grouped about 
such heads as Slavery, the Tariff, Party History, Inven- 
tions, Education. Some teachers make a list of outstand- 
ing topics and appoint, at the beginning of the course, a little 
specialist in each one, whose duty it is to collect and report, 
as the course proceeds, all important facts relating to his 
specialty. Of course these topics should be adapted to the 
children, and so chosen as to bring about an application of 
their learning to present life. 
Teaching democracy by the tandem method. — All our 
study of history-civies should lead to enlightened action. 
How can we guide the nerve currents repeatedly along the 
right paths? 
The teacher of the olden time, like the ruler of olden times, 
was an autocrat, and was expected to be. The difference 
was that the teacher’s autocracy was expected to be a 
benevolent one. The modern teacher is more democratic. 
She does not throw away her power; but she regards herself 
as group leader rather than group boss, and tries to get 
her pupils to participate in making the school a good school. 
They discuss problems, serve on committees, plan programs, 
form clubs, run their own meetings, perhaps, or even engage 
in pupil government. The danger has sometimes been that 
when the pupils began to participate, the teacher felt it her 
duty to withdraw and let them go alone, lest she destroy 
their initiative. But the airman does not withdraw sud- 
denly and leave his learner to manage the craft alone. 
Safety first! The teacher is there to prevent errors and ex- 
ceptions, the exercise of wrong paths. Teacher (or teachers) 
and pupils should be citizens together, plan together, vote 
together, carry on together. Gradually, the teacher will try
-P-A-G-E-462
    452 THE CHILD’S MIND 
to see to it that she becomes as useless as possible, bringing 
the pupils up point by point to their highest reach of demo- 
cratic responsibility and efficiency in action. 
Making practice like performance: attitude and morale.— 
Why has the world failed in so many cases to solve its 
problems? Because people (1) have indulged their impulses 
and narrow herd feelings instead of steadfastly maintaining 
the larger attitude of good will, and (2) have failed to see 
their problems afar off and find the right remedy while 
there was time. 
To cure the first of these troubles, we must cultivate 
morale. Morale is unity of feeling that leads to ut of 
action. It is our feelings that determine what we do, and 
it is one of the teacher’s largest tasks to educate these 
feelings. Democracy is just good feeling — backed up with 
intelligence, of course — applied to civic affairs. 
It is a highly educative undertaking to try to tee into 
the feelings of the past; for we can see that many past 
passions have been very foolish, and that the tek senti- 
ment is a kind of large-minded attachment to the whole of 
things. We can bring our pupils most vividly into the moods 
of the past by referring to the present. ‘‘Why so much 
excitement about ‘Andy’ Jackson?” Because it was a case 
of ‘the common people” against the “upper classes.” How 
shall we decide just who are “the common people” and who 
“the upper classes.” 
One of the best exercises a pupil (or any one of us) can 
set himself is that of maintaining, in committee work, in 
class or other elections, in the face of slurs and misunder- 
standings, perhaps, a serene and whole-hearted attachment 
to the larger cause, whether his opponent does so or not. 
The teacher should be a living exponent of the old motto,   
 
-P-A-G-E-463
  HISTORY AND CIVICS 453 
In certis, unitas. In dubits, libertas. In omnibus, caritas. 
“Tn things certain, unity. In things doubtful, liberty. In 
all things, charity, kindness.” By her attitude and exhorta- 
tions she can do much to determine the quality of future 
citizenship. 
Gradually, we must try to enlarge the pupil’s morale 
group, so that his unity of feeling is not bounded by his 
family, or school or town, or even his country, but by noth- 
ing less than all humanity. After all, good will is catching. 
In time we shall induce all men everywhere to adopt the 
motto, In omnibus, caritas. 
Making practice like performance: problems and pro- 
jects. — How do we perform? We face ‘‘current events,” 
and from time to time we have to do something about them. 
Studying history ought to mean facing the current events 
of the past and trying to decide what you would do about 
them. We ask of primitive man our search questions, 
Who are you? and How are you? and find that he had no 
clothing, no tools, no fire. Children, what would you do in 
such a case? The Boy Scout is given a similar problem 
when he is required to ‘‘make fire’ without matches. 
Granted fire, but no matches, how would you keep it? 
How did our colonial ancestors keep theirs? Have you ever 
heard of “borrowing fire”? What does curfew mean? 
What problems and projects can we find about our room, 
our school, our town? How can we take a hand in solving 
them or putting them through? 
If there were slaves in our land and you wanted to free 
them, how might you do it? How did England do it? How 
did we finally do it? 
Coming on up to the present: If the world is full of fight 
and we want to stop it, how can we? 
 
-P-A-G-E-464
  
  454 THE CHILD’S MIND | 
Effect. — As the problem of readiness is a minor one in the 
teaching of history, so also is that of effect. To know our 
local, state, national and planetary past is in itself a pleasure 
to most minds, — so much so that history is often classed 
as literature. Further, by the method now happily becoming 
more common, of applying historical facts constantly to 
present problems, the pupil rightly feels that he is getting 
something which enables him to take part in the conversa- 
tion, in the deliberation, and in the action of home, school, 
and community. An interested and historically minded 
teacher, a good textbook with suitable side readings, with 
lessons carefully assigned and clearly developed in an atmos- 
phere of social class spirit, will leave the pupil ready for 
more. 
Testing essential bonds. — In preparing our tests, let us 
make sure that what we require is ‘essential,’ something 
that made a difference, and that it has been brought out 
plainly in our daily work. Preferably, we shall choose those 
events that bear some striking and valuable relation to 
present life. In upper classes, this finding the bearing of 
past events on present life may be one of the very best 
points to test, — the difficulty being, of course, that there 
may be many cases in which no one can give a certain and 
standardized answer. 
Attempts have been made to set up measuring scales for 
history teaching,' but the subject results in the forming of 
so many and so varied bonds, with such complex relation- 
ships involving a large fraction of the whole personality at 
once in the way of judgment, attitude, morale, and action, 
1 Standard tests in history can be obtained from the Bureau of Codperative 
Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minn., and from the Bureau 
of Publications, Teachers College, Columbia University, New York City. 
   
-P-A-G-E-465
  HISTORY AND CIVICS 455 
that standardized measurement of the complete product is 
very difficult. 
After all, the big test for our little graduate in history- 
civics is how he practices the subject, what morale he main- 
tains, and what deeds he does as citizen of school, community, 
nation, world. 
CLASS EXERCISE 
As a student of education, you are no doubt interested in its 
history, and the application of historical facts to present educa- 
tional problems. 
Make a list of what the members of the class regard as the largest 
present-day problems of a school system, such as purpose of educa- 
tion, program of studies, methods of teaching, financing the schools, 
school administration. 
How have these matters been met in the past? What light do 
past events throw on their solution now? Try to discover general 
trends; for example, toward or away from centralization of author- 
ity. 
If desired, definite tasks may be assigned in advance. Also, 
the work may be limited to one phase of education, or one period. 
Parker’s History of the Modern Elementary School Curriculum, 
Finney’s The American Public School, and Cubberley’s Public 
Education in the United States are suggested as texts on which to 
base such assignments. 
Follow this with a discussion of the probable value of some such 
plan in the teaching of history generally. 
FOR FURTHER STUDY 
1. What use do you think should be made of current events in 
the teaching of history? What is the best means by which pupils 
can get the current news? 
2. Show how history can be correlated with the other branches. 
3. Do you approve of the way you were taught history in the 
elementary school? Why or why not? 
 
-P-A-G-E-466
  456 THE CHILD’S MIND 
4. Did you learn, in connection with your high school or other 
advanced history, to read the newspapers? What importance 
would you attach to this question as a test of the success of a 
history course? 
5. “T said, ‘How is old Ireland and how does she stand?’” In 
the old song, which of our search questions is thus presented? 
What other questions should be asked in order to find out com- 
pletely the condition of the country and what to do about that 
condition? 
6. What, in your judgment, is the value of historical tables 
showing, in parallel columns, what was going on in the same period 
in different countries or in various lines of development? Why? 
7. What do you think are the largest problems the world now 
has to solve? Run through ‘The Chief Factors of Human Wel- 
fare” and see if this helps you to discover these problems. 
8. How is the world more likely to secure ‘‘ progress through 
socialization,” by working on adult minds, or on the younger 
generation as it comes up? What importance do you attach to 
schools as a means to such progress? 
9. Mention some of the things, such as a visit to a museum or 
historic ground, which have helped to make the past more real. 
What things have made the present most real? 
10. Discuss the place and value of maps in the teaching of 
history.

  CHAPTER XXII 
LirpRATURE 
I have always thought that the chief object of education was to awaken 
the spirit, and that inasmuch as a literature whenever it has touched its great 
and higher notes was an expression of the spirit of mankind, the best induction 
into education was to feel the pulses of humanity which had beaten from age 
to age through the universities of men who had penetrated to the secrets of the 
human spirit. — Wooprow Witson. 
Well, as to education, the newspapers are correct; I never went to school 
more than six months in my life. But as you say, this must be a product of 
culture in some form. . . . I can say this, that among my earliest recollec- 
tions I remember how, when a mere child, I used to get irritated when any- 
body talked to me in a way I could not understand. I don’t think I ever got 
angry at anything else in my life. ... I can remember going to my little bed- 
room, after hearing the neighbors talk of an evening with my father, and 
spending no small part of the night walking up and down, trying to make out 
what was the exact meaning of some of their —to me — dark sayings. 
I could not sleep... until I had caught it ... until I put it in language 
plain enough, as I thought, for any boy I knew to comprehend. . . I am 
never easy now, when I am handling a thought, till I have bounded it 
North, and bounded it South, and bounded it East, and bounded it West.

Exercisn. — You are going to study, in class, with a teacher, 
some piece of literature. What is likely to be the purpose of 
yourself and of most other members of the class in taking up such 
a study? How would you like to have the teacher, or class and 
teacher, proceed in choosing the piece to be studied? Describe 
briefly the method which you think would enable all to get most 
out of it. How many or what words should be looked up in the 
dictionary? What allusions chased down? How many figures 
of speech catalogued and explained? What historical and envi- 
ronmental details should be brought out? When, if at all, would 
you care to study the life of the author? — What relation have all 
these things to the purpose in view? 
What light does this throw on the teaching of literature to 
children?

-P-A-G-E-469
  LITERATURE 459 
What is literature? — Literature is that kind of writing 
which appeals chiefly to the feelings, and especially those 
feelings which are universal, common to all. Because of 
this universal appeal, it chooses a subject of wide interest, 
such as the adventurer far from home; or the lover separated 
from his sweetheart; and because it seeks to rouse feeling, 
it presents this general theme in the form of a concrete, 
vivid, individual picture, such as that of Robinson Crusoe, 
or the lover in ‘‘The Raven.” As further means to rousing 
feeling, it uses words that are polished and smooth-flowing, 
and often striking, either in themselves or in their phrasing; 
it builds on the bonds of deep and fundamental experiences 
in the reader; and it makes much use of imagination, fre- 
quently causing to shine out before us ideals which chal- 
lenge to achievement. 
Take Longfellow’s “Excelsior” as a sample. Here is, in a 
fashion, the whole human adventure, the adventure of fol- 
lowing an ideal. It appeals to all mankind. It puts this 
adventure in the form of a concrete, vivid, individual pic- 
ture, that of the heroic mountain climber who resists temp- 
tation and pushes forward. Its language is polished, smooth- 
flowing, striking: Longfellow does not say, “It was getting 
dark rapidly,” but “‘The shades of night were falling fast.” 
It builds on fundamental experiences — the lights of home, 
the endearments of love. Much use is made of imagination, 
finding its climax in the almost supernatural voice that 
came “‘like a falling star.” As for ideals, the poem is ideal- 
ism itself, the ideal of having ideals. 
Not every piece of literature embodies all these points; 
but every piece that is worthy of the name exemplifies some 
of them, and makes them prominent. 
“We must have more bread an’ less whiskey in this  
-P-A-G-E-470
  460 THE CHILD’S MIND 
house,” said Molly to Pat. “Bread is the shtaff o’ loife, ye 
know.” ‘‘Yis,” said Pat, ‘bread is the shtaff o’ loife, but 
whiskey is loife itself!’ We cannot approve of Pat’s senti- 
ment about whiskey, but his statement is very nearly true 
of literature: other branches are the staff of life, but liter- 
ature is life itself. It is life projected into words. It is not 
only the verbal re-living of life, but the re-creating of life. 
For we have not only realists who paint life as it is — and 
get no further — but we have writers who take the mundane 
elements of our daily existence and recombine them so as 
to picture that better world we should like to live in, and 
which we can live in if we will all do our bit to produce it. 
Situation and response: attitude. — In general, the situ- 
ation is living; and the response is living better. Literature 
transforms us by the renewing of our minds. 
Let us make this more definite. We have seen that litera- 
ture aims to rouse feeling. Well, then, it is the duty of 
literature to shape the feelings, to help educate the whole 
emotional and affective nature. We want our pupil to honor 
his father and his mother, to love his country and all hu- 
manity as fast as he can grow up to it, and to feel an aversion 
to sneaking, bullying, cruelty, lying, and unfair play of all 
sorts. The school has not done enough for the feelings. It 
has worked largely on the assumption that if you give a child 
ideas he will put the power into them and carry them out; 
whereas a much better assumption is, that if you arouse 
desires, ideals, purposes, in the heart of a child, he will him- 
self find or make the outfit of ideas necessary to carry out 
and realize them. 
But feelings do not stand alone in the mind. We feel 
about something, a death, an election, and so on, and that 
something takes the form of an idea. Literature, then, must 
 
-P-A-G-E-471
  LITERATURE 461 
have its framework of ideas, though its final aim is fixed 
on feeling. Now, that big framework of ideas one has of the 
universe and his relations to it constitutes his “philosophy 
of life.” Is the universe a dead machine or a live personality? 
Is man an unlucky accident, perhaps a bubble on the stream 
of time, or the climax of ages of planning, a living soul of 
infinite possibilities? Is moral civilization to be preferred 
to material? And does it pay to live morally? Our philoso- 
phy of life makes a world of difference with the way we live, 
happily or unhappily, by the straight road or the crooked. 
This philosophy of life is built up in us bit by bit as a deposit 
of daily living, and largely as a result of the literature we 
read. : 
Situation and response: action. — Literature, like all other 
learning, should start from life and come back to life. It 
must be practical and idealistic, both. If, from reading it, 
we get dreamer’s disease, complicated with paralysis of the 
will, our last state may be worse than our first. If the hero- 
ism of the ‘‘penny dreadful’? does not make the boy a bit 
more heroic, then it is dreadful; and if the tears we shed 
over our pathetic heroine do not make us more sympathetic, 
then our heroine has only led us into a flirtation that leaves 
us less likely than before to love our neighbor as ourselves. 
But in general the result does show in action. We all feel 
how dangerous it is to children’s conduct to expose them to 
unethical literature; by similar reasoning, it would seem 
that there must be at least a little likelihood of their catch- 
ing goodness by being exposed to it. Traits often lie dor- 
mant till stirred by some stimulus from without, and litera- 
ture may furnish that stimulus. A child may imitate more 
strongly the character in the book than he does any char- 
acter he knows outside of it.

    462 THE CHILD’S MIND 
Literature may be read for pleasure, truly, and much of 
it should be. To teach our youth to spend their leisure with 
good books, even for pure pleasure, is to win a great triumph 
over the impure pleasures that might otherwise fill the void. 
But to cut the connection between literature and life by 
continual reading for pleasure only is to ruin, at length, both 
the literature and the life. The teacher of literature has, 
in general, the same responsibility as the teacher of history- 
civies, and that is to teach his pupils how to answer with 
deeds the question, What does this mean in terms of our 
present-day life, and how can we put it into practice? 
Stimuli and reactions. — When an author writes a piece of 
literature, he proceeds from experience to words: he must 
(1) conceive a purpose, get ideas, get them into order (to 
form his outline or plot), and (2) get words, and get them 
into order (in phrases, sentences, etc.). But the learner who 
reads this literature must form word-to-experience bonds: 
he must (1) ‘“‘get”’ the words, understand them in idiomatic 
order, grouped as they are to form phrases, figures of speech, 
etc., (2) get the ideas one by one as they are pictured forth, 
and get them in order, so that they compose, in the end, a 
unified picture, or interpretation, with a resulting feeling 
for the piece as a whole. The pupil who said ‘ ‘The shades 
of night were falling fast’ means the people were pulling 
down their window curtains in a hurry,” did not get from 
that group of words the picture which Longfellow intended 
he should; and the teacher who explained that the meaning 
of the piece as a whole is, “‘ Don’t bite off more than you can 
chew,” failed in the end of getting the one deep meaning of 
the whole thing. 
The stimulus, then, is a piece of literature, and it is well 
if the children can help choose it. The response is working 
 
-P-A-G-E-473
  
LITERATURE 463 
out its meaning, with dictionary and all other available 
helps, until the learner has gotten the feeling which the 
author had when he conceived the piece and which he meant 
to rouse in his reader. Since the voice (with appropriate 
facial expression) is the great carrier of feeling, the best 
immediate schoolroom response is that of good oral reading. 
But we want our pupils to seek literature and pursue it 
long after school days are over, and so we shall try. to secure 
other responses also, such as committing to memory at 
least a few of the most appealing lines; reading at home as 
well as at school, perhaps forming the fifteen-minutes-a- 
day habit; increasing vocabulary and giving conversation a 
wholesome literary trend; buying good books, and if neces- 
sary sacrificing a little for them; seeking literature in news- 
paper, periodical, and books; and learning to discriminate 
between the good and the bad in letters. 
Bonds not to build. — Whatever contributes to the feeling 
that is the aim of our study, and which author and teacher 
are partners in producing, has a place in our program; what- 
ever conflicts with it should be eyed with suspicion and 
probably omitted. We need not trouble ourselves about the 
multitudinous bonds involved in knowing the history of 
literature, or the lives of authors, or even many of their 
works, until our pupils show some sign of wanting these 
things. It is not our object to make them sophisticated so 
that they can refer in learned way to this author or that, or 
pursue their friends with that sometimes trying question, 
“Have you read so-and-so?”’ Our ideal is rather that of a 
little book well filled, a little literature well tilled, a little 
citizen well willed. 
Then there is what may almost be called the original sin 
in the teaching of literature, cutting up its dead body and
-P-A-G-E-474
  464 THE CHILD’S MIND 
wiring its skeleton and losing its soul. Outlines may help, 
but we must get the substance, the sentiment. Parsing and 
syntax may have some place, but they must keep their 
place. Hairbreadth discriminations may be necessary 
sometimes, but they must not spoil the hairbreadth escape. 
Figures of speech must not loom up so as to obscure the 
figure of the hero. We may sometimes have to build a com- 
plex enginery of ideas, but we must not forget to put in the 
explosive fluid and apply the spark. It is so easy to be 
intellectual merely, when we ought to be spiritual and feel- 
ingful, and should be leading our children into the highest 
sentiments they are capable of. 
What responses are ready? — Reviewing a bit, we find 
that a child, in learning literature, must respond by feeling; 
must form concrete, vivid mental pictures; master beautiful, 
striking language; have ‘‘fundamental experiences” on tap; 
use imagination; and form ideals. We can sum this all up 
in two comprehensive questions: How much has he had of 
language? How much has he had of living? 
The question of language mastery is a very acute one in 
the early grades — for the reading period should be occupied 
mainly with literature, and not merely with reading matter, 
from the day the child enters school until he leaves it. For- 
tunately, our makers of child literature are growing more 
careful in this respect. The stories are clothed in words of 
limited number, words selected from the list of those in 
most common use, and carefully graded as to difficulty. 
Ear bonds and mouth bonds for all or nearly all of the 
words used are likely to be found ready made. In the 
early grades, the child’s vocabulary should broaden his 
reading; in the later ones, his reading should broaden his 
vocabulary. 
   
-P-A-G-E-475
LITERATURE 465 
  “How much has he had of living?” The situation here is 
much like the one we found in history. To interpret either 
history or literature completely, one must have had experi- 
ence with (1) the material environment and its doings, 
(2) people and lower animals and their behavior, and (3) 
thoughts and feelings in all their complexity. If the first 
two are kept reasonably simple and expressed in simple 
language, they trouble but little. It is the third that throws 
up the difficulties. For example, children cannot appreciate 
adult love stories; and most of them, I believe, cannot un- 
derstand why there should ever be such a thing as a tragedy 
in print. The thoughts and feelings they like best to find in 
their stories are those elemental ones that flow from their 
dominant instincts, and so from such activities as eating, 
playing, going to parties; exploring and adventuring, as 
about a farm; playing pranks, triumphing by might or by 
right. It is no wonder that the animal story, in the first 
and second grades, is the favorite story of all. 
Relation of the desired bonds. — We can see at a glance 
that literature, as we pass from the simple to the complex, 
requires bonds in every kind of relation, and especially in- 
clusive units of infinite variety. To put a long sentence be- 
fore a child and ask him to tell what it means is very like 
placing before him the numerous pieces of some machine 
and requiring him to assemble them and make the thing 
run. You can appreciate this the better if you will recall 
your efforts to translate some difficult piece of Latin or other 
foreign language. You realized very keenly that every word 
has its bond. If any word bond was lacking, you were em- 
barrassed to that extent — you did not know what to do 
with that part of the machine. But the stronger word bonds 
began to assert themselves, sometimes too strongly, so that
-P-A-G-E-476
466 THE CHILD’S MIND 
your story went wrong and made no sense with what had 
come previously. You tried again, gave some of them more 
prominence than before and others less, and finally fitted 
all the pieces together harmoniously. 
Children have to ‘‘translate” their English in much the 
same way. Professor Thorndike gave the following to some 
fifth and sixth grade children, who were directed to read it 
and then write the answers to some questions, re-reading it 
as often as they needed to: 
Nearly fifteen thousand of the city’s workers joined in the parade on 
September seventh, and passed before two hundred thousand cheering spec- 
tators. There were workers of both sexes in the parade, though the men far 
outnumbered the women. 
  The first question to be answered was, ‘What is said 
about the number of persons who marched in the parade?”’ 
Some of the answers were: ‘‘two hundred people” ; ‘‘eighteen 
thousand”; “200,000”; ‘‘maybe No. 12”; “‘a very great 
deal’; ‘‘the men were more than the women’’; ‘“‘the men 
were far ahead of the women”; “they marched nice’’; 
“there was a lot of floats’; ‘‘the people are killed by the 
war’’; ‘the meddles”; ‘“Irish.’’ ! 
Thorndike elsewhere states that — 
Understanding a paragraph is like solving a problem in mathematics. 
It consists in selecting the right elements of the situation and putting them 
together in the right relations, and also with the right amount of weight or 
influence or force for each. The mind is assailed as it were by every word 
in the paragraph. It must select, repress, soften, emphasize, correlate and 
organize, all under the influence of the right mental set or purpose or de- 
mand. #

  LITERATURE 467 
If children have so much difficulty in forming, from simple 
language, a concrete picture of what actually happened, 
they will stumble still more when they come to the con- 
structs of imagination, the building of ideals, and the ever 
loftier flight of the feelings. 
One of the most important lessons we can learn in the 
teaching of literature is to recover from that great blunder 
of the past, from the days of the New England Primer right 
on down — the giving to children of selections for reading 
which we think superficially must be good for them because 
we have ourselves found them edifying. We are even a 
little worse than those officious friends who insist on lend- 
ing us their book and compelling us to read it because they 
“enjoyed it so much.” 
From sensori-motor to high level bonds. — The course in 
this subject begins when baby lives his literature at home, 
when father is a horse or a bear and the little one a rider or 
a hunter. A much higher grade has been reached when he 
sits or lies with bright eyes fixed far away and brain busy 
forming pictures fast while mother sings or tells some tale 
of wonder. After a time, he takes his third degree. He 
begins to fabricate, to babble original childish stories, and so 
takes his place among the ranks of authors! 
This cycle of experience should be repeated when school 
days begin. Keep life, especially at first, well ahead of 
literature. Shakespeare lived deeply, or he could not have 
written so well. He got a wealth of experience in Stratford 
and in the coffee houses of London, listened to many a tale 
from tongue and book, acted and saw much acting, and so 
produced his wonderful plays. Our pupils may go on a 
nature study trip or perhaps a number of them. We may 
then read or tell them the stories of some of John Bur-
-P-A-G-E-478
    468 THE CHILD’S MIND 
roughs’ nature study excursions. Can we not then write 
up a trip of our own, truthful as to the facts of nature but 
fanciful as to plot or incident? Even if we do not succeed - 
so very well, the effort will make us appreciate such poems 
as ‘Robin Redbreast,”’ “‘The Brook,” ‘The Death of the 
Flowers,” and “To a Waterfowl.”’ Just as the writing of a 
chapter in home geography or present-day history for others 
to read helps us to interpret the geography of many miles 
away and the history of many years ago, so the preparation 
of a piece of personal, home literature helps us to appreciate 
the literary product of other minds. 
In every case, the first question is, Have my pupils had 
enough experience with life to understand and care about 
this selection? If not, do not try to teach it to them. If 
they have, the next question is, Just what experiences have 
they had that will enable me to put this literature into 
terms of their living? 
Which bonds first? — When we have learned how to- 
grade life and conduct, we shall know just how to grade 
literature. 
One difficulty is that if we analyze for the essentials, 
we find them all present from the first. For instance, the 
essentials of a good story (roughly speaking) are purpose, 
plot, character, and climax; yet all these are found, in some 
form, in the simplest story for the tiniest tots. The difference 
between the adult story and the juvenile is that these essen- 
tials become more complex in the more mature literature. 
In particular, more traits of character are brought out and 
these more finely shaded, and experiences are expressed — 
especially changes in character under the influence of for- 
tune, friends, and foes — which lie beyond the children’s 
understanding.
-P-A-G-E-479
  LITERATURE 469 
Yet we can do something in the way of discovering a prin- 
ciple of grading. The great trunk line bond in all our best 
literature is personal experience. There must be such a 
character, or such experience, that the reader can in some 
measure identify himself with him, or it, or both. Here is 
the reason for so much personification of animals, of flowers 
and vegetables, and even of inanimate things, such as the 
dish that ran away with the spoon. In the beginning, of 
course, the character and the experience must be very sim- 
ple. Each personality may have but one outstanding trait, 
as the greedy pig, or the cheerful robin; but a story without 
a personality of any kind in it would be just no story at all. 
These personal experience bonds, then, are the ones that 
can be made easiest and most interesting for the learner, 
that are bound to occur most frequently, and that are sure 
to prepare the way for the greatest number of bonds to be 
formed later. 
Various efforts have been made to assign to the different 
grades the general type of literature, or even the specific 
selections, which seem most suitable; ! but while these are 
good for suggestive purposes, Minerva must wish that each 
teacher had the time and the literary means to choose what 
is good for her grade. If she can tell what traits are appear- 
ing in her pupils, as home love, love of adventure, of mystery, 
etc., and can find literature that expresses those traits, she will 
be a good guide. 
Readiness. — As we review our sources of readiness, it is 
easy to conclude that, other things being equal, that pupil 
will have most longing for literature who is brought up

  470 THE CHILD’S MIND 
among books and book talk, who brings a fresh and healthy 
mind to the work, whose teacher is enthusiastic about liter- 
ature and full of faith as to what can be accomplished 
through it, whose reading is skillfully chosen and not over- 
done, who finds the reading period a happy one because of 
the way the work is conducted, and who is inspired by the 
vision of the fruit he is going to find among the leaves. 
Chiefly to be accented are the right literature and the right 
teacher — and the right teacher is one who loves literature. 
Among the destroyers of readiness 1 we find what may be 
called ‘cheap reading,’ such as the comic supplement of 
certain newspapers, some of the juvenile series, and poor 
reading texts in school; the common prejudice among par- 
ents and others against imaginative literature and in favor 
of books of information and morality lectures; the limited 
ownership of books; and “‘the passing of the practice of 
reading aloud about the fireside.” 
To what extent the moving picture and the radiophone are 
supplanting the book, and to what extent they can serve as 
substitutes for it, we are unable to say. They ought to be 
able allies. 
Exercise. — As to exercise, there are two fundamentals. 
The first is that the teacher shall have had a good course in 
literature, or failing that, shall study thoroughly for himself 
whatever he has to teach. The second is that, in teaching 
it, he shall do as he would be done by. If there is any 
place where we should forsake all rules of pedagogy and just 
do what a sensible person would naturally do with a group 
of children in the chimney corner at home, that place is in 
the literature class.

erature for Children.

LITERATURE 471 
How should we like to be “done by” if we were going to 
take up with our teacher of French literature such a piece 
as‘‘La Derniére Classe’? We should expéct some feeling to 
be the result, and we should want our teacher to keep that 
feeling topmost in his mind all the way through, to bring out 
for us and with us whatever contributed to that feeling and 
to repress or neglect all else. Should we take up the mean- 
ing of words and phrases, bring out the historical setting, 
dwell on the life of the author? If they are necessary to the 
desired effect, yes; but otherwise, no. The teacher might 
tell us that Daudet is one of the greatest story writers of all 
time, and that “The Last Class” relates a pathetic inci- 
dent that happened at the close of the Franco-Prussian 
War. A question or two will tell him whether or not we have 
well in mind the historical situation. 
Once over, twice over, or how many times over? There 
can be no set rule for such things. It depends on the piece 
and on the class. And who shall begin? Perhaps the 
teacher had better read it all through for us first — he can 
throw such expression into his French. If there are difficult 
parts, he will adroitly put them in his own words for the 
present; but the easy passages he may assign to us to read. 
We get the general effect, and we feel our hearts wrung — 
but we want them wrung again, and more poignantly! 
We go over it again, dwelling on the incidents as one does 
on the lines of some appreciated picture. Study may be 
assigned, and we use our dictionaries with a will. The 
teacher takes pains to rouse many associations, to make us 
feel the piece in terms of our own experience. ‘‘Should we 
notice the cockchafers if they flew into our room? And yet 
not even ‘the little fellows’ looked up when the May beetles 
came humming in, so intent were they on getting their last 
 
-P-A-G-E-482
  472 _ THE CHILD’S MIND 
writing lesson in French before the Germans took over the 
school.”” What was it that choked the old teacher when he 
tried to speak? “Suppose you were giving the last lesson 
you could ever give in English before the foe took over your 
school, suppressed your language, ruled your country!” 
This last, the forming of associations and the interpre- 
tation of the piece in terms of the pupil’s experience, is one 
of the most precious things the teacher can do, and one of the 
most commonly neglected. It is here that she follows the bee, 
which, as John Burroughs says, furnishes a model for us 
to imitate in that it adds a bit of its own self to the sweets 
it gathers. The mixture it makes is the honey. 
One more warning. Too much study of plot, movement, 
character, and climax is as barren and bad as too” much 
defining of words, analyzing of sentences, and anatomizing 
of figures of speech. We are not studying to make our pupils © 
great authors. We want them to learn how to live, and to 
learn it by sporting about in the English language. We can 
not tell ourselves too often that we are aiming to stir up a 
mass of connections that will rouse a feeling, and leave them 
the better for having felt it. To go nosing about too much 
among the stage fixtures would spoil the effect of the play. 
The use of the dictionary.— The pupil may begin, any 
time after he has learned his letters, by making a little 
dictionary of his own. Placing the twenty-six letters at the 
tops of twenty-six pages of a blank book, he can enter words 
at first according to their initial letters, later placing them 
according to their second and third and other letters. 
Having practiced putting words into such an embryonic 
dictionary as this, he will easily learn how to find them in 
the larger book. 
By the time he reaches the fourth grade, he should have a  
-P-A-G-E-483
  LITERATURE 473 
simple vade mecum dictionary of his own, to be consulted 
especially in connection with spelling, composition, and lit- 
erature. This ought to be regarded as a friendly book which 
does not persist, as most books do, in unfolding its whole 
story from start to finish like a gossip, but will tell you, dis- 
cretely and definitely, like a good friend, anything it knows 
if you only ask it aright. 
Special drill will be needed on diacritical marks and deri- 
vations, and on the quick finding of words. The pupil should 
be able to get from his wordbook, on demand, correct spell- 
ing and pronunciation, root meaning and definition. And 
happy is he who has learned to reénforce his reading with 
dictionary at elbow. 
Memorizing. —It is a very common and a very desirable 
practice—that of hanging beautiful literary pictures on the 
walls of memory. We should make it as easy and agreeable 
as possible for all. 
Memorizing consists largely in forming series bonds. To 
make it easy, put the matter in sensori-motor form, that is, 
“see the picture,” act it, hear the sounds, etc., and see to it 
that the pictures are in a series, so that they can be recalled 
as such. Let me illustrate with a case given by Frances 
Gulick Jewett.1. She found a boy trying to memorize the 
following lines: 
On came the whirlwind — like the last 
But fiercest sweep of tempest blast; 
On came the whirlwind, — steel gleams broke 
Like lightning through the rolling smoke; 
The war was waked anew. 
Three hundred cannon mouths roared loud, 
And from their throats, with flash and cloud, 
Their showers of iron threw. 
1See Control of Body and Mind, Chapter XXIV. Ginn and Company. 
 
-P-A-G-E-484
  474 THE CHILD’S MIND 
He was saying each line or two from ten to twenty times 
over, gradually adding one such unit after another, speaking 
rapidly, learning slowly, and complaining of his wretched 
memory, particularly of the fact that he stuck at the end 
of the fifth line. 
She told him to go very slowly, fixing his attention on 
word after word and phrase after phrase, making a vivid. 
picture of everything, seeing the whirlwind, hearing the 
tempest, and so on. In addition, he was to ‘‘make bridges” 
(form connections): ‘‘waked anew” suggested how he would 
wake if ‘‘three hundred cannon mouths roared loud” right 
by his bed; ‘“‘mouths” made him think of ‘‘throats,” 
“cloud” led to “showers,’”’ etc. ‘‘Make sensible bridges 
when you can, but even-a foolish bridge is better than a 
chasm.”’ The boy caught the idea, called it “‘a great scheme,”’ 
and no longer complained of his memory. 
Summary of ‘‘Exercise.””— To guide the nerve current 
repeatedly along the right path is to see that our pupils 
repeatedly get good and edifying feelings from literature. 
In order to approach the tandem method, let us yoke up 
with our pupils and study and enjoy one good piece after 
another with them just as we would do for ourselves, only 
making allowance for their immaturity. Let us not put in 
many outlines and character studies and pulverized facts, 
unless we would really want them for our own satisfaction 
if we were studying alone. 
Preventing the exercise of wrong paths means, in the large 
view, preventing pupils from getting bad and destructive 
feelings from what they read. Our largest service here con- 
sists in guiding them away from bad reading into good 
reading — reading that is good for them at their stage of 
development. 
 
-P-A-G-E-485
  LITERATURE 475 
How have the pupil practice as he will perform? Well, 
how do people ‘‘perform” on literature? School can never 
be like life until there is more joy in the recitation, teacher 
and pupil and book together. Why not? 
Effect. — One kind of effect is too pronounced among 
people who undertake to be “literary.” It is that down- 
- hearted effect which follows the acknowledgment that one 
has not read a certain best seller, or is not sure as to who 
wrote this or that, or why Poe was dismissed from West 
Point. But to try to read everything is like trying to eat 
at all the hotels in the country. So far as best sellers are 
concerned, the Bible and’ Shakespeare have been two of the 
best sellers for a long time back. And there is no more reason 
for knowing all the details of literature than there is for 
knowing all the details of history or of science. We must 
not trouble our pupils with such worries. 
Our great crimes in this connection are choosing the wrong 
literature and studying it in the wrong way. For general 
study we must select that only which is of general appeal, 
leaving each to follow his individual tastes outside of class. 
The right and the wrong way of study have already been 
indicated. 
Testing essential bonds. — The best passing mark a pupil! 
of mine ever achieved in literature was made by a very 
sensible eighth grade girl who, on finishing the class 
reading of “Evangeline,” burst into tears. The tears 
were the mark. I regarded them as conclusive evidence 
that she believed in ‘‘affection that hopes, and endures, 
and is patient,’ and “in the beauty and strength of 
woman’s devotion.” Of course we could hardly insist on 
such a test for every pupil, but we can expect expressive 
and intelligent oral reading of assigned parts. Let me
-P-A-G-E-486
  476 THE CHILD’S MIND 
quote from Corson’s wonderful little book, The Voice and 
Spiritual Education. 
This brings me to say that, in literary examinations, whatever other 
means be employed, a sufficiently qualified teacher could arrive at a nicer 
and more certain estimate of what a student has appropriated, both intel- 
lectually and spiritually, of a literary product, or any portion of a literary 
prouct, by requiring him to read it, than he could arrive at through any 
amount of catechizing.... To adapt the French saying, le style, c'est 
Vhomme [‘‘The style is the man”’], it may be said that la lecture a haute 
voix c'est Vhomme |‘ Reading aloud is the man”’]. Reading reveals the read- 
er’s spiritual appreciation or the absence of it. And it is only to the extent 
that a reader assures his hearers that he has himself experienced the senti- 
ments to which he gives utterance, that he impresses them. 
Would that we could conduct our courses in literature 
without an examination in the usual sense of the word. If 
we must resort to a list of questions, let us try to see that 
they test whether the pupil has appreciated the spirit, not 
merely the letter, of what he has read. 
CLASS EXERCISE 
1. Make an outline of what may be regarded as standard 
procedure in the teaching of a piece of literature. (For help, see 
Chubb’s The Teaching of English, Ch. VII; Klapper’s Teaching 
Children to Read, Ch. X; Goldwasser’s Method and Methods in 
the Teaching of English, Chs. VII-IX; and MacClintock’s Liter- 
ature in the Elementary School, Chs. XTV, XV.) 
2. Let each show how he would study a bit of literature with 
a class. Include an illustration of how to memorize a passage. 
3. Try to make a list of the principal feelings, passing from 
simplest (characteristic of young children) to most complex 
(characteristic of adults). 
Hint: The feelings, especially those of childhood, are the out- 
flow of the instincts. Review the instincts listed in Chapter III.

  LITERATURE 477 
Better still, study Robert S. Woodworth’s ‘Inventory of Human 
Instincts and Primary Emotions,” being Chapter VIII of his 
Psychology: A Study of Mental Life. 
What basis do these instinct-feelings afford for the rough grading 
of literature? 
FOR FURTHER STUDY 
1. Give examples of writings that are not literature, according 
to the standard set up in this chapter. Is plane geometry litera- 
ture? A weather report? A textbook in geography? 
2. Could all textbooks be so written as to make them litera- 
ture, or at least literary? Should they be? What hint is there 
here for the writers of textbooks? 
3. It is sometimes asserted that literature aims primarily to 
give pleasure. (Was the Bible written for that purpose? Is it 
literature?) How do the statements of this chapter differ from 
that view? 
4. Examine literature as to its value when gauged by Spencer’s 
five tests: direct self-preservation, indirect  self-preservation, 
rearing and discipline of offspring, maintaining proper social and 
political relations, and the miscellaneous activities of leisure. 
5. Recall the literary study of your sehool days? What did 
you enjoy and profit by most? Least? What shall you imitate 
and what reject when you teach literature? 
6. Can teachers be wholesomely “literary” even when teaching 
other subjects? Just what would this mean as to feeling, language, 
and imagination? 
7. How should the transition be made from the “reading” of 
the early grades to the “literature” of the later ones? What. 
differences in the method of teaching? (A special report may be 
made on this, perhaps based on Klapper’s Teaching Children to 
Read, Ch. IX.) 
8. Should moving pictures be included under the term liter- 
ature? Lectures and phonographic productions (other than musi-
-P-A-G-E-488
  478 THE CHILD’S MIND 
cal)? Radiophone messages of a literary nature? Can we expect 
as much book reading as in days before these inventions? Dis- 
cuss. 
9. Suggest means by which you would hope to get children to 
read outside of school, and to direct or influence that reading. 
What effect will your own general reading and the sympathy 
between you and the children be likely to have? 
10. How many books do you own? Are you planning to own 
any more? Where can cheap editions be obtained? How can 
children who have money be induced to buy books? Why should 
they if there is a public library at hand? 
11. A shoe dealer tells me that some parents buy for their 
children shoes that are too small because they want to think their 
children have small feet. What kind of books are they likely to 
buy for their children’s heads? 
12. Darwin says that one of the most important factors in 
whatever measure of success he achieved was “unbounded patience 
in long reflecting over any subject.” . Show the place of discussion 
in the literature class, and especially why the teacher should adopt 
the tandem method of forming many associations between the 
literature on one hand, and the pupils’ experience and the life of 
the present time on the other. :

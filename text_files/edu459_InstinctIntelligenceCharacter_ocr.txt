  PREFACE 
Tue leisure and incentive to prepare for the press the lectures 
which form this book I owe to an invitation from Dean 
Russell of Teachers’ College, Columbia University, New York 
City, to spend the session 1923-24 there as Visiting Professor 
of Education. To him, and to Dr. E. L. Thorndike, at whose 
suggestion the invitation was extended to me, I owe a debt 
which I am glad to acknowledge ; and no less to Sir Theodore 
Morison and the Council of Armstrong College in Newcastle 
for acquiescence in the necessary leave of absence, made 
possible by the great kindness of my predecessor and old 
friend, Mark R. Wright, in emerging from his retirement 
to take up for another year his former duties. 
The lectures were three times delivered, in the winter, 
spring, and summer semesters, and are here printed sub- 
stantially as given on the last occasion. Any merits they 
may have they owe to my audiences, for from a class ranging 
in age from nineteen to fifty-five years, possessed of teaching 
experience of every conceivable sort, and gathered not only 
from every State of the Union, but from every continent, 
the teacher could not fail to learn, whatever they may have 
learned from him. And to them, to “251 C,” I dedicate 
the present volume.

CHAPTER I 
A PRELIMINARY TALK ON INSTINCTS 
AND HABITS 
Tuts book does not concern itself, except indirectly, with 
the aims of education, though no attempt will be made to 
keep the writer’s own views completely out of sight. The 
purpose is primarily to set out what appear to be the facts 
of mental life which are most important, clearly, and with 
illustrations drawn as far as possible from teaching practice. 
Among the questions to which a thoughtful educator wants 
answers are such matters as the following :—Are there any 
laws which describe the best way of acquiring skill, such as 
skill in writing or in handling tools, or of acquiring knuwledge 
such as the multiplication table or the formule for solving 
triangles ? *Can a teacher make any ordinary boy into a 
great scholar if he can only teach him well enough and per- 
suade him to work hard enough, or are there inborn limits 
in each child beyond which he cannot go? And if so, how 
early can we find out, with reasonable certainty, what these 
limits are ?- How ought we to deal with children of different 
temperaments, the sullen, the flippant, the stodgy and the 
cocksure ? Does chemistry give as good an education as 
the classics ? Were all successful business men the despair 
11
-P-A-G-E-10
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
of their schoolmasters, or is there something about the 
atmosphere of Speech Day which leads them untruthfully 
to say so? Do children fall into types, the bookish, the 
mechanical, the abstract thinker, the linguist, the mathe- 
matician, the artist? Or is the clever boy usually clever 
all round? At what age should specialization begin ? 
What about the Dalton Plan, the heuristic method, the 
evils of competition, self-government, intelligence tests, 
psycho-analysis, and the Boy Scouts? Are there general 
laws by means of which we can judge new fads, or must we 
essay them one by one and learn by trial and error of the 
crudest kind ? 
To these and a host of similar questions a common-sense 
psychology can give at any rate partial answers. True, the 
great majority are ready with answers themselves. But in 
many cases, the answers are conflicting, and yes and no are 
urged with equal force.and on the same grounds. In such a 
case it is necessary to take stock of the whole situation, to 
discover what is common to the apparently opposed views, 
to expose experimental error or invalid reasoning where it 
can be seen, to plan and suggest crucial experiments, to 
bring to the inquiry the resources of the sciences of heredity, 
of statistics, and of comparative psychology. No one is 
fully qualified to act this part of judge; but by placing on 
record his own views, his own experiences, and his own 
solutions, everyone can serve on the jury. 
Man is an animal, and no part of his body exists but can 
be paralleled in less developed or in otherwise developed 
forms found among the animals. Yet there is a tremendous 
gap between man and even the highest anthropoids. It will 
be part of our duty to study particularly those mental points 
in which man is most superior and by which he has won his 
commanding position in the world, to ask how he appears 
to have acquired these advantages, and whether education 
can modify them and raise him higher in the scale towards 
an ideal being. 
12

  A PRELIMINARY TALK 
But this we cannot do without also studying what man 
has in common with the animals, his instincts and the 
physical laws of his body. 
Instincts. 
The purely reflex actions themselves hardly call for much 
notice from the educator. They are uneducable, or very 
nearly so, and only disappear in serious illness or when 
submitted to very unnatural treatment, as when the appren- 
tice sword-swallower “tires out” his vomiting reflex. 
Some are quite unconsciously performed (as the dilation and 
contraction of the pupil of the eye) and are quite uncon- 
trollable. Others are not quite so completely below the 
conscious level and are subject to a certain amount of control. 
Stand inside a large plate-glass window while someone 
violently and suddenly throws a pailful of water against 
the outside. It is nearly impossible not to wink and flinch. 
Sneezing is a little more controllable. A large part of the 
training of a little baby consists in teaching him to acquire 
control over actions which at first are reflex, and to learn 
habits of cleanliness. Instincts range all the way from 
responses which are practically reflex actions, made irresist- 
ibly to certain narrowly defined stimuli, on the one hand, 
to rather vague instinctive tendencies to act in more or less 
such and such a kind of way in response to a wide class of 
stimuli, on the other. Fairly near to the lower end of the 
scale is, for example, the little child’s tendency to put a new 
toy into its mouth. Near the other end is the “ collecting 
instinct ’’ which arises in very varied situations, and which 
leads to the collecting of all kinds of things, from cigarette 
cards to birds’ eggs, from postage stamps to the titles of 
scientific articles on the applications of Mendelism to human 
eugenics. Near the lower end there is little doubt about the 
innate nature of the instinct, for it is usually very widespread, 
is often shared with the higher animals, and has often heen 
13 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
seen to arise spontaneously in situations where it could not 
well have been learned from others. Near the upper end 
there is usually considerable doubt about the inborn nature 
of the response and much controversy, for the response 
differs significantly in different individuals, and arises 
often or always in circumstances where it might well have 
been learned from others. Boys, for example, usually collect 
stamps because other boys do so, and acquire their interest 
and their skill from their school friends. Is the wish to 
collect (something or other) also acquired, or is the influence 
of the environment limited to directing an inborn instinct 
to the particular object, “‘ stamps ” ? 
In popular language, the words instinct and instinctive 
are very often misused. They are often applied to actions 
which are not instinctive at all, but habitual. ‘‘ Seeing the 
child run across the street,” writes the newspaper reporter, 
“the tramcar driver instinctively applied his brakes.” This 
is a well-fixed habit in the driver, not an instinct. The 
child’s action in starting back and shrieking when it saw a 
large tramcar bearing down upon it was on the other hand 
instinctive, and so was its mother’s action in rushing forward 
to its help. The best examples of pure instinct are seen in 
lower animals, for example in the spiders, of which Fabre 
has written so vividly. - The banded Epeira cannot be taught 
by her mother to make her wonderful nest, for her mother 
died when the first cold of last winter came. Yet at the 
proper time she will make her silk bag, ovoid in shape, 
crowned with a scalloped rim, composed of compact white 
satin and of reddish brown wadding, covered with patterns 
of spindle shape in fanciful meridian waves; a nest quite 
different from that of the silky Epeira, her relative. Of 
course, saying that the spider builds the nest by instinct 
is not an explanation, it is merely a short way of saying that 
she does so without being taught, without learning. 
Few actions of the higher animals are so purely instinctive 
as this. In man, shortly after birth, sucking is instinctive. 
. 14
-P-A-G-E-13
  A PRELIMINARY TALK 
Later, walking is probably, almost certainly, instinctive ; 
though the child hardly ever is allowed to begin to walk 
without being taught. If left quite to himself in this respect, 
however, the baby will, somewhere between ten months and 
sixteen months, stand up and walk rather suddenly, though 
the walking is not at all perfect on the first occasion. Most_ 
of man’s actions are a mixture.of instinct and learning. 
The human child is always being taught, not only in an 
impersonal neutral way by the environment, but actively 
and of set purpose by his parents, his brothers and sisters, 
older children, aunts and uncles, and teachers. It is small 
wonder, therefore, if we hardly know just what things he 
would, under other circumstances, do instinctively. ( He 
does not learn English, or French, or German, instinctively, 
for an English baby transferred to a French home acquires 
French as his mother tongue. Nor would he speak any 
language at all if he could be brought up without human 
companionship, or by dumb mutes.) But the babbling 
sounds he takes a delight in making from about the sixth 
month, the repetitions of ma-ma-ma, and ga-ga-gu, these 
are.made instinctively, and form the foundation upon which 
the mother tongue is built up. (The truth about the instine-) 
tive nature of man is probably this, that he has a large num- 
ber of instincts, but that these instincts are very indefinite 
compared with those of animals, especially lower animals. 
They would not in themselves enable man to survive, but 
are capable of being directed and diverted to a surprising 
extent, and they form the basis of education, which consists 
in building on these instincts those habits which the civiliza- 
tion and culture of the period demand from the adult. 
(tt is just because man’s instincts are only vaguely directed 
that he is far the most highly educable animal, excelling in 
this respect to an incredible extent.) Not only what are 
commonly called habits and customs, but also all forms of 
dexterity and muscular skill, and even all forms of artistic 
appreciation and intellectual performance, thought and 
15
-P-A-G-E-14
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
reasoning itself, are all probably possible in man just because 
he has indefinite instinctive tendencies rather than specific 
and narrow instincts, and can learn. To a preliminary 
talk on habit and the laws of learning we may next turn 
our attention. ; 
Hasirt AND LEARNING. 
A habit is distinguished from an instinct by being acquired, 
not inborn. In an instinct, there are ready-made nerve 
connections..which ensure~that-such. and.such_a response 
will occur in a certain situation. In a habit, the nerve con- 
nections have to be made by exercise and satisfaction. 
The water-chick which dives for the first time in its life when 
frightened by a barking puppy, and which has never seen 
another water-hen, having been brought up in an incubator, 
nevertheless gives the characteristic water-hen dive.1 This 
is instinctive, and the nerve connections which run from 
eye and ear to spinal cord and brain, and thence to the 
diving muscles, must be set ready to produce this particular 
act by the hand of Nature through the mechanism of 
heredity. But a boy does not dive instinctively. He has 
to learn to dive, and the nerve connections which ultimately 
co-ordinate his muscles when as a practised diver he plunges 
into the water have been brought to this state of readiness 
by long practice, by dissatisfaction at failures, and satis- 
faction at successes. Diving in the case of the boy is 
habitual, not instinctive. It is an acquired skill. 
The word habit in ordinary conversation is most frequently 
applied to moral or immoral actions, as early rising or 
drunkenness. But even in ordinary speech it is extended 
to cases of skill, as when we say that Jones dives badly, or 
writes badly, because he got into bad habits of diving or of 
writing when he was first learning. We shall not in the 
present section speak much, or at all, about good or bad 
1 Lloyd Morgan, ‘“‘ The Natural History of Experience,” Brit. Journ. 
of Psychology, 1909, iii, 11. 
16
-P-A-G-E-15
  A PRELIMINARY TALK 
habits, but rather of the way in which-all habits, whether 
good or bad, are learned. 
An animal which possesses quite fixed, definite, strong 
reactions in connection with a certain situation cannot well 
form any habits in response to that situation. A moth 
flies to a light in a way which has become proverbial, and 
it would be impossible, or at any rate tremendously difficult, 
to form habits in a moth as regards its behaviour to a lighted 
candle. But if an animal does not always respond in quite 
the same way to a situation, then education is possible 
and habits can be formed quite different from the responses 
due to instinct, out of which they are developed. The 
differences in response may be due to the failure of those 
first tried, as when a dog attempts in vain to jump over a 
fence and then tries to squeeze under it. It could be trained 
always to do the latter by associating some “reward” 
with this response and ‘‘ punishment” with the jumping 
response. Or the differences may be due to the attitude of 
- the animal at the moment, to being more hungry, or more 
tired, or the like. If there is variability, there is the possi- 
bility of learning. 
Popular psychology about habits of skill sums itself up 
in the saying ‘‘ Practice makes perfect.”” Everyone knows 
that repetition makes an act easier, more certain. What is 
‘not explained by this popular psychology is how it is that 
we get better in any action, such as serving at tennis, when 
as a matter of fact we practise the wrong actions much more 
often than the right ones in the early stages of our practice, 
and indeed for months or years. Clearly another law of 
skill is needed to explain this, in addition to ‘‘ practice makes 
perfect.”” What that law is we shall in a moment see. 
The “‘ practice ”’ law, “law of use,” or ‘‘ law of exercise,” 
as Thorndike calls it,1 can be expressed in terms of nerve 
action by saying that nerve connections are the more 
easily made the more often they have been made before, 
1 Hducational Psychol. Briefer Course, New York, 1914, p. 70.

  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
and the more recently: and that the longer time we allow 
to elapse without making such and such a nerve connection, 
the less likely itis to be made, other things being equal. 
On the whole, this general statement is borne out by common 
experience, by laboratory experiment, and by schoolroom 
observation. But there must be something more, or errors 
made so frequently in the early stages of practice would 
be perpetuated. That other law is this, that satisfaction, 
the glow of pleasure, which follows a successful movement, 
somehow stamps in the nerve connections which have just 
been made, and causes them to be a little more readily made 
again than would have been the case had dissatisfaction 
ensued. How this is we do not understand ; but that it is 
80, in practice, we know. It follows at once that practice 
will have the more rapid effect, the more certainly the pupil 
can know when he has, by chance or forethought, made a 
more than usually successful try, and the more pleased he 
is at his success. So that teachers should make known 
clearly to their pupils when they have done even slightly 
better than usual, and should do whatever is likely to increase 
the pupil’s satisfaction at this improvement. The most 
effective means of doing this is to ensure that improvement 
in the habit shall tend to satisfy some powerful instinct, 
so that here again we see how habits depend upon instincts. 
They arise out of instincts, and are developed often in the 
satisfaction of instincts. They are so similar in their certainty 
and quickness of response that it is with difficulty we 
distinguish between them. Habits, let us repeat, are 
acquired; instincts are inborn, inherited. And as an aid 
to their study and understanding, we must give some 
attention to the laws of heredity, to which we turn in our 
next chapter.

-P-A-G-E-17
  CHAPTER II 
THE LAWS OF HEREDITY 
PxrrHars the greatest event in the nineteenth century was 
the publication of Darwin’s Origin of Species, in which he 
propounded the doctrine that different species and genera of 
animals, including man himself, have been formed by the 
influence of the environment in weeding out the “ unfit,” 
that is, those unsuited to the environment. It is true that 
Darwinism in its original form is no longer entirely accepted 
by biologists, but the notion of the “‘ survival of the fittest,” 
the idea of “natural selection,” is so fundamental to all 
thinking to-day that it is essential that we should first 
grasp it. Consider, say, a country in which there lived lions 
and antelopes, the former preying on the latter. Then if 
an individual antelope is a slow runner, it will fall an early 
prey to the lions and will leave few or no progeny. If, on 
the other hand, an antelope is a very good runner, then it 
will live long and have many children. The antelopes of 
the next generation will, therefore, be descended from the 
faster runners of the previous generation, and will be, if 
there is anything in heredity, a faster set of runners than 
was that generation. And so on and so on. The lions keep 
speeding the antelopes up. Note that it is not by practice 
in running that the antelopes get faster, but by selection, 
the bad runners being killed off and the good runners allowed 
to breed. This is exactly what cattle breeders do, or dog 
fanciers, when they wish to alter or to improve a strain. 
At the same time the antelopes are speeding up the lions, 
for a lion will starve if it cannot sprint or jump. And the 
19
-P-A-G-E-18
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
process will go on until some limit set by other factors is 
reached. Instead of speed, the quality selected may be 
matching the background, or lying perfectly still, or going 
for long periods without water, or hibernating, or anything 
which has “survival value”’ in any animal. So the lions 
and antelopes may come in many thousands of years to be 
very different from what they were. And so, indeed, all 
animal species have come to exist. Such is a crude account 
of Darwin’s famous theory. 
This theory clearly assumes that children are, on the whole, 
like their parents, and this is of course supported by common 
experience. It is desirable, however, to have some more 
exact way of stating this fact, for it is also common knowledge 
that a child may be unlike either parent. A convenient way 
of stating the facts quantitatively is the following. For 
clearness, take a definite and easily measurable quality such 
as height, and let us confine ourselves to males. If we obtain 
the heights of, say, 1,000 English fathers selected at random, 
each of them having an adult son whose height is also 
measured, we have material for ascertaining what is called 
the “correlation” between height of father and height of 
son. Ifeach son always and invariably grew to just the same 
height as his father we should say that the correlation was 
perfect ; and in that case we could, of course, predict a 
boy’s ultimate height with certainty. The facts, however, 
are not so: yet there is a tendency for the sons of tall fathers 
to be tall, and of short fathers to be short. That tendency 
we wish to measure by the coefficient of correlation. 
Let the average height of Englishmen be 5 feet 7 inches, 
and let us choose from our data the set of fathers who are 
each and all four inches above the average, i.e. 5 feet 11 inches 
tall. These fathers will have sons of varying height, some 
taller than their fathers, others not so tall, some even 
below the English average. But the average height of these 
sons will lie between 5 feet 11 inches and 5 feet 7 inches. They 
will not average as tall as their fathers, but they will average 
20
-P-A-G-E-19
  THE LAWS OF HEREDITY 
taller than the common man. Instead of being four inches 
above the racial average, they will be about two inches above 
it. The ratio of this two inches to that four inches is 
what is called the correlation coefficient, here equal to 
0°5. Had the set of fathers selected been, say, three inches 
each below the racial average, then their sons, though 
scattered in height, would tend to be short, though not so 
-short as their parents, and would, in fact, average about 
an inch and a half below the race. 
The cause of this “ regression ” from the parental towards 
the racial height is presumably the influence of the more 
remote ancestry, and also the influence of the mother’s side. 
But even if instead of correlating with the father’s height 
we correlate with the average of father and mother, such 
regression still takes place. If, however, the selection of 
tall parents for survival continued, all below a certain 
height being exterminated before they bore any or many 
children, the regression to the original racial average would, 
it may be supposed, grow less and less, as more and more 
of the ancestry became tall, until in time a race of tall men 
would be arrived at, who would continue tall for very many 
generations, even should the conditions which exterminate 
short individuals cease to act. 
This, then, is the method by which orthodox Darwinism 
supposed species, and even genera, to be created. Ever so 
small a variation might, if it had survival value, become 
fixed as a permanent feature, provided that the environ- 
mental conditions which gave it survival value continued to 
act for a sufficiently large number of generations. 
It is by no means certain that such evolution by the 
cumulative effect of tiny variations has not taken place. 
But the convictions held by the scientific world on this 
question of evolution have been profoundly modified by the 
progress of Mendelism, the study of the inheritance of certain 
unitary characters which was begun by the Abbé Gregor 
Mendel in the garden of the monastery at Briinn or Brno, 
21
-P-A-G-E-20
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
in what is now Czecho-Slovakia, in the year 1865. The 
general essence of Mendelism is still best explained by an 
account of one of Mendel’s own original experiments, in 
which he cross-fertilized two different species of peas, one 
tall and the other dwarf. 
The ordinary pea, both tall and dwarf, is self-fertilizing ; 
but in his experiment Mendel took the pollen from a tall 
plant and dusted it on the ovules of a short plant, or vice 
versa, and carefully preserved and planted the resulting

peas. These all grew into tall plants, resembling the tall 
parent. This is the first filial generation. ‘These resulting 
tall plants were allowed to mature and to self-fertilize 
themselves, and the peas planted to grow into the second 
filial generation. The members of this second filial generation, 
though all descended from tall parents, were not all tall. 
One quarter of them were short like the short grandparent, 
and these short plants proved to be pure in breed, that is, 
their descendants to many generations were invariably 
22
-P-A-G-E-21
  THE LAWS OF HEREDITY 
short. The other three quarters of the second filial generation 
were tall: but one of these three-quarters proved to be 
pure tall, giving only tall descendants, whereas the remaining 
two quarters produced both short and tall offspring, in the 
proportion of 1 to 3. All this is better seen in the diagram 
on page 22. 
The theory advanced to explain this (at first sight com- 
plicated) inheritance was, that the factors for tallness and 
shortness do not blend, but that the sexual cells contain 
either the one or the other factor (or we may, perhaps, speak 
of a single factor whose presence causes tallness, and whose 
absence causes dwarfness). 
Tallness is said to be dominant and shortness recessive, 
so that when either parent supplies the tall factor, as in the 
original cross, then the offspring are tall. 
But though tall in outward appearance, these plants 
have only a single dose of the tallness factor, not a double 
dose as when both parents are tall. Their sexual cells will 
in half the cases contain the T factor, in half they will lack 
it. In any single blossom of this first filial generation, 
therefore, there will be many pollen grains, half the number 
bearing T and half not, and a number of ovules, half the 
number bearing T and half not. When the pollen falls on 
to the ovules, it will be sheer chance whether both pollen 
and ovule contain the T factor, or both lack it, or one have 
it and the other lack it. 
Exactly the same chance pairing takes place when we 
throw two pennies. If we mark the two sides of each coin 
with Tall and Short, and throw them, we may get 
Tall x Tall 
Tall x Short 
Short x Tall 
Short x Short 
In one quarter of the cases the result will be a pure tall 
plant, both pollen and ovule containing the T factor. Such 
a plant will give tall plants in all succeeding generations if 
23  
-P-A-G-E-22
  | INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
self-fertilization only is allowed. It is pure bred despite 
its short grandmother. The plants resulting from pollen 
and ovules which both lack the tall factor will produce 
pure short plants, from which only short descendants can 
arise as long as only self-fertilization is possible—a pure- 
bred short plant despite its tall grandfather. The plants 
resulting from tall-bearing pollen and tall-lacking ovules 
will be just like the first filial generation, and so also those 
from tall-lacking pollen and tall-bearing ovules. 
Since the rediscovery in 1900 of Mendel’s work (which 
had been buried in the archives of a Briinn society) a large 
number of unit factors like this ‘‘ tallness ’’ factor has been 
investigated, in many plants, and also in animals. The 
theory becomes complex when many factors are involved, 
but it is essentially the same in principle as in the simple 
case considered above. Sometimes pairs or groups of factors 
are found which are partially linked together, so that the 
group tends to act together, and thus further possibilities 
arise. 
It is clear that this changing by definite jumps, by muta- 
tions, is a different process from Darwin’s progress by small 
variations. But upon these mutations, as upon any varia- 
tions, environment can still exercise its selective influence, 
and the essential idea of Darwinism, the “survival of the 
fittest,’’ remains in force. 
This idea of evolution by selection (whether from small 
variations or from mutations) explains much of evolution 
without any appeal to the idea of the environment improving 
the individual and thereby improving his progeny. In the 
pure selection theory, the environment eliminates a harmful 
quality, not by improving, but by killing off, the individuals 
who possess it. Indeed, though Darwin probably thought 
otherwise, it has for long been the opinion of most biologists 
that acquired characteristics are not inherited, that is to 
say that any quality which an individual acquires by training 
during his lifetime will not be passed on to his children.

  THE LAWS OF HEREDITY 
Of course, he may in his turn teach it to his children, but 
what is here meant is that it will not be inborn in his children. 
This is a hypothesis which many students find it hard to 
grasp, and indeed it does make one wonder where all the 
numerous qualities now exhibited by all the innumerable 
species of animals and plants can have comefrom. If nothing 
acquired is inherited, then it would seem that all these won- 
derful qualities, the colours of the humming bird, the homing 
instinct of the pigeon, the longneckedness of the giraffe, 
the shortneckedness of the bulldog, the wings of the albatross 
and the brain of man, all must have been potentially present 
in the first form of life which appeared on this planet. But 
great as this difficulty may be, we must not, as scientists, 
assume the inheritance of acquired characteristics if there 
is no evidence for it, and if the evolution of species as we see 5 
it taking place (without worrying about the first beginnings) 
can be explained by selection without it. 
Occasionally experiments are reported which seem to 
imply inheritance of acquired characteristics!. But since 
most experiment points against it, confirmation of their 
results must be awaited. 
Meanwhile, if nothing acquired is inherited, education 
loses importance in one direction and gains it in another. 
If the educator could know that his work would be per- 
petuated by inheritance, that the children would start, in 
intellect and in character, from where the parents left off, 
or at any rate from a higher starting point than did their 
parents, then every act of the teacher would be fraught — 
with consequences to untold generations. 
1 For example those of Kammerer. And more recently still, since the 
above was written, a report of a lecture by Professor Ivan P. Pawlow 
has appeared (Science, Nov. 9, 1923, vol. Iviii, p. 359-361) in which it is 
asserted that conditioned reflexes may be inherited. Some white mice 
were trained to run to the feeding place on the ringing of an electric bell, 
300 lessons being required. Succeeding generations required in turn 
100, 30, 10, and only 5 lessons. The sixth generation was awaiting 
Professor Pawlow’s return to Russia, and he confidently expected that 
ultimately the offspring would exhibit the reaction without any training 
at all. But repetition of these experiments must be awaited.

But if it is not so, if the work has to be begun again with 
each generation, then education becomes doubly important. 
Without it, mankind would at once, in one generation, slip 
back from civilization to savagery. It has to provide a 
social inheritance, to pass on the acquired mental wealth 
of the race which biological inheritance refuses to transmit. 
It has to improve its methods so as to get more and more 
done in each generation. The torch of learning is passed on, 
but he who receives it has to begin the race anew. He 
receives no allowance of so many yards or miles, and he can 
only go farther if his way be made smoother. It is the busi- 
ness of education to smooth the way.

  CHAPTER Ili 
INSTINCTS IN MAN 
Just what the instincts are which man inherits from his 
forefathers is difficult to say, because in man all instinctive 
reactions are so rapidly and deeply covered by a crust or 
cake of custom. That is why opinions have been so varied 
as to what proportion the instinctive basis of human 
behaviour bears to the whole, and why lists of human 
instincts have differed so much from one another. 
William James was one of the first writers, and was the 
most forceful, in urging that instinct was at the root of 
a good deal more of man’s behaviour than was commonly 
admitted: and every teacher should read what he has to 
say. Since his time, an increasing emphasis in the same 
direction has been shown by one psychologist after another : 
but in their classifications of instincts two schools have shown 
themselves, the one using a few wide classes, the other giving 
long lists of separate instincts. A classification of the former 
kind which has been popularized by Tansley’s widely read 
volume, The New Psychology, is that into ego instincts, 
herd-instincts, and sex-instincts, corresponding to self- 
Seaeaten land aggrandizement), tribal preservation, 
and racial preservation respectively. Most remote from this 
is Thorndike’s classification, which is indeed hardly a 
classification at all, but rather an enumeration of one specific 
situation after another, with the specifically instinctive 
response in each case. Instead, for example, of a general 
instinct to imitate, Thorndike enumerates the specific 
things which he sees being imitated in an instinctive manner. 
27
-P-A-G-E-26
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
He cannot see any general tendency towards imitating any- 
thing and everything, but he sees a tendency towards 
“yelling when others yell, laughing when others laugh, 
smiling when smiled at, looking at what others observe, 
listening when others listen, running with or after people 
who are running in the same direction, running from the 
focus whence others scatter, jabbering when others jabber, 
and becoming silent as they become silent, crouching 
when others crouch, chasing, attacking, and rending what 
others hunt, and seizing whatever object another seizes.” 
Between these two extremes is a list like that of McDougall, 
containing about a dozen simple instincts, to each of which’ 
is linked a primary emotion: for in McDougall’s treatment 
an emotion becomes almost the “‘inside’’ of an instinct, 
an instinct as it feels when occurring to one. The list is : 
Instinct. Emotion. 
Flight, Concealment, or Immobility Fear 
Pugnacity Anger 
Repulsion Disgust 
Submission Subjection 
Self-assertion Elation 
Curiosity Wonder 
Parental Instinct Tender Emotion 
Reproductive Instincts 
Acquisition the emotions corresponding to 
Feeding which are not so definitely 
regariousness | named by McDougall 
Construction : 
Tansley makes an attempt to reconcile McDougall’s 
classification with his own, or rather to show how he would 
further classify McDougall’s twelve heads to reduce them 
to his three. Under the ego-complex he places : 
Self-assertion (with pugnacity and curiosity). 
Feeding, acquisition, and construction. 
Submission (with flight, etc., and repulsion). 
3 In his latest book Professor McDougall adds to these two more, 
appeal and laughter. 
28
-P-A-G-E-27
  INSTINCTS IN MAN 
Under the sex-instincts he places : 
Parental Instincts and 
Reproductive Instincts, 
leaving for his herd-instinct McDougall’s 
Gregariousness. 
This does not, of course, imply that these subheadings 
exhaust what in Tansley’s opinion is the content of any one 
of his three heads. 
For the actual problems of teaching and education 
Thorndike’s attitude is useful. It is important to the teacher 
to know just what a child may be expected to imitate, just 
what kind of situations lead to self-assertion, and so on. In 
combining and redirecting instincts, in checking some and 
encouraging others, it is, however, wise to take account of 
the three centres of attraction to which our instinctive 
forces converge. The development of proper relations with 
one’s fellows, learning to live with them without losing one’s 
identity, and the skilful guiding of the forces of sex into the 
right channels, are the three most important tasks of the 
educator. But the professional knowledge which will enable 
him to accomplish these tasks is composed of those units 
which the “situation-response”’ psychologists enumerate. 
Among the innumerable situations and responses described 
with admirable clearness and absence of theoretical bias 
by Thorndike, the following are perhaps of greater educa- 
tional value, in nursery and school. His own words are 
freely used. 
To sudden changes and sharp contrasts a universal response 
is ‘‘ attentiveness, i.e. such fixating of eyes, head, etc., that 
the objects showing the change or contrast are brought into 
clearest observation.” 
“Any not too large object which” thus, or otherwise, 
“attracts attention, and does not possess repelling or 
frightening features, incites to approach, reaching, touching, 
29

Ree. 
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
> grasping, putting in the mouth, general manipulation.’ 
If it is portable, it may be carried home or to some familiar 
human being, and there contemplated and fingered. If it 
is alive, there is a tendency to dismemberment or mauling, 
especially if it has run away, and been hunted. If it runs 
away and is large, it will be chased and stoned and perhaps 
thrown down. As Booth Tarkington says, when he tells 
how Penrod and Sam pursued the old white horse, boys in 
such a situation are not being bad, they are merely being 
historic. 
Should any person “grab or make off with a recently 
acquired object ’’ the response will be ‘‘ anger, a tight clutch 
on the object, pushing, striking, and screaming at the 
intruder.” 
Toward other individuals present in the same room there 
is an instinctive tendency to be truculent if they do not 
kow-tow ; or at any rate a desire to attract their attention. 
Approval expressed by other human beings is an instinctive 
source of great satisfaction, scornful or derisive looks of 
“discomfort extending to utter wretchedness.” 
Gorgeous display, acts of daring or skill, victory in 
competition or combat, produce in the onlooker staring, 
smiles, ejaculations, encouraging shouts. The presence of 
others taking part in the same activity as ourselves leads to 
increased vigour in our own performance, and to great satis- 
faction at any manifest superiority. 
In the presence of a baby,women have a special endowment 
of instinctive acts, including interested attention, exclama- 
tions of pleasure at its gurglings and smiles, instinctive 
comforting acts when it shows pain or grief. Boys and men 
have conflicting impulses. For them the small child is 
sometimes a small animal to be chased and teased as might 
any other. But Thorndike sees in them instinctive actions 
when they “‘ offer scraps of food to see it eat, snatch it from 
peril, and smile approvingly at its vigorous antics.” 
These paragraphs may give some idea of the attempt to 
80
-P-A-G-E-29
  \ 
  INSTINCTS IN MAN 
set down situation by situation. Such a list might go on for 
pages, and the contrast with the threefold ‘‘ ego, herd, sex” 
classification is very striking. The “new psychologists ’’ 
are scientific in making some classification out of chaos— 
provided that their classification is not, in their own words, 
a mere rationalization. Thorndike is scientific in wishing to 
avoid the “faculty fallacy”’ of saying, for example, that 
there exist general powers of memory, of imitation, and the 
like, and in wishing to stick close to the facts and to'say just 
what those facts are. 
In any case, it seems clear that man’s instincts are more 
difficult to enumerate than are the instincts of the animals : 
and especially those lower animals which are to the popular 
mind the embodiment of instinct, such as the ant or the 
wasp. And the thesis will presently be put forward that it 
is just exactly the vagueness of instincts in man which has 
contributed most to his rise to overlordship in the animal 
kingdom. A typically “instinctive” animal makes auto- L 
matic and definite responses to certain definite situations. 
In a “‘ natural” or “ suitable” environment these automatic 
responses are beneficial on the whole and in the majority of 
instances, but their fixed character precludes any adaptation 
to a new environment, and precludes any learving. If there 
is enough variation among the individuals of the species, 
a fairly large change of environment may still leave the race 
- surviving, for the individuals more fitted to the environ- 
ment will become the parents of the next generation. But 
this is not learning, it is not adaptation ; it is decimation, 
purification by killing off the unfit. For the individuals 
of a species to be able to learn, to be able to adapt themselvés, 
there must be. some freedom from rigidity in the instinctive 
responses. Variation within the individual is the prerequisite 
of improvability of the individual, just as variability from 
one individual to another is the prerequisite of improvability 
in the race. In the latter case there is a selection of indi- 
viduals, some to survive and some to die. In the former case 
31  
-P-A-G-E-30
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
there is just as truly a selection of responses. What the 
selective agent is, and how it works, will be the subject of 
discussion in later chapters. The period of life during which 
this process of selecting and training instinctive responses 
is carried out is the period of infancy, of dependence on the 
parents, a period which in man necessarily extends to the 
age of eight or nine, and commonly is extended to the age 
of fourteen or even twenty-one years. The most instinctive 
feature of that period is the activity known as “play,” 
difficult to define, but easy to recognize. In the opinion of 
the present writer, play is the most important fact of human 
life, inasmuch as thereby that adaptability to environment 
is secured which has won for man his superiority to environ- 
ment. To the study of “ play ” we turn in Chapter IV. 
82
-P-A-G-E-31
  CHAPTER IV 
PLAY 
Wz all know what we mean by play, though it is difficult 
to define it so as to distinguish it in every instance from other 
non-play activities. Children are playing when they are 
merrily enjoying a game of ball. Two young dogs are playing 
when they chase one another alternately, pretend to bite, 
roll one another over, and bark. A kitten plays with a ball 
of wool. A little boy plays at building castles and moats 
and systems of canals on the seashore. A little girl plays 
at houses. Three or four bigger boys play at Indians. A 
team of high-school girls plays hockey. A schoolmaster 
plays golf. 
In most of these cases, especially those earlier in the list, 
we have no doubt that the activity is play. There may be 
some doubt about the hockey match if it is a compulsory 
game. The schoolmaster may go through his weekly task 
of obtaining exercise, though he hates it. Does the pro- 
fessional golfer play ? Sometimes he assuredly does, just as 
anyone else might. Sometimes he feels that it is his daily 
work by which he obtains his daily bread. Do we not on the 
other hand know men who treat their work as play and would 
rather play the game of being a\chemist, or a lawyer, or a 
soldier, than do anything else #— \ 
The two dogs are not playing when they begin to fight 
really, as we say ; when bites are given to draw blood and 
a deeper note comes into the growl. The kitten is not playing 
—or is it still playing ?—when it chases a mouse instead of 
a ball of wool. Certainly it is not playing if it is a really 
hungry, starving kitten. 
838 ce  
-P-A-G-E-32
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
It is clear that the dividing line between play and earnest 
is an uncertain one. Play passes continuously and without 
break into work, or into real hunting or real fighting. The 
theory of play which it is the purpose of this section to uphold, 
the theory mainly associated with the name of Karl Groos, 
is that play is a preparation for the earnest activities of life, 
and that when nature began to select species for their 
playfulness she had turned a corner in the great experiment 
of evolution, and had embarked on the journey which led 
to the creation of man. If this theory be true, it is play 
which more and more distinguishes the higher animals as 
we rise in the scale of ability, and which most of all marks 
out man. It is “play” that gives man that other great 
implement of progress, speech, which some have almost 
believed to be equivalent to thought and intelligence, 
so great is the advantage enjoyed by its possessor. It is 
play, if we are right, which is the natural educator and which 
therefore points the way for the human educator, the teacher. 
It is worth while dwelling a little longer on that change 
in the march of evolution which has just been referred to. 
Previously, the selection had been for those most fitted, 
as they stood, to the environment. It was like buying 
ready-made clothes. If they really do fit, well and good, 
but the man who buys uncut cloth and employs a tailor is 
more likely to look well dressed. The lower animals inherit 
fixed instincts, they must take their “‘ready-mades ” and 
wear them. The higher animals inherit less well-fixed 
instincts, better able to be fashioned to fit the life of the 
times. The trying-on process is the period of play, and the 
journeyman tailor, the workman carrying out the design 
of the Master Craftsman, is the teacher. He has not a free 
hand, he must cut his coat according to his cloth: but his 
is the power of ensuring assimilation to the civilized society 
of to-day and of reducing misfits of defect or delinquency to 
their lowest numbers. He has not the power, that is to say, 
to write whatever he will on a clean slate. But he has the 
34
-P-A-G-E-33
  PLAY 
task of directing, modifying, sublimating the instincts, and 
if we are right he will do this most readily by utilizing the 
tendency to play. English schools have long used play as 
the chief means of training character, and have expressed 
their ideal as “‘ playing the game ”’ in the real affairs of life. 
And now “ playways’”’ of learning are coming more and 
more into favour in the provinces of skill and of reasoning 
as well as in the moral province. 
The impulse to play is just the impulse to carry out certain 
instinctive actions in the absence of the usual inner set or 
trend of the organism. As this is perhaps rather a novel 
way of looking at play, it may be worth while amplifying 
the statement and illustrating it. How an animal acts in 
any situation depends not only upon the outer situation 
but also upon the inner “set ’”’ of the animal, whether it 
be hungry or replete, fatigued or fresh, in a period of sexual 
excitement or sexual quiescence. 
Now consider, say, the hunting instinct. In the sedate 
mature animal the urge of hunger makes the animal restless, 
it wanders observantly about in its usual hunting ground, 
certain smells and sights presently cause it to pause, flatten, 
crawl, jump, sprint, pounce upon its prey. The process has 
been well described by James as a chain of instincts, hunger 
causing restlessness, restlessness leading to sight of a small 
escaping animal, this sight leading to pursuit, and so on. 
But throughout, the inner set of the organism, the drive of 
hunger, is a part of the total situation and were that drive 
not present the hunting response would not be carried out. 
In an animal born with perfected instinctive responses, 
fitted to enable it at once, or very soon, to lead an independent 
life, the whole situation-is comparatively fixed. But in an 
1 A similar doctrine holds good in the cognitive or intellectual realm. 
What a given sentence makes me think about depends upon what I am

35
-P-A-G-E-34
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
animal which plays, and has a period of more or less 
protracted childhood, there are two differences in the com- 
bination of situation and response. In the first place, 
the hunting response can be set off by the sight of the small 
escaping animal without that inner drive of hunger being 
needed. And secondly, other small escaping animals only 
remotely resembling the natural prey may set it off, or even 
a whirling dead leaf or a bit of stick may do so. 
The inner drive which belongs to the mature instinct 
being absent, the hunting which ensues is not carried out 
so far as to lead to eating the prey or, in the case of the 
fighting instinct, to actual wounding or killing of the 
opponent. Instead of the directed drive of hunger or of 
anger, there is just the aimless drive of youthful energy 
easily diverted into any channel. All the instinctive actions 
of the mature animal may, in fragmentary portions, take 
a place in the play activity of the young: but they are 
divorced from the emotions of anger, fear, lust, from the 
inner states such as hunger, which accompany them later, 
and instead they are pervaded all alike by a general sense of 
well-being and light-heartedness. 
The picture thus presented is one showing, in the young 
animal, imperfectly developed instincts, or portions of later 
instinctive chains, partially divorced from any binding 
alliance with specific situations, and from association with 
definite emotional drives. The selection and survival of 
the fittest which formerly went on among the individuals 
of a generation now goes on among the responses of that 
individual to the environment of his childhood. For the 
specifically equipped animal, the absence from the environ- 
ment of just its own proper prey would cause death. For 
the animal that we are discussing, the absence of what had 
formerly been the usual prey of its parents would only cause 
the more generally directed hunting instinct to learn to 
attach itself, during the play of childhood, to the nearest 
available similar prey. The hunting play would shift its 
86
-P-A-G-E-35
  PLAY 
association gradually from bits of fur or leaves to bits of the 
mother’s food, to wounded specimens of prey now hunted 
by her, to any small suitable animals in the neighbourhood, 
and accommodation to the environment would (if too violent 
an alteration were avoided) take place in the individual, 
instead of whole generations having to be decimated to 
bring about adaptation. Natural selection by survival of 
the fittest individuals would, it is true, still go on; but 
the selection would be of those most fitted to learn by play, 
not of those fitted to perform perfect specific acts. If the 
fashions changed (to return to our tailor analogy), there 
would be no need to buy and scrap hundreds of garments 
in search for the right cut: attention could be concentrated 
on getting good cloth, leaving the cut to the tailor. 
To take a specific example, and the most important one, 
consider the difference between an animal born with instinc- 
tive cries attached to certain situations such as being alarmed, 
being alone, courting, etc., and an animal born with just 
an aimless tendency to make vocal sounds and to enjoy 
doing so. The former animal cannot learn vocal connections, 
his small repertory is ready made. The latter animal learns 
speech. The human child has the connection of the vocal 
responses to things and events made, during the period when 
he plays aimlessly at the game of babbling, by the enthusiasm 
with which some of his efforts are hailed, and imitated, by 
his nurse and parents, which causes him to repeat them 
and associate them with objects, while other of his efforts 
are ignored and sink into disuse. It would be a long course 
of evolution before beings were evolved who said “ milk” 
when thirsty, if we followed the plan of killing those who 
didn’t. It would no doubt be conceivable under certain 
circumstances. But nature found it easier to select just those 
who enjoyed aimless babbling, leaving to another kind of 
selection the job of attaching the response “ milk ” to that 
situation of being thirsty. 
And this throws, I think, a light on that non-inheritance 
87
-P-A-G-E-36
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
of acquired characteristics spoken of on page 24. If it be 
true that selection for plastic response and a period of play 
was found by Nature to produce races of animals who 
conquered those who possessed ready-made fixed instincts, 
would one not expect as a corollary to find that acquired 
characteristics are not inherited ? If they were, would not 
that be a retrograde step, undoing the step in advance made 
when play entered the world. To put on the worn garments 
of the previous generation will be just as bad as to put on 
ready-mades. A race of beings with fixed inherited habits 
would be just as unfitted to survive as a race with fixed 
unalterable instincts, and indeed would be indistinguishable 
from them. Man has won in the race against animals with 
more fixed instincts, and can, if he wishes, exterminate any 
one of them, just because of his childhood period of play. 
And the adaptability which that play period gives him would 
be just as much jeopardized by the inheritance of newly 
fixed habits as of older fixed instincts. Man is par excellence 
an animal that learns. It is far more important to be able 
to learn than to have learned. Progress in evolution is like 
finding the centre of a maze. It is better for each generation 
to re-enter the maze with the power of learning than to start 
at the point, possibly in a blind alley, at which the previous 
generation finished. Inheriting acquired characters would 
involve blind alleys. 
88
-P-A-G-E-37
CHAPTER V 
THE LEARNING PROCESS 
Man is par excellence the learning animal. He is not the only 
learning animal; indeed, far down in the scale of animal 
life there are creatures which can perform simple acts of ~ 
learning. But man can learn more readily, and can learn 
more subtle responses, than any other being—far more. 
Just because of this, however, it is very desirable to begin 
our study of the learning process with animals, and later 
see to what extent the laws there found can be applied to 
man. 
There is a little microscopic organism called the stentor 
which is in shape rather like a trumpet. Its stalk attaches 
it to some water-plant or bit of debris in the water in which it 
lives, and it constructs a tube of flocculent matter into which 
it can withdraw for protection. When protruding from this 
tube it draws the surrounding water into its “mouth” 
by means of a fringe of cilia or hairs which move backwards 
and forwards, quickly in and slowly out. By this means 
small fragments of edible substance are brought to its 
digestive apparatus. 
Whenever any obnoxious substance is thus swept into its 
mouth, this animalcula has a reflex response adapted to 
getting rid of it, for the stentor first bends to one side, and 
then, if this does not suffice, its cilia change their flickering 
so as to reverse the current which until then they had been 
creating. This can be observed when a little cloud of 
carmine dye is put into the water near at hand.1 After a 
1 Jennings, H. S., Amer. Journ. Physiol. 1902, viii, 23-60. 
89
-P-A-G-E-38
INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
moment the cilia then resume their previous action, sweeping 
neighbouring water into the mouth. 
If the quantity of dye placed in the water is such that 
a short reversal of the cilia is not sufficient to clear it away, 
further reversals will occur. While if three or four such 
reversals are not successful, the animalcula contracts its 
stalk, thus retreating into its tube, and waits till the clouds 
roll by. 
Presently, after half a minute or more, it emerges again, 
and its cilia recommence their wave motion. If dye is very 
shortly reintroduced into the adjacent water, the former 
responses will again be made, first the bending, then the 
cilia reversal, and then, when this proves unsuccessful, 
the stalk contraction. 
So far there is nothing which need, perhaps, be called 
learning. This animal has two or three responses to the 
- presence of obnoxious matter in the surrounding water. One 
of them it tries first: and when several efforts with this 
response have failed, it carries out the other. The situation 
which causes the first response is just the presence of dye in 
the water. The situation which causes the other response 
is different. It is the presence of dye in the water, plus 
the recency of a number of failures to obtain relief. 
We must suppose that something of the nature of memory 
exists in the animalcula, not in the sense that it consciously 
remembers, but in the sense only that some change in its 
organism has taken place as a result of these failures to obtain 
relief from the carmine dye. 
If now the experiment be continued, and dye is every 
time introduced into the neighbourhood as soon as ever the 
animal emerges, we find that a kind of learning process goes 
on, inasmuch as on each occasion fewer and fewer efforts 
are mada to sweep the dye away by ciliary movements, 
more and stili more quickly does the creature take refuge 
in its tube, until finally it does so without any preliminary 
ciliary reversals at all, After a few more trials a new kind 
40 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
  THE LEARNING PROCESS 
of response sets in, a response now to the situation, “ presence 
of dye in the water and a large number of unsuccessful 
responses of all the earlier kinds.” The new response is 
for the creature to jerk itself away from its anchorage and 
swim off to seek new quarters. 
We must, of course, beware of attributing to the animal- 
cula any of the feelings and thoughts which a human being 
would have under similar circumstances. We need not 
postulate any consciousness at all. But to obtain learning 
it is essential that the organism under study should have 
more than one response to the same situation, or otherwise 
there will be nothing from which to select. The most one 
could then do would be to teach the organism not to respond 
at all, a form of teaching which is indeed of great importance 
in character training. 
The “same situation” here is the presence of dye in the 
water, and the four responses possible are bending, ciliary 
reversal, withdrawal into the tube, and swimming away. 
True, the situation progressively changes owing to the con- 
tinued non-success of the first response, in the sense that 
the inner “set” of the organism changes. But the external 
situation is the same, and the animal “learns ”’ presently 
to make not the ciliary response but the withdrawal 
response. 
Multiple response to the same situation is, then, necessary 
for learning to set in. From these responses one can be 
selected because it, brings some kind of advantage, whereas 
the others do not. In the case we have been considering 
the possible responses are arranged in a kind of order already, 
since we know that an ordinary stentor! will try the bending 
first, the ciliary reversal next, then the withdrawal, and then 
the swimming away. And itis probable that a very short 
period of vacation from our “ teaching”? would make our 
“pupil” forget what he has “learnt”? and return to his 
ciliary reversal. Permanent learning is probably not in this

  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
case possible, and it is doubtful whether it can really be called 
a case of learning in the sense of the formation of habits of 
response. 
With animals higher in the scale, however, the various 
responses to the same situation cease to be arranged so 
definitely in an order. One cannot say with certainty which 
of the possible responses will be made first. No doubt the 
actual response is determined by the total situation and the 
inner set of the organism. But a very slight change in either 
may change the response. Suppose we shut up a hungry 
chicken inside an enclosure which is rather confined and 
small for it, and from which two passageways run, one being 
a blind alley and the other leading to food and the com- 
panionship of other chickens and the mother hen.! To 
this situation the chicken responds by peeping, by rush- 
ing about, by attempting to scale the walls of the 
enclosure in a sort of flying scramble, and by running 
along the passageways. Just which of these things 
it will do first cannot be predicted. What can be 
predicted is that it will do them in rapid succession and 
apparently aimlessly. It will repeat trials which did no good 
before, and will, up to a limit, become more and more 
vigorous in its efforts. Sooner or later it will run far enough 
along the passage which leads to companionship and food, 
will rejoin the hen and recommence pecking. 
If it is presently placed again in exactly the same outer 
situation, and in the same inner condition as regards hunger, 
sleepiness, etc., it will do the same. It will not immediately 
choose the passage which leads to freedom, but will make a 
large number of aimless rushes, etc. Yet if the experiment is 
repeated again and again, the length of time taken by the 
chicken to escape will gradually become less. It will try the 
correct response earlier and earlier, until finally it has 
“learnt” to make its way out of the enclosure without 
delay.

THE LEARNING PROCESS 
  Now one law of learning which everyone knows is what 
might be called the Law of Practice, namely that any action 
which is done frequently becomes on that account easier to 
do and more likely to be done. But this case of the chicken 
shows very clearly that the Law of Practice is not the only 
factor in learning. The chicken practised the correct 
response only once per trial, for after a correct response 
the trial ceased, it got out of the enclosure. Incorrect 
responses, on the other hand, such as jumping up at the wall, 
may be made, and are made, several times in each trial, 
indeed, very frequently in the earlier trials. Practice alone, 
therefore, ought to have fixed the incorrect rather than the 
correct response. In what way then does the correct response 
differ from the others ? Common sense tells us that it differs 
because it puts the chicken into a new condition, it relieves 
it from loneliness and hunger, it satisfies certain inner 
cravings. We must assume that this satisfaction somehow 
makes this response more likely to recur when next the 
situation is reconstituted. Not certain to recur, for then the 
chicken would on second trial go straight out by the proper 
passageway, and that is not what we actually find; but 
more likely to recur, and therefore recurring at an earlier 
stage at the later trials. 
The type of learning thus illustrated may be called Trial _ 
and Error learning. It arises when an animal has more 
ii one response to a situation. Confronted by the situation, 
the animal tries its responses over until one succeeds. 
Confronted later by the same situation, it again tries its 
responses over, but the response which was associated with 
satisfaction somehow has thereby become facilitated a little, 
and so the improvement goes on till the proper response 
comes to be made without other trials. It is Satisfaction 
which has selected the response. Practice will now stamp 
itin. For as the trials progress the correct response, which 
at first got less practice than the incorrect, comes to catch 
up in this respect. Toward the end, while the correct 
48 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
response is always made, each of the various incorrect 
responses is only made occasionally! Finally only the 
correct response gets practice. If the situation is left 
unpractised for a long time, the chicken will partly or wholly 
forget its trick, and will have to relearn it. 
This learning by Trial and Error, by the aid of the laws 
of Satisfaction and Practice, will occupy us a good deal, 
for we shall wish to find out whether all learning is of this 
type, or whether any new laws are needed as we proceed to 
study learning in higher animals and in man. It will be our 
duty, if we wish to act in a scientific manner, to avoid 
making any further hypotheses unless we feel absolutely 
forced to do so. Of course, the Law of Satisfaction includes 
the opposite case of punishment or dissatisfaction. If a 
third passageway had been open, so arranged that when the 
chicken went along this passageway it received an electric 
shock, it would have learned to avoid this passageway sooner 
than it learned to avoid the non-electrified one. Going along 
the blind alley in any case, however, leads to disappoint- 
ment, to dissatisfaction ; and so we ought perhaps to call 
our law the Law of Satisfaction and Dissatisfaction. 
Now let us contrast with our chicken the behaviour of a 
1 To illustrate the way in which, it is suggested, the reward resulting 
from the successful movement makes it more likely to occur when the 
situation is again met with, imagine an experiment with a pack of cards, 
the fifty-two cards of which represent the random responses made by the 
imprisoned and hungry animal. Draw a card, which will represent 
the first response the animal makes. Replace it in the pack, shuffle well, 
and draw another card, representing the second response made. One 
response will follow another in random order, and sometimes a card 
may recur. Sooner or later, however, the card representing the success- 
ful response will be drawn, say the six of hearts. Now, to represent the 
stamping in effect of the satisfaction which success brings, suppose we 
add another six of hearts to the pack (making fifty-three cards in all). 
When we now repeat the whole experiment, the six of hearts will be 
a little more likely to be drawn. It will not, as a rule, be drawn at once, 
The successful response will not, that is, be made at once as soon as the 
second trial is begun. But the odds are in favour of its appearance a 
little earlier than in the first trial. Every time the six of hearts is drawn, 
let an additional six of hearts be added to the pack. After a while the 
chances in favour of this card being drawn will be very high, though on 
any one occasion it may take many draws before it appears. Gradually 
it will come to be the almost certain event, as the pack comes to contain 
dozens and even hundreds of this particular card.

  THE LEARNING PROCESS 
human being in a similar situation. Suppose a man just 
about dinner time is shut in a room with two doors, 
one leading to the dining-room and a company of friends, 
the other leading into a blind alley. His behaviour will, 
at any rate apparently, differ from the chicken’s. He 
will not rush about in fruitless dashes at the walls. He will 
at once select a door, open it, and if it is the wrong one 
he will go to the other and enter the dining-room. If placed 
in the same situation next day, he will avoid the wrong door ; 
or if he should perhaps fail to remember, he will learn in a 
very short series of trials. It may be said that the man 
consciously remembers and acts accordingly, whereas the 
effect on the chicken is some influence on the nerves which 
facilitates but does not ensure the correct choice next day, 
an unconscious influence. 
But is the situation into which we have placed the 
man really comparable with that into which we placed the 
chicken ? Suppose a giant had taken the man and put him 
into a dungeon, would there not then be the possibility of 
rushing about and acting vigorously but aimlessly ? Or 
suppose, instead of fluttering his feelings, we simply give 
the man something harder to do. Give him a mechanical 
puzzle in which two pieces of bent metal have to be separated 
without the use of force; which can only be accomplished 
by getting them into just the correct relative positions, or 
into a sequence of such positions. When we try such a 
puzzle, do we not find ourselves making “trial and error ” 
movements ? Do we not usually succeed, after a long series 
of aimless manipulations, without knowing exactly what it 
was we did to achieve success ? Do we not make many fruit- 
less manipulations even after one or two successes, and only 
come gradually to reduce the time taken ?1 Perhaps there 
is no essential difference, but only one of degree, between the 
chicken’s learning and the man’s learning. 
The reader may reply that sooner or later the man “‘ under-

    INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
stands ” how to solve the puzzle, and after that moment 
the trials and errors disappear suddenly. Though this is 
not what is actually found if the puzzle is a difficult one, we 
must bear the point in mind, and ask ourselves whether there 
are two kinds of learning, one by trial and error, and the other 
by insight and understanding. There are certainly some 
provinces of learning in which man uses mainly trial and 
error. For instance, consider learning to drive a long and 
straight ball at golf. There is no doubt very considerable 
advantage to be gained by having a teacher who gives us a 
good model, and warns us against faults. But in any case 
a very considerable amount of trial and error there must be, 
and good driving can be learnt, and has been learnt, just by 
driving and driving and driving. Naive learning of this 
_ sort, indeed, is probably best, provided that there is a strong 
enough incentive to continue, that the dissatisfaction at 
bad drives does not lead to discontinuance of the game, 
and that there is occasionally seen a model of what can be 
achieved. When anyone learns in this way he cannot usually 
say just what it is that he does differently that causes him 
to drive better this month than last. When he does say 
what it is, the chances are that he is mistaken, and that 
attention given to this analysed point will only check his 
learning. People drive best when they do not think about it, 
but just put the ball down and smack it away. Since they 
do certainly get better with practice even when unconscious 
of what changes they are making, and since at first they 
certainly practise the wrong thing oftener than the right 
thing, we are forced to assume that in man also, satisfaction 
at a successful movement can somehow cause that movement 
to be repeated more easily, can select it from among the 
dissatisfying movements, even when he is not conscious of 
the exact muscular combinations which formed the success- 
ful movement. Some change, some unconscious change, 
must take place in the nervous system. We turn next to an 
elementary study of the nervous system to see whether this 
46

  THE LEARNING PROCESS 
sort of thing is at all possible or conceivable. Our study 
must be a very elementary study, for only a course of 
practical work in physiology and anatomy could give a 
competent basis to it. We shall indeed speak mainly in 
analogies and similes: and our similes must not be pushed 
too far.

CHAPTER VI 
THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 
  AN animal is like a colony of cells which have each specialized 
and taken on separate jobs, just as in a human colony some 
men are farmers, some cartmen, some hunters, and so on. 
A mere agglomeration of cells would not resemble an animal : 
it is essential that they be organized into a unit, into a whole, 
by something which will enable them to co-operate as one 
being. The cells whose job is to form the left leg must 
co-operate with each other; the left leg must co-operate 
with the other legs; the heart must co-operate with the 
arteries and with the lungs; the cells which secrete gastric 
juices must co-operate with the stomach muscles, and so 
on. In the animal body, and in the human body, some cells 
have specialized in duties which have for their object just 
this integrative action. Two kinds of such integration exist, 
which have been likened by Sir Arthur Keith! to a postal 
system and a telegraph system respectively. The telegraph 
system is formed by the nerves which are our present object 
of study. 
These run away from all the sense organs, including the 
various sense spots in the skin, into the central nervous 
system situated in the spinal column and in the skull. The 
messages they bring in cause other messages to go out to the 
muscles and glands of the body, and lead to their action in 
a regular and organized manner. The fact that such and 
such muscles are moving is itself reported to the central 
1 The Engines of the Human Body, Williams & Norgate, London. 
48
-P-A-G-E-47
  THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 
office, and the receipt of these messages may cause further 
orders to be sent out. It is rather like the telegraph and 
telephone system of a large army in the field. Messages 
come in from the eyes of the army, from the scouts, the 
aeroplanes, the observation posts, etc. These messages do 
not usually go direct to the commander-in-chief and his 
staff, they are received and considered first by lower officers ; 
and in the case of many of the messages these lower officers 
issue the orders which lead to the simple movements of 
troops necessary to deal with the situation. When the 
situation which the various messages reveals is more 
complicated, however, the information is relayed on to 
headquarters, and there is discussed by the heads of staff, 
who may call each other up repeatedly on their office tele- 
phones to consult about it. Finally orders go out from the 
commander-in-chief which lead to co-ordinated movements 
of battalions, to speeding up of ammunition supply, to 
stopping leave and stopping letters, and to an increase in 
the activity of the medical units in anticipation of the 
necessary evacuation of the wounded. ‘The battalions 
concerned will send in reports of their movements during 
the battle, and further orders issued from headquarters 
will depend largely upon these reports. The telegraph and 
_ telephone system of a modern army is engaged in this 
integrating work which co-ordinates the army into a unit 
acting under control from headquarters. 
The nerves which form the cables of the human telegraph 
system are composed of bundles of long thin nerve cells 
called neurones. A neurone is a cell just like any other cell 
of the body or just like an independent animal cell such 
as Ameeba. But its form is specialized and its composition 
is specialized in a way directed entirely towards its duties as 
a carrier of messages. From its cell body goes out a long, 
thin projection (often with a tasselled end) called the axone, 
and it is these axones which, grouped in cables, form the 
nerves. One of these may be several feet in length, for 
/ 49 D 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
instance an axone reaching from the lower part of the spinal 
column to the toe. From the cell body, too, there go out 
in the opposite direction, much-branched thin, hair-like 
projections called dendrites.1 The whole, dendrites, cell 
body, and axone, form a unit along which a “ message,” a 
change of chemical composition, can pass. Moreover, the 
message only goes one way. A different neurone is required 
to bring back a reply. The disturbance passes from the 
dendrites to the axone in each neurone. 
In the simplest kind of nerve message it is conceivable 
(though it is highly improbable that anything so simple ever 
really occurs) that only two neurones are concerned. One of 
these starts in a sense organ, say in a pain spot in the hand. 
It runs in to the spinal column where its tassel-like endings 
are entangled with the dendrites of cnother neurone, an 
efferent neurone (those which carry messages in are called 
afferent, out efferent). The chemical excitement, or whatever 
it is, passes from the one neurone-ending to the other, such a 
a place of crossing being called a synapse, and the message 
goes out along the efferent neurone to a muscle which jerks 
the hand away from the pin which has pricked it. Such a 
unit of response is called a reflex arc, and the action a reflex 
action. Invariably, no doubt, several or many such reflex 
arcs are stimulated together, even by the narrowest stimulus 
and for the simplest response. The action need not be at 
all conscious : or if we are conscious of it we become so after 
it has happened. Such actions occur, for example, when we 
slip and regain our balance, when we dodge a sudden snow- 
ball, when we start from a curtain which touches the face 
in the dark. 
If we return to our analogy with the army, we may liken 
such situations to sudden emergencies of a well-known kind, 
dealt with at once by the nearest officer. A sentry in Sector 
D 7 sees an enemy patrol in the darkness. He wakens his 
2 In some neurones the dendrites are represented by one very long 
unbranched projection ; and there are many other varieties. 
50

THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 
next superior officer. The officer does not wait to com- 
municate the news to the commander-in-chief and ask 
what he is to do. On his own initiative he gives orders 
for rapid fire. He passes on the news later, after he has 
done this. 
We may almost look upon what occurs in the spinal 
column in a reflex movement, as being analogous with this 
prompt action on the spot of the non-commissioned officer 
or second-lieutenant. In another case, however, where 
consideration was required, or where the counter measures 
needed orders from a higher rank, the lieutenant in question 
might have passed on the information before acting in any 
way. And the reply might not have come through him at 
all. Indeed, the message might have been relayed back 
till it reached general headquarters. Not otherwise does it 
happen in the spinal column. Instead of going out again 
at once and causing a reflex action, the incoming nerve 
currents may pass from the nerves which brought them in, 
to other neurones which carry them higher up the spinal 
column, or up to the mid brain. And thence, passing over 
synapses to yet other neurones, they may go to the great 
brain itself, the cerebral hemispheres, where complicated 
systems of neurones may carry the excitement hither and 
thither before finally a downward-carrying set convey 
currents which at some lower level pass to efferent or motor 
nerves and cause muscular movement to occur. 
The expression “carrying the nerve current” must not 
be allowed to mislead. The first analogy is with currents 
of water such as waterpipes carry. That is certainly most 
unlike what occurs. The second analogy, that suggested 
by our telegraph system, is with wires which direct an electric 
current. That, also, however, is in many respects unlike 
what occurs. In the first place, nerve currents do not travel 
anything like as fast as electric currents. Then detailed 
examination shows that, although there are certain electrical 
manifestations which do take place, the disturbance which 
51
-P-A-G-E-50
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
passes along a neurone is more like the slow explosion or 
rapid burning which passes along a fuse. Behind the burning 
point the fuse is dead and incapable of further action. And 
so indeed is the neurone for a fraction of a second, but it 
recuperates with extraordinary rapidity. We can ascertain 
how long the fatigue-period is by sending impulses along a 
neurone one after the other quicker and quicker till it begins 
to miss every other one out. 
Reflex actions, then, are actions where a number of con- 
nections between incoming nerves and outgoing nerves are — 
ready made by Nature. These connections are always there. 
They need no operator to make them. And they are not 
accompanied by any consciousness, or at any rate need not - 
be. Some are so unconscious that most people do not know 
about them. Such is the narrowing of the pupil of the eye 
which takes place in a bright light. 
In a continuous series from the pure reflex actions come 
the instinctive actions, such as striking back at a man who 
strikes me, cheering and yelling at a successful feat of strength 
or skill in which a friend has overcome a stranger, or shutting 
my eyes at a repulsive sight. Neurone connections exist in 
us which make these things happen very easily, but not 
with such certainty as the contraction of the pupil of the 
eye. It is probable that these are relayed back to a higher 
level before the return messages start off. They are accom- 
panied, too, by consciousness in an increasing degree. We are 
aware of them, we have inner feelings called anger, or en- 
thusiasm, or disgust, we are aware of the effort to prevent 
their expression on some occasions, an effort which frequently 
succeeds, or succeeds in part. 
Finally we come to actions where it is probable that the 
incoming nerve messages are relayed back right to the 
cerebral hemispheres themselves, and where a very, very 
large number of neurones is involved before the nerve 
currents go out to command the muscles to act. Take the 
case of a man walking from the station to the town hall in 
52
-P-A-G-E-51
em 
  THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 
an unfamiliar city of which, however, he possesses a map. 
Every turn he takes is the subject of consideration and 
reflection. Heis very conscious of his actions and the reasons 
for them. 
But if he makes the journey daily for some weeks he 
ceases to ponder over each turn. The choice of a certain 
route has become habitual. If the habit is practised daily 
for a longer period, it may become so firmly fixed that when 
he wishes to go to some other destination than the town hall 
he may find himself, without thinking, taking the habitual 
path. What has happened, in terms of neurone connection, 
in this case? Compare it with the army. The case was at 
first that the situation was reported right to the general 
commanding, whose decision was made after some thought. 
Later the action became habitual. The general-in-chief 
no longer troubles himself about it. What has happened 
to the route taken by the messages ?_ Have they been short- 
circuited, and is the proper response made by some lower 
officer without waiting for a reply from H.Q.? Or is it that 
the messages still take the same course, going right up to the 
general’s office, but that their presence attracts no attention 
there, and ready printed orders are just sent out, with no 
delay, and by smooth working relays of messengers? In 
terms of neurone action, we suppose that on first traversing 
the route the incoming neurone messages describing the 
situation are sent up to the brain, that large numbers of 
neurones there flash nerve currents back an‘ forth, and that 
finally, other neurones carry messages which are relayed on 
to the muscles. When the action becomes habitual, has the 
neurone circuit been short-circuited at some lower level, 
or does the same set of neurones still respond, only without 
hesitation and without so much consciousness accompanying 
their activity ? 
This is a question we cannot with certainty answer. 
It is probable, however, that there is both some short- 
circuiting and also some facilitation of the paths through 
53
-P-A-G-E-52
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
the upper brain, through the general’s office. Consider 
the army again. Lieutenant A receives the news of a 
certain enemy action. He passes it on up the hierarchy of 
officers to the general. But his duty also requires him to 
warn his fellow lieutenants B, C, and D. Presently the 
order comes back for C and D to move, and finds them ready 
to move, thanks to A’s warning. Suppose this identical 
situation recurs again and again. C and D will get more 
and more accustomed to receiving orders to move, a little 
while after receiving A’s warning. Some day they may 
be so ready to move that they do so as soon as the telephone 
message from headquarters begins, or as soon as the general’s 
messenger is seen approaching. There is both short-circuiting 
and less attention to A’s message at headquarters. 
B, C, and D are instinctive or reflex, or earlier habitual 
actions, and A is a situation a little bit like that which sete 
off B, a little like that which sets off C, a little like that 
which sets off D. A sends neurone messages to all of 
them, but they are not quite the right messages. Not 
until the further message from the brain comes do C 
and D act; while B relapses into quiescence. C and 
D are ready to act, they receive orders to act, and this 
situation is satisfying. B is ready to act but receives no 
orders, or no permission, to act. This situation is unsatis- 
fying. B will gradually cease taking any notice of A’s 
warning, while C and D will go off on that warning with 
little or no further encouragement. 
It is at the synapses, where one neurone makes communi- 
cation with others, that, as we believe, the events take 
place which decide the path the nerve current will take. 
It may pass along various paths, and these will have different 
degrees of resistance. That path which is frequently taken 
by a nerve current comes to have a less resistance. This 
lessening of resistance, which is believed to take place at 
the synapses, may be an actual growing into closer con- 
tiguity of the end brushes, or tasselled ends of the neurones, 
54
-P-A-G-E-53
  THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 
as two trees might closely interlock their twigs and small 
branches. Or it may be some change in the chemical com- 
position of the intervening substance. 
Whatever it is, the facts as to acquiring skill which we 
considered in the previous section seem, at least to the 
present writer, to imply that when an action is successful, 
as when a drive at golf is successful, the state of body and 
mind which we call feeling satisfied at the success, pleased 
at the success, must somehow act on the synapses over which 
the nerve currents have just passed to direct that successful 
action, and cause them to acquire a slightly lowered 
resistance. This does not seem to be physiologically 
impossible, though as far as I am aware there is no physio- 
logical evidence to show that it takes place. Its physiological 
possibility would depend on the condition of the neurones 
and synapses remaining slightly differentiated for a long 
enough period to allow of the afterglow of pleasure somehow 
influencing them differently from others. 
There is no necessity for the psychologist to interpret 
his facts, or to couch his theories, in physiological terms, 
and it is as well to emphasize this point here. The observed 
psychological fact from which we started some pages ago 
was that improvement in the skilful performance of some 
action does actually take place, even although the clumsy 
elements of the action are in the early stages of practice 
repeated more often than the correct elements. From this 
the need of something more than the mere law of practice 
follows: and the required addition, it is suggested, is that 
satisfaction encourages and dissatisfaction discourages the 
repetition of certain muscular patterns, even if we are not 
clearly conscious, or not at all conscious, of what those 
patterns are. To make this explanation conceivable in terms 
of what is known of the neurones and their connections is 
the object of the present section, but the law of satisfaction 
and dissatisfaction does not stand or fall with the correctness 
of what is here said, and surmised, about the neurones.

Only one has a strong desire to make the whole of knowledge 
hang together, and few students can speak and think of the 
learning process without forming some picture of what goes 
on in the brain and nerves. Let us, however, return to the 
observation of acts of learning once more, and in particular 
to that form of experiment known as maze-running. 
56
-P-A-G-E-55
  CHAPTER VII 
MAZE EXPERIMENTS 
Mazz experiments have been carried out by a large number 
of experimenters, with mice and rats mainly, but also with 
other animals, including tortoises. They can also be per- 
formed with human beings, either with large mazes, or with 
small drawings, or in the special way to be described later 
in this section. 
The simplest form of maze for experimental purposes 
is one in which at each choice of paths one path is a cul-de-sac. 
Such a maze is shown for example in the accompanying figure. 
The rat is put in at P, and when he reaches the centre H 
he finds some favourite food. The length of time taken, the 
number of blind alleys entered, the number of false returns 
over any alley, are all noted, and a gradual improvement 
is found in all these respects till the maze is learned and the 
rat runs unerringly to the food box. Needless to say, care 
has to be taken that he does not run by following the scent 
of a former trial. 
In such a maze, the law of satisfaction may be conceived. 
of as operating because of the dissatisfaction at having to 
retrace one’s steps out of a blind alley, when a wrong turn 
is taken, and the satisfaction at being able to penetrate 
more deeply when a correct turn is taken. On the occasion 
of the first run this, and the further dissatisfaction of being 
returned to the maze should the entrance P be reached 
again, suffice to cause the food box to be reached ultimately. 
On future runs there is the memory of the food to incite 
to perseverance. Exploring along alleyways when in a 
state of hunger is no doubt a native tendency in a rat, and 
57

provided he keeps moving, and is turned back whenever he 
tries to come out at P, he will by sheer chance come finally 
to the middle, even if he did not avoid blind alleys just 
previously explored. 
Let us try an artificial experiment in which we throw a 
coin at each choice of paths and imagine we turn to the right 
  P 
hand for heads, left hand for tails. Here is one such trial, 
, made by actually throwing a coin (the letters show the path 
according to the letters of the diagram). 
P 
Nor V? The coin gives a tail, so we take N. Go in to N, discover 
it is a blind alley, come out again, and then ask : 
Por V? The coin gives tail, so take V. 
ZorL? The coin gives head, so take L. 
58
-P-A-G-E-57
  MAZE EXPERIMENTS 
On coming out of L we ask : 
VorZ? Coin says V. We reach P and ask : 
PorN? Coin says N. 
Por V? Coin says V, 
and so on, the path finally being found to be (including the 
above moves) as follows : 
PONV LVN V UY PV LVN PON V-Z 8 2 y

This path, if traced out on the diagram, looks quite like 
a real maze-run ; but really a rat would not keep on taking 
blind alleys repeatedly, for dissatisfaction at coming to a 
dead wall would make them less likely to be re-entered, 
However, assume that, on this first occasion, chance alone 
has led the rat, as chance alone led our choice of a path with 
the aid of a tossed penny. 
Now suppose the rat is started on a second run of the maze, 
and let us see what would happen if only the law of use 
acted. Moreover, suppose that it acts infallibly. On entry 
at P, will the rat take N or V? If we examine the record 
we find that on its previous entries it took N three times 
and V only twice. It will, therefore, take N, and the law of 
use alone will never enable it to get rid of entering N. In 
the same way we can find the whole route which the rat 
would take on this its second trial. It would bb PN VLV 
PNVLVPNVLVP and so on ad infinitum.2 By the 
law of use it would never reach the food box. Indeed, we 
only allowed it to reach the food box at all in the first run 
1 V is a more recent reaction than N, and if recency as well as frequency 
were regarded, this following paragraph would have to be rewritten in 
its details. If we take recency entirely to override frequency we get the 
following: PVZKEQBOTCYSJH. The blind alleys Q, 0, J, in this run would never be eliminated by recency or frequency if they alone 
acted. And recency if applied during the first run would effectually 
prevent any rat which once took a return path from ever getting to the 
centre, which is not true to the facts. 
2 In other cases it might reach the centre: but some blind alleys 
would always remain and would never be eliminated.

by not allowing the law of use to act till the run was over: 
for otherwise the rat having once returned to P would keep 
on doing so always. 
Clearly then a Law of Satisfaction and Dissatisfaction is 
essential to explain improvement. Let us say that when a 
blind alley has been already negotiated in the same run, 
the chances are only 1 in 4 of the rat entering it, if again 
‘confronted with a dilemma of which that particular blind 
alley is one horn. Start a second rat off on its first trial, 
turning it to right or left by the head or tail of a penny at 
each alternative, except that when a “ previous ” blind alley 
is reached two successive heads (or two tails) are needed 
before the rat enters. In an actual trial I obtain the 
following : 
PNVLZKEBOTCYUYCACXCACYSH 
This has considerably shortened the run: but if the reader 
will actually make the experiment for himself he will see 
that unless we add some device to represent reluctance to 
return along an alley already traversed (other than the 
blind alleys, already considered) there is great danger that 
the rat, once reversed, will run backwards clean out at P 
just because of his reluctance to enter blind alleys. 
If the reader will in imagination put himself in the place 
of the rat he will see that one difficulty is to recognize whether 
any present alternative has been negotiated before, and to 
recall which of the two paths was chosen. To get informa- 
tion about this it is very helpful to try a maze oneself, but 
without looking at the diagram, for that makes it too easy. 
Try the following experiment on some friend, and later get 
him to try it on you after changing all the letters. 
Give the following instructions : 
I am going to ask you to find your way through a simple maze. 
You will not be shown the maze, but I will ask you to choose between 
8 pair of letters which I will say to you, in order to see which turn 
you take. Every time you are offered such a choice, one of the 
letters offered will stand for a blind alley from which, if you enter 
60 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  MAZE EXPERIMENTS 
it, you must emerge by the same way as you go in. The other 
letter stands for the proper route. I shall sometimes give the 
blind alley first of the two, and sometimes second, so pay no atten- 
tion to the order of the pair of letters. Each alley has its own 
letter by which it is always called, just as streets have names: 
and the letters have been distributed to the alleys quite at random. 
Now, after entering, do you choose N or V ?3 
Now offer at each question that pair of letters to 
which the subject’s wanderings in the maze have brought 
you, and record all his answers. When he reaches H say 
“That is the goal,” but do not emphasize the letter. Give 
your subject as many “runs ” as his good nature will stand : ? 
and get him to give the maze or a similar one, to you, first 
altering the letters. You will find, as with rats, that your 
performance on the whole improves, whether measured by 
time taken or number of errors made, though not without 
relapses into former errors. You will recognize that you 
have been in a blind alley by the fact of the recurrence of 
letters already passed by. You may formulate a certain 
tule (can you state it ?) about your proper action in case the 
same letter occurs in consecutive pairs presented to you. 
You may find a blind adherence to this rule, if you should 
carelessly get “‘ reversed,” leading you clean out of the maze 
again. You will certainly have more poignant feelings as 
to the laws of use and of satisfaction in maze-running than 
you would have otherwise experienced. 
An actual experiment on these lines, in which the run was 
shortened by making T the goal, gave the following ‘“‘ runs ” 
lL PNVLZKGEQBT = 11 moves

2 It is probably best, unless he has very great patience, to shorten the 
maze by finishing the run at some earlier point, as in the example below.

This is typical in that blind alleys near the goal are rapidly 
eliminated. Note how soon the final run home of K EBT 
is acquired. It seems to show also the persistence of a bad 
habit (a reluctance to go into’ K), and there is a strong 
suggestion that after the third run a sudden “insight” 
occurred, after which learning was rapid. 
In this experiment the subject has the advantage that 
each alley was uniquely designated by its letter: and 
therefore a good memory could enable him to say whether 
a certain situation had been experienced before. But 
when the rat runs its maze the alleys are all alike. It may 
observe minute differences: but this is unlikely, for all 
efforts to reduce any such fail to check its powers of learning. 
Suppose you try a mental maze again, being asked only 
“right or left” at each alternative, and being told whenever 
. you enter a blind alley. This makes your knowledge that 
you have gone wrong at any point more immediate and 
definite. On the other hand you will be able on a second 
“run” to recognize where you have got to in the maze only 
by the sequence of previous right and left turns. You will 
indeed learn the maze as a pattern of right and left turns 
following one another. You may form rational rules, such 
as that if you get into a blind alley by a left turn, you 
had better make another left turn when you emerge. If 
you blunder once and get reversed, you will find such a 
rule leading you back steadily to the entrance, and you 
will have no letters to warn you that you are traversing 
familiar streets. However, it may occur to you that an 
infallible obedience to such a rule, which one might call a 
‘general sense of progress,’ would do instead of a Law of 
Satisfaction and Dissatisfaction. Let us try another coin

experiment, only making the correct turn always on coming 
out of a blind alley. In an example with the same maze 
figured on page 58 I get : 
PINVZEEE QQ BOT ORE.Y US EH 
Avoiding all return runs makes the success of the run 
assured in a fairly short time. But consideration will show 
that on the second run the Law of Use (whether frequency 
or recency be taken as most important) will simply cause a 
repetition of the identical run with all its blind alleys as on 
the first trial. A Law of Satisfaction and Dissatisfaction 
is still required to explain improvement. 
The actual facts of maze learning by rats and other animals 
show that : 
1. Learning takes place gradually as a rule, but cases are 
quoted where sudden improvements occur. 
2. At first returns are just as frequent as forward move- 
ments, but they are rapidly. eliminated, much more 
rapidly than the entering of blind alleys. 
3. Blind alleys near the food box are eliminated more 
quickly than those near the entrance.1 
4, Returns also persist longer near the entrance. 
5. The distance penetrated into blind alleys decreases 
before the alley is eliminated. 
6. Short blind alleys are more rapidly eliminated than are 
long. 
As teachers we can learn that mere repetition is useless, 
there must be pleasure at success; that such satisfaction 
must not be too long delayed ; that a single bad habit may 
hold up a whole learning process; and that there must be 
@ general sense’ of progress. 
The general conclusion which we seem able at this point 
1 This has been questioned and is not always found. See for example 
Warden, Journ. Exp. Peychol., 1923, vi, 192-210. But in Warden’s 
maze the blind alleys were different in other respects; and he does not 
seem to have answered Peterson’s 1920 paper, which indeed he does not, 
I think, refer to. 
68
-P-A-G-E-62
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
to draw from all this is, that the Laws of Frequency and 
Recency do not appear to explain learning in the sense of 
acquiring a concatenation of responses (for they would 
perpetuate errors) and that some selective influence must 
be at work. That selective influence appears to be the 
satisfaction or dissatisfaction felt at this or that result of a 
response. What then, we may well ask, is this satisfaction 
or dissatisfaction which thus plays the part of the fates, 
or of the god of progress ? Selection in the racial group of 
individuals was made by the environment. What is this 
which makes a selection among the responses of an 
individual ? 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
  CHAPTER VIII 
THE NATURE OF SATISFACTION AND 
DISSATISFACTION 
Tue obvious first step in endeavouring to answer such a 
question is to go over in one’s mind situations which bring 
satisfaction or dissatisfaction, and it will then be agreed, 
I think, by everyone, that these situations are such as permit 
expression of some response which is either instinctive or 
habitual: and if the latter, then it can usually be seen that 
the habit has grown out of an instinct, by its sublimation, 
diversion, or perversion. The rat in the maze was in a 
state of hunger. The acts of eating are the natural response ; 
and the food box, by giving them possibility of expression, 
brought satisfaction. The state of hunger causes various 
changes in neurones and hormones! which make a state 
of readiness for food. Or if you like, the state of hunger 
ts that state of readiness. The actual translation into fact 
of these responses which are so ready to happen brings 
satisfaction. 
This is, more or less, Thorndike’s Law of Readiness. 
The feeling of satisfaction itself, however, is a state of 
consciousness, swi generis, which occurs when the organism 
is given opportunity to carry out responses which it is 
ready to carry out: dissatisfaction, one which occurs when 
such responses are prevented, or when unready responses are 
compulsorily performed. 
Satisfaction and dissatisfaction, then, are the result of 
the interaction between the situation and response on the 
1 See below. 
65 E  
-P-A-G-E-64
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
one hand, and the inner set or attitude on the other. These 
inner attitudes are, in the naive animal, of instinctive 
origin: hunger, thirst, lust for the opposite sex, desire to 
be with other members of the species, anger at opposition, 
desire for recognition and homage, fear. The inner drives 
which have been commonly used in psychological experi- 
ments on animals have been hunger, desire to be with 
others of the same species, and pain. It may be presumed 
that other inner desires would give results of a similar 
kind, but this has not been widely put to the test. With 
humans more complex motives have been employed. 
It may be pointed out in passing that to call this hypo- 
thesis—that satisfaction and dissatisfaction select among our 
responses—the ‘‘ pleasure-pain ’”’ theory is hardly correct: 
for dissatisfaction may be produced by a situation of which 
pain in the proper sense forms no part, while pain may be 
present in a satisfying situation. 
Those things are satisfying, then, which, in another 
psychological language, permit instincts or habits, once 
aroused, to run their course. Both instincts and habits 
fall into chains of situations, the response to one situation 
forming the incitement to the next response. One thing 
leads on to another, as we say. And it is satisfying to 
follow on, dissatisfying to check when in full cry. 
Thorndike’s way of looking at this is, that a situation 
not only causes certain neurones to act, but puts other 
neurones in readiness to act. It is perhaps pedantic, but 
it is not absurd to ask just how neurones are put in readiness 
to act. Does some message flash along the neurones telling 
them that they are presently going to be asked to transmit 
a message ? That would be to assume that there are two 
kinds of messages which can pass along neurones, one a 
“get ready” signal, the other an “action” signal. The 
difficulty, it will be seen, is to know how the communication 
system can communicate ahead of its own reactions: and 
especially this is a difficulty if one accepts the doctrine, 
66
-P-A-G-E-65
  SATISFACTION AND DISSATISFACTION 
for which there is a considerable amount of experimental 
evidence, that the reaction of a neurone is an “‘all-or-none ” 
reaction, so that it either goes off for all it is worth, or not 
at all. 
But this difficulty, which is perhaps of my own making 
and possibly would not have occurred to my reader, is not 
necessarily insurmountable, though I think it is serious. 
It arises mainly from thinking of the neurones which act 
in a chain-instinct, or in a chain-habit, as lying end to end, 
like the different sections of the telegraph wire from London 
to Edinburgh. Then, indeed, it would be difficult to see 
how, a message being started at London, any instructions 
to get ready for it could get ahead of the message itself. 
But if we think of a complex of neurones, instead of a linear 
chain, then it becomes easier. We might, for example, 
think of action to be taken by persons in different towns 
in succession. The individuals in Norwich might well be 
warned and assembled in their proper places ready for 
action, and the telegraph operators concerned with com- 
munication between London and Norwich might be warned 
to be in their places, ready for the completion of some 
action at Plymouth which was to give the cue to Norwich. 
In such a way are revolutions, or campaigns, or business 
operations planned, without any need to use any quicker 
method of communication than the telegraph itself. 
But can, then, a neurone carry different messages, as a 
telegraph wire can? No, almost certainly not. The 
analogy with a telegraph or telephone system breaks down 
at this point. Instead of the different messages which one 
telegraph wire can carry, we have in the neurone system 
different combinations of neurones acting together. It is 
assthough each subscriber to the telephone exchange could 
ring up but couldn’t speak. When the subscriber owning 
a telephone rings up, the telephone girl at the central 
exchange sees a little lamp glow at his number on the 
switchboard, asks him what number he wants, and connects 
67
-P-A-G-E-66
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
him accordingly. Instead of that, however, imagine that the 
telephone girl did not ask each subscriber with what number 
he wished to be connected, but instead looked at the whole 
switchboard, saw the pattern which the innumerable little 
lamps formed, and let this decide her as to what connections 
should then be made. The whole pattern of incoming 
nerve currents decides whither the excitement shall be 
diverted. 
A naive reader again may not ask, but some other reader 
is sure to ask, who is the switchboard operator who makes 
the connections? To her there is nothing equivalent in 
the neurone system, whatever there may be in a psychical 
account of the consciousness which accompanies the neurone 
action. Somehow the pattern of incoming nerve currents 
settles the ‘‘ whither ’’ itself. The end brushes of a neurone, 
and the synapses where these end brushes are entangled 
with those of other neurones, somehow not only are stimu- 
lated by a message having come along their own neurone, 
but are differently stimulated according to the pattern of 
surrounding stimulation in others. That is not really 
surprising when. one considers the very extensive rami- 
fications and complexities of many end brushes. The 
whole system is so very complex as to be beyond comparison 
with any mechanical means of communication, mechanical 
in the sense of man-made, artificial. 
We are, let us remind ourselves, discussing the nature of 
satisfaction and. dissatisfaction; we have contemplated 
Thorndike’s view that these consist in a consummation 
of neurone connections which are ready for action, or a 
denial of that consummation ; we have thought over some 
of the difficulties in the way of making a neurone picture 
corresponding to this idea ; and we return now to the possi- 
bility of the readiness for action, whether of the neurones 
or of the muscles and organs, being somehow otherwise 
controlled. On page 48 a hint was dropped that there 
exists in our own bodies not only a telephone or telegraph 
68
-P-A-G-E-67
SATISFACTION AND DISSATISFACTION 
system, but also a postal system. That postal system is 
one which makes use of the blood circulation to carry 
round the body various drug-like chemicals which are 
produced by glands, and which exercise an important 
influence on the action, ‘and on the readiness for action, 
of the different muscles, organs, and neurones themselves. 
It is well known to everyone that what we eat and drink 
can have a considerable effect on what we want to do, and 
on how we doit. Iam tired and depressed, and don’t want 
to study. After a cup of coffee I feel quite different, and 
turn with interest to my work. I am nervous and worried 
about that after-dinner speech, but the dinner puts me all 
right. Indeed, if I have a glass of champagne I may become 
quite confident and want to speak several times. Drugs, 
whether taken as medicines or as bad habits, have an 
effect on our bodies and on our moods. We want to do 
different things when drugged, whether by bromide or 
cocaine or champagne or coffee or roast beef, from what 
we want when we are not drugged. We want to do different 
things at different times even if we do not take drugs: and 
the suggestion lies very near that, somehow, we are being 
drugged then, even although we do not take anything 
into the system from without. And so indeed it is. We 
are constantly being drugged by the products of our own 
glands, and the difference between a man who is depressed 
and one who is elated is not very dissimilar to the difference 
before and after taking a stimulating drug, say alcohol. 
“Intoxicated with delight” is rather more than a mere 
phrase. 
The glands of the body, which produce the “ drugs” of 
which we speak, are of two main kinds. The first are those 
which deliver their secretions along tubes or ducts to just 
the places where they are wanted. They are mostly con- 
nected with the alimentary canal, and serve the processes 
of digestion and assimilation. Such are the salivary 
glands of the mouth, the glands of the stomach, and the 
69
-P-A-G-E-68
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
pancreas, which pours its juices into the small intestine, as 
does also the liver. All these glands, perhaps, and cer- 
tainly the liver, have functions wider than that of merely 
supplying digestive juices, but this wider function can best 
be described and studied in the other class of glands, those 
which have no ducts, but. whose products simply pass 
directly through cell walls into the blood circulation. 
Among these are, for example, the thyroid and the para- 
thyroid glands on the sides of the neck, the supra-renal 
glands just above the kidneys, the pituitary gland, and the 
pineal gland. Each of these is secreting its special product 
and turning it into the blood-stream. The rate of pro- 
duction of each secretion varies from time to time, so that 
now there is more of this, now more of that. These 
changes may be gradual, and take place over long years, 
as when the sex glands gradually come to maturity, or 
they may be quicker, even very sudden. When something 
startles us and gives us a really fundamental fright, these 
glands change in their action, some speeding up, others 
ceasing to function. Different changes occur when we are 
angry, or when we see someone whom we love. The 
different composition of the blood is felt in all kinds of 
organs all over the body: it so affects them that there are 
changes in their readiness for action. Some arteries are 
dilated—in anger those going to the muscles of the limbs— 
some are contracted—in the same case, those feeding the 
organs of digestion. An excess of one hormone (as these 
secretions are called) will make the whole nervous system 
excitable and easily irritated. Another soothes and com- 
poses. What we want to do is in some way dependent 
upon these hormones. What will give us satisfaction 
depends on them in some way. 
This method of communicating throughout the body 
by means of the blood-stream may perhaps be illustrated 
by an addition to our analogy of the telephone system. 
Suppose, instead of calling up all the other subscribers in 
70
-P-A-G-E-69
  SATISFACTION AND DISSATISFACTION 
order to incite them to a certain action, one subscriber just 
telephoned to the waterworks and had a drug put in the 
water. It would reach all the subscribers, and when they 
drank from their water supply the drug would do the 
necessary inciting—or it might be, soothing. 
You will notice that the subscriber who originated the 
action did use the telephone system a little. And so it 
also is in the human body. The eye sees an armed enemy. 
The nervous system carries messages to the adrenal glands, 
they pour adrenin into the blood, and it courses round the 
body, producing certain effects. The analogy with the water 
supply would be closer if in that case some of the towns- 
people were influenced in one way by the drug, others in 
another way, and a third section were unaffected: as 
might be, supposing the drug were, say, whisky. The tee- 
totallers would act in one way, bibulous people in another. 
Adrenin, for example, as a larger amount than usual courses 
round the blood, has the effect of stimulating those parts 
of our organism which are likely to have heavy demands 
made upon them in vigorous muscular action (such as a, 
fight with another man), and of putting comparatively 
out of action those parts which are for the moment useless 
in a fight, such as the digestive organs. 
We see, then, that the whole man is “integrated,” is 
caused to act as one unit, by this interlocking of the 
glandular system with the nervous system on one hand and 
with a large number of organs on the other. Hardly ever, 
or perhaps never, can any isolated stimulus influence just 
one isolated part of the body. By means of the nervous 
system and its ally, the gland system, a response is called 
forth in practically every part, though in the case of the 
simple reflexes and the best established simple motor 
habits the localization of the effect may be fairly complete. 
On the whole, then, that readiness for action which 
undoubtedly occurs in our neurones, when the first of a chain 
of situations is encountered, may at least in part be due to 
vel
-P-A-G-E-70
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
hormonic action. For the rest, especially in chains of purely 
motor responses, accompanied by little or no feeling, we 
may perhaps picture the state of chemical tension at certain 
synapses being changed by the particular pattern of 
neurone activity which has just recently occupied neigh- 
bouring synapses, or indeed some of the same synapses, 
just as railway points may be imagined to be set in a certain 
way because trains in such and such a direction had recently 
passed. Indeed, we know that in complicated systems of 
points at large crossings there are interlocking devices 
which determine within limits what levers the signalman 
must next operate. Something or other, anyhow, causes 
a readiness for action, to “‘ satisfy ” which is “ satisfactory.” 
As we advance in life, the situations which bring us 
satisfaction or dissatisfaction change. Children are bored 
by @ grown-up party, grown-ups are irritated by childish 
amusements—unless they are in childish mood or are the 
parents of the children. Boys talk of their patrol and the 
week-end camp; young men, of girls and games; men, of 
politics or business. Partly, these changing satisfactions 
are due to ripening instincts, as the sex instinct. Partly, 
perhaps, they may be due to other instincts waning and 
losing strength. But also they are due to the steady growth 
of habits, to increase in knowledge, and to the building up 
of sentiments. These different points must each in its place 
engage our attention. 
In part, at least, the changes in what, we like or 
dislike as we grow older arise from instinctive sources. The 
great changes in the instincts occur at the period of 
adolescence, and are indubitable. But before then, many 
have thought to see different instinctive likings emerging 
at different ages, and have endeavoured so to arrange 
school education as to fit in with these observations. 
One fairly clear case of such emergence of instinctive 
desires seems to me to be the tendency which appears in 
boys at six or seven to form gangs and play fighting games. 
72
-P-A-G-E-71
  SATISFACTION AND DISSATISFACTION 
It is most often, perhaps, later than seven, but it is almost 
always seen by nine. The boy of this age adores Indians 
and pirates, he is a keen Wolf Cub and, later, Boy Scout. 
The Boy Scout Movement, indeed, seems almost to make 
concrete the set of instincts of which I am speaking. They 
seem to mark the change from infancy to boyhood. The 
gang spirit passes over into the team spirit which makes the 
playing of team games, like football, a potent appeal at 
about twelve. 
Whether with girls there is anything similar to this it is 
difficult to say. But from the success of the Girl Guide 
Movement it seems probable that there is. 
It would undoubtedly be a very great aid to the teacher 
if other activities could be assigned even approximate dates 
of appearance, but in truth this is a very difficult task. 
And in so far as it can be attempted, one feels strongly that 
in many cases it is the ripening of intelligence rather than 
the ripening of instincts which is the reason of the order of 
appearance of these activities. Babbling precedes scribbling, 
drawing precedes writing ; playing with scooters, skating 
- on roller-skates, riding a bicycle, riding a motor-bicycle, 
come in that order, perhaps (but not always) ; collecting 
things does seem to set in at about eight to ten ; a liking for 
historical stories is certainly earlier than a liking for mathe- 
matics, even for mathematics of simple puzzles forming 
playthings; and so on. How much of this is really due 
to the ripening of instincts and how much to the fashion of 
the suburb or school in which the child finds himself, it is 
difficult to say, nor does it really matter a great deal to the 
teacher. What does matter is that the teacher should 
carefully observe what things in point of fact do most 
interest her class, and each one of her class, at the present 
moment, and should modify what she requires of them 
accordingly, using these things as incentives, and teaching 
those matters which best fit in with the present desires and 
interests of the pupil. For these interests will in any case

  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
change, whether James is right or wrong in his theory of 
the transitoriness of instincts, will change if not for that 
reason, then for some reason connected with the growth 
of habits or the attraction of novelty or what not. 
This law of the transitoriness of instincts to which we have 
just referred is that instincts arise, last for a short or a long 
time (more or less fixed for each instinct), and then wane 
and disappear unless, during their period of strength, they 
have been given opportunity to transmute themselves into 
habits. The famous instance is the “‘ following ” instinct 
of the chicken which causes it to follow its mother hen and 
to develop a habit of doing so which outlasts the instinct as 
instinct ; a habit which persists, indeed, when the “ follow- 
ing ” instinct is replaced by a “ fleeing ” instinct which makes 
the chick run away from every animal except those to which 
it has formed the “following” habit. The proof is that 
in the absence of a hen the chick of the proper age will 
learn to follow a dog or a man, at a slightly later age will 
run in alarm from its own mother. Or if kept from all 
companionship of whatever sort for a suitable time, it will 
never develop the “following” habit, but will flee from 
anyone and everything. 
By analogy we are warned to strike while the iron is hot 
in the case of our human pupils. And whether the analogy 
with the chicken’s instincts be correct or not, there can be 
no harm in piling on the drawing practice, or the roller- 
skating, or the arithmetic, during the months or periods 
when the pupil is most in the mood for them, though that 
does not absolve the teacher from the duty of trying to direct 
those moods and interests, to invent ways of associating 
desirable acquirements with the main interest of the moment, 
and the like. 
A theory of education which has been based upon the 
supposed fixity of sequence in the appearance of the instincts 
is that known as the Recapitulation Theory. This theory 
assumes that the order in which the instincts appear in the 
14 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
  SATISFACTION AND DISSATISFACTION 
child is the same as the order in which they appear in the 
race. The child is supposed to climb up his own ancestral 
tree during his infancy and to pass in succession through a 
series of phases, each of which was once the end or stopping 
place and constituted, in some past epoch, the adult form. 
In each of these stages different things bring satisfaction or 
dissatisfaction. 
The theory is formed by analogy with a similar hypothesis 
in the province of anatomy and physiology. A common 
animal in which this hypothesis appears to find a striking 
verification is the frog, which, living quite apart from its 
parents and independent of them, passes through the stages 
of a unicellular animal, a multicellular animal, a fish (tadpole) 
breathing in the water by means of external gills, a different 
kind of fish possessing internal gills, and finally the air- 
breathing frog with lungs. Many other bodily changes, 
such as the absorption of the tail, accompany this meta- 
morphosis, and it is very easy to imagine the animal stopping 
at any one of these stages in an earlier epoch, and in that 
stage developing sex organs and reproducing itself. This 
imagination is rendered easier and more concrete by the 
knowledge that other amphibious animals, somewhat 
resembling frogs, do to-day sometimes, or even normally, 
stop their development in a tadpole stage and become in 
that stage sexually mature. Such an animal can sometimes 
be accelerated in its progress, as in the case of a Mexican 
example! which only rarely proceeds to the. air-breathing 
stage, but can be induced to do so by being fed with thyroid 
preparation. 
This climbing up the ancestral tree, which can almost be 
said to be directly observable in the case of the frog, also 
occurs in a hidden manner in mammals. During the pre- 
natal period, while still within the mother’s body, the human 
child, for instance, shows certain slits in-the region of the

neck which are taken to represent gills : and the short time 
during which this phenomenon lasts is taken to represent 
the long ages in which, eons ago, our ancestors were fish- 
like and breathed under water. 
It is by an intuitive leap that this not improbable 
hypothesis is extended into regions where its probability 
is much less. In man, the stages representing animal 
ancestry are all passed through before birth. The young 
baby is already a human being. The assumption is made, 
however, that he is passing through a stage representing a 
very early type of man, and that as he grows older he passes 
through stages corresponding with more and more modern 
and civilized periods in man’s history. Consequently, the 
things which will bring him satisfaction at each stage will 
be those things which brought satisfaction to some type of 
primitive or savage man. He will be at one time a hunter 
and a nomad, leading (in his play) an independent existence 
in gangs or small packs like wolves (hence Baden Powell’s 
Wolf Cubs—though presumably that name comes from 
Mowgli). The type of mental pabulum suitable to his mental 
development will therefore most readily be found by bring- 
ing him along the story of the ages, giving him the literature 
and history first of the very earliest known times, beginning 
with myths and passing through sagas to historical periods. 
As an educational practice, this plan or a modified form of 
it has justified itself by experience and needs no support 
1 From the writings of Mr. Julian Huxley I gather that often the organs 
which belong to one period or stage, and which disappear in the following 
stages (as the gills in the frog), do not disappear entirely and utterly 
but are cunningly utilized fer new functions in the new animal. Thus, 
the gill slits of the human embryo become the para-thyroid glands of 
the adult man. If the Recapitulation Theory is also in any measure 
@ correct account of the facts in the mental sphere, as it undoubtedly 
appears to be to some extent in the physical, then no doubt the natural 
way would be, not to repress the instincts and interests of one stage 
when another stage is formed, but to modify and redirect them to fulfil 
&new purpose. As the para-thyroids (essential to man) grow out of the 
now useless gills, so out of the gang spirit, the tribal urge, in boys may 
grow a larger patriotism and a feeling of identity not merely with a little 
gang but with humanity. Out of the excessive sex instincts of the 
adolescent may grow knighthood, poetry, art, religion.

from a recapitulation theory. But its success may be taken 
as some support of that theory. 
There seems to be no doubt that boys do have the Boy 
Scout instincts strongly developed. And that is about 
all that direct observation shows in favour of the Recapitu- 
lation Theory. On the other hand, it seems probable enough 
from analogy, indeed once the facts of anatomical recapitu- 
lation become realized, the mind almost inevitably passes 
on to a similar assumption in the province of the instincts. 
It has been urged against recapitulation, by Thorndike, that 
the sex impulses, which must have come very early in the 
race, come very late in the individual. This is, perhaps, 
hardly a fair objection. The sex impulses occupy a rather 
special position in the theory, for the steps of development 
all lead up to the sexually mature form. It is as though 
indeed the whole matter were a postponement of sex to a 
later and later stage, as though sex development stopped 
the cycle. And so the present late stage of sex develop- 
ment is quite in accord with previous phases. Possibly, 
too, the Freudian conception of sex having its roots away 
back in infancy is not without some bearing on this. 
A more serious objection could, I think, be based on what 
was discussed under the heading of play. According to the 
suggestions there advanced, the higher animals differ from 
those lower in the scale by reason of their less fixed instincts, 
in place of which they have vaguer instinctive tendencies 
which are moulded during an educative period whose natural 
method is the method of play. In their development out 
of lower animals, therefore, these higher animals have not 
simply added new instincts to a previous list, they have 
totally recast those previous instincts; what they have 
added is not merely additive, it is revolutionary, and so, 
however tempting it may be, the Recapitulation Theory, in 
its crude form, must be rejected. There can be nothing 
+ If Axolotl (see page 75) becomes sexually mature in the water- 
breathing form, the time necessary to produce metamorphosis to the 
land form (by feeding with thyroid) is increased by 25 to 50 per cent.

but good in observing and employing any instinctive likes 
which emerge, at the right time; but the important thing 
about childhood is that it is a period when these vague 
instincts, much more indefinite than a recapitulation theory 
would suggest, are modified by the action of the learning 
process.

  CHAPTER IX 
THE ASCENT FROM INSTINCT TO INTELLIGENCE 
(a) Imagery. 
AN animal which has only one response to a given situation, 
and inevitably makes this response, is not said to be intelli- 
gent, but to be a creature of blind instinct. It survives 
because this response is, in the majority of instances, the 
suitable response. It sees only the one point in the situation, 
neglecting all minor shades of difference, and so it is very 
inadaptable. Moreover, its own inner life is very simple, 
for it always has the same attitude or set, or if it has different 
attitudes, the changes are of a crude kind such as hunger, 
or the mating instinct, can produce. Such an animal on 
any occasion would try the same response again and again 
in spite of failure. 
An animal with many responses to a given situation would 
seem more intelligent. It would try @ and fail; then 6 
and fail; then cand d and finally succeed. More accurately, 
it responds to the new situation caused by the failure of a, 
the failure of b, and so on. Or we may put it that its inner 
set is readily modified by its recent experiences. It might 
return to a and try it again later, or even quite soon. Very 
slight differences in the environment or in the set of the 
organism might alter the order in which different individuals 
tried their repertory of responses. We should call such 
conduct “trial and error,” and deny to it any high degree 
of intelligence. It is, however, clearly a step higher than 
the conduct of the animal with one unvarying and inevitable 
response. That animal did not learn by experience at all. 
79 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
It seemed to have no memory. This animal does profit by 
experience, it ‘‘ remembers ”’ its failure long enough to avoid 
making the same response a few seconds later. Moreover, 
if this situation is presented repeatedly to the animal, it 
comes to omit the responses a, b, and c, and to make the 
response @ without any trials. From its repertory, satis- 
faction or the reward of success has selected that which 
succeeds. It is capable of learning. The action of such 
an animal can be conceivably explained entirely by a com- 
paratively brief persistence of the dissatisfaction of failure, 
causing it to respond by 6 when a has failed, and by a 
comparatively mild stamping-in effect of satisfaction ; 
comparatively mild, for it learns but slowly. Such an 
animal—a chicken for instance—has to learn each separate 
simple task separately. It can learn a number of different 
mazes, or how to escape from confinement in a number of 
different boxes, now by walking up an incline, now by flutter- 
ing over a partition wall and going through a tunnel; but 
it learns each of these slowly and separately. The most 
it will do in the way of any improvement is that it may 
begin to attend, more carefully than would a naive animal, 
to certain parts of the gross situation ; as Thorndike’s cats, 
which had learned to escape from a number of problem boxes 
by turning buttons, tweaking pieces of wood, or pulling 
strings, became more attentive to such little bits of the cage 
when placed in a new problem box, exhibiting what Thorn- 
dike calls the law of piecemeal activity, or the enhanced 
potency of certain bits of the situation. It is the beginning 
of analysis. 
Let us, however, go a step farther. We have considered 
the animal which had but one response to a situation, the 
automaton. Next we pictured the animal with a multiplicity 
of responses which it tries in aimless sequence until success 
occurs, showing the typical picture of animal trial and error. 
An animal, however, which had some means of anticipating 
the success or failure of each response without completely 
80
-P-A-G-E-79
  THE ASCENT: IMAGERY 
carrying it out, would save a lot of time and would do its 
trial and error by proxy, as it were. The most obvious 
source of such anticipation is in imagery of various kinds. 
Instead of carrying out the response, the animal has an image 
of itself doing so, and of the accompanying success or failure. 
Probably at first such images can replace only part of the 
response, the Jater part of the chain. It is by the failure 
of a chain of events to follow the accustomed order, indeed,. 
that images first probably occur, as Dr. James Ward has 
urged. A baby, for example, has come to welcome a chain 
of events which culminate in some satisfaction, as the sound 
of an approaching footstep, the opening and closing of the 
nursery door, the sound of its mother’s voice, the embrace 
which follows, and the culminating pleasure of being nursed 
and fed. As it begins this chain of experiences, anticipatory 
excitements occur in the neurones which are to be concerned 
in the later links of the chain. They are very ready 
to explode, and if, on one occasion, the familiar chain of 
situations is broken (say the mother is called away just as 
she approaches) then some of the ‘‘ ready ” neurones may go 
off, enough of them to arouse an “image ’”’ of the mother’s 
voice or her appearance ; much as we take two pulls to a 
rifle and may take the second even when the expected target 
fails to appear. 
If images can thus arise and carry out chains of response 
even when the external stimuli cease, then such imaging 
may take the place of actual response in future situations 
where various responses are possible. I want to build a 
picnic fire. I do not really build it here, there, and every- 
where until I find a place which is sheltered, yet with enough 
air, suitable for sitting round, etc., etc. I do so only in 
imagination ; and, practically without trial, I reject a large 
number of possible (or rather impossible) places. I picture, 
however, my fire built in the remaining more practicable 
positions. I imagine that stone placed across the corner 
of these walls. But I foresee, in imagination, that it will be 
81 F  
-P-A-G-E-80
    INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
uncomfortable sitting among these nettles. Not everything 
is imagination. I stoop down to the stone, I walk towards 
a second possible place, I move my head from side to side 
seeking and trying other places. There is plenty of trial 
and rejection. There may even be fires actually begun 
and rejected only after failure. But much of the trial is 
trial in imagination only, image-experimenting. This form 
of experimenting is undoubtedly rare among animals, and 
unknown among lower animals. But imagery, which makes 
it possible, is almost certainly found in some monkeys, 
in some raccoons, and probably in other animals. In man, 
imagery is rich and abundant, at any rate in children 
and in untutored minds. In minds more accustomed to 
what is called abstract thinking, the imagery is less obvious, 
but is probably in great measure still present, though now 
it has become imagery of words and symbols. For the 
present, however, let us make a short study of concrete 
imagery, of images which are like the real things, though, 
being less vivid and unaccompanied by certain expected 
concomitants, they are not mistaken for the real things. 
Images can be experienced in terms of each of the senses ; 
we can not only see with the mind’s eye, we can hear, feel, 
smell, taste, etc., in an inner way equally well—at least 
equally well is true ofsome-people. Read through the follow- 
ing passage in a quiet room, closing the eyes from time to 
time to assist in visualizing, and keeping on the alert for 
any actual images of smell or taste or motion : 
The scene, as I remember it, had a magical charm. On the 
left, by the side of the lane, rose a crazy footpath of boards and 
posts with a wooden handrail, and a sluice or two below. Beyond, 
the deep millpool slept, dark and still, all fringed with trees. On 
the right the stream flowed off among the meadows, disappearing 
into an arch of greenery. On the bank stood the shuttered, 
humming mill, the water wheel splashing and thundering, like 
a prisoned giant, in a pent house of its own. It was a fearful joy 
to look in and see it rise dripping, huge and black, with the 
fresh smell of the river water all about it (BrNson, The House 
of Quiet). 
82
-P-A-G-E-81
  THE ASCENT: IMAGERY 
With what degree of clearness can you picture this scene ? 
Is it as vivid as a painting ? Has it colour, do you see the 
arch of greenery green? Have you an image of the fresh 
smell of the river water ? Does any image, or as some would 
say, any reproduction, of the emotion of fearful joy arise 
in you? Can you hear the humming mill and the splashing 
wheel, and how do those auditory images compare with 
your visual images for vividness ? Some people, at any rate 
when grown up, have only the one kind of imagery and 
lack the other, or think they do. Such a one would Hilaire 
Belloc appear to be, who wrote this next extract : 
As I thought this kind of thing and still drank up that port, 
the woods that overhang the reaches of my river came back to me 
so clearly that for the sake of them, and to enjoy their beauty, 
I put my hand in front of my eyes, and I saw with every delicate 
appeal that one’s own woods can offer, the steep bank over Stoke, 
the valley, the high ridge which hides a man from Arundel, and 
Arun turning and hurrying below. I smelt the tide. 
Not ever, in a better time, when I had seen it of reality and 
before my own eyes living, had that good picture stood so plain ; 
and even the colours of it were more vivid than they commonly 
are in our English air; but because it was a vision there was no 
sound, nor could I even hear the rustling of the leaves, though 
I saw the breeze gusty on the water-meadow banks, and ruffling 
up @ force against the stream (The Four Men: a Walk through 
Sussex). 
Now I have no greater difficulty in hearing the rustling 
of the leaves than in smelling the tide. But no doubt Mr. 
Belloc is correct when he describes the absence of such 
auditory imagery in his own case. Here is another paragraph 
in which the reader will have opportunity of detecting in 
himself several kinds of imagery, including kinesthetic 
imagery, or imagery of muscle movement; such as you 
may perhaps have if you think of a company of soldiers 
marching along, or of waltzing, or playing the piano, or 
walking upstairs—especially if you think of the occasion 
in the dark when you step on to a non-existent top step. 
Does the memory of that jar not consist partly in a recon- 
83 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
stitution of the feel of muscular jerk? Hero is the para- 
graph in question : 
In the early morning the sky was grey and the atmosphere 
oppressive. But both lightened towards noon, and we were 
reassured. The tent could be pitched, and tea be served outside 
upon the lawn, and we could listen, with indolent enjoyment, to 
the remarks made by the drake in his deep sotto voce bass to an 
intrusive woodpigeon sharing uninvited his meal. In the meadow 
at the far end of the garden men were cutting the grass; the ear 
is not gladdened in this rapid age by the soft sound of scythes 
sweeping through the stalks, and the ring of. blades on the hone ; 
but the whirr of the machine that has displaced the rhythmically 
swaying mower is not unmusical, and patient horses still hold this 
field of labour against petrol-driven engines. So the beautiful 
fragrance of new-mown grass was borne untainted down the yarden, 
and lent a new fragrance to the heaped dish of raspberries and 
currants just gathered (The Lowly Estate, by CRaNstToUN MEt- 
CALFE). 
In this quotation visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, 
and kinesthetic imagery are all possible—sight, hearing, 
smell, taste, and the muscles. To me, at least, the thought 
of the rhythmically swaying mower is, in part, a kinesthetic 
image of swaying as though I were mowing, and especially 
I feel my left foot take the short stamping step forward 
at the end of the swing. If it be correct that the left foot 
moves just in that way at that point, then my muscles have 
remembered it, it has been stored up in the neurone pattern 
which actuates them, for it returned as a kinesthetic image 
before I was aware of it in any other way. 
One can also have images of touch—think of the feel of 
velvet, or of emery paper, or of soap—and of the senses of 
warmth and cold. The suggestion which led us to this 
examination of imagery was that an animal, whose progress 
from crude animal reactions up to the rational actions of 
human beings we are considering, takes a step forward when 
he begins to make his trials and errors in terms of imagery 
instead of actual physical response. The thought naturally 
occurs to one, To what extent do animals differ from human 
beings in their possession of imagery ? 
84
-P-A-G-E-83
    THE ASCENT: IMAGERY 
Any answer to this question runs the grave risk of being 
an argument in a circle. For we cannot, of course, have 
any actual experience of animal imagery, or, for that matter, 
of human imagery other than our own. And so we have to 
conclude from animals’ behaviour whether they possess 
imagery, and then we are going to explain their behaviour 
by means of imagery, a dangerous circle. Yet it may be 
worth while to record one or two instances where psycholo- 
gists of repute have believed that imagery was involved. 
Dr. R. M. Yerkés, for example, found such evidence, to 
his mind, in the behaviour of the monkey, Skirrl, which he 
used in some of his Californian experiments. In these, 
the animal had the choice of more than one door. If the 
correct choice was made, Skirrl was rewarded by a banana 
after passing through a short passage. If the wrong one, 
then on entering the passageway the monkey found doors 
at both ends closed, and was confined for a short time before 
the door behind him was opened and he was free to choose 
again. On one occasion Skirrl made a tremendous racket 
in the passage in which he was confined, and showed so much 
excitement and disturbance that the experiments had to be 
discontinued for some days: and it was found that project- 
ing nails had been left in the floor of that passage, one of 
which had doubtless hurt Skirrl. Many days later, when 
again in the full swing of experimenting, it happened that 
the locks of the door closing behind Skirrl grated rather 
noisily. He acted as he had when hurt, and when released 
rushed out, sat down, and examined his foot. As I said, Dr. 
Yerkes thought this behaviour strong evidence of imagery. 
Dr. W. S. Hunter’s experiments! on rats, dogs, raccoons 
and children are suggestive in this connection. In each 
case—though the dimensions and arrangements of the 
apparatus differed—the subject had the choice of three 
doors, one of which led to food. (For the children the plan 
was to have three bell-pushes, one of which sounded a 
1 Behavior Monographs, 1913. 
85
-P-A-G-E-84
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
‘ buzzer and resulted in “‘candy.’’) Above each door was 
an electric bulb, and the bulb above the correct door was 
turned on. The animals soon learned to go to whichever 
door was lighted. Then, in later experiments, the light 
was turned off before they got to the door, and, ultimately, 
was extinguished before the glass partition which restrained 
them was raised. The object was to see how many seconds 
could be allowed to elapse between showing the light and 
releasing the animals, without reducing the accuracy of 
their response. There was considerable individual variation, 
but the best performances were approximately: rat 10 
seconds, dog 5 minutes, raccoon 25 seconds, child of 6 years 
35 minutes. The rats and the dogs, however, were only 
able to make the correct response by facing the light when 
it was turned on and remaining in that position during the 
absence of the light until released. They failed if they 
moved. In their case, therefore, there is in these experi- 
ments no evidence of images being retained and recalled 
to guide delayed action: The raccoons, however (for a 
few seconds up to 25), and the children (for several minutes) 
were able to respond accurately without any such device 
of remaining in a constant attitude. In their case, Dr. 
Hunter had no doubt of the operation of some intra-organic 
factor which represented the absent light, in the sense of 
guiding the delayed response. It is true that Dr. Hunter 
does not think that this representative was necessarily an 
image; he develops a theory of “sensory thought ” which 
is not easy to explain or understand. But the more obvious 
explanation lies in imagery. 
Again, imagery is not proved, but is strongly suggested 
by Dr. L. W. Sackett’s Canada porcupine which, opening 
a problem box by depressing a lever, failed on one occasion 
to find its usual food on emerging from the box, whereupon 
it re-entered the box and gave the lever a second push 
down.1 But this ought probably to be considered in con- 
1 Behavior Monographs, No. 2. 
86
-P-A-G-E-85
  THE ASCENT: IMAGERY 
nection with the readiness of animals which have learned 
problem boxes to enter them voluntarily. Dr. Sackett 
does not, I think, profess that imagery played a part. 
The oft-quoted case of Dr. Washburn’s cat, however, is 
one in which the psychologist on the spot diagnosed imagery.! 
It started to run upstairs to its nest of kittens, but stopped 
half-way, and turning went to the new position in the 
cellar to which it had transferred them on the previous 
day. 
We may perhaps then suppose that animals have the 
beginnings of imagery, and that this is a first step in the 
direction of that kind of behaviour which in man we call 
reasoning. The anticipatory readiness of the next-to-act 
neurones is increased to such a pitch that their incongruity 
with the external situation is realized. The incoming train 
has automatically set the points ahead at a number of 
crossings, and what it would do if it were diverted this way 
or that can already be seen. 
It is of great interest to see the way in which imagery 
gradually comes into the human solving of problems as we 
make them more and more like problems in reasoning. 
Take first a maze drawn on paper such as that on page 58. 
If an adult is asked to draw a pencil mark from the entrance 
by the shortest path through the alleyways to the food 
box, he does not make excursions with his pencil into any 
blind alleys unless he is either careless or unintelligent. 
He makes the entrance into the blind alleys by proxy, in 
this case by actual eye movements. There is trial and error, 
but it is trial by proxy, though imagery hardly yet plays 
much part. 
Ask an adult to mark the left-hand figure in the diagram, 
on page 88, so as to show how it should be cut to give the 
pieces on the right (I.E.R. Tests, Teachers College, Columbia 
1 The Animal Mind, New York, 1908. ‘‘ Idea” is the word used by 
Dr. Washburn, but from the title of the chapter and from the context 
I take it that imagery is implied. And she adds, “ Errors of interpre- 
tation are possible at every turn.” 
87  
-P-A-G-E-86
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
_ University, New York). There is here undoubtedly trial and 
error byimagery. There is also a strong temptation to make 
actual trials: but the more intelligent refrain from these 
until imaged trials have been made. Do you consider that 
there is anything else present beyond such trials? Suppose 
someone says, “‘ But it can’t be done, there are only three 
corners,” is that any other kind of reasoning, or has such a 
person an image of the three angles put together, and the 
fourth angle missing ? Such an image would be an incorrect 
image, but images can be incorrect and yet be images and 
trials. That only shows the importance of actual experi- 
ments to check the imaginary experiments. Then suppose 
anyone who has made the above remark goes on in this 
OSL fashion, saying, “‘ Well, the fourth corner must be one of 
the butt ends.” Is this something new? Or an image of 
a special kind of cut across the hollow square just near 
a corner? We are getting perilously near a still higher 
type of thought, in which symbols are used, to which we 
shall come later. 
Try finally this really difficult feat. Imagine a cube, 
which is going to be cut in two by a straight saw cut. 
The saw-cut section, the raw face of the cut, can clearly be 
of various shapes, as square, or triangular (if a corner were 
cut off).. How would you cut the cube so that the section 
88

THE ASCENT: IMAGERY 
may be a perfect plane hexagon? Here is certainly trial 
and error by images. You must not draw anything, nor 
look at cubical or nearly cubical objects while thinking 
it out. Most of those who succeed in this test agree that 
visual imagery trials are not all that they do. Not every- 
thing is plain “trial and error.” They ‘‘ reason” that as 
they want a six-sided figure they must cut all six faces of 
the cube. A kind of principle of symmetry teaches them 
that the edge of the section must lie similarly in each face. 
And so they come to the correct conclusion that each square 
face of the cube must be cut along a line joining obliquely 
the mid-points of.adjacent sides. They may come to this 
conclusion without being able to see the resulting cut. This 
sort of ‘‘ reasoning ” is common in the mathematics, and my 
own opinion is that despite its new appearance it is really 
still trial and error by proxy. But in it, use is made to a 
great extent of symbols, and higher habits of mind are 
employed which have long ceased to be active thought, 
and have become habitual responses. Yet there are grave 
difficulties in the way of such explanation, which we must 
leave for the present, to return to them later. Meanwhile, 
we may turn for relief to other aspects of the study of imagery, 
in teaching, in the use of language, and even in parlour 
tricks.

CHAPTER X 
VARIOUS USES OF VISUAL IMAGERY 
  Pzruaps the chief importance of imagery in human think- 
ing is that emphasized in the previous chapter, of raising 
behaviour in the face of a problem above the level of animal 
trial and error. But once that is granted, other points of 
view may be used. There are higher levels yet of reasoning, 
to which we shall come in due course, where imagery either 
is not used at all (as some aver) or is imagery of a symbolic 
kind. Imagery of the kind to be considered in the present 
section, that is imagery of real warm-coloured life as it 
actually occurs, is of great value as a check upon this more 
abstract thinking, just as actual concrete experiment is 
essential as a check upon imagery. And imagery, “a gift 
as great as can be possessed by a disembodied spirit,” brings 
a wealth of pleasure with it. Let us turn first to the pleasure 
which a habit of imaging brings into the words of our every- 
day vocabulary. Nearly every word we use imprisons a 
picture, which imagery can release. It is indeed curious how 
we can come to disregard the picture even when it is not in 
any way concealed : as in words like cupboard, or forecastle, 
or waistcoat, or holiday, or clerestory—in which last case, 
however, the spelling, for those who only know the word 
by sight, is of course a hindrance. In our English language, 
where so many of the roots come from Latin and Greek 
and do not, therefore, carry a homely meaning with them, 
a great deal of loose usage can occur, and vividness of speech 
and of comprehension can be largely lost, if we do not at 
times let our minds dwell on the original picture which 
the words convey. Consideration, a consulting of the stars ; 
disaster, when the stars in their courses fight against us ; 
90

  VARIOUS USES OF VISUAL IMAGERY 
mercurial, jovial, saturnine, martial; all these words can 
call up pictures of the astrologer practising his art, or the 
worshippers of the heavens adoring and fearing the mystery 
of the spheres. Starboard brings me a picture of a viking 
ship with Witta and his heathens, Witta at the steerboard, the 
right-hand gunwale near the stern, threddling the longship 
through the seas. Companion is the better word if it brings 
up a picture of two breaking bread together, sitting perchance 
on some high pass and looking down into the lowlands, as 
one looks from Carter Bar into Scotland. A squatter entering 
into possession of his land by sitting down upon it ; a bursar 
equipped with his purse ; a pocket as a little poke; a candi- 
date standing at the altar dressed in white ; these are pictures 
which add to the appeal of the words, and often lead to an 
association very much to the point. There is no great fear 
that an over-cultivation of such imagery would lead to a 
narrowness of usage—not many are so able to see the pictures 
their words paint as to be hindered in their thought. Most 
of us only too soon come to use the words as counters without 
concrete imagery, a tendency which brings to some the power 
of generalizing and abstract thinking, but which brings to a 
greater number only verbosity and parrot-pattering fluency. 
Another occasion on which the habit of visualizing can be 
advantageous is when we have to read aloud. Thus the best 
advice I have ever known, to assist one in holding one’s 
audience, is this which I read long ago, in a most useful 
booklet on clear speaking and good reading! ‘‘ See the 
scenes as you read the words. Look at them intently in your 
own mental vision, and pause at each completed picture.” I 
recall the illustration used in the book, a very telling one— 
one of the parables. “‘The seed . . . is the word of God, 
. .. Those by the wayside . . . are they that hear; ... 
1 I was unable, as I wrote this, to recall the name of the author, and 
spent a few minutes in putting down what passed through my mind in 
the attempt to do so. See page 164 ahead, where the reason why I still 
refrain giving the name will become clear—it would betray to some the 
real names there disguised. 
91  
-P-A-G-E-90
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
then cometh the devil . . . and taketh away the word out 
of their hearts.” 
Children, too, love to close their eyes during a lesson and 
see pictures. They like to try to draw scenes described from 
a pupil’s imagery, and the pupil has his descriptive powers 
much improved by the practice, and by the contrasts between 
his imagery and the drawings which, he has to admit, fit 
his inaccurate words. And his fellow-pupils criticize loose- 
ness in his telling.t 
Visualizing is a great help in studying a foreign language. 
“We have a clearer notion of surplomber when we reflect 
that it comes from sur = over and plomb = lead, and when 
des rochers qui surplombent call up the picture of crags 
overhanging so much that a leadline dropped over the top- 
most ledge would fall clear of the sides.” 
“Tf what is described in the French is really visualized, 
words will rarely fail the translator to express in English the 
mental picture thus clearly formed . . . Anyone who reads 
translations written by examination candidates soon per- 
ceives that the chief source of weakness is the habit of 
mentally registering one English word against each French 
word learned ”’—instead of visualizing the things, that is, 
“A single example will illustrate the point. In a passage 
recently. set for translation, there occurred the phrase 
‘dans la petite maison du garde-chasse.’ It was quite an 
exception to find in the translations offered the natural 
rendering, namely ‘in the gamekeeper’s cottage.’ Most 
candidates wrote ‘in the gamekeeper’s little house,’ some 
even ‘in the little house of the gamekeeper.’ Yet it is 
improbable that any one of these candidates would have 
spoken of a ‘little house’ in an English essay in which 
the same idea had to be expressed.” ? Improbable that they 
would have said ‘“‘little house” had they seen it, either 
actually or in the mind’s eye.

  VARIOUS USES OF VISUAL IMAGERY 
Or, for an example of how the power of visualizing can light 
up a lesson in the classics, turn to Chapter VII of Benson’s 
House of Quiet, and read his memory of the vision which came 
to him “in a dusty classroom, the gas flaring, the lesson 
proceeding slowly and wearily, with a thin trickle of 
exposition from the desk,” a vision of that scene where 
Aineas comes on Andromache at her orisons in “a clearing 
in a wood of beeches”’; who ends her*burst of passionate 
grief with the question “ Hector ubi est?’ A scene “‘so 
intensely real, so glowing, that I could see the pale-stemmed 
beeches ; and below through a gap, low fantastic hills and 
a wan river winding in the plain. I could see the white set 
face of Aineas, the dark-eyed glance of the queen, the 
frightened silence of the worshippers.” 
Or turn to science. Nowhere perhaps is the use of visual- 
ization more obvious. It is true that Sir Francis Galton in 
a classical inquiry found that famous fellows of the Royal 
Society of London appeared to be lacking in, or to have 
lost, the power of visualizing, and relied more on abstract, 
symbolic, possibly quite imageless thought. But they 
had, even supposing there was not some error of misunder- 
standing between them and Sir Francis, arrived at that 
goal by paths denied to most ; and it hardly is to be doubted 
that, could they have attained their power of abstraction 
without losing the faculty of vivid visualization, they would 
have been still greater than they were. Lord Kelvin at 
least is reported to have said that he could not understand 
a theory unless he could make a model of it. And Sir J. J. 
Thomson, himself a President of the Royal Society, writes 
in his preface to Recent Researches in Electricity and 
Magnetism: ‘The first chapter of this work contains an 
account of a method of regarding the electric field which is 
geometrical and physical rather than analytical. I have 
been induced to dwell on this point because I have found that 
students, especially those who commence the subject after 
a long course of mathematical studies, have a great tendency 
98
-P-A-G-E-92
INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
to regard the whole of Maxwell’s theory as a matter of the 
solution of certain equations, and to dispense with any 
attempt to form for themselves a mental picture of the 
physical processes which accompany the phenomena they 
are investigating. ... The physical method has all the 
advantages in vividness which arise from the use of concrete 
quantities instead of abstract symbols to represent the state 
of the electric field.”” And he devotes considerable time to 
the portrayal of Faraday’s method of ‘tubes of force,” 
which can readily be imagined in mental pictures, and which 
in Faraday’s hands served to interpret all the laws of 
electrostatics. 
Those who are strong in visualizing are not necessarily 
weak in other forms of imagery. But they have, it must be 
admitted, a trick ot using visual imagery to tide them over 
difficult links in the chain of memory. Seeing the pictures, 
as a poem calls them up, is to me a great help in remembering 
the poem, and I find that the deliberate creation of some 
picture, even if it be irrelevant and grotesque, often serves 
to carry me over at that difficult passage from the end of 
one verse to the beginning of the next, where we are all 
rather more liable to miss the connection. For example, 
I taught myself at school Tennyson’s ode to Vergil, which 
was given at length in the introduction to one of my school 
books.   Roman Vergil, thou that singest 
Tlion’s lofty temples clothed in fire, 
Ilion falling, Rome arising, 
Wars, and filial faith, and Dido’s pyre. 
Now how does the second verse commence? Well, I see 
a good deal of imagery during the first verse, including 
not only pictures of Ilion aflame, but also a map of the 
Mediterranean, focused at Carthage: and at that last line 
I see Dido’s pyre. It is in a courtyard of a castle, but I 
am aware, through the openings of the courtyard, of a wooded 
countryside, probably exceedingly unlike that which Dido 
94
-P-A-G-E-93
  VARIOUS USES OF VISUAL IMAGERY 
knew. And the picture of that landscape lets me know 
somehow that the next verse begins with the word 
Landscape. 
Landscape-lover, lord of language 
More than he that sang the Works and Days, 
All the chosen coin of fancy 
Flashing forth! from many a golden phrase, 
And here it is the word “ golden” which brings up a picture 
of a field of golden wheat. 
Thou that singest wheat and woodland, 
and so on. The pictures carry me along, not infallibly, 
but better than anything else I know. And so I have 
formed the prejudice that associations in terms of visual 
images are more easily recalled than are others. No doubt, 
however, this is quite wrong for some, who recall by auditory 
images best, or by feeling the shape of the words in the mouth 
(kinesthetic imagery). The important thing for a student 
of psychology is to become interested in his own imagery 
(or in its absence). 
A last example of visual imagery will, however, I think, 
convince a large number, if they will try the experiment, 
that such imagery forms very easily recalled associations. 
The experiment in question is a “parlour trick” of the 
children’s entertainment variety and is really very effective. 
The audience in turn say words to the experimenter, up to 
a total of one hundred even, and then on request the experi- 
menter, who has memorized the words by this one repetition, 
gives any word asked for, as number 27, or number 43, and 
soon. This sounds startling, but is easily within the power 
of a majority of those who read this. I saw the device 
explained in an article by D. S. Hill in the Psychological 
Bulletin of 1918, and it forms one of the best illustrations 
I know of the kind of manceuvring of psychological powers 
1 So I remember it, but the only edition accessible to me says out.

  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
which enables experts of the music-hall stage to perform 
almost incredible feats of memory, or sometimes apparently 
of thought-reading. 
The key to the situation is that the experimenter, as each 
word is pronounced, fits it into a mental picture which he 
has trained himself to use for the number in question. These 
mental pictures are remembered by the trick of using words 
which begin and end with certain letters. 
For example, instead of 15, the experimenter sees a visual 
image of an ape, this being chosen because 
APE 
begins with the first and ends with the fifth letter of the 
alphabet. When the experimenter says “No. 15,” let us 
suppose the person in the audience says “bicycle” (it is 
as well for a beginner to confine the audience to common 
nouns, names of real things). The experimenter promptly 
puts his ape on a bicycle, sees this mental picture intently 
for a moment, and then dismisses it from his mind, calling 
for No. 16. He can be perfectly confident that when he 
is later asked for No. 15 he will remember “ape,” that the 
ape was on a “ bicycle,’ and that the required word is 
therefore bicycle. The essential thing is to see the picture 
clearly. Here is a list of key words, and anyone wishing 
to try the experiment should form a definite and concrete 
picture in connection with each one.

  These are Mr. Hill’s words, modified in one instance. 
The reader may be left the task of completing the list up 
to 50 or 100 if required. 
It will be noticed that n is used for zero, nothing; as 
in “Bun” meaning twenty: and that all the single figure 
numbers 1 to 9 have words endingin r. In several instances 
it may prove desirable, in order to get a good picture, to 
alter these words to suit personal idiosyncrasies. A final 
explanation of its working, in case of any confusion in the 
above: Yesterday at a children’s party, when doing this 
trick as part of the amusement, I was asked for number 7. 
The key word is Garter, and I immediately saw the scene 
I had pictured, an alligator with a garter round its body. 
The word was alligator. Asked for 29, I saw a map of the 
Gulf of Mexico (Biloxi is a town there) with a radiator stand- 
ing on it. The word was radiator. Asked for 22,1 saw a 
baby in a perambulator or baby-carriage (Bab is the key 
word, and I always see this picture) being run over by a 
steam-roller. The word was steam-roller. Take the above 
printed list of key words and get some one to try you. 
This is, of course, fooling. Butitis a piece of fooling which 
may lead someone who would not otherwise have done so to 
perform what is really a psychological experiment, an intro- 
spective inquiry. 
Another province in which one has opportunity of observ- 
ing visual imagery, and at the same time other forms of 
imagery, is in instrumental music, or indeed vocal music ; 
but the case I have most in mind is that of playing the 
piano. One may distinguish between the stage during 
which one is learning to play a certain piece of music by 
heart, and the later stage when one is able to sit down and 
go through the performance without hesitation and without 
error. I have at yarious times asked a considerable number 
of students and teachers of music how they carried out this 
performance of learning and reproducing from memory. 
In the great majority of cases it would seem that the final 
97 G 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
” memory is, as it were, ‘“‘in the fingers.” This seems to mean 
that when the piece of music is once started, the actions of 
the muscles of the fingers and arms in playing each bar or 
phrase act as the stimulus to that pattern of neurone excita- 
tion which causes the muscles to play the next bar or phrase. 
The piece is played without any special consciousness of 
how it is remembered, the imagery present is not concerned 
with remembering the piece, but with the shades of interpre- 
tation and emotion to be brought out on this particular 
occasion. The whole has become automatic, a ‘‘ chain 
habit,”’ each link forging its successor. Some individuals 
see the printed music while playing from memory and 
a smaller number claim to be able to read from the imaged 
page: but in most cases the vision is too hazy for this, 
although there may be a clear recognition of where the pages 
have to be turned and on which part of the page each phrase 
is printed. Auditory imagery does not appear to be employed 
a great deal in remembering, it is rather released from that 
task so that it can preside over the whole performance and 
direct its emotional rather than its mechanical side. 
More instructive, however, is the réle of imagery during the 
process of memorizing, and during the process of playing 
a new piece of music from the score. The primary outer 
stimulus in this last case is visual, is the set of black marks 
called notes arranged in such and such a way on the printed 
lines. The performer sees a certain pattern of these, and 
his fingers play a corresponding sequence of notes and chords 
on the keyboard. What has passed through his mind in 
the meantime ? That depends ou his degree of familiarity 
with the art of reading at sight, and with the personal 
idiosyncrasies which are his because of his inborn nature, 
because of his previous instruction in music, and because 
of his previous experience in other provinces of life and 
education. 
In the case of playing the piano, there need be no auditory 
image at all, the finger response may be made to the visual 
98
-P-A-G-E-97
  
  VARIOUS USES OF VISUAL IMAGERY 
sign just as it might be made by a man stone-deaf from birth. 
This is hardly likely to be the case when singing, instead of 
playing the piano, is in question. It is still conceivable that 
a certain muscular set of reactions in the vocal and breathing 
organs should be made in response to the notes, without 
the intervention of an auditory image as a go-between: 
but it is much less conceivable, is indeed hardly admissible, 
as a practical proposition. For we are much less conscious 
of just what we do when we sing and articulate. No one, 
I imagine, has ever tried to teach a stone-deaf child to play 
the piano from notes, though it could probably be done 
with fair success. But we have a lot of experience of the 
difficulty of teaching a stone-deaf child to speak ; and the 
difficulties are very great indeed. Moreover, the contrast 
between such a stone-deaf child and one who has a trace 
of hearing left, or one who once heard, is so great as to 
leave no doubt in my mind as to the immense importance 
of auditory imagery in controlling the voice organs, even 
though one could explain this case by the fact of hearing 
controlling the learning even without imagery. In singing 
from notes, therefore, I believe the notes call up an auditory 
image which assists, together with the direct action of the 
visual stimulus, in determining the proper vocal response. 
In playing this need not be so, and in many cases does not 
seem to be so. The sense of hearing checks what is being 
played, without any auditory image having preceded that 
playing. 
One can in the last resort only relate what one finds in 
one’s own mind in such matters, and the reader should do 
a little introspection at the piano. In my own case (I possess 
only very moderate powers of reading at sight) I am conscious 
of a very definite image of the rhythm of a piece of new 
music, an image which sits mainly in the arm muscles, 
with vestigial taps of the foot, swayings of the body, and 
pattering of the vocal mechanism (without any of these 
coming to actual expression). I am much less conscious 
99  
-P-A-G-E-98
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
of any auditory imagery. Indeed, when I just look 
at a strange score, I find it impossible to image the 
harmonies, though I could play them, and can sometimes 
feel their emotional significance merely from the score. 
What I do image with great visual clearness is the piano 
keyboard, and Isee my hands playing. If I am sitting 
actually at the piano reading, I look, of course, a good deal 
at the keyboard and at my hands, but mostly at the score, 
finding my way about the piano by a combined imagery 
of sight and arm-position. 
If I now want to play the piece from memory I cannot 
do so, even though I have played it hundreds of times with 
the music, which I hardly feel the need to attend to. Yet 
remove it, and I must stop. Nor can I, by giving much 
thought, see any image of the score good enough to replace 
the actual score. If I want to learn to play by heart, I have 
to learn to start the action with the keyboard image. I 
look at my hands more and deliberately. I fix landmarks 
in the piece according to their keyboard position, and leave 
the flights between them to the muscle memory of my fingers. 
There is a distinct strain about the process, as great as, 
though different in quality from, the strain of first reading. 
It seems clear that the attention of learners at the piano 
might with profit be directed to the question of forming 
visual images of the keyboard, and to the question of forming 
auditory images from the unplayed score, and this, I under- 
stand, is now done in the practice of the best teachers 
following the best methods, as that of Mrs. Curwen. 
The whole question of the interconnection of these forms 
of imagery and the way in which visual, auditory, and kin- 
esthetic percepts and images act as cues to one another, 
~ can be more readily followed after one has some knowledge 
of the way in which some of these mental activities are 
connected with certain areas of the brain. And we may take 
the opportunity of making a short’ study of the brain’s 
topography, and some of its functions.

  CHAPTER XI 
BRAIN LOCALIZATION 
On ty the most elementary knowledge of the structure of 
the brain is possible without actual dissections, or at least 
study of models. It is composed of neurones or nerve cells 
just as are the nerves and the spinal column. These neurones 
have cell bodies, mainly situated in the outer layer of the 
brain, the “grey matter ”’ of the rind or cortex, and have 
also most extraordinarily complicated interconnections 
by brush-like dendrites and by longer axone-processes, which 
latter form a kind of close-packed cable system in the 
inner part of the brain, the so-called white matter. 
The change in the brain which occurs, as the ascent is 
made up the scale of intelligence from an animal such as a 
frog to man, is not chiefly in the introduction of anything 
new, but in a great increase of size of the brain in comparison 
with the rest of the body, and a great increase in size and 
complexity of the cerebral hemispheres in comparison with 
the rest of the brain. A very striking museum exhibit 
is a comparison of the skeleton of a three-year-old child 
with the skeleton of a monkey of the same height, where 
by far the most noticeable difference is in the size of the skull 
which encloses the brain. In man the cerebral hemispheres, 
which are only a small part of the brain of a lower animal 
such as a frog, have developed to such an extent that they 
cover up most of the rest of the brain. They are very con- 
voluted, like a walnut inside its shell, and like the walnut 
they are almost completely divided into a right and a left 
hemisphere, by a deep fissure just underneath the centre- 
101
-P-A-G-E-100
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
line of the skull, from the root of the nose straight over the 
top of the head through the crown. But below this fissure, 
and forming its floor, are closely packed bands of nerves 
joining the two halves. The right and left cerebral hemi- 
spheres form the most unique part of the human nervous 
system, and it is here that the nervous phenomena take 
place which always accompany thought. Injury to the 
cerebral hemispheres invariably is accompanied by some 
mental deficiency or other. But many forms of mental 
deficiency or aberration can and do exist without any 
detectable trouble in the cerebral hemispheres, though we 
believe, many of us, that this is only because we are not able 
to see and interpret the finer structure of the hemispheres. 
We know more about the mind than we do about the brain : 
but what we know about the brain is more definite, and 
scientists are more in agreement about it than they are 
about the mind. The innumerable fissures or clefts between 
the convolutions of the cerebral hemispheres form a pattern 
which is much the same in all brains, and yet is individualistic 
in each brain, as our faces are similar yet different, or as 
maps of England drawn by hand might all show the same 
rivers, which yet would have differences in form. Experts 
know all these fissures; we must content ourselves with 
knowing the approximate positions of the fissure of Sylvius, 
the fissure of Roland, and the Parieto-occipital fissure, which 
mark the boundaries between the four lobes into which it 
is usual to divide each hemisphere, viz. the Frontal, the 
Temporal, the Parietal, and the Occipital. Imagine a man 
wearing one of those listening-in headphones used with radio 
sets, where a band of metal joining the two ear-pieces runs 
over the top of the head. Then the two (right and left) 
Frontal lobes are approximately the part of the brain in front 
of this band of metal and behind the forehead. The fissure 
of Roland is approximately underneath the metal band, 
and separates the Frontal lobe from the Parietal lobe 
behind it. Right at the back of the skull lie the Occipital 
102
-P-A-G-E-101
  BRAIN LOCALIZATION 
lobes, separated from the Parietal by the Parieto-occipital 
fissures. 
The Sylvian fissure on each side runs roughly parallel 
with the legs of a pair of spectacles, but about an inch higher, 
and rising as it goes backward. Below the Sylvian fissures 
lie the Temporal lobes, behind the temples or flat portions 
on either side of the head above the cheekbones. 
From two classes of experiments we gain knowledge of 
the particular functions of certain parts of the hemispheres. 
When post-mortem examinations of the brain are possible, 
in the case of various forms of derangement (such as paralysis 
of certain limbs, defects of speech, and the like) it can be 
ascertained in what part of the hemispheres injuries are 
present. And from experiments on monkeys and dogs, in 
which the brain of the living animal is exposed and given 
a mild electric stimulation in various regions, we can plot 
those parts of the hemisphere whose stimulation results in 
the movements of different parts of the body. From experi- 
ments of this second kind, it is known that such electric 
stimulation of the convolution just in front of the fissure of 
Roland results in movements of different sorts, and this part 
of the cortex, known topographically as the precentral 
gyrus, is therefore called the motor region. Generally 
speaking, the upper parts (nearer the top of the head) cause, 
when stimulated, movements of the lower limbs ; and as we 
pass down the area, the muscles affected are higher up in the 
body. Near the point where the fissure of Roland approaches 
the fissure of Sylvius there are centres which have a connec- 
tion with, and appear to control, the hands and fingers, and 
the vocal organs. These two centres are not far apart.t 
These facts are confirmed by the post-mortem examinations, 
Where a “stroke ’’ paralyses an arm, or a leg, then a clot

the motor region. If the paralysis is confined to one side of 
the body, then the brain injury is found in the hemisphere 
of the opposite side; for all connections between body and 
brain cross over somewhere or other, either in the brain or 
at some level of the spinal column. A paralysis of the 
right hand, therefore, means probably a lesion or injury in 
the left hemisphere. 
The vocal organs are centrally situated in our bodies, not 
like the limbs one on each side, and they have nerve connec- 
tions with both hemispheres. But as a result of experi- 
ments and observations similar to the above it has been 
found that invariably there is a specialization of duties. 
Both hemispheres control the vocal organs (tongue, throat, 
etc.) in so far as it is merely a question of making noises, 
executing swallowing movements, and similar crude motions. 
But when it comes to language and speech, one side of the 
brain does all the higher work, usually (indeed I believe 
invariably) the same side as is in contro] of the more “‘ dex- 
terous”’ hand: that is to say, the left side of the brain in 
the case of right-handed workers, and the right side in the 
ease of those who are more skilled with their left hands. 
Stimulation of other parts of the brain does not result in 
any muscular responses. But we know that certain other 
regions are intimately connected with the senses, and they 
are therefore called sensorial regions. For example, a part 
of the Occipital lobe, near the back of the skull, is thus asso- 
ciated with vision, and a lesion here can cause blindness, 
though the eyes be perfect. 
There is a disease to which sheep are subject which illus- 
trates this. Sheep suffering from it become partially blind, 
and walk in circular or curved paths in consequence. Now 
the crossing over of nerves from the brain to the body is 
rather peculiar in the case of the eyes. It is not that the 
left retina is connected with the right brain, and the right 
retina with the left. But the right-hand halves are connected 
with the right brain, and the left-hand halves with the 
104
-P-A-G-E-103
    
BRAIN LOCALIZATION 
left brain An injury to the proper region of the right brain 
will therefore cut off the right-hand half of each retina ; 
and (as rays of light cross in passing through the lens of 
the eye) this means that the left half of the field of vision 
is darkened. 
The brain injury is due to a polyp which grows between 
the sheep’s skull and his brain and by pressing on the latter 
keeps away the blood supply. An old Northumbrian farmer 
whom I knew was accustomed to operate on the sheep (and 
no doubt the operation is well known among farmers) by 
boring into the skull at a place chosen partly by observing 
the sheep’s manner of- walking, partly by feeling the skull 
with the thumbs ; whereupon the polyp protruded and was 
withdrawn, and the wound closed with a tarred bandage. 
The auditory region is just below the Sylvian fissure. 
The regions similarly connected with taste, smell, etc., are 
on the inher surface between the two hemispheres. Running 
along the front border of the parietal lobe, and just across 
the river, as it were—that is, across the fissure of Roland— 
from the motor region, is a region which is necessary to the 
sense of touch over the surface of the body and perhaps to 
the other skin senses ; for injuries here result in loss of sensa- 
tion somewhere on the body. This and the motor region 
run approximately across the top of the head, and down 
towards the ears under the headpiece of a radio set when 
one is “listening-in,” separated from one another by the 
Rolandic fissure. 
The other areas of the cortex, though they are not, like 
those described, intimately connected with groups of muscles 
or with sense organs, are nevertheless highly important, 
Called sometimes the silent areas, or association areas, they 
are essential in even the simplest perception, for we have 
reason to think that mere excitation of, say, the visual region, 
would give only a meaningless sensation instead of an 
understood and significant percept. The words percept and 
perception have not been used or defined in this book 
105
-P-A-G-E-104
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
previously, but their meaning can be sufficiently grasped 
when it is said that looking at an orange and knowing what 
it is constitutes perception, whereas just seeing a patch of 
yellowish-red colour is not perception, is mere sensation. 
An adult, or even a child, hardly ever has mere sensations : 
he not only hears a certain sound but perceives a motor-horn 
(the words perceive, percept, and perception being used 
technically for all the senses, not only for sight). The 
percept may be erroneous, the sensations may call up the 
wrong percept, as when we are deceived by a painting, or 
by a figure in a looking-glass, or think the sails of a windmill 
are revolving the wrong way. And even when we do not 
recognize a sensation-situation, our condition is seldom one 
of complete bewilderment, but rather of rapid oscillation 
between attempted percepts which do not quite fit. This 
crude account must suffice for explanation of the difference 
between sensation and perception: and to return to our 
brain-regions, there is some reason for saying that the 
regions we have labelled as visual or as auditory are concerned 
with the mere sensations as such, whereas the translation 
into perception requires the co-operation of large parts of 
the “silent ” areas. 
Part of the evidence which points in this direction, 
evidence about which there is a great deal of controversy, 
and which we can only consider as onlookers, consists of the 
records of cases of aphasia and allied defects, in which a 
patient loses, for example, the understanding of spoken 
words, though he may still understand written words; or 
is unable to speak sensibly or coherently, though he may be 
able to write what he wants to say; or a number of other 
conditions. As a matter of fact, one gathers from the 
literature that such cases are rarely or never limited to one 
particular defect as is suggested above, but are nearly always 
more complex, and show different symptoms at different 
stages of the disease. In my own small experience of aphasia 
patients, as a lay visitor to a local hospital, that has cer- 
106
-P-A-G-E-105
BRAIN LOCALIZATION 
  tainly been the case. But approximations to different 
types appear, nevertheless, to exist. They are explicable 
on the following lines. 
Suppose, for instance, that the auditory region were, 
through some brain lesion, cut off to a considerable extent 
from the rest of the cortex. Then, although the sensations 
produced by spoken words would be heard, there would be 
no perception of their meaning, since that involves the 
co-operation of large parts of the “silent ” areas. Yet, 
since the visual region is still in communication with these 
areas, the printed word may be comprehended. If the 
communication between the visual centre and the motor 
centre which regulates speech is intact, it may even be 
that the patient may read aloud correctly. These cases 
have in the past been usually classed as cases of (1) motor 
aphasia, or inability to speak ; (2) word-deafness, or inability 
to understand spoken language; (3) word-blindness, or 
inability to understand printed or written language; and 
(4) agraphia, or inability to write; though, as we shall 
presently see, there is every reason to think that these con- 
ditions are seldom found as distinct from one another as 
these names would suggest. As Broca first, in a famous 
paper published in 1861, was able to show, in motor aphasia 
there is a lesion of the convolution adjoining the motor 
region. If this motor region itself is injured, there is partial 
actual paralysis of the vocal organs. But the corresponding 
region on the other side of the head can control the grosser 
movements of tongue, etc. The following case is quoted 
by Sir James Purves Stewart : } 
Case 1. W.M., aged 55. ‘‘ He suddenly became speechless 
and his face became asymmetrical. His intelligence was 
unimpaired. He was able to understand and execute all 
sorts of verbal commands, to put out his tongue, to place 
his hand on any part of his face or head, to move the right 
or left thumb by bending it half-way or straightening it out, 
1 Brain, 1920, xliii, 424-5, 
107
-P-A-G-E-106
    INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
as requested. But he was unable to utter any word whatever.” 
“At the autopsy . . . the brain, after hardening, showed a 
small area in the lower third of the left precentral gyrus, 
in which there was a dark marbled appearance, due to 
embolic blocking of a small cortical arteriole.” If Broca’s 
convolution alone is injured, the vocal organs can still 
be used for making sounds, but not for making words. 
It was Wernicke who found the position of lesions, in 
the case of word-deafness, to be near, but not in, the auditory 
centre. And similarly lesions which are closely related to 
the hand centre or to the visual centre, but do not actually 
encroach on those centres, can cause inability to write or to 
read, though the hand is not paralysed nor the eyes blinded. 
Actual reports of clinical cases are the best illustration : 
and they will show how confused, compared with this 
classification, such cases really are—though no doubt from 
time to time fairly pure cases turn up. 
On a table in front of one of Head’s patients! lay six 
common objects. The patient was able to point to any 
one of these when a duplicate was shown him, or was placed 
(out of sight) in his hand. He could still hesitatingly do 
so if the object was named by the examiner, or if its name 
was shown him in print. When asked to name an object 
indicated, however, he was not always successful. True, 
he always gave the correct name for the penny, and he 
did pretty well with the knife, though he wrote ‘‘ panin” 
and ‘‘ Kerrert,” and other wrong forms. When the key 
was pointed to, he on one occasion said, ‘‘ That’s mer, may,” 
and on two other trials he took his keys out of his pocket, 
saying ‘‘ Mat, latch” and “No, I cannot tell you that.” 
Nor could he write the word. Presumably, under the old 
nomenclature, he would have been described as a case of 
motor aphasia and agraphia: but his inability to use words 
(spoken or written) was only partial. Moreover, though he 
could point to the object named or printed, he did so in a 
1 Brain, 1920, xliii, 95. 
108
-P-A-G-E-107
  BRAIN LOCALIZATION 
hovering and hesitating way, and said, ‘‘I can’t remember 
what they are unless I think. If it wasn’t here on the table 
I couldn’t tell you.” 
Influenced by a number of cases in which this mixture of 
the symptoms occurs, Head has asserted that “ disorders 
in the use of language, due to a (left) unilateral lesion of the 
brain, cannot be classified under the categories of speaking, 
reading, and writing,” and that they are “ not due,” or need 
not be due, ‘‘to destruction of images.” ‘‘The patient 
succeeds in reading or writing under certain conditions 
although he fails completely if the task is presented to him 
in a different manner.’ The function which is disturbed 
by such lesions he calls “ symbolic thinking and expression,” 
while admitting that ‘‘every manifestation of this aspect 
of psychical activity is not . . . of necessity disturbed in 
any one case.” ‘‘ The more acute and severe the lesion, the 
graver and more extensive will be the disorder it produces.” 
“At first the whole of symbolic thinking and expression may 
be rendered impossible, but gradually certain forms return, 
whilst the recovery of others may be indefinitely retarded. 
When a man has received a severe injury to his foot, at 
first he may not be able to walk at all; but after a while 
he is found to be walking in a peculiar manner according to 
whether the wound affects his toe or his heel. The gait he 
assumes is not an elementary component of his normal 
method of walking; it is due to the fact that he cannot 
place some one part of his foot on the ground. Provided 
we bear these principles strictly in mind, we are justified 
in recognizing the existence of various forms of aphasia.” 1 
Head has suggested, in place of the older terms such as 
agraphia, alexia, etc. (which he rejects because they suggest 
special centres for writing, reading, etc.) the terms verbal, 
syntactical, nominal, and semantic disorders of symbolic 
formulation and expression. The verbal form is seen in 
@ patient who cannot readily pronounce his words, though 
1 Henry Head, Brain, 1920, passims 
109
-P-A-G-E-108
INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
he uses them correctly if he can, or uses their misformed 
representatives correctly. The injury here lies mainly 
within or beneath the central convolutions bordering the 
Rolandic fissure. The syntactical patient talks jargon. 
He hurries on in the hope of something being understood. 
He can understand what he reads provided he does not 
attempt to formulate it in words. The lesion here is in the 
temporal lobe. Lesions in the parietal lobe seem to lead 
either to the nominal or to the semantic form of interference 
with symbolic formulation and expression, the lesion tending 
to be somewhat farther back in the case of nominal aphasia. 
In semantic aphasia the patient may to casual observation 
appear to be normal: but he has difficulty in following or 
retaining the general drift of an argument. In nominal 
aphasia his difficulty is in naming, and he often talks round 
some idea which he is unable to name. 
“The processes which underlie the act of speech,” says 
Head, “‘run through the nervous system like a prairie fire 
from bush to bush; remove all inflammable material at 
any one point and the fire stops. So, when a break occurs 
in the functional chain, orderly speech becomes impossible, 
because the basic physiological processes which subserve 
it have been disturbed. The site of such a breach of 
continuity is not a ‘centre for speech,’ but solely a place 
where it can be interrupted or changed.”

  CHAPTER XII 
THE ASCENT FROM INSTINCT TO INTELLIGENCE 
(6) Tuz Use or Worps In Tuovenr. 
Caszs of aphasia such as those noted in the last chapter 
bring forcibly before one’s mind the question of the inde- 
pendence, or the interdependence, of language and thought. 
Opinions on this question have covered a very wide range, 
from Max Miiller’s blunt assertion that speech is thought 
and thought is speech, to Sir Francis Galton’s equally 
definite statement, in a letter to Max Miller, that he 
thought absolutely without the use of any mental words. 
Words can come before the mind in several different 
forms. They may be seen, or heard, or inwardly spoken. 
If the reader will close his eyes and enter upon some train 
of thought, such as, say, what the consequences of free rail- 
way travel would be in a nation, he will be conscious (in 
addition to a lot of concrete imagery of railway stations, holi- 
day resorts, express trains, and the like) of words arising in his 
mind, in the case certainly of a majority of those who try 
this experiment. Things he himself could do, or ways in 
which business would be facilitated, will at least in frag- 
mentary ways be expressed in words. The thought ‘‘ What 
a tremendous increase in the traffic there would be ”’ is, in 
my case, composed of a jumbled vision of crowds and a 
porter stooping, a sight of the word ‘‘ whew!” combined 
with a puckering of unreal lips to whistle, an actual raising 
of my eyebrows, and the words “tremendous increase 
in traffic, anyway ”’ in inner speech, as to which I can never 
quite determine whether I hear or speak more plainly— 
111
-P-A-G-E-110
A ty 
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
but I do not see more than “tr” and “incr,” i.e. one or 
two beginnings of words. 
But as soon as it becomes necessary really to drive the 
argument through and to determine just what one thinks 
about the problem, one finds himself (in the majority of 
cases, as I believe) putting it more definitely into words, 
even saying words and sentences aloud, and putting them 
down in notes. Whatever one may believe about the 
“growing point”’ of thought, there can be little doubt 
about the tendency to turn the thought into words as soon 
as possible. The words form definite foci for thoughts which 
would otherwise be vague. They are almost essential for 
communicating our thoughts to others, and mighty con- 
venient for communicating our thoughts to our own selves, 
e.g. for use in a long train of reasoning. They appear to be 
the more necessary, the more abstract the thought. ‘“‘ We 
do not progress far with our thoughts,” says H. G. Wells 
in Mankind in the Making, ‘“‘ unless we throw them out into 
objective existence by means of words, diagrams, models, 
trial essays. Even if we do not talk to others we must, 
silently or vocally or visibly, talk to ourselves at least to 
get on. To acquire the means of intercourse is to learn to 
think, so far as learning goes in the matter.” 
And in his Men like Gods the same writer puts this truth 
in a still more striking way. For the inhabitants of that 
Utopian land into which a group of terrestrials had involun- 
tarily penetrated as a result of an experiment in the rotation 
of matter in the fourth dimension, had given up the use of 
speech and used among themselves only direct communica- 
tion of thought (except in moments of emotion and when 
gsthetic considerations intervened). Now the interesting 
thing is that the terrestrials heard these thought-projecting 
Utopians speaking—and each hearer heard his own language, 
French or English or the chauffeur’s cockney slang. They 
were being made the recipients of thoughts, but they 
“listened in” in terms of language. Moreover, they each 
112
-P-A-G-E-111
  THE ASCENT: THE USE OF WORDS 
and all of them found silent patches in the speeches, when 
they could not understand. How many teachers realize 
that the thoughts they send out can only be “listened in” 
to by their pupils in terms of the pupils’ own vocabulary and 
phrasing. And how good if they seemed to be ae when 
they were abstruse. 
Various ways (in addition to the observation of aphasics) 
suggest themselves for the study of the use of words in 
thinking. There is introspection, final as regards an indi- 
vidual’s own thought, but not to be made the excuse for 
generalizations including all others. The study of how words 
arise in children, and the history, as far as it can be deducéd, 
of how words arise in the race, gives another line of approach. 
A third is the investigation of the relationship actually 
found between vocabulary and intelligence, especially th 
individual differences in this respect. And another is tod 
examine the practice of successful teachers and successful 
teaching methods and see how words and thought are related 
to one another in good teaching. 
Now in teaching there can be no doubt that often for 
long periods the mistake has been made of supposing that 
the possession of words implied the understanding of the 
thought. In such times education has become entirely 
verbal, memory of rules, definitions, and generalizations, 
has been mistaken for the power to apply them, and fluency _ 
for lucidity and truth. So often has the reform “ teach 
things, not words,”’ been needed in our schools, that it is 
certain that teachers must ever be on their guard against 
teaching mere words, and that, whether or no thought requires 
words, words do not always require thought. 
Not only in the schools, but in outside life, we find this 
same danger. Growing up, as we do, into a society speaking 
our mother tongue and daily using thousands of phrases 
and catchwords which imply judgments, we are very liable 
to acquire the phrases and the catchwords without any real 
consideration of the judgments involved. So we become 
118 H 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
» 
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
Englishmen or Frenchmen, Turks or Prussians ; so we become 
little Liberals and little Conservatives. And perhaps this 
is inevitable, and to some extent even advantageous. There 
is not time for each individual to begin afresh and rejudge 
all the questions of humanity, any more than there is time 
for each individual to reinvent all the material appliances 
which belong to our twentieth-century civilization. Nor 
could most of us be capable of either the one or the other 
feat even with our adult intelligence, let alone the impossi- 
bility of keeping the mind fallow till childhood and youth 
were past. But a great measure of elasticity, of readiness 
to reconsider even the most tightly closed question, should 
be retained by the scholars of every really great teacher. 
It is Dr. F. H. Hayward, in his book Spiritual Bases of Recon- 
struction, who demands that the right of entry to schools 
should be given to every warring sect and creed, whether 
religious, literary, scientific, or political. The golden mean 
must lie somewhere between this extreme and that other 
which appealed so strongly to Stephen Girard, mariner and 
merchant, and benefactor of the city of Philadelphia, who 
in his will said, ‘‘ As there is such a multitude of sects, and 
such a diversity of opinion amongst them, I desire to 
keep the tender minds of the orphans, who are to derive , 
advantage from this bequest, free from the excitements 
which clashing doctrines and sectarian controversy are apt 
to produce.” 
But this is a digression. It arose from the consideration 
that the doctrines, and even the language into which we grow 
up, limit our freedom of thought, and deceive us as to our 
. ability to think ; for which reason the teacher must ever be 
suspicious of a merely verbal knowledge and must see that 
the things behind the words are grasped, manipulated, 
felt, understood. If that is faithfully done, he will find that 
words are not likely to be lacking. Verbaque previsam rem 
non invita sequentur, as Montaigne quotes. And Florio 
translates: ‘‘ When matter we foreknow, words voluntary 
114
-P-A-G-E-113
  THE ASCENT: THE USE OF WORDS 
” flow.” Yet he must not fall into the opposite error of 
always avoiding abstract and technical terms, and continually 
talking down to the pupils. To a number of relationships, 
whether in sciences or in the humanities, their attention 
will never be drawn unless by hearing the relationship named. 
Virtues which have no name among a people are apt to die 
out. Mathematical functions which have no name escape 
notice. It is bad to have the name without understanding 
the fact, but difficult to understand or even notice the fact 
without the name. And so the golden rule is to teach real 
things and real relationships, but to talk naturally about 
them, so that vocabulary advances equally with true 
knowledge, not usurping its place, but not lagging in 
the rear. 
Children do differ enormously in vocabulary, and their 
vocabulary grows at a rate which is always underestimated 
by those who have never made an effort to measure it quan- 
titatively. A child has a number of different vocabularies, 
of which the widest is the number of words which he under- 
stands when he hears them. This vocabulary has no definite 
margin, but shades off through words which are fairly well 
comprehended to words which are only hazily appreciated, 
and then only in certain phrases or contexts. A word is not 
one day unknown and the next day understood, but rather 
it ripens to maturity in the mind. 
Enclosed within this vocabulary is that lesser treasury of 
words which the child himself actually uses—it is probably 
@ proper aim for the teacher of English to endeavour to make 
these two realms more nearly coincident in size. And there 
are other possible delimitations ; as the words which the 
pupil can spell, or will use in a written composition. 
Vocabulary has been repeatedly used as a test of intelli- 
gence, both size of vocabulary and quality, while indirectly 
it plays an important part in other tests. | Methods of 
measuring vocabulary are of interest in themselves, as an 
example of the difficulty attending upon quantitative experi- 
115
-P-A-G-E-114
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
ment in child psychology. With very little children the 
actual spoken vocabulary can be set down in full, as: 
Age eleven months. 
Words used recognizably :— 
Sthere = it is there 
Thersth = there it is 
Esh = yes 
Dad-dé = daddy 
Mammam = mammie 
My = my, only in phrase “‘ my mammam ” 
Boowoo = bow wow 
also several words which we cannot yet interpret with certainty, 
With older children this is not possible. But it is interesting 
and useful to note specimens of their talk from time to time. 
And it is possible to put down every word used over a given | 
period, perhaps a number of days, as Drever did, in the case 
of his children, or a single day or a period of a few hours. 
H., whose vocabulary at 11 months is given above, was 
thus ‘“‘reported’’ continuously for two hours when aged 
3 years 14 months, and used in those two hours 485 different 
words. Four days later, in another two hours, he used 152 
additional different words, making 637 in all (plus two 
foreign phrases, viz. pas encore, and, at the end of a tune 
which till then had been hummed without words, the 
fragment—Reiter, und brak sie ap). These words fall into 
parts of speech in the following proportions, Drever’s two 
children of similar age being also shown on page 117. 
It is a good exercise for anyone interested in children to 
make such snapshots of their speech and preserve them. 
The correlation with developing thought and intelligence 
will be emphatic. With still older children the manner of 
measuring vocabulary by sampling is of interest as an 
example of the modern tendency to standardize and objectify 
such estimates. It is clearly impossible to test a child’s 
knowledge of all the words in the language or, for that 
matter, all the words in a given dictionary, which even if 
116
-P-A-G-E-115
  
THE ASCENT: THE USE OF WORDS 
small may contain twenty or forty thousand. So a sample 
of the dictionary is taken at random, the easiest way being 
to take the first, or last, word on every tenth, or hundredth 
page, according to the size of sample wanted. Suppose 
100 words are obtained in this random way and that the child 
is found to understand 32 of them, we may then assume that 
as far as we can tell, he will understand about 32 per cent. 
of the whole dictionary ; and we could test this by trying 
other random samples of 100. 
The best-known such random sample of the language is 
that of 100 words used by Terman in his revision of the

3 Years 4 Years 3 Years

Binet tests. On that list, Terman found that a child of 
ten knew about 30, one of twelve years 40, one of fourteen 
50, and an average adult 65, while a selection of more 
intelligent adults know 75. Just what is here meant by 
“knowing ”’ the word will be found defined in Terman’s 
book The Measurement of Intelligence, but nothing more than 
fair acquaintance with its general significance was required. 
Tests dependent on quality of vocabulary (which is almost 
certainly associated with extent) include, of course, the time- 
honoured essay, so difficult to mark consistently ; but also 
more definite tests, such as asking the difference between 
117
-P-A-G-E-116
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
poverty and misery, or for a definition of charity, the attempt 
here being to get at an index of the wealth of abstract ideas 
possessed, on the assumption that possession of the idea is 
unlikely without possession of the word. These, and many 
other tests which depend more or less upon vocabulary, 
have been found to place children in an order of intelligence 
closely similar to that based on the considered opinion of 
teachers well acquainted with them. 
It may be retorted that this merely means that we all, 
and especially teachers, tend to be too much influenced by’ 
verbal signs of intelligence and too little impressed by 
intelligence which finds its outlet in other forms, as in making 
things. There is undoubted truth in this. But there is 
* évidence that some correlation between vocabulary and 
intelligence remains even after allowance has been made 
for this bias. There exist tests which depend only very 
slightly upon language, such as, for example, the Pintner- 
Patterson tests, in which children fit together simple jigsaw 
puzzles, place squares, stars, and triangles into appropriate 
holes, tap cubes in given sequence, and so on. These tests 
show a correlation with tests involving vocabulary. In 
particular, deaf and dumb children, whose vocabulary in 
early years is extremely limited, do not do so well in these 
non-language tests as speaking children (though of course 
there is here, as in all comparisons of classes, tremendous 
overlapping, and many dumb children rise superior to the 
average speaking child). It seems to many who have made 
a study of them that such handicapped children, whatever 
inner potentialities may be, do actually show a retardation, 
_ on the average, in the rate of growth of their intelligence, 
due to lack of vocabulary and to consequent lack of guidance 
and assistance in the formation of abstract ideas. 
The great advantage of a word over a sign or gesture is 
its power of dropping away from itself all traces of particular 
items, and becoming a symbol for a whole class. This 
can happen to a gesture in a sign language, but not to the 
118
-P-A-G-E-117
  THE ASCENT: THE USE OF WORDS 
same extent as it happens to a word. It is easy (I have 
read somewhere!) to imitate by signs making bread, or 
making hay, or making a hut for Wendy, as children do in 
their games, but not easy to convey by a sign the idea of 
just making—making anything—the generalized idea of 
making. No doubt the sign language would have developed 
such abstract signs had it been possible for man to progress 
with only that method of communication. Indeed, some 
such signs exist among deaf mutes, as the hand placed on 
the breast with fingers outstretched meaning “I want.” 
But to have developed far in such a direction would have 
meant employing all the muscles of the hands and arms, 
at any rate, in communicating with others, so that action 
of any sort (as fighting or hunting) would have been for the 
time interrupted ; whereas speech can go on while the body 
muscles are in action, and in the dark or when out of sight 
we can convey our thoughts to others within earshot. 
This power of a word to drop its particular associations 
comes gradually in childhood, from hearing the word used in 
such varying particular circumstances. All the irrelevant 
concomitants thereby tend to fall away, and the child’s 
attention is directed to something common to all these 
situations by the fact of hearing the same name given to 
them. So a common noun like cat comes to mean not any 
particular animal, but a type of animal which we would have 
difficulty in defining, but can unerringly recognize. So an 
abstract word like pity comes to crystallize out with a definite 
but at first undefined meaning in the child’s mind. The 
proper way to ensure that the generalized, or as we say 
the conceptual, significance of a word is grasped by a pupil, 
is to see that he meets it in a large number of different 
contexts and different circumstances. Any particularized 
meaning which might have fitted in with one case is gradually 
corrected, widened, or narrowed, as it is seen not to fit other

Manual of Psychology, p. 487, which I have here paraphrased.

  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
cases. One feels this happening to oneself with new words, 
as happened to the psychologist who thought that a “‘ gadget” 
was part of an aeroplane, since he first heard it used about 
a flying machine which “ had too many gadgets about it”: 
but presently came across the slang word in other connections 
and realized gradually its meaning as a mechanical device of 
a pernickety kind often but not always ancillary to a larger 
machine; as a self-starter, a special backsight, a patent 
cigar lighter, or a new kind of damper. With children it 
must happen very frequently. A little boy aged three years 
and five months heard his parents, discussing accounts, use 
the word “balance,”’ and interrupted to say ‘‘ hedgehogs 
have balances,” to which assertion he stoutly adhered, 
repudiating the suggestion that perhaps he meant quills. 
“‘ Hedgehogs have balances, those things you weigh clothes 
with—spring balances. In that story gran’ma told me the 
hedgehog said, ‘I’m very sorry, I’ve just lost my balance.’ ”’ 
Here was a pretty confusion between three meanings of the 
word balance: and I feel fairly sure that H.’s first interrup- 
tion was occasioned by his feeling of something wrong with 
the word, for often he used a new word wrongly, or rather, 
in an unusual way, and looked around at us to see how we 
took it. One sees this tendency in children at work, as it 
were, from both ends In the above example H. was 
assuming that the word, when met with, would always mean 
the weighing machine. He was associating the one thing 
with all thé words, whatever their context—and, indeed, 
in a higher stage we come to recognize that there is a common 
element of balancing two things against one another in 
all the uses of the word. At the other end is the assumption 
that one word will do for a large number of things, the trick 
which children so often show of extending a particular name 
to cover a wider class, as “‘ daddy ” for all grown-up men. 
H.’s cousin, on a walk with me one day, leaned over a 
fence against which I was holding him and called ‘‘ puss 
puss, puss”? tosomesheep. H. extended the word “‘dickies’ 
120
-P-A-G-E-119
  
  THE ASCENT: THE USE OF WORDS 
to mean flies and butterflies as well as birds, and at fifteen 
months he applied it to falling snowflakes. At two years 
seven months he called the silver-wire network over the rose- 
bowl a “veil,” and a month later, seeing grapes either for the 
first time or after a long period, he called them “cherries.” 
In both cases it was evident, from his tone and the context, 
that he recognized the differences perfectly and was using 
the words as a makeshift. The case is similar to the naming 
of new objects by savage tribes, as “ firestick ’’ for musket, 
or ‘‘ birds ” for ships with outspread sails. It is indeed the 
way in which all our class-names have arisen, probably. 
Children, and people, who are above a certain level of intelli- 
gence form classes readily enough, and name them. The 
assistance given by the educator is not so much needed to 
stimulate such generalization as to direct it. Growth is 
as luxuriant in the jungle as in the garden, but the garden 
is tidier: and the tendency to generalize and classify is as 
active in a savage or a child as in a scientist, but the scien- 
tist’s classifications are tidier. And also they are more 
fundamental. The class of objects which H. formed and 
called “dickies,” including birds, butterflies, and slowly 
falling snowflakes, is not a very useful class and so has not 
found general acceptance. Children find their attention 
directed to those which have found acceptance, by the 
names which are commonly used. Not otherwise is it with 
the young chemist learning classes such as the “‘ acids,” 
the “ paraffins,” etc. Often a flood of light is thrown on 
some matter by the teacher’s apparently casual extension 
of a class-name to some unusual instance of the class, such 
as calling a tangent a chord, a straight line a circle, water 
hydrogen oxide, the monsoons trade winds, comets planets, 
or man an animal. 
In music teaching, the importance of naming is well 
illustrated by the influence of the Solfa names in tune, 
and of the patternames introduced with great advantage 
during the past few years in teaching time. As regards 
121
-P-A-G-E-120
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
Solfa names, many teachers of music urge strongly their 
importance. The peculiarity, from a psychological point 
of view, about a Solfa name is that it invests a single note 
with a background of relationships. If anyone sings to 
me a single note to the syllable ‘‘ ah,” I hear just a single 
note ; or if I fit it into any set of relationships. it is unlikely 
to be the same set as that intended by the singer. But if 
he sings a Solfa name to the note, say lah, then its place 
in a musical scale is fixed, and it has, as sung, certain 
emotional tendencies which are the result of that position. 
The name produces in me an attitude or set intended by the 
singer. In part this attitude is a readiness to go on to other 
notes, as to go on to doh from te. For my own part, too, 
I find that I can often remember 4 new and still rather 
unfamiliar melody better by its Solfa names than by any 
unnamed tone-sequence, as, e.g., remembering that ‘‘ Rufty 
Tufty”’ begins Doh—doh ray me. This one finds in many 
other spheres of memory also. If one is asked to gaze at 
a building or other object and then presently, turning one’s 
back, to describe it (as in one lesson of the Army “ Eyesight 
training ’’) one finds it a great assistance—or at least I do 
—to say to oneself such points as—‘‘ the windows have blue 
curtains, there are two rain-barrels,” etc. In part this is 
because attention is thereby directed to these details: 
in part it is, I think, because of the facility of recall of words 
even in a subject with a good visual memory. 
The advantage, which has been emphasized in this chapter, 
arising from the way in which words drop off any particular 
attributes (such as blackness in a cat) and thereby are enabled 
to stand as signs for concepts (as cat or charity, or although) 
is in contradiction to what was said in Chapter X on seeing 
pictures in words. The contradiction is, however, only 
superficial. The recommendation there made, to go back 
to the original pictures in the words, is very much needed, 
even though words owe their conceptualizing power to the 
trick of dropping such pictures. In most cases, speakers

-P-A-G-E-121
    THE ASCENT: THE USE OF WORDS 
have not originally had allied to their words clear-cut images 
which have gradually dropped away, but have taken the 
word too vaguely from current usage. There is a far greater | 
tendency for words to spread their meaning over too wide | 
a field than there is any tendency for them to be restricted 
to particular instances. Words owe part of their usefulness 
to the ease with which they become general counters: but 
this tendency is so strong that a check is needed (and is 
supplied by visual imagery) to prevent them becoming 
merely debased coinage.

    CHAPTER XIII 
MATHEMATICAL AND OTHER SYMBOLS 
THE province of thought in which, perhaps beyond all 
other, symbols have shown their power as instruments 
and tools of thought is the realm of mathematics. Nowhere 
else are there such well-worn paths of thought, so often 
traversed that they can be passed over without any fresh 
reasoning whatever. When, for example, we solve an 
equation by some familiar formula or device, we are 
performing the equivalent of an act of reasoning, but without 
any expenditure of reasoning on our own part: our available 
reasoning powers are, as it were, set free from this lower 
duty to occupy themselves with fresh fields. 
This continual use of symbols is at once the power, the 
difficulty, and the danger of mathematics. The power 
is illustrated in every piece of mathematical research. 
The difficulty of mathematics arises at least in part from its 
divorce from concrete space and time and its transformation 
into a crowd of symbols. And the danger is ever present 
that a student may learn to manipulate these symbols 
entirely without comprehension, so that he not only saves 
himself the trouble of reasoning now, but has never done 
the reasoning which would have given him the right to use 
these devices, and without which he is unable to make any 
substantial advance. The first and most familiar symbols 
of mathematics are our ordinary numerals 0, 1, 2, 3, and 
up to 9, together with our most taken-for-granted and yet 
most wonderful device of place value, whereby a digit placed 
to the left of another means so many bundles instead of 
124
-P-A-G-E-123
  - MATHEMATICAL AND OTHER SYMBOLS 
so many units. It took the civilized world many centuries 
to arrive at this simple conception, and there are to be 
found in books on the subject accounts of the cumbrous 
methods of multiplying, dividing and so on with numbers 
expressed in other forms such as the Roman XXVII for 27. 
We are ordinarily hardly aware of the extent to which our 
numerical notation has come to do our arithmetical problems 
automatically for us. We can place ourselves partly in the 
unsophisticated position by trying to carry out a calculation 
in some other notation. Even when the principle remains 
the same, and a comparatively small change is made such 
as reducing our numerals to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 only, and making 
the effect of a place-change five times instead of ten times, 
we feel like fish out of water. Try for example to add, on 
this understanding, 43 to 12. The answer is 110, which 
in our present language we call thirty. Yet this notation 
is probably no harder for us than our usual notation is for 
little children in school. What has occurred is that certain 
habits of response to numbers have been firmly formed in 
us by the arithmetical drills of everyday life; the pathway 
through this mental maze has been fixed by habits to which 
these visual or auditory symbols give the starting cue. 
It is exceedingly important that such habits should be 
quickly, securely, and economically formed in early school 
days, for which purpose many of our ordinary school drills 
need overhauling, and the usual random combinations of 
numbers replacing by combinations designed to distribute 
practice where it is most needed.’ But still more important 
perhaps is it to invite older scholars occasionally to see 
why some familiar fact should be so, to see 9X 7=63, for 
example, as 70 less 7, or to realize clearly just why we carry 
out each part of an operation such as multiplying or sub- 
tracting or finding the square root. We cannot always 
wait to understand a procedure before learning and using it, 
nor can we continuously bear in mind just what it means ; 
1 As, e.g., in the Courtis Arithmetical Practice Tests, 
125 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
    INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
indeed, that is the economy of it all, that we need not. 
But there is every advantage in doing so now and then. 
When, for example, I find by the usual process the square 
root of 29°41 (as I had occasion to do an hour ago, in the 
absence of slide rules or other devices) I set the work down 
as follows : 
5/29-41(5 
25 
) 4-41 
‘The number required is evidently a little larger than 5, 
so I subtract 25 from 29°41, and set 5 down in the answer. 
I then do the following jugglery. I double the 5 and set 
it down as 10, and ask myself how many times 10 will go 
into the remainder 4°41, decide upon ‘4, and curiously 
enough set this ‘4 on to the 10 as well as on to the 5, thus : 
5/29-41(5+4 
25 
10-4] 4-41 
4:16 
“25 
I then write down for a new divisor 10°8, got by doubling 
6°4, and proceed as far as I require decimals, thus : 
5/29-41(5-423 
25 
10-4) 4-41 
4-16 
10-82] +25 
+2164 
10-843} -0336 
+032529 
-001071 
Now this is really a very eccentric procedure and one which 
has become quite automatic and meaningless. It is exceed- 
ingly refreshing to look past the symbols at some concrete 
representation of the same facts, say a geometrical repre-

sentation. I want the length of side of a square cardboard 
whose area is 29°41 inches. 
  A five-inch square will account for most of it, leaving a strip 
along two sides as surplus. What I want to know is the 
width of this strip, to add to my five inches. Suppose 
I straighten the strip out so that it forms one long, narrow 
rectangle. What is the area of this rectangle? It is 4°41 
square inches. 
5/29-41(5 
25 
| 4-41 = area of long rectangle.   
How long is it? Well, I don’t quite know, but it is twice 
five and a bit more represented by the little corner square, 
the very same bit more that I want to know, so that is why 
I double the 5, and why I am going to add a bit to it.

10° [ try :4 and proceed thus : 
5/29-41(5+4 
25 
10-4) 4-41

+25 
The situation is now like this : 
  Length twice 5-4 plus abit 
A narrower strip is left round my square of cardboard, 
with area ‘25 and length a little more than twice 54. I 
proceed just as before, and so on and so on. The reason 
I double my answer for each new divisor is pictured in each 
diagram, it is to get the approximate length of the long strip. 
The reason I add my new decimal both to my divisor and to 
my answer is pictured by the little square in the corner. 
In rapid calculation we have not time to see such concrete 
explanations behind all our operations. In teaching arith- 
metical operations to children, or mathematical operations 
to older students, we cannot wait till an operation is fully 
128
-P-A-G-E-127
  MATHEMATICAL AND OTHER SYMBOLS 
understood before using it; use aids understanding. But 
no one can be a good mathematician who cannot at any 
moment see behind the habits of symbolism which have 
short-circuited separate acts of thought, just what the 
reasons for those operations are. 
An illustration from the integral and differential calculus 
of infinitesimals may be given. The fundamental proposition 
of the infinitesimal calculus is that if y is the differential of x 
then x is the integral of y. In these words, the proposition 
may convey no meaning to many of my readers. Those 
who know that it conveys no meaning are all right: but 
there may be others who have heard, seen, repeated this 
sentence long enough to have acquired a belief that it 
conveys a meaning. Many mathematical students are in 
that self-deceiving position. Especially they remember, 
or know, that if 
dx 
dz y 
then 
Jae =2 
which is just the same fact, set down in mathematical 
symbols instead of in words. 
True, they usually are familiar with the meaning of “ the 
dx 
differential of x,’ or with ms being the slope of a curve. 
Less often they are accustomed to think of fae, “ the 
? integral of y,” as being the area under a curve. Hardly 
ever do they see these two ideas sufficiently clearly ‘o realize 
almost intuitively that the proposition with which we 
began is obvious. In pictorial terms, that proposition 
states that “if one curve rises and falls according to the 
steepness of another, then this other rises and falls according 
129 rT 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
   
   INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
to the area under the first.” In a diagram (page 131) we 
have first a curve 2 (rising and falling in any way). Then 
we are told that a second curve y is drawn so that it is 
high where z is steep and low where z is only sloping 
gently. 
At A z is steep, so y is high. 
At B z= is sloping only gently, so y is low. 
At C =z is steep again, so y is high. 
At D = is flat, so y is zero. 
Now the proposition whose truth we are endeavouring to 
see, asserts that then, the area under the curve y is repre- 
sented by the height of the curve x. To take a specific 
instance, it asserts that the shaded area between A and B 
in curve y is represented by the height of B above A in curve 
a. Now that something like this must be true can be seen 
intuitively. For if curve z had gone on being as steep 
as at A, then B in that curve would have been much higher : 
and curve y would have stayed at height A and the shaded 
area would have been greater. More exactly, the height 
of B above A in curve x depends upon the average slope of x 
from A to B, and, on the other hand, the shaded area in 
curve y depends upon the average height of that curve 
between A and B: and this average height in y represents 
that average slope in z.1 
But though there is great need to guard against the 
meaningless manipulation of symbols in mathematics, just 
as there is to guard against the parrot-like vocalization of 
words in ordinary thinking, yet nothing would be farther 
from the truth than to belittle the importance of mathe- 
matical notation. Again and again in the progress of the 
physical sciences it has occurred that the invention of a 
suitable notation has enabled, has indeed caused, a leap 
forward to be made. With a good notation a mediocrity 
in reasoning may perchance accomplish as much as would 
1 Note that if curve z had at any point come downhill, curve y would 
have gone below the z axis.

a genius without it; but genius is needed for the creation 
of the notation. The help given by the notation comes 
to pass in two chief ways: by enabling details of situations 
to be seen at a glance, and by enabling rules of manipulation 
already familiar in another realm to be transferred to the 
new province. Good.examples of the first point are the 
chemical notation, e.g. H,O for water, or C,H,,,.0 for a 
general class of alcohols; and in mathematics, the second 
point is illustrated, for example, by the superiority of the 
notation, in the “‘ Rule of Three,” of 
3 
4 
Rle 
over 
324:2::9: 12 
For by the employment of the former notation we are 
enabled at once to use all our knowledge about fractions. 
Instead of learning a new rule, that the “ product of the 
inner numbers equals the product of the outer numbers ” 
(4 x 9 = 3 xX 12), we treat the whole by our former 
knowledge of simple equations. On a large scale this 
process is seen all over the realm of mathematical physics. 
Getting the equations of some new phenomenon into a form 
where the known mathematics of wave motion in water (say) 
can be applied, is a familiar task. Just as words represent 
concepts, represent general ideas divested of irrelevant 
details, so mathematical symbols represent such general 
ideas, with the additional advantage that not only are the 
irrelevant details omitted, but the distinguishing details are 
indicated in a way not usual in words, except it be in scientific 
words such as tetramethylbutane. The importance of being 
able to transfer abilities acquired in one field to do useful 
service in another, as in these mathematical examples, is 
very great. It is furthered to some extent also by ordinary 
words, especially by all the language of relationships. Our 
word-making, both in the history of language and in every- 
182
-P-A-G-E-131
  MATHEMATICAL AND OTHER SYMBOLS 
day slang, shows it. Proverbs show it. Often they are 
pointed transfers of a relationship from a concrete case to a 
more abstract case. ‘The early bird catches the worm.” 
“A stitch in time saves nine.” 
The whole question of “ transfer” in its technical sense 
is one which has greatly exercised the psychological and 
educational world. This narrower question is whether 
exercising one function (as practising Latin composition) 
will cause, by “transfer,” an improvement in another 
function (such as pleading as a lawyer, or practising as a 
physician). The discussion of this problem requires a special 
chapter wherein to follow the somewhat paradoxical results 
of experiment in this field. 
188
-P-A-G-E-132
    CHAPTER XIV 
THE TRANSFER OF TRAINING 
Tue problem of the transfer of training has three or four 
different aspects requiring separate consideration. There 
is first. the entanglement with faculty psychology, accord- 
ing to which, if the memory or the reason or the imagina- 
tion are exercised they are strengthened, and therefore of 
course can act with greater efficiency in any situation. 
Closely connected with this is the argument invented by 
teachers of subjects which have lost with changing con- 
ditions of life their once obvious utilitarian value, claiming 
for them a “disciplinary ’’ effect, improving faculties in the 
mind. Then there are the views of the laboratory experi- 
menter whose researches show hardly any transfer of 
training acquired in one field to any other field: of experi- 
menters in schools, who find more transfer though still not 
much : of teachers and employers, who think they observe 
a great deal of transfer. And, lastly, there is the paradox 
that a widely accepted definition of intelligence calls it the 
power of meeting new situations, of recognizing in novel 
situations sufficiently familiar points to enable reactions 
learned elsewhere to be transferred to the new situation. 
Faculty psychology, under whose wings those who 
believe in free transfer of training feel most at home, is 
almost entirely rejected to-day by competent psychologists, 
and for two main reasons. In the first place, it separated 
the mind into watertight compartments labelled ‘the 
reason,” “the imagination,” ‘‘ memory,” ‘ observation,” 
and so on, in a way which seems at variance with the 
184
-P-A-G-E-133
  THE TRANSFER OF TRAINING 
obvious unity of the mind, and at variance, less obviously, 
with the known facts about the brain, which is so closely 
associated with the mind. And, in the second place, it 
created entities which were called by the names of these 
faculties, it almost personified them, and led thus to 
fallacious arguments such as ‘“‘Jones remembered the 
points of that lecture remarkably well, he must have an 
excellent memory—he would be a keen competitor in my 
job, where I need to remember so many facts about my 
customers, their names and business connections and so 
on.” Such an argument begs the “transfer’’ question. 
And in less crude and less noticeable forms such arguments 
are being used daily by all of us, often to our later con- 
fusion. The school subject which has usually been cited 
by those who attack “ formal training ” as a reason for the 
existence of any portion of the curriculum is Latin. I 
do not know that the Latin teachers would agree; but 
according to those who want Latin out of the schools, or 
dethroned from a place of sovereignty, its teachers claim 
that through their teaching of that language, and through 
a study of the classical literature, their pupils gain a mental 
power which enables them to do almost anything well in 
after years; do anything well, that is, to an extent pro- 
portional to their success in absorbing the Latin teaching 
of their school period. 
I fancy that the Latinists would not put it quite that 
way, but would lay at least some stress on—not the training 
of the intelligence, but the amassing of knowledge of human 
kind and its fundamental passions, and the acquiring of 
a vocabulary in terms of which to think and speak. Be 
that as it may, to their triumphant production of many 
successful and great men who were trained in the classics, 
their opponents counter with the retort that these men are 
the result of selection, not of training. They usually come 
from the already successful class who could send their boys 
to a Public School. Or if not from this class, they were 
185  
-P-A-G-E-134
INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
still more directly selected individually and in their own 
persons by some Scholarship Examination, and by some 
discerning headmaster who saw them as clever enough to 
be put in for such an examination. The Latin course was 
a stiff one, and those who did well in it almost invariably 
showed ability in various walks of life later—but not 
because of the Latin. Rather, because of their own innate 
intellect, which had enabled them to shine both here and 
there, both in Latin class and in Parliament. According 
to this view, indeed, the Latin course is a prolonged intelli- 
gence test discovering intelligence of a high order, not 
making it. And could it have been discovered otherwise 
and in shorter time (as may perhaps be done some day by 
“Intelligence Tests”), the time spent on Latin might 
better have been given to some more directly useful training, 
closer in its nature to the work to be done in later life. 
This argument leaves out of count, of course, the claims 
of Latin to inclusion for other reasons, such as giving 
training for leisure rather than for work. It is directed 
only at the claim that Latin “ strengthens the intellect.” 
But it is time that we turned to experiments designed 
specifically to test whether training does really transfer. 
In their earlier forms, some twenty-five years ago, such 
researches contained numerous experimental errors, but 
many of these have been corrected, and the form which 
such an experiment in more recent years has usually taken 
is somewhat like this. 
Two groups of persons (usually school children) are 
chosen, one of which is presently to be subjected to intensive 
training in a definite material (say memorizing lists of 
nonsense syllables—a definitely useless procedure, but one 
presumably training “the memory,” if such an entity 
exists); while the other, called the “control group,” is 
not to have any such training. Let us suppose that we 
wish to ascertain whether learning such lists of nonsense 
syllables will cause an improvement in the power to learn 
136 ’ 
  
TK

  THE TRANSFER OF TRAINING 
useful passages of prose, or to learn historical dates, or 
what not. 
The two groups—the “ control group” and the group to 
be trained—are chosen so as to match each other very 
carefully. To each member of the one group there corre- 
sponds a member of the other group who has the same 
qualities as far as they are relevant ; for example, is of the 
same or closely similar age, same sex, same race, same 
school training, same intelligence, same present ability in 
memorizing prose, and so on. To obtain two such groups 
a larger number of subjects has to be examined, intelligence 
tests have to be administered, preliminary memory tests 
given. 
Usually or most accurately, moreover, it is further 
desirable to have yet other groups, and for this reason. 
The object is to see how much the groups improve in 
learning nonsense syllables and in learning prose. For 
this purpose a piece of prose has to be learned in the pre- 
liminary test and another piece in the final test. Now, 
it is impossible to ensure that these two tests are of exactly 
equal difficulty: and therefore any change in score may 
be due to the second test being easier, or harder, than the 
first one. If, however, the whole experiment as described 
above is duplicated, and in this duplicate experiment the 
two tests are given in reverse order, the former preliminary 
test being here the final test and vice versa, then on the 
average of the two experiments the errors we have been 
considering will be cancelled. 
To sum up, then, we want four groups of subjects, A, B 
C, and D, which groups have to be as exactly matched as 
possible, in the sense that to any member of group A there 
correspond members of B,C, and D who are at the begin- 
ning of the experiment equally able in the things to be 
tested, and have other qualities as alike as possible. A 
and B are given certain preliminary tests in memory and 
certain final tests—C and D are given, for preliminary tests, 
137
-P-A-G-E-136
  “INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
those used as finals for A and B, and vice versa. A and C 
are now given intensive practice (for a fortnight, a month, 
or even a year) in learning nonsense syllables, while B and 
D are given no such practice, filling in the corresponding 
time of day with, say, a task in copying drawings. Other- 
wise the daily round of all four groups should be alike. 
When at the end of the experiment all the groups are 
again tested, the following results are those commonly 
found. 
A and C, which have practised learning nonsense syllables, 
have naturally improved a great deal in this activity. B 
and D have usually also improved somewhat in this in spite 
of having had no practice—this is commonly attributed 
either to “ growth”’ or to the practice effect of the first 
test itselfi—but to a very slight extent compared with 
A and C. 
The interesting question, however, is whether the prac- 
tice in nonsense syllables has “transferred’’ to learning 
prose. In the test in prose, all four groups have usually 
improved, but the improvement of A and C is commonly 
a little more than the improvement of the control groups 
Band D. Not a great deal more—it varies from the same 
to about twice as much. And certainly a great deal less 
than would have been shown had the time been directly 
applied to practising prose learning. This last point is 
particularly well brought out when a still more cunning 
arrangement of groups is used, as by Dr. W. G. Sleight.? 
It would be a good exercise for a reader to plan an arrange- 
ment to test this point. 
There cannot be much doubt in the mind of anyone 
who has studied experiments like that outlined above, that 
the general picture shown in them is “ very little transfer ”’ ; 
and that to get improvement in a certain function or in 
certain material it is many times more advisable to give 
training in that function itself, or that material itself,

THE TRANSFER OF TRAINING 
rather than in anything else with the hope of obtaining 
transfer. The arguments which could still be brought 
forward by the believer in transfer are mainly (1) that 
these experiments are very short, lasting only a few weeks 
as a rule, and perhaps are not long enough to show results ; 
(2) that during these weeks the special training of the 
group undergoing practice is a merely insignificant addition 
to the training of the whole school day. In practising the 
memory for nonsense syllables, for example, it cannot be 
supposed that ‘‘ the memory ” of either the practice group 
or the control group is lying dormant during the remaining 
234 hours of the day. And (3) that the methods of work, 
and the incentives to work, are so closely controlled, and 
everything made so mechanical, that the greatest faetor in 
transfer is rendered nugatory—namely, the recognition of 
general ways of working successfully. 
All these points have something of the truth in them. 
They may be summed up by saying that the experiments 
are too artificial to apply to life. In fact, an opponent 
might make a good debating point by saying: “If you 
believe that there is no transfer, then you mustn’t transfer 
what you learn in these narrow experiments to anything 
except to other similar experiments, certainly not to normal 
school work or to life.” 
The answer to this is that experiments have been con- 
ducted, though as yet in only a few instances, which do 
actually approximate very closely to natural conditions. 
The best of these from the point of view of extent and 
natural background is that conducted by Thorndike in 
1922-23 in the United States.1 The number of children 
acting as subjects was over eight thousand. They had no 
idea they were acting as subjects. The work in which they 
were practised was their actual school work. The function 
which was tested with a view to detecting transfer, was 
the power to obtain high marks in portions of the very 
1 See Journ. of Educ. Psychol., January 1924, 
189
-P-A-G-E-138
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
reliable intelligence test known as the I.E.R. (Institute of 
Educational Research, Teachers’ College, Columbia) test. 
The children were given this test at the beginning and at 
the end of the school year. Naturally they improved their 
scores on the second occasion as compared with the first. 
The question was whether some of the school subjects had 
improved their “intelligence ’’ more than others, and the 
answer on the whole was that there was very little differ- 
ence in this respect, stenography being pretty well as good 
as any other subject, Latin much the same as cookery, 
French, or natural history. .The general plan of the statis- 
tical investigation was to select from the 8,000 children 
two groups who were taking the same school subjects, 
except that one group took, say, Latin where the other took, 
say, cookery. Only one subject was to be different in the 
two groups. (There were certain permissible departures 
from this rule which are explained in the article.) Thus 
differences, if any, between the two groups may be sup- 
posed to be caused by the one subject which differs. 
The “fallacy of sélection ’’ was carefully borne in mind 
as a possible vitiation, and suitable precautions taken to 
make reasonably certain that the final results were not 
caused by this factor. Indeed, it can hardly be appealed to 
as explaining why cookery students (say) did well in the 
matter of improvement during the year, for no one will 
be likely to assert that they are specially selected for intelli- 
gence as compared with Latin students. And improve- 
ment is, on the whole, positively correlated with initial 
marks. 
In this admirably conducted investigation hardly any 
loophole is left for the critic who assails the practice period 
on the score of artificiality or shortness of duration. It 
‘was the normal school year with regular ordinary school 
work. On the other hand, it may perhaps be claimed by 
opponents that the test is still artificial and unlike real life 
tests: and especially that it was short. If the testing 
140
-P-A-G-E-139
  THE TRANSFER OF TRAINING 
could have approximated as closely to real life conditions 
as the practice did to real school conditions, it may be 
thought that perhaps the Latin and mathematics training 
would have emerged. The only way in which one can 
think readily of this being done is to follow up large numbers 
of the pupils in life for a few years and see how they do. 
There would then arise difficulties enough of another sort, 
the great expense of such an investigation, the difficulty 
of obtaining quantitative and objective measures of relative 
“success ’’ in life, the danger of losing track not of an 
unselected sample of the whole but of special classes, such 
as those who have greater wanderlust, which might well 
be correlated with intelligence. And then success is not 
due to intelligence alone. 
On the whole, the experimenters must be granted their 
claim to have shown that transfer is nothing like as easy 
to detect as it ought to be, were it occurring on as whole- 
sale a scale as once was believed. The belief in transfer 
among teachers and others, in so far as it survives a study 
of the experiments, must rationalize itself by supposing 
that the experiments somehow miss transfer by being too 
artificial, or by their tests being too short and not measuring 
quite the right thing. 
It is my own belief that the speed factor in tests, while 
not the reprehensible thing which some lay critics would 
have us believe, yet does lead to a possible error by 
minimizing the advantages derived from transfer of training. 
By the speed factor I mean the fact that tests have to be 
performed with a time limit at a certain place and on a 
certain occasion. In some intelligence tests—as in the 
American army tests—this speed factor distinctly causes 
a hurried feeling. In these tests only so many minutes are 
given for each page, or even so many seconds for each 
question, a device probably desirable in testing for the 
kind of “ on-the-spottitude ” (as I have heard it called) 
needed in warfare, but not perhaps so uniquely essential 
141
-P-A-G-E-140
    INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
everywhere. Not all tests have the speed timing in the 
same degree. In Thorndike’s I.E.R. tests the children 
were advised when to turn the page, but allowed to 
turn back at any point or to go ahead quicker—and 
the questions were so graded that few children could 
have done any more even if another half hour had been 
given. 
Yet the fact remains that such tests only measure what 
can be done in an hour or a half-day of rather pressing 
work ; and it is possible that such is not much influenced 
by training, and yet that more deliberate work may be 
influenced. What the person of average ability gets out 
of a mathematical training, for instance, apart from the 
actual knowledge, is a habit of mind when confronted with 
quantitative problems, a belief that an orderly setting 
down of the problem in a suitable notation will go far 
towards solving it, a confidence that the right answer can 
be recognized as such by simple tests when it is obtained, 
and a familiarity with abstract notions of space and time 
relationships which is greatly encouraged by the proper 
association of symbols with geometrical or physical ex- 
amples. Such habits of mind appear, a priori, to be likely 
enough to transfer to any quantitative problem of life not 
commonly called mathematical; and to lead to greater 
power in dealing with such problems ; but not immediately 
to greater speed in dealing with them. 
It is true that experiment has an answer ready, and one 
to be considered with care. It is, that whenever “ speed ” 
and ‘“‘ power ” of thinking have been measured separately, 
a fairly large positive correlation has been found between 
them, they have been found to go, on the whole, together. 
These experiments have perhaps hardly measured power by 
sufficiently difficult thinking, but as far as they go they 
tend in the direction noted. It will be seen that the whole 
of this transfer dispute is one between wide observation 
and narrow experiment. Wide observation gets something 
142
-P-A-G-E-141
  THE TRANSFER OF TRAINING 
which narrow experiment may miss. But wide observation 
is open to many more sources of error, fallacies of material, 
and bias of judgment. And narrow experiment is ever 
widening. Experiment will have the last word, but its final 
verdict may not be its present dictum. 
Anyhow, certain conclusions seem forced upon the 
acceptance of the educator. Transfer of training appears, 
to put it cautiously, to be much less certain and of much 
narrower spread than once was believed.! Subjects of 
instruction will not therefore be included in the curriculum 
lightheartedly on the formal “discipline of the mind” 
argument. Other things being reasonably equal, useful 
subjects will have the preference. On the other hand, 
“useful” subjects have a trick of being subjects which 
anybody can do. Much as it may arouse the antagonism 
of friends and colleagues, I feel compelled by intellectual 
honesty to say that almost any girl can learn to cook, or 
to do schoo! botany, while only few girls can do mathe- 
matics or Latin. I think a much stronger case for the 
inclusion of those latter subjects could be made out on the 
lines of their efficiency as selective agencies for finding 
intelligence, than on their training powers. Why not 
reverse a common argument ? and say, since we must give 
intelligent tests, let us give tests which are also training the 
child in something useful in itself. Such an intelligence 
test is formed by a year’s course in mathematics, or Latin ; 
and the material incidentally learned, though not perhaps 
so useful as cookery or stenography, is not altogether 
useless in some circumstances. 
Joking apart, it is certain that if any portion of the 
1 According to one writer at least, this has been the salvation of the 
schools. After remarking on the comparative laxity, in comparison 
with business practice, which is shown by the schools in matters such 
as punctuality, regularity of attendance, and so on, he adds: ‘“ Let it 
be fully recognized by the teacher that only the fact that there is little 
transfer of training between the schoolroom and the office, factory or 
field, prevents his methods from proving a lifelong handicap to his 
students in their struggle for a living” (William R. Wilson in School 
and Society, February 9, 1924). 
148  
-P-A-G-E-142
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
“‘ discipline ” theory is retained by teachers in their working 
creed—and they retain even more than they admit—they 
must be up and doing in every aspect of their teaching in 
order to make transfer more probable or greater in quantity. 
From experiments of an exact nature such as Sleight’s, 
and from much more numerous and unrecorded experi- 
ments of a rough-and-ready sort which teachers are every- 
day making, it seems very probable that transfer can be 
greatly aided by methods of teaching. In general, the rule 
appears to be that any teaching which makes the pupil 
more conscious of how successful results are obtained, is 
likely to assist transfer. 
In memorizing nonsense syllables, it may be an improve- 
ment to say them silently: and if so, to realize this and 
apply it to memorizing a prose passage may create transfer. 
In playing tennis, improvement may come from keeping 
one’s eye on the ball, and the consciousness of this may 
cause transfer to playing cricket, in spite of the different 
stroke. In weighing evidence in history, the actual con- 
sciousness of the importance of having all the evidence 
before one may cause transfer to weighing evidence in 
business affairs or in a chemical or even a mathematical 
problem. A conscious effort to make quite certain that 
one is not looking at a special, instead of a general case, 
in mathematics may transfer to geography or to biology. 
A conscious appreciation of the importance of trying a 
general law on many cases, and especially on limiting cases, 
may transfer from mathematics to politics, or from the 
science of languages to. the affairs of life. Shortly, if each 
and every subject is taught as a page or chapter of the 
universal subject ‘how to think,” and the principles of 
“how to think” are constantly and consciously appealed 
to, transfer appears to be much more probable. And what 
is true on the intellectual side of the mind is, I believe, 
also true, indeed is still more obviously true, on the side 
of character and effort. Ideals of tidy records, clean 
144 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  -THE TRANSFER OF TRAINING 
apparatus, the power of industry, the importance of experi- 
mental honesty, will transfer the more surely, the more they 
are made conscious. 
There are, however, right and wrong ways of getting 
such ideas consciously grasped by the mind. What is 
meant above is that they should be understood with con- 
viction, not that they should be reproduced in parrot-like 
Trepetition of a verbal form. There comes first an uncon- 
scious employment of certain principles or ideals. These 
gradually become clearer and more definitely outlined. 
They are recognized by their owner and named, and thereby 
gain tremendously in effectiveness and in transfer-power. 
This recognition must, however, await the slow growth of 
the idea to be recognized. The teacher cannot put the 
words into the pupil’s mouth—or rather, unfortunately, he 
can do so, but if he does it too early he will give mere 
words. “‘ Honesty is the best policy ” ; “ Don’t jump to con- 
clusions in too big a hurry”; “Test it on a new case ” ; 
these are generalizations whose spirit cannot be taught 
by giving a form of words. Pupils must earn them for 
themselves. 
Really the transfer question, in the way it has been put 
up to this point in this chapter, is being presented inside 
out ; and a consideration of just what this means may lead 
to a better understanding of the whole psychological situa- 
tion. I have just said that it is desirable, in order to get 
transfer, that certain ways and means of achieving success 
should become consciously recognized by the pupil. These 
ways and means are highly abstract matters, such as 
honesty, or tidiness, or avoiding special cases, or suspending 
judgment. Now what are the methods of making any 
pupil conscious of some abstract idea? They are first to 
present instances in which the abstract idea is embodied, 
taking care that all the irrelevant concomitants of the idea 
change and change, until, among the sum total of instances, 
nothing is common except the idea in question. And 
145 EK 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
secondly, to present many pairs of instances in which all 
the concomitants remain the same in the two members of 
the pair, while the idea in question is present in one and 
absent or in some way greatly changed in the other. For 
example, in teaching subtraction, cows are subtracted 
from cows, beads from beads, cups from cups, apples 
from apples and only finally numbers from numbers. 
While addition and subtraction are juxtaposed and 
_ contrasted. 
If these principles are correct, then the way to excite 
consciousness of, say, the importance of testing a generaliza- 
tion by trying it on a limiting case, will be to present this 
notion in many varied guises, now in mathematics, now in 
languages, now in history, in order that it may rise superior 
to its accidental concomitants and penetrate into the mind. 
This implies that these ideals of methods cannot be really 
well taught in any one subject, for they will not become 
generalized. The mathematician may not learn to be 
accurate, only to be accurate-in-mathematics. But the 
chemist-cum-biologist may have a better chance of learning 
accuracy in itself, having learned it in two different pro- 
vinces. So it may be, may it not, that transfer from three 
or four subjects to a fifth, or to life, may be greater than 
from one even if taught more intensively. Thorndike 
would be able, on his ‘‘ theory of common elements,” to 
say that this was due to several school subjects naturally 
having among them more points of contact with a new 
subject than any one alone will have. But in part it may 
be due to the cause I have suggested, rendering methods 
of work conscious and clear because they are seen against 
more than one background. 
If this has any grain of truth in it, then over-narrowness 
of curriculum is to be avoided. Not. that there is any 
danger of this in the modern English school, and still less 
inthe American; at least, until the age of sixteen or there- 
abouts is reached. After that there is danger that the 
146
-P-A-G-E-145
  
  THE TRANSFER OF TRAINING 
pupils, by being shepherded into advanced courses in school, 
and honours courses in college may over-specialize, a pro- 
cedure comparatively innocuous to the really clever youth, 
but very bad for the average person. 
Not only is there the danger, in too narrow a curriculum, 
that ideals of method may not be consciously conceived. 
There is the supplementary danger that erroneous ideals 
may be formed and transferred to provinces where they 
are out of place. A mathematician easily gains the con- 
viction, for example, that all the data of a problem are 
easily assembled, are perfectly definite, and that the main 
difficulty is in reasoning out their consequences. Whereas 
in history or in life, the chief difficulty is just in obtaining 
all the data and appraising their relative bearing and 
importance. Or a physicist easily gets the fixed convic- 
tion that men must act, under experimental conditions, as 
predictably as do atoms. Or a historian, since much in 
this science is open to discussion and differences of opinion, 
is unable to appreciate the wish for absolute proof which 
moves in the breast of a chemist, or the fact that absolute 
proof is ever possible. 
There are various theories which explain the facts con- 
cerning transfer, especially Thorndike’s Theory of Common 
Elements and Spearman’s Theory of Two Factors. But 
as these theories are more readily discussed as theories of 
the structure of the intellect, and are highly controversial, 
we may advantageously postpone them and turn to a matter 
concerned. not with the intellectual side of man’s mind so 
much as with its emotional side and with character. 
For after all, the greatest difference between persons who 
have studied different subjects is not so much in their 
intellect as in their interests and prejudices. And the effect 
which studies have on these is perhaps more important 
than the intellectual spread of ability. As a child grows 
up he develops ways of looking at the world, and ways of 
reacting to situations ; he grows up into a conservative or

a radical, a solicitor or a plumber, an atheist or a Wesleyan 
Methodist, a patriot or a cosmopolitan, and the differences 
between these are not merely differences in skill or in 
knowledge or in power of reasoning, not merely differences 
in the integration of knowledge into science, but also in 
the integration of the feelings and the emotions into 
sentiments.

  CHAPTER XV 
INTERESTS AND PREJUDICES 
In the type of psychology which is called Herbartian the 
“ apperception-mass ”’ is an important concept. An apper- 
ception-mass is a group of ideas which are related to one 
another, have links of association which bind the whole 
together. For example, I have a certain apperception-mass 
which is centred round the ideas of evolution and natural 
selection. Within this “mass” are numerous pieces of 
knowledge of various biological facts, beginning with many 
from Darwin’s Origin of Species; various illustrations of 
the way in which natural selection works (such as the 
illustration employed in Chapter II of this book) ; pictures 
of geological specimens ; visions of the slow change of life 
on this planet through the rolling ages; names and lives 
of men like Lamarck, Darwin himself, Huxley, Weismann, 
Wallace. All these ideas and facts are integrated loosely 
into a whole system which comes, in one or other of its 
parts, readily into my mind when any new theory is dis- 
cussed which deals with animal or plant forms. 
According to the Herbartian theory of apperception, I 
shall be interested in a new idea if I possess a strong apper- 
ception-mass to which the new idea can be affiliated, and 
if this apperception-mass, this set of welcoming ideas, is 
in my mind when the new idea is communicated to me, or 
if not in consciousness at the moment, at once enters it. 
Although this is a very one-sided view of what happens, 
yet it is an important view, and is worth more careful 
examination before we contemplate other aspects of the 
149
-P-A-G-E-148
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
matter. It means, in teaching, that interest in any idea 
or fact can be obtained if that idea can be seen to fit in with 
an already organized body of knowledge, to modify and 
illuminate that: body of knowledge and make it hang 
together better. For example, a boy with a considerable 
acquaintance with birds’ eggs would have, as we say, an 
active apperception-mass of ideas concerning them. If he 
were told that seagulls’ eggs are very unequal at the two 
ends so that they will not roll far, but only in a small circle, 
and thus do not fall off ledges, this new idea would certainly 
arouse actively a lot of his ‘‘ birds’ egg ”’ apperception-mass, 
and its acceptance or rejection would depend upon its con- 
gruity with what he already knew. And if accepted, the 
new idea would alter the flavour of many familiar facts 
about eggs. 
I should say as a precaution, and incidentally as another 
example, that I do not know whether the egg theory is 
valid or not. When first propounded to me on the Farne 
Islands by a companion, it fitted in well enough with what 
little I knew about birds’ eggs, and seemed not to be antago- 
nistic to my natural-selection apperception-mass also, since 
it appeared likely enough that seagulls laying spherical eggs 
on rocky ledges would leave few offspring. 
The famous “ Formal Steps,” which according to Her- 
bartian doctrine ought to be found in a lesson or teaching 
unit, were based largely on this idea of apperception. The 
first task of the teacher, in the preparation step, was to 
recall and refresh that apperception-mass which was likely 
to welcome and assimilate the new material, which was 
then presented in the second stage of the lesson, the presen- 
tation. (The names are English translations of German 
terms—presumably terms coined by disciples, for the names 
used by Herbart are distinctly different.) Then oppor- 
tunity and encouragement and assistance were given, in 
the third or association stage, to the process of bringing the 
new material into comparison and contrast with all the 
150
-P-A-G-E-149
  INTERESTS AND PREJUDICES 
parts of the apperception-mass, and endeavouring to fit 
it into its place in this particular scheme of things. In this 
process the new material and the previously existing ideas 
come, under favourable circumstances, to form a new and 
wider apperception-mass, the clearing up and defining of 
which is the task of the fourth step of “ generalization.” 
In the final step of “application ”’ the concept thus won 
is applied to the comprehension of other cases, and receives 
verification from them. 
For instance, it might be the desire of the teacher to 
lead the pupils to form the generalization that the rapidity 
with which a pendulum oscillates is inversely proportional 
to the square root of its length. The problem might arise 
out of a project to make a pendulum of given speed of 
oscillation, or out of investigations as to the effects of 
temperature on clocks by causing expansion and contrac- 
tion of the pendulum ; which facts, and the general know- 
ledge that a pendulum goes more slowly if long, form the 
apperception-mass called up by the preliminary announce- 
ment, remarks, and questions of the teacher. The presen- 
tation would consist in requiring measurements of length 
and time of certain pendula: and the skill of the teacher 
would in part lie in “requiring” these not by a direct 
request but by causing a curiosity to know them, by 
cunningly arranging that they shall be made for some 
reason or other, or by seizing upon chance happenings and 
just giving this particular lesson (unpremeditated) when 
such favourable chances occurred. 
The measurements, when assembled, have to be looked 
over and “ guesses ’’ made as to their connection, as to the 
law governing them, judgment in each case being held in 
suspense till the guess is tested on other, and if necessary on 
new measurements. And here a new kind of apperception 
mass comes into play—or rather it is always in play, but 
we first notice it here and now—and that is, a general 
collection of ways and habits of dealing with numerical 
151
-P-A-G-E-150
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
data, and a knowledge that such data generally reveal 
some law when tried in various ways. Among such ways 
are making graphic curves, forming simple functions such 
as products, sines, squares, forming differences between 
consecutive values, and a host more. By such means a 
law may ultimately be discovered which gives the con- 
nection between the length and time of swing of a pendulum, 
and enables the one to be predicted from the other. 
We must leave for the present? the enticing development 
of how such empirical laws as the above fail to satisfy us 
and how we only are content when we can deduce the 
same law from intuitive premises by logical steps: and 
return to our discussion of the Herbartian doctrine of 
apperception. The new facts which are introduced in the 
presentation merge themselves in the apperception-mass, 
and modify it, as a piece of sugar disappears in a cup of 
tea, which is itself changed into a drink with a new flavour. 
The new apperception-mass, being richer and more articu- 
lated than the old, will have more points of contact with 
the unknown, will be more capable of absorbing new data 
and new ideas. Thus the circle of thought goes on in- 
creasing its area, throwing out projections here and there 
along this or that radius but, in a harmonious education, 
always from time to time filling in the intervening sectors 
and making an integrated whole. 
The pendulum illustration, though excellent for illus- 
trating the Five Steps, emphasizes mainly a logical aspect 
of apperception, whereas Herbart was concerned rather with 
the active power of ideas to seize others even when no such 
scientific generalization as that of the pendulum law is 
found. There must no doubt always be a certain logical 
satisfaction, but the plane of reasoning may be very low. 
To take examples at various levels, we may cite under- 
standing a new country by comparison and contrast with 
the home neighbourhood and countries already studied ;

interested in new stamps because one already has a wide 
knowledge of them ; hearing a sonata with greater interest 
and comprehension after facts about sonatas already known 
have been recalled, and certain of the themes have been 
anticipated and played over. 
When a man visits a town, he is unlikely to settle there 
if he is lonely and no one is recognizable as belonging to 
his set, his profession, his lodge, his church, or his college. 
But if some of these have been called to the station to 
meet him, and he is in pleasant fashion introduced and 
make known to them and they to him, he may remain, 
settle down, marry into the town, and influence by his 
presence the particular group which has absorbed him. So 
it is in teaching, where the art of the teacher consists in 
part in calling to the front the right ideas to meet the 
new-comer, and in making suitable introductions. 
Now in this Herbartian view of interest, useful as it has 
been and can still be to the teacher as a guide, there are 
two main deficiencies. The one is that, in the preparation 
part of a lesson, it is far more important that a problem 
attitude should be evoked, that a project to do something 
should arise, than that certain ideas should be haled into 
the focus of consciousness. 
The other is that the Herbartian view of the growth of 
interests makes the whole matter far too exclusively an 
affair of the intellect, instead of being to an even greater 
extent dependent upon the instincts and the emotions. 
Herbart and his followers realized and emphasized the way 
in which cognitive ideas, pieces of knowledge, aspects of 
a subject, generalizations, are built up into systems which 
are the working mind, viewed as a logical machine. It 
was left for a later generation of psychologists to appreciate 
the fact that there are similar structures on the side of the 
feelings also, corresponding to apperception-masses on the 
158
-P-A-G-E-152
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
cognitive side. These are the sentiments, or the complexes 4 
of the “new psychology,” which, drawing their energy from 
the instincts, put vital force into the rather marionette-like 
figures on the Herbartian stage of consciousness. 
A sentiment is a kind of structure of the emotions round 
some object or idea, so that when this object or idea appears 
in a situation we tend to develop emotions which prevent 
us from thinking in an entirely unbiassed way and we tend 
to behave in what may often seem, and be, an irrational 
manner. In short, a sentiment is a prejudice, if we take 
the latter word at its face value; or rather, there is no 
judgment at all except a trumped-up judgment which 
deceives ourselves more than it deceives others. Sentiments 
may be very laudable things, and the arguments may be 
valid with which we support them, and yet not owe their 
force to that validity. 
For example, patriotism is a sentiment. The emotions 
are organized in a certain way about the idea of our native 
country, and about persons and symbols which represent 
it. So we thrill at the sight of our flag in a foreign land, 
burn with indignation at any insult to our ambassador, 
feel fear lest the country’s prestige should suffer in a world 
conference, and hatred of all who oppose its ambitions. 
A sentiment is not itself an emotion, or group of emotions, 
it is the permanent set or attitude which ensures that 
emotions of a given sort will arise in situations involving 
the object of the sentiment. It is an organization of 
emotions round an object or idea, while the apperception- 
mass is an organization of ideas and cognitive facts. With- 
out doubt the two should be considered together, for the 
idea which is the centre of a sentiment is itself part of an 
apperception-mass, and any other part of that mass may 
The word complex is used by the mere orthodox followers of Freud 
and Jung, it would appear, to mean only a “‘repressed’’ complex. As 
almost an equivalent of Shand’s term ‘“‘sentiment”’ it has been widely 
popularized by Tansley’s book The New Psychology. There seems also 
a tendency to use sentiment for the weaker kinds of complex. 
154
-P-A-G-E-153
  INTERESTS AND PREJUDICES 
in more or less effective measure act as the cue to release 
the emotions. Thus, in the patriotism sentiment, any 
member of a widespread apperception-mass (which includes 
the flag, the ambassador, facts about my country’s foreign 
policy, and what not) may arouse patriotically directed 
emotions. In a sentiment of a narrower and more personal 
kind, such as may form round a favourite pipe, it is more 
truly a single object which is the focus, and the sentiment 
is almost wholly an organization of emotions alone. In 
love for a person of the opposite sex, there is a wide set of 
cues which may be active; but these are mainly objects 
and places accidentally associated with the loved one, as 
a dress, a book, a room, or the like. 
When an apperception-mass is called into consciousness 
as in the Herbartian lesson, the ideas which it is likely to 
assimilate and accept are by no means those which find 
logical affinity, which fit nicely into the intellectual struc- 
ture, or which indicate obvious modifications and simplifi- 
cations of that intellectual structure. In the case of the 
pendulum lesson, where no sentiments are likely to be 
involved, no prejudices toned with feeling likely to be 
present, the acceptance of the new generalization does 
mainly depend on its logical congruity with what is already 
known, though even here the teacher’s prestige will be 
a force to be reckoned with. In the case of many new 
ideas, however, it is far more the fact that their acceptance 
depends on the sentiments than on logical suitability. 
Take for example the ideas of evolution and natural selec- 
tion referred to in the opening paragraph of this chapter, 
and consider their reception by the minds of men of the 
mid-nineteenth century when they were first introduced to 
widespread notice. Their acceptance or rejection by an indi- 
vidual depended far more upon feelings than upon facts. 
Only if we extend the apperception-mass to include all the 
sentimental structure woven into and around it can we 
follow the Herbartian doctrine. And if we do so, then 
155
-P-A-G-E-154
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
we have to recognize that the circle of a pupil’s interest 
will grow not only by feeding on ideas but by practising 
behaviour actuated by feelings. 
The preceding paragraphs must be understood as dwelling 
on the interaction of the feelings and the intellect, not on 
their separation. Saying that new ideas will be accepted 
mainly because of congruity with prejudices and senti- 
ments does not mean that the latter are constant and 
impervious to the influence of ideas. There is constant 
mutual influence. A biologist is reported to have said of 
a clergyman who rejected the Darwinian doctrines with 
vehemence, that if he would only come and take a three 
years’ course in biology, he would change his mind. And 
doubtless, could his prejudices have been overcome so far 
as to permit him to take such a course, the influx of new 
experiences would have considerably modified his pre- 
jJudices by enlarging his circle of ideas. But could the 
biologist have taken three years’ slumming with the clergy- 
man, possibly he might have changed too. 
Certainly sentiments are often formed by processes which 
cannot be described as consisting in enlarging our ideas. 
Properly arranged ceremonies of saluting the flag, honouring 
national observances, and singing national songs can pro- 
duce patriotism, as Americanization exercises in the United 
States clearly show. The whole question of this formation 
of sentiments is one of the greatest importance for education 
if education is to mean more than the accumulation of 
knowledge, and more even than the acquirement of skill 
or the training of intellectual powers. It is based on a 
proper handling of the instinctive forces of the individual, 
and it recognizes the instincts as the great sources of 
energy, the proper direction of which into suitable channels , 
is the main business of character formation.

  CHAPTER XVI 
REPRESSION AND SUBLIMATION 
Man is descended from the same ancestry as the animals, 
but he is different from them. He has won in the struggle 
for mastery on this planet because of the possession of 
powers which they lack. Viewed from the intellectual side, 
these powers take the form of the ability to reason, practi- 
cally lacking in animals even though the psychologist may 
with interested eye see its germs and beginnings there. 
And the power of reasoning is based, as we think, largely 
on a flexibility of response to situations, so that alternatives 
present themselves and are followed out, not by explicit 
action, but by imagery or by symbolic internal behaviour 
mainly in terms of words. 
From another point of view, however, man’s superiority 
isin the greater plasticity of his instincts, and the emotional 
drives associated with them, so that they can be directed 
away from the bestial gutters in which their untrammelled 
course would lie, into other channels. And so began in 
man the conflict of good and evil, for while the primordial 
path of expression of an instinct cannot be either blame- 
worthy or praiseworthy in a beast of the field which can 
respond in no other way, in man the channels into which 
instincts are diverted may be either noble or ignoble. The 
former choice is what the technical language of the new 
psychology calls sublimation, as when the sex instinct, finds 
expression for its energy in the ideals of chivalry and knight- 
hood. ‘The latter is perversion, as when the same sex 
instinct finds an outlet in pornography, or in secret or 
social vice. 
157
-P-A-G-E-156
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
An analogy which has been much used by exponents of 
this view is that of water power, the water drainage system 
of a country. The natural valleys down which the water 
rushes are the natural instincts, untouched by engineering, 
by education. In the animal these channels are fixed and 
hardly changeable. But in man the soil is more suitable 
for canalizing some of the river courses, diverting others, 
possibly blocking and damming others. In Thorndike’s 
phrase, education can encourage some instinctive responses, 
eliminate some, and redirect others. The main contribution 
of the psychoanalytic schools of Freud and Jung to the 
psychology of education has been, I think, their discovery 
of the frequency and magnitude of the dangers of endeavour- 
ing to eliminate instincts, and their insistence on the 
importance of redirection or sublimation. 
Merely repressing an instinct is like building a wall across 
the valley without making any provision for the piled-up 
waters being somehow drained away. In such a case one 
of three things may happen. The first is that the wall of 
repression may from time to time be broken through, and 
the pent-up energy rush down its old channel in an orgy 
of primitive passion, like the relapses of the converted 
drunkard, or the outbursts of the prodigal son of an over- 
strict home. Such débdcles, like the dam-bursts of a real 
country, do more harm than the unrestrained river would 
have created. A naive preventive is to release the flood 
gates from time to time: a harmless, indeed a beneficial 
plan in some cases, as when the nerve-strung city dweller 
runs off to the woods and lives the life of a primitive savage 
as nearly as he can, calling it camping or hunting or ex- 
ploring ; but in other cases very open to abuse, as were 
the riots of revelry on days such as accompanied, in the 
medieval Church, periods of repression and fasting (the 
modern Carnivals, Mardi Gras, Fasnacht, Mi-caréme). 
Sowing wild oats is not the best way of preventing the 
evils of repression. 
158
-P-A-G-E-157
  REPRESSION AND SUBLIMATION 
The second thing that can happen to our walled-up 
valley, our repressed: instinct, is that the water behind the 
wall may seep through in secret places (places unknown or 
from which we resolutely turn our gaze), and find channels 
of its own down which it runs to create new problems worse 
than those for which we built the wall. We prevent 
emulation in the school, because it so easily breeds envy 
and conceit, and it finds expression in seeing who can smoke 
most cigarettes, or know most swear words. We fail to 
take account of the sex instinct, we wall it off from life, 
and it leaks out in perversions, or transfers itself to unhealthy 
friendships and favouritisms. 
But thirdly, and perhaps worst, our dam may be a 
success. The valley below may be quite dry (and sterile), 
a Pyrrhic victory won at. the cost of absorbing the whole 
energy of the land in preserying and strengthening the dam. 
The need of restraining that imprisoned force neutralizes 
whatever else of force’ the individual possesses, and a 
tremendous mental’ conflict is set up, the more disastrous 
because its existence is denied, or is even unknown to 
consciousness. This is the analogue of the repressed com- 
plex of-the Freudians, the source of so much mental trouble. 
And as a valley may be dammed most easily near its source, 
so the Freudians find the cause of such repressions mainly 
in the early years of infancy, and Jend by their theories 
@ new importance to Gertrude teaching her children, to the 
fore-kindergarten and kindergarten years. Repression of 
instincts in those early years means that we block the 
natural channel but leave: to chance what the result will 
be. True educative agencies would block no channels, 
would merely divert slightly the flow of energy. In the 
hills a little thing may decide whether a spring will send 
its waters down this or that valley, and a result may be 
achieved which, if postponed, would have required marvels 
of engineering. 
The Freudian school seeks in the sex-complex most of 
159
-P-A-G-E-158
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
the repressions of mental life. And there is, of course, no 
doubt that it is in questions of sex that the conditions of 
modern civilization make most demands on redirection of 
instincts. On the one hand, natural selection will always 
tend to keep the sex instinct up to a high level of potential, 
for there must always be a tendency for those in whom 
it is strongest to leave more numerous progeny, other 
things being at all equal. And, on the other hand, modern 
civilization makes marriage an event occurring several or 
many years after adolescence and leads to post-marital 
restrictions and small families, while custom throws such 
a veil over all the questionings of the young concerning 
their own bodies, where babies come from, and the like, 
that there is a state of tension throughout society regarding 
these matters not found in connection with any other 
instinct. No doubt repression most commonly occurs here, 
and no doubt, too, sublimation is more difficult. An in- 
stinctive pugnacity in a boy can be readily diverted from 
quarrelsomeness and fighting to boxing, to games and 
mastery in them, to studies and beating others there, even 
to setting the teeth and fighting a hard problem in mathe- 
matics or Latin translation. The transitions are not un- 
natural. It is not so easy to know what to do with the 
sex instinct. There is reason to think any kind of work, 
physical or mental, games or studies, will carry off some 
of the energy. Giving such knowledge (through the 
botanical approach) as makes sex seem natural, and giving 
reasonable opportunities for meeting children of the other 
sex even if co-education is not possible, are helpful. Actual 
sublimation of the sex instinct is believed by many to 
take place in the provinces of music and art, poetry and 
the zsthetic side of education generally, and in religious 
contemplation and practices. Indeed, with adolescent 
girls, this last can become almost a perversion. With girls, 
the connection of the sex instincts with maternal sentiments 
allows of a natural outlet by mothering, playing at house- 
160
-P-A-G-E-159
  REPRESSION AND SUBLIMATION 
making, and caring for any tender and fragile things such 
as chicks or porcelain or embroidery. 
According to Freud, the sex instinct is strong even in 
infancy, and directed towards the parents, especially the 
parent of opposite sex. Not, of course, the animal sex 
instinct of puberty, but its emotional core, together with 
pleasure in bodily contact, kissing and endearment. The 
development of the individual is for Freud largely the 
history of how this attachment is directed later to others 
and ultimately to the sweetheart and mate. Failure to 
break away from the parental attachment causes, accord- 
ing to this view, much weakness of character. In the 
process of transference of the affections from parent to 
mate, the teacher, during childhood, undoubtedly plays 
a part. Attachment of children for teachers can easily 
become unhealthily emotional, especially in girls’ schools, 
where a kind of worship of a favourite teacher often clearly 
draws its strength from the growth of emotions as yet 
undirected towards the opposite sex. 
It is the belief of Freud and his followers that dreams 
are the expressions of repressed complexes striving to win 
a way to consciousness, and that they are the guardians 
of sleep, by giving a certain partial satisfaction and outlet 
to forces which would otherwise cause an awakening. 
Freud personifies the repressing force (due to other instincts, 
or other manifestations of the same instinct) and calls it 
the Censor. This Censor is less vigilant in sleep, yet not 
entirely careless of what passes into the dream consoious- 
ness; and so the forbidden wishes disguise themselves in 
symbolic figures (several wishes often compressing them- 
selves into one symbol), which disguised actors form the 
manifest content of the dream, very different in apparent 
significance from the latent content, which would appal the 
Censor and can only be discovered by the special methods 
of psychoanalysis. 
In one of his early writings (in Année psychologique) 
161 L
-P-A-G-E-160
INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
C. G. Jung, in part a disciple and in part an opponent of 
Freud, gives an example of the workings of a repressed 
complex in the unconscious background behind the mere 
fagade of consciousness, not drawn from a dream but from 
a chance sung song, apparently chosen at random and 
without cause—the song sung by Margaret in Faust: 
Es war ein K6nig in Thule 
Getreu bis an das Grab. 
There was once a king in Thule who was faithful to his 
true love until death. For as she lay dying she had given 
him a golden beaker, which he had ever used: and now 
that his own end was approaching, while he shared among 
his heirs all that was his of lands and wealth, he 
took the beaker and repaired to a high pinnacle by 
the sea, overlooking a whirlpool. And there, having drunk 
a last draught from it, he cast it into the gulf, where it too 
drank and sank into the waters as the king sank back 
to die. 
In the Freudian theory no mental event is random and 
without cause, not even the accident of which song a girl 
sings as she spins. Margaret, though she would deny it 
and does, indeed, repress it, is beginning to doubt, below 
the surface of her conscious thoughts, the fidelity of Faust. 
The wish that he might prove faithful to her till death 
cannot find straightforward expression, since that would 
imply a painful recognition of her doubts. But it actively 
presses upward, and passes the Censor successfully in what 
is only a thin disguise; the king in the song being an 
obvious substitute for Faust, and the “true love” for 
Margaret herself. 
When mental distress and conflict, various bodily tics 
1 Freud was, of course, not the first to say this. More than a century 
before him Hume, in the Inquiry, wrote: ‘Even in our wildest and 
most wandering reveries, nay, in our very dreams, we shall find, if we 
reflect, that the imagination ran not altogether at adventures.” But 
Freud followed up the clue, 
162 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
  REPRESSION AND SUBLIMATION 
and jerks, or mental phobias, are caused by a repression, 
it has been found that cure follows if the patient can be 
assisted to bring the repressed complex into consciousness. 
It is doing harm, because, though kept out of the intel- 
lectual chamber of consciousness where common sense 
would dispose of it, it is in emotional strength undiminished, 
and to hold this force down is using up energy. The chief 
point in outflanking the ‘Censor seems to be to get the patient 
to practise allowing his mind to follow associations in the 
freest possible fashion, reporting them to the psychoanalyst : 
and in order to get starting-points, dreams are used, each 
item being made the commencement of such trains of free 
associations. Or in another method, words are said one 
by one to the patient, who responds with his first associated 
word, as “ white,” “snow.” When these words touch on 
complexes, a longer time elapses before the reply comes, 
or the word is misheard, or an exceedingly far-fetched 
association is made, or a previous one repeated, etc. In 
such a way the analyst gets on the track of the trouble 
and drags it to daylight. Each little forgetfulness of 
every day, each slip of speech, is similarly asserted to be 
due to unconscious forces. We forget what is painful ; 
we say by a slip of the tongue what deep in our unconscious 
we really think, as when a hostess exclaims “Can’t you 
go—must you stay?” Repressed incidents drag down 
into unconsciousness with them, things which have only 
slight superficial associations with them, even a punning 
resemblance being sufficient—as when Freud forgets the 
name of a character and miscalls him Jocelyn, because his 
true name Joyeux would suggest his own name Freud 
and would be painful in the circumstances in question 
(Joyeux being approximately a French equivalent of Freud), 
Perhaps only someone who is engaged in treating mental 
patients, and knows from experience how helpful as 
windows to the back of the mind such apparent trifles can 
be, is competent to judge this hypothesis. Most of us can 
168
-P-A-G-E-162
INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
find occurrences in our own lives which seem to fit in with 
Freud’s theories, though remaining doubtful whether they 
are coincidences such as can be brought in support of any 
theory, or relevant instances. 
For example, the reader may remember that on page 91 
I was unable to recall the name of an author. At the 
time when this actually happened, it struck me that the 
forgetfulness might be an illustration of Freud’s theory, 
and I wrote down what came into my mind while trying, 
in vain, to recall the name. My notes with altered names, 
and one or two consequent alterations in the text, are as 
follows : 
The first name that occurs to me is Boyes. I have a feeling 
that this is wrong, but I believe the name is a monosyllable. I 
cannot write quickly enough to put down the many associations 
that occur. The Argentine I think of. Did not the man I mean 
go out to an important post there? No; was not that the author 
of another book ... which I used at about the same time ? 
Cross! I believe that is the name—but I am not sure. (Boyes, 
of course, is the name of the chief assistant of my solicitor from 
whom I had a letter last week, but that seems irrelevant.) The 
book was slim and yellowish in colour. I believe the name was 
Cross. Cross and Blackwell make jam. Boyes seems to keep 
coming back to me. I feel very confident that the name was Cross. 
Why can’t I remember the initials ? I feel that I would recognize 
the name better could I get the initials—T. K. Cross is it ? No. 
Perhaps that came from T. K. R., my old college chum’s initials. 
I must leave it at Cross—or Craggs—no, not Craggs. Cross surely. 
I feel uncertain. 
Six weeks after the above was written down, I chanced 
to see, in the New York Times, the name Craster, and 
realized at once that it was the name I was trying to recall. 
I again set down just what came into my mind—paper 
and pencil were at my elbow : 
Craster at once makes me think of a girl of that name who in 
1914 was engaged to someone who was the first of my friends to be 
killed in the war in September 1914. It seems possible that I 
have repressed the name because of this painful association. I 
164
-P-A-G-E-163
  REPRESSION AND SUBLIMATION 
remember the scene when I heard the news of his death, with that 
of his chum and fellow-student killed on the same day. I was 
visiting a school and a teacher and fellow-student of theirs (whose 
name also at this moment refuses to return—it was P. W.—I have 
just got it) showed me a newspaper. He too was killed nine months 
later. I do not know why Boyes comes in, unless because of the 
girl’s nickname. ... TT. K. R. was a fellow-officer for a while with 
P. W., in the same battalion, and with his career another painful 
memory is connected. Physically he rather resembles the man 
who was killed in 1914, who was called Blackwood. Is that why 
I thought of Cross and Blackwell? His chum also, who was killed 
on the same day, was called Blaylock, a name beginning with the 
same three letters. 
It has been difficult to alter the names without changing 
the associations, but 1 have succeeded fairly well, I think, 
in making them much the same, except that I cannot fit 
in a fictitious nickname which will suggest Boyes as the 
original did the corresponding real name. 
Now the Freudian theory of this would be, I imagine, 
that I repressed once upon a time, because of the pain 
which his death caused me, not only the name of my friend 
Blackwood, but also names of people who might remind 
me of him, such as Miss Craster or P. W. And when I 
wanted Craster, the author, the repression still worked and 
I could not remember the name. But in its endeavour to 
escape, the energy of the name Craster, forbidden to come 
to light in that form, disguised itself as Cross, and Craggs, 
or brought up the first syllable of the name Blackwood in 
Cross and Blackwell. 
I should add that later again I remembered that Craster 
had been a tutor at Cross Street College when he wrote the 
book (the names of Cross in “ Cross Street College” and 
Cross in “Cross and Blackwell’s” are not identical in 
spelling in the real names, but similar in sound). 
Wit and humour, too, are in Freud’s opinion in part 
operations of the unconscious mind, as might be antici- 
1 This bringing up of pieces of names is not unlike Freud’s case of 
ue deus Signorelli Botticelli and Boltrafia (Psychopathologie des Alltags-

pated from the frequent verbal superficial associations occur- 
ring in his analyses. To one reading his writings it seems 
almost as though the differences between individuals in 
respect to freedom of imagination, exuberance of fancy, 
originality of ideas, was not so much due to lack of ability 
to make these connections as to the action of a Censor in 
refusing them admission to the stage of consciousness. 
They are freely made in the unconscious, and if they escape 
are ingenious or witty or mad; but mostly they are 
repressed as incongruous. Wit is just such an incongruity 
with a thread of connection, made in the unconscious but 
seized on by consciousness. And if this is so there should 
surely be wit in dreams, as there is certainly madness and 
poetry. Personally, I know that I often dream puns and 
jokes. Six months ago, westbound on the Atlantic, and a 
trifle worried as to what to do with a medicinally minute 
flask of whisky in my luggage, I dreamt I was making a 
public speech in which I referred, with great effect, to the 
United States as “that land of liberty without licence.” 
And in New York, having noted with amusement that 
each and every taxicab showed a notice “ lowest rate,” 
I dreamt I saw a man affixing a detachable S before the 
former of these two words. 
“Variation,” says Thorndike in a notable phrase, “is 
the first requisite for progress in the behaviour of an 
individual, as it is in the development of the race.” The 
suggestion here made is that this variation, from which 
the environment by the satisfactions and pains of social 
taboos selects the adult surviving ideas and habits of 
thought, is perhaps sometimes too rigidly pruned and 
weeded out by this Censor of consciousness: that educa- 
tion by taming the wilderness may be turning it not into 
a garden of delightful surprises but a desert of artificial 
funeral wreaths, marking the graves of associations which 
might have been the germs of invention in science or art 
or poetry. We harden as we grow older. The Censor has 
166 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
  
REPRESSION AND SUBLIMATION 
more power. And education should not unduly hasten 
the process. . 
In another chapter, and indeed in many books on psy- 
chology, our brains and nervous systems have been likened 
to telephone systems. Now the essence of a telephone 
system is certainty and speed. If I call up Cathedral 3742 
I want my friend Smith, and am annoyed with the operator 
if I don’t get him every time. But a mind which made 
such reliable and predictable connections every time would 
be a dull and stodgy affair. The analogy breaks down. 
Business demands the certainty in the telephone system, 
but it would be ever so much more interesting if, when 
I called up Cathedral 3742, I might get Lloyd George or 
Babe Ruth or Howard Carter or Joan of Arc or a fishwife 
at Cullercoats. Business demands certainty in the mind’s 
responses, and as we grow older it gets it, but at a penalty, 
the loss of interest and creative force. It is disconcerting 
in matters of routine if our mind calls up Joan if the situa- 
tion requires Smith, and we reprove it if it does. But if 
we train it too well we find it cannot make any suggestions 
(except Smith) when the situation is a bit new and strange. 
Thus the Censor, who is mainly awake to the opinions of 
the particular herd to which we belong, creates sentiments 
and prejudices in accord with the fashionable ideas of that 
herd by refusing admission to consciousness of others. 
And as selection among the individuals of one generation 
influences the composition of the next generation because 
these selected individuals become its parents, so selection 
among the ideas and ideals of childhood influences the 
adult mind, for these ideas which come to the stage of 
consciousness intermarry with one another, form alliances 
and families, and their offspring are the stock in trade of 
the grown man, while the repressed ideas languish in 
sterile imprisonment. 
Sometimes the fact of belonging to two herds creates

tells us of cases of actual multiple personality, like Sally 
Beauchamp, or Doris E, where the segregation of conscious 
ideas may be so complete that the two or more personalities 
may not have common memories, as Real Doris did not 
know anything of the life of Sick Doris or Margaret or 
Sleeping Margaret who were her co-dwellers in the one 
body. And cases, not of actual multiple personality, but 
of very different systems of sentiments, may occur and 
probably do so more frequently than we imagine even 
among children. The schoolboy who has quite different 
codes of honour in his relationship with comrades or teacher, 
is not unlike the business man who is a good father and 
respectable churchwarden but is capable of very sharp 
practice at the office. On sex matters very many school 
children have two ways of thinking, and differ very much 
when they are among other children or with grown-ups. 
Their attitude in the latter case may vary between com- 
plete repression and giggling innuendo. And in many 
other ways school and home life may force children to live 
double lives. 
Now it would seem that the lesson to be learned from 
all this, by teachers, is the desirability of avoiding barriers 
in the life of childhood, and of taming instincts by employing 
them, not by either ignoring or combating them. Barriers 
grow up when discipline is inflicted from without instead 
of growing from within; when teachers are too aloof and 
when they shirk discussion ; when unnatural separation of 
sexes occurs (a certain amount of separation at some ages 
may be natural); when teachers demand standards of 
behaviour beyond the power of childhood. 
* * * * 
And above all, inner conflict is certain when we do not 
early form the habit of appealing always to the intellect 
and to reason. Reasons do not sway mobs. Reasons, 
says Nietzsche, make the populace suspicious. But we must 
168
-P-A-G-E-167
    
REPRESSION AND SUBLIMATION 
work for a day when reason is mightier than now, and aid 
it in holding sway in ourselves first, then in our pupils and 
—who knows ?—perhaps some day in the world. Wherein 
the danger is that reason may fall of its own presumption, 
for it must learn humility, not pride, and must rationally 
prove, and reasonably accept the proof, that some matters 
are insoluble. It must consider and envisage matters of 
the spirit as well as of the material world. But in all it 
must demand honesty and a ruthless laying bare of the 
motives which may be active in any behaviour undertaken. 
In school, then, open-mindedness, the sinking of personal 
motives (which is achieved by many schools) and equally 
the sinking of party or sectarian or even patriotic motives 
(which is achieved by few) is the ideal; free forms of 
discipline, free debate, freedom of speech, toleration of all 
things (including even a certain toleration of others’ in- 
tolerance), the use of emulation only to sublimate it as 
esprit de corps, and the use of esprit de corps only to make 
' it sublime as a feeling of the oneness of humanity. And 
in particular the teacher should be ever on guard against 
insidious rationalizations, against reasons for certain 
_ behaviour which are really trumped up after the behaviour 
has been actuated by quite other motives, as when we 
punish a child to reform him or to deter others, but really 
because we are angry and our self-esteem is hurt.

  CL CHAPTER XVII 
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN INTELLECT 
One of the great changes which have come over educational 
psychology in the last twenty years is that produced by 
the realization of the tremendous differences which exist 
between individuals, and of the continuity which yet reigns 
from one end of the scale to the other. We shall leave to 
another chapter the question whether these differences are 
produced by environment and education or are mainly 
inborn and unchangeable, merely saying here that the 
present state of our knowledge supports a belief that inborn 
differences form a very considerable part of the whole. 
If a large number of men is assembled and ranked for 
any quality—such as height, in the familiar army prepara- 
tion for ceremonial drill, ‘‘ Tallest on the right, shortest on 
the left; size’””—then provided the men are numerous, are 
all of one race, and are quite unselected, these two facts of 
wide range and continuity over the range will show them- 
selves. 
Of course, if different races are involved, there may well 
be discontinuity. If some of the men are negroes from 
Africa, and some are Norwegians, they will fall into two 
distinct groups for skin colour. And Japanese and Nor- 
wegians would fall into two nearly distinct groups for size. 
But if they are all of one race, then for most qualities there 
will be continuity. 
Again, of course, if they are few in number, there may 
be discontinuity. If they are sizing for height, there may 
be a very tall man who is much taller than the next in the 
170
-P-A-G-E-169
  INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN INTELLECT 
row. But if their numbers are increased, more and more 
will step into the gap, and it will ultimately be filled up by 
men differing only slightly in height. 
And thirdly, if they have been selected consciously or 
unconsciously according to some criterion, then their 
ranking according to that or any associated criterion may 
show discontinuity. For example, if they were a mixed 
lot of Guardsmen and Artillery drivers, they would pro- 
bably fall into distinct size-groups. Here the selection is 
conscious and is set forth on recruiting posters. But it 
might not in every case be so obvious. 
And lastly, it cannot be denied that in some cases actual 
discontinuity is found, or what is practically discontinuity. 
There is a continuous range from ipo to brunette, but 
the red-headed stand apart. 
The point of all this is that similar laws have been found 
to hold for mental qualities, for temperament, good taste, 
etc., and particularly for intelligence. There is always a 
danger that the use of class names, such as defective, normal, 
clever, genius, etc., may lead to the belief that these classes 
are quite or almost distinct. Thus children were once 
rather looked upon as falling into a large group of normal 
children, all very much alike, and two smaller groups, of 
defectives at one end and, at the other, of geniuses, clearly 
marked off from the normal. 
Now this is not so, as experiment and statistical obser- 
vation have clearly shown. If men or children are ranked 
for intelligence they form as unbroken a series of steps 
from one end of the line to the other as they do in the case 
of height. There is not a class of defectives at one end 
and of geniuses at the other at all clearly marked off and 
separated sharply from the others. There is continuity, ~ 
there are no gaps which cannot be filled in if we increase 
our numbers. But there is a difference in the size of the 
steps between individuals, a law governing the continuity, 
which can be best shown by the following considerations. 
171   
 
-P-A-G-E-170
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
Let us return to our men who are falling in in order of 
height, tallest on the right. Let us suppose that we cause 
men who are identical in height to stand behind one another, 
so that the front rank is composed of men distinguishable 
in height from another, while behind each front-rank man 
stand in file those identical with him. Then what we would 
find would be that near the middle of the row the files 
would extend far to the rear, while near the ends of the row 
the files would be short, at the very end being some who 
have no one behind them. To make the picture more 
vivid still, suppose that the men of each file proceed to stand 
one above the other on their front-rank man’s shoulders, 
as gymnasts do at displays. Then the end men would 
have to support none or few, while in the centre of the 
front rank the human ladder would tower to the roof, like 
this : 
  The curve thus visualized is the famous Normal Curve 
of Probability, associated with the names of Gauss and 
Laplace, and the thesis of this chapter so far may be said 
to be that mental qualities also are distributed according 
to the normal curve, or according to one of the allied skew 
curves presently to be described. 
172
-P-A-G-E-171
  INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN INTELLECT 
If, for example, the arrangement of the above diagram 
had been for intelligence instead of size, the curve formed 
by the line of hats—only the topmost man in each column 
is wearing a hat—would be of similar shape. In recent 
years what are known as intelligence tests have been 
developed, by which a measure of intelligence called the 
intelligence quotient is obtained, of which it only need be 
said here that it is high for high intelligence and low for 
low intelligence, and centres round 100. Thus 140 is very 
clever and 60 is very unintelligent indeed. When the 
intelligence quotients of a large number of unselected 
children are examined they are found to fall into a curve 
just like the above. Here are 2,710 Northumberland 
children tested in 1921.

It is in steps only because, for convenience, we have lumped 
together all the cases into groups of ten points—really the 
smooth curve drawn through the rectangles should be 
imagined. 
The chief educational problems which an appreciation 
of the range and continuity of mental differences emphasizes 
are those connected with classification, with special classes 
for the defective, with rapid promotion for the child of 
superior intellect, with lack of homogeneity in classes, with 
marking examination papers and with borderline cases. 
One or two considerations bearing on some of these problems 
can be deduced from facts of which the above is a solitary 
but typical example. 
In the first place, it is clearly a difficult task to separate 
children, distributed as above, into the sheep and the goats. 
There is not any chasm separating them. In picking 
children who are unable to gain anything from an ordinary 
school, and who ought to be cared for in a special school, 
there is no question “is, or is not, this child defective ? ” 
There is only the question where to draw the line in a 
continuously changing variable called intelligence. If one 
community has one per cent. of its children in such special 
schools, and another community two per cent., that merely 
means, as a rule, that the line in question is differently 
drawn by the two authorities. And it is also clear that in 
drawing such a line the deciding authority will necessarily 
be troubled by many borderline cases, and will in all 
honesty make decisions which another would reverse. 
It is also clear that drawing a dividing line is more 
difficult in or near the middle of the distribution than near 
the end, for near the middle the individuals are closer 
together. In the above diagram, for example, all the 
children represented by the tallest rectangle, 644 in number, 
have to crowd on a frontage from intelligence quotient 90 
to intelligence quotient 100; whereas from 130 to 140 
there are only 65 children, who therefore have ten times 
174
-P-A-G-E-173
  
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN INTELLECT 
as much elbow-room. Not only is there plenty of room at 
the top but the individual differences are greater. It is 
easier to pick the first and second of a race than to find 
the middle man. A long steeplechase tails out the fasts 
and the slows, but leaves a bunch in between of medium 
runners. 
This has a moral for examiners. The most difficult task 
that can be set an examiner is to divide his examinees into 
passes and failures in approximately equal numbers without 
injustice. It is much easier for him to pick the best, or 
the worst, ten or twenty per cent. But the ease with which 
he can do these latter tasks, and the efficacy of his 
examining, depend upon the particular form of distribution, 
which his examination marks give to the candidates. To 
elucidate this point let us digress to consider another form 
of distribution, say according to income instead of according 
to height. 
When we imagined our men falling in in order of height, 
and then men of identical height climbing on one another’s 
shoulders to make the gymnastic pyramid pictured a page 
or two ago, we obtained a symmetrical figure. If we 
imagine that the lower men in that figure were standing 
on a long beam, the beam would balance about the middle 
point—or rather it would if the men were all the same 
weight or were made the same by carrying appropriate 
weights as jockeys do. The figure is symmetrical, is 
balanced. 
But suppose that instead of falling in in order of height 
the men fell in in order of incomes, and men of identical 
incomes stodd on each other’s shoulders. They would 
make a figure like the one shown on page 176. 
Such a distribution is called, in statistics, a skew dis- 
tribution. If these men were standing on a plank, its 
point of balance (indicated by the arrow in the figure) 
would not divide the men into two equal groups. More 
men are below the point of balance than above. The 
175 ae 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
fewer above make up by having some of their number 
farther away, exerting a more considerable leverage. 
The point of balance of which we have been speaking is 
what we commonly know as the average or mean. The 
median man, on the other hand, is the man who has half 
the crowd to right and half to left of him. In asymmetrical 
distribution like our first picture he is also the average man. 
But in our asymmetrical second picture he stands to one 
  side of the average,1 and the distance between him and 
the average is the greater, the greater the skewness of the 
distribution. For some purposes the median is a better 
measure than the average. If each man on a jury, for 
example, agreed to write down the damages he considered 
proper in the case, then the median would be better than 
the average. For the average could be made inordinately 
big by any vindictive juryman who cared to write down 
1 The median man is blackened in each figure.
-P-A-G-E-175
  INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN INTELLECT 
an absurdly high figure, a proceeding without effect on the 
median.1 (In passing, since it may occur to some reader 
that there is no median in a jury of twelve, it may be taken 
as the point half-way between the two middle values.) 
Now the extent to which an examiner’s marks show a 
distribution which is smooth, and skew just to the extent 
which his particular task requires, is an important matter, 
and should be borne in mind whenever the number of 
candidates is large enough to justify statistical treatment 
—certainly for 300 candidates, and even, with reservations, 
for only 50. 
For example, suppose an examiner finds that his marks 
(on a percentage scale, say) do not give a curve like either 
of the above, but show two well-marked peaks, then he is 
justified in taking thought whether this is due to a real 
splitting of his candidates into two classes, or to some un- 
conscious idiosyncrasy of hisown. If the nambers are large 
it is almost certainly the latter. For instance, if his marks - 
scale were divided into five classes and they ran like this : 
Number of Cases = 810. 
  
Lowest Next Median Next Highest 
Class. Lowest. Class, Highest. Class. 
17 367 24 239 103 
  
this would be a very bad distribution, almost certainly an 
unjust distribution. Whereas the following (which was the 
actual distribution in an examination in English) is more 
likely to be just and fair : 
Number of Cases = 810. 
  
Lowest Next Median Next Highest 
Class. Lowest. Class. Highest. Class.

If the purpose of the examination is to select a smaller- 
than-half group of the cleverer students, then the examiner 
would be justified in making the questions difficult and 
producing a skew distribution, with the poorer candidates 
jammed together among the low marks, but the better 
candidates well spread. Such is the case in the following 
examination which was to select children for scholarships :

Numbers ea 1,137 581 199 49 1 
If, on the other hand, the purpose were to select a small 
group of the least able, the examination should be easy, 
and the statistics skewed the other way, with a well-spread 
tail towards the low end. 
If for any purpose it is desirable to divide a group up 
into subgroups of approximately equal size, say three 
subgroups, a best, a median, and a worst, then it is clear 
from the above curves and tables that the median group 
will be much more homogeneous than either of the extreme 
groups. Even if we make the median group a good deal 
larger it will still be a more homogeneous group. As an 
example take the 2,710 children whose intelligence quotients 
are given on page 173. Let us make the two divisions at 
90 and 110. Then the numbers are: 
Lowest group 805, rangingfrom 90 to below 60, range over 30 
Median group 1,240 99 91 to 110, range 20 
Highest group 665 a 111 to over 140, range over 301

If these had been a class of 100 children of much the same 
present level who needed classifying into a slow-moving, 
a median, and a fast-moving division in a school, it is clear 
that the median division ought to receive larger numbers, 
say: 
Lowest ae as «+ 25 children

if comparatively equally homogeneous groups were to be 
at all approximated to. 
It is the facts of great individual differences, and the 
difficulties of classification resulting therefrom, which have 
led many to object strongly to the “lock-step”’ of our 
usual school curriculum which keeps every member of the 
class going ahead at the selfsame rate. Even freedom of 
promotion cannot keep pace with the range and continuity 
of differences which we now know to exist, which is one 
of the factors which have caused the introduction of indi- 
vidual methods such as the Dalton! Plan, in which each 
student goes his own gait. He has to cover a minimum 
assignment of work in the month, but he is freed from 
having to sit and watch a teacher teaching at the rate of 
the slowest in the class, and can investigate the meadows 
on either side of the main route, with advice from teachers 
and possibly actual assignments of ‘‘ maximum ” work in 
addition to the “ minimum ”’ assignments. 
So called after the town of Dalton, U.S.A., though I like to let it 
remind me of Dalton who first urged the atomic theory in chemistry, 
for this Dalton Plan proposes to treat children as separate entities, and 
not in masses.

Ab CHAPTER XVIII 
INTELLIGENCE TESTS 
INTELLIGENCE tests in their modern form are due mainly 
to the pioneer work of Binet in Paris, who with his colleague, 
Simon, published in 1905 the first scale of tests. Twelve 
years later intelligence testing received its second great 
impetus from the work of the psychologists who examined 
with standardized group tests some two million soldiers of 
the American Army. 
Binet’s problem was to find a working method of deciding 
which children in Paris schools should be taken~out of the 
ordinary classes and placed in special classes for defectives. 
And intelligence testing in its earlier years was mainly 
aimed at the discovery of lack of intelligence. But it has 
long outgrown this one-sided development and there now 
exist tests which can tax the intellect of the cleverest 
children. 
Binet’s success in a problem where many had failed 
was chiefly due to three guiding principles, which, perhaps 
unconsciously, he seems to have taken as the clue to 
success. First, he took a medley of different kinds of 
tests, approaching intelligence from different aspects. 
Secondly, he made no theoretical assertions about the 
suitability or otherwise of a given test for this or that age. 
And thirdly, he employed the mental age scale. Let us 
consider these in turn. 
For a test, Binet chose any simple question the answer 
to which appeared to be mainly decided by the child’s 
intelligence, and not. by any special information which some 
180
-P-A-G-E-179
  INTELLIGENCE TESTS 
children might possess and others lack. For example, the 
child may be invited to copy a diamond, to execute a 
commission, to count backwards from 20 to 1, or to criticize 
an absurd statement. Some of these depend on knowledge. 
But the knowledge required is very simple, and such as 
cannot well be avoided by a child living in any community 
unless he is unintelligent. Picking up ordinary bits of 
knowledge from everyday life is, in fact, taken as one 
criterion of intelligence. By having a medley of questions 
he ensured that any advantage gained from recent experi- 
ence with one item would not make much difference in the 
whole score. Some might have a slight adventitious advan- 
tage in one test, others in another, but the average would 
not be much affected. There was no attempt, it would 
seem, to test separately any “faculties” of memory, or 
imagination, or reasoning, the intelligence was just taken 
as a whole without much worry as to what exactly intelli- 
gence means.! 
In the second place, the order of difficulty of the tests 
was decided by actual experiment with children, not by 
any psychologizing a priori. Take, for example, the Three 
Commissions Test. In this, the child is asked to put a 
bunch of keys on the table, then to bring the examiner 
a box which is pointed out, then to shut the door. “Now 
remember,” says the examiner, “first the keys, then the 
box, then the door.” ? 
Instead of indulging in guesses as to the age at which 
@ normal or average child would first carry this out without 
a mistake, the proper plan is to try it on large numbers 
1 Binet’s own words in describing his procedure are not always con- 
sistent. A discussion will be found in Professor Spearman’s book The 
Nature of Intelligence, Macmillan 1923, pp. 7 et seg. Binet seems to 
have tried various points of view, and ultimately to have settled down 
to tests which, as said in the text, are very diverse and unwarped by 
any attempt to measure separate faculties. Such is the practical result, 
whatever Binet’s theoretical views. 
* I once had the exhilarating experience of seeing a child correctly 
lap the keys on the table, bring me the box, and then shut the door, 
from the outside, after which she went off to her class ! 
181
-P-A-G-E-180

of children and find out. In doing so we must take care 
that we get a random selection of children, not all of one 
social class or in any other way specialized. In his 
researches on London children, Mr. Cyril Burt found for 
the above test the following figures : 
  Age group centred at .. 8t 4b 5k 64 
Per cent. passing. . 26-4 65:3 84-2 96-7 
Age group centredat .. 7 8} oo 10% 
Per cent. passing. . 98-4 99-2 99-6 100 
Notice here that at a point somewhere between 3} years 
and 44 years, half the children could perform this triple 
commission correctly, so that if a child of greater age could 
not do so, he would be below the average. Contrast the 
figures for another test, that of counting from 20 to 1 back- 
wards. In a similar form they read: 
Age group centred at .. 4t bt 6+ it 8t 
Per cent. passing..| 0-0 57 28 53-6 76 
  Age group centredat .. 94 10% | 11¢ 124 - 
  
Per cent. passing.. | 86-1 96 | 98-3 100 — 
From this it will be seen that there is a point somewhere 
in the 7th year, at which age one child out of two can do 
this test. If a child can carry out the task of counting 
182 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
  INTELLIGENCE TESTS 
from 20 to 1 before this age he is better than the average, 
in this single test. If he cannot do so till later, he is worse 
than the average. This age is the age at which the average 
child, or more strictly the median child, can carry out this 
particular task. A similar age can be found for each of 
the proposed tests, and they can be ranged in an order 
of difficulty, those being deemed more difficult for which 
a@ more mature age is necessary. And to each test can be 
assigned an age, at which 50 per cent. of children can 
pass it. 
In the third place, Binet adopted the mental age scale. 
This step follows on naturally from the preceding. Having 
first tested our tests on large numbers of children, we can 
then—but not till then—proceed to use the tests to test 
children. An individual child is plied with these questions 
under exactly the same conditions as those ruling in the 
work of standardizing. We find which he can pass and 
in which he fails, and thence are able to state that his 
performance is equal to that of the average child of x years. 
This is called his ‘‘ mental age.” If it exceeds his actual 
age, he is above average intelligence ; if it is less, he is 
below. 
We have in this brief statement glossed over one diffi- 
culty which early arose. When we test the child we do 
not, as a rule, find that he can answer all the easier ques- 
tions up to a certain point after which he can answer no 
more. On the contrary, what we find is that though he 
breaks down at a certain question, he can answer two or 
three of those ranked in our list as more difficult. This | 
is simply because children are not all alike in their talents, | 
and our order of difficulty of the tests is only correct on the’ 
average. Under these circumstances the modern practice _ 
is to give him credit for all the tests passed. In Terman’s 
revision of the Binet Scale there are six tests per year, 
1 There has been controversy about this percentage, which is cleared 
up by Cyril Burt on p. 140 of Mental and Scholastic Tests, London, 1921. 
1838
-P-A-G-E-182
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
and a child simply gets two more months of mental age 
for any test which he passes.1 
In the early days of testing, the result of the examination 
was usually expressed by the difference between the mental 
age and the chronological age. Thus a child was said to 
be “ two years advanced,” say, or ‘‘ fifteen months retarded.” 
But it was soon found that a given retardation was more 
serious in a young child than in an older child, and that 
it was rather the ratio of this to the chronological age 
which mattered. Hence the Intelligence Quotient, or I.Q., 
introduced by Professor Stern of Hamburg, came to be the 
recognized way of giving results. This I.Q. is the mental 
age expressed as a percentage of the actual age, so that 
if, for example, the child’s actual or chronological age is 
7 years 3 months, and his mental age is 8 years 2 months, 
then we have : 
Mental Age 
Chronological Age 
t) ni 8 years 2 months x 100 
7 years 3 months 
9,800 =—— = 113 87 Intelligence Quotient = x 100 
Clearly, from the manner of its formation, the average 
1.Q. is 100, which is the I.Q. of any child whose mental 
age is the same as his actual age. Quotients are mostly 
between 80 and 120; but about one child in twenty will 
be above 120, and about one in twenty or so below 80, 
while some run up to 140, or even 160, and more in rare 
cases. a 
There are difficulties in connection with this I.Q. method 
which become more acute with older children and with 
adults. They arise from the fact that the mental age as 
estimated by the usual tests does not go on increasing 
indefinitely, but slows off and comes to a standstill at some

for certain exceptions to this general rule.

age round about sixteen. This fact has led to much con- 
troversy, and must be discussed later. But the difficulty 
in connection with intelligence quotients to which it gives 
rise can be obviated by giving up the use of the I.Q. and 
substituting another measure, the Percentile Rank, instead. 
This is the rank which any individual would have among 
100 unselected individuals, the most intelligent of these 
being ranked 100, and the least intelligent 1, the average 
man being at number 50. Thus a percentile rank of 83°4 
means that the individual so designated is more intelligent 
than 83°4 per cent. of the whole population, but not so 
intelligent as the remaining 16°6 per cent. The word 
population here means those with whom we can reasonably 
compare him. In the case of a twelve-year-old English 
boy it would mean all English boys of his age, which in 
practice we might take to mean boys born in the same 
month of the same year, perhaps. For adults the ‘‘ popu- 
lation”’ is all adults of the same race. An I.Q. of 120 
corresponds approximately to a P.R. of 95, an I.Q. of 80 
toa P.R. of 5, an 1.Q. of 100 toa P.R. of 50. Each method 
has its advantages and its disadvantages. The I.Q. is best 
for children up to about fourteen, but thereafter the 
P.R. is better.+ 
The Binet Tests were individual, and took approximately 
an hour to give to each child. The desire for Group Tests 
which during an hour could be administered to a number 
of children simultaneously had often been expressed, and 
some progress had been made in their construction, when 
the demand was intensified suddenly by the decision of 
the American Army authorities, advised by a committee 
of psychologists, to submit all recruits to such tests in 
order to assist in selecting officers, to enable platoons to 
be equalized in average intelligence, to enable squad training 
to be done at different speeds by the more or the less

rating. E

intelligent, and to eliminate from the Army men unfit by 
reason of low intelligence. The result was the Army Alpha 
Test for the majority of recruits, and the Beta Test for 
the illiterate or foreign-speaking part of the draft. These 
were to some extent based on material already at hand 
and partially standardized by Otis, Pintner, and others. 
Full particulars of the Alpha Test can be obtained in the 
book by Yerkes and Yoakum.1 Following the war, this 
test, and many others largely inspired by it, as well as 
some more original, were applied to children in secondary 
schools; and presently forms suitable for elementary 
schools, and even group tests for infants, began to appear. 
A very complete list of Group Tests on the American 
market up to 1923, will be found in Pintner’s Intelligence 
Testing ;* and Ballard’s Group Tests gives particulars of 
most of the English forms. 
Certain general principles show themselves in a study of 
tests; and instead of giving random specimens of the 
questions asked, it may be more desirable to adduce them 
in illustration. As has already been said, one class of 
tests measures intelligence by asking questions the answers 
to which are, it is assumed, sure to have been “ picked 
up” unless there is lack of intelligence. Such tests do 
actually show a high correlation with other criteria, such 
as the judgment of experienced teachers who have known 
the children for a considerable time. In the Binet Tests 
such a question as “Is it morning or afternoon ?” is of 
this nature. In group tests these information questions 
may take a form such as “ Pearls are found in mines, 
oysters, palms, wells,” the candidate having previously 
been instructed to underline the correct word. It is diffi- 
cult to avoid the fear that such tests may be unduly influ- 
enced by instruction, and lend themselves to coaching, 
which would defeat the object of the tester and would waste 
the testee’s time on a particularly bad kind of education.

  INTELLIGENCE TESTS 
Another group of tests largely identifies intelligence with 
the possession and right use of vocabulary. The Terman 
revision of the Binet test has a list of words with which to 
make a direct trial of vocabulary. Such a Binet test as 
that asking the child to say as many words as possible in 
three minutes is certainly connected with vocabulary. 
The “ opposites ” test asks for the opposite of words and 
can be easy (as the opposite of black, or last, or near) or 
very difficult (as the opposite of stringent, or disdain, or 
despite). It is particularly in the hard examples that it 
tests richness and nicety of vocabulary more obviously 
than intelligence. But experiment finds these two closely 
correlated, though on the other hand it would seem that 
country children, for example, might be sadly handicapped 
and yet be quite intelligent. 
This “opposites” test, however, does not merely test 
for the possession of a piece of acquired knowledge, as 
the information tests do. It calls for the employment of 
intelligence at the time, for usually the subject has not 
previously considered what word stands in the “‘ opposite ” 
relationship to disdain (say), even if he should possess the 
required word and be accustomed to use it correctly. This 
requirement of the exercise of intelligence at the moment 
of taking the test (and not merely previously in acquiring 
the information or the vocabulary) is also an obvious 
feature in the “analogies ” test first developed by Wood- 
worth and by Burt, and in the completion or missing word 
test of Ebbinghaus. Both of these call, in addition to 
vocabulary, for an appreciation of relationships. The 
former asks for the missing term in such a pair of relation- 
ships as 
fin : fish :: wing: ? 
reminding one of the epigram, “ Pitt is to Addington as 
London is to Paddington”; while the latter asks for the 
missing words in a paragraph or sentence, as “To 
187 
   
-P-A-G-E-186
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
friends is always ..... hes... tee it takes,” one of 
the Trabue test sentences. Finally (passing over numerous 
other forms of test) we come to those which employ the 
traditional forms of induction and deduction more 
obviously. The recognition of a general class is required 
by a test composed of elements such as this: “In this 
line of five words cross out the word which does not belong 
there : 
chair, table, sofa, jacket, stool. 
And similarly in this, in which the candidate has to find 
what the first three words have in common, and underline 
that one of the remaining words which best goes with them : 
Sparrow, eagle, robin (nest, hen, fly, air)! (from I.E.R. tests). 
Still more obviously in the class of logical forms are ques- 
tions giving a syllogism and asking if the conclusion is 
true, or false, or undetermined, as : 
All of the houses on First Street were burned. 
Mr. Smith’s house was on Second Street. 
Conclusion : Mr. Smith’s house was not burned.? 
More complicated forms of syllogistic reasoning occur in 
Mr. Burt’s Reasoning Tests, as : 
Where the climate is hot, aloes and rubber will grow: heather 
and grass will only grow where it is cold. Heather and rubber 
require plenty of moisture: grass and aloes will grow only in fairly 
dry regions. Near the river Amazon it is very hot and very damp. 
Which of the above grows there ? 
A test simulating John Stuart Mill’s logical methods of 
Agreement and Difference is the writer’s “ Hindustani ” 
Test, which was one of those forming the first Northum- 
berland Mental Tests. Its nature will be best understood 
2 Both of these can be given with drawings instead of words, to obviate language difficulties: while geometrical figures can also be used. From 
the above easy examples there is a continuous scale of difficulty up to 
really hard examples.

from the following explanatory introduction given in the 
Northumberland booklet.! 
The sentences below are in a foreign language, and their meanings 
are given in English. In each English sentence a word is under- 
lined, and you have to underline the word which corresponds to 
it in the foreign sentence. You can do this by comparing the 
sentences with each other. For example, look at these: 
1. Kuchh Malai = Some cream. 
2. Kuchh Puri Leoge = Will you take some cake ? 
3. Misri Leoge = Will you take sugar ? 
By comparing 1 and 2 you see that kuchh must mean some 
because it occurs in both sentences. By comparing 2 and 3 you 
see that leoge means will you take. Then the only word you do 
not know in 2 is purt which must mean cake. Notice that the 
foreign words are not always in the same order as the Englisa 
words, 
The reader would perhaps like to try a harder example 
of the same kind of thing; and if so he will find it in the 
following test, part of one designed to be given to college 
undergraduates : 
Crusoe Test Instructions. 
The following sentences are written in the language of Man 
Friday, and a translation is given of each. The English words are 
not usually in the same order as the words in the cannibal tongue, 
but by comparing sentences carefully you can tell which word 
means which. By this means you can translate the paragraph 
which comes at the end. Do so, guessing any words which occur 
in the paragraph and not in the sentences.

The main uses to which intelligence tests have been put 
are to select children for special instruction in schools for 
the defective, to assist in selecting children for admission 
to High Schools and Secondary Schools, and to grade 
classes into groups capable of undertaking various types 
of curricula. In schools in which the latter plan is followed, 
a threefold “multiple track” is a common arrangement. 
There are three tracks through the school, one suited for 
children of high I.Q., one for the median group, one for 
those of low I.Q. In the intelligent group, there are two 
alternatives open, one being to go ahead at the rapid pace 
of which these children are quite capable, and finish the 
190
-P-A-G-E-189
  INTELLIGENCE TESTS 
school curriculum at an earlier age, thus enabling the 
children to enter High School or College one or two or 
even three years earlier than usual. As this may lead to 
plunging them into the companionship of more mature 
pupils too suddenly, others prefer to have, for this group, 
not an accelerated but an enriched programme, so that 
while traversing the same main route as the normal group, 
and at the same rate, they find time to deviate into numerous 
interesting byways of study. 
In such classes or groups of bright pupils different methods 
of teaching are found possible and desirable, for with the 
cleverer children much more abstract statements of funda- 
mental principles can be given, projects can be planned 
which involve their application, and independent attempts 
at solution can be anticipated on the part of the children. 
This is, in short, the Heuristic method so forcibly urged 
years ago by Professor Henry E. Armstrong ; and the most 
delightful account of it is in his little book in which he 
describes the researches which were carried out by a group 
of children whose curiosity was provoked by the story of 
the monkey which refused to be drowned. Although the 
stone tied round its neck was too heavy for it to lift on 
land, yet at the bottom of the lake it picked the stone 
up and walked ashore. With the less intelligent children, 
on the other hand, the matter to be learned has to be 
broken into smaller units, and these have to be practised 
separately. Much more drill work is required. For the 
least intelligent of all a curriculum largely composed of 
handwork is appropriate. 
Intelligence Tests have also been used in lieu of College 
Entrance Examinations. Columbia College, cf Columbia 
University in New York, has for some years employed 
the Thorndike Test for this purpose, and has a considerable

body of data as to the success of the new plan. Reporting 
on it, Dean Hawkes says : + 
Just what it measures, I do not know. Whether it is intelli- 
gence or not it is hard to say until one defines exactly what one 
means by intelligence. But I do know that it indicates more 
definitely and accurately than anything we are familiar with 
whether the boy will succeed in Columbia College. 
And again : 
Since the introduction of the Thorndike Test the percentage of 
men who are forced out on account of poor scholarship has been 
cut in half, although our scholarship requirements have been lifted 
during this interval.

CHAPTER XIX 
ACHIEVEMENT TESTS 
Tux natural corollary to the intelligence test is the achieve- 
ment test, a test of what has been achieved in the various 
school subjects. Binet himself, in his pioneer work, had a 
scale of school performance as well as a scale of intelligence. 
Clearly, we cannot separate achievement from intelli- 
gence; even if we may approximate to separating intelligence 
from achievement. An achievement test must measure 
the result of intelligence plus application. If opportunity 
and application have been equal, it will place the candi- 
dates in order of intelligence. If opportunity and intelli- 
gence are equal, it will place them in order of application, 
of hard work. 
Such tests of schooling are, of course, nothing but the 
old examinations, but with a difference. The points of 
difference are that more time is expended on making the 
questions ; that they are “‘ tried out ”’ on very large numbers 
of children before they are used to test other children ; 
that objective methods of marking are employed which 
leave nothing to the whim of the examiner; and that the 
results are expressed in terms which enable a pupil to know _ 
his standing, in respect to the performance, among candi- 
dates of his own age taken at random from the whole 
population. 
As regards the first of these points, it is not intended, 
by the upholders of newer methods of testing, to imply 
that the makers of old-fashioned examinations did not in 
many cases give much care and thought to the choice of 
193 N  
-P-A-G-E-192
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
questions. But it remains true that the old-fashioned 
paper was often, or usually, written in a night or two in 
the study, and was not tried on any pupils until the actual 
examination of which it was part; whereas in the modern 
achievement test the questions are accumulated for months, 
and are particularly scrutinized to see that they both cover 
adequately the whole ground to be tested, and are likely 
to lead to answers which can be definitely and rapidly 
marked as good, bad or indifferent, without any need of 
judgment during the marking. During that time they are 
given to thousands of children and a ruthless rejection is 
enforced of questions which turn out to be ambiguous, or 
too easy, or too hard, or which lead to answers difficult to 
judge. Of the bad points and the possible abuses of 
achieyement tests we shall speak presently ; but for this 
principle of trying questions beforehand there can be nothing 
but praise, the only conceivable objection being that in the 
case of important examinations on which a great deal 
depended, it might be difficult to make the trials with that 
secrecy which human nature, even the human nature of 
teachers, makes necessary. All who have set examination 
papers will agree that in every case some question turns 
out to be ambiguous to the children. Some question turns 
out to be never or hardly ever answered. Some important 
branches of the subject can be entirely avoided by whole 
groups of candidates. In my own experience of setting 
examination questions for children, I have always found it 
a very great help, if time permitted, to send the paper to 
some headmaster friend in another part of the country and 
have his pupils try it. 
During these standardizing trials, too, the marking of 
the answers can be fixed and tabulated. Usually the 
answers are required to be short. Sometimes the answer 
has to be identified, and underlined, among several printed 
after the question. Often the so-called ‘“‘ True-false ’ form 
is used, in which the ‘“ questions” consist of a number of 
194
-P-A-G-E-193
    ACHIEVEMENT TESTS 
assertions which have to be marked plus (true) or minus 
(false) by the candidate, in which case, to penalize guessing, 
the number of wrong answers is deducted from the number 
of right answers to obtain the score. In another popular 
form the “ missing word” plan is used just as in the 
Ebbinghaus or Trabue Intelligence Test, except that here 
definite knowledge as well as general intelligence is needed 
to fill up the blanks.* 
These last devices (the Short-answer Plan, the Multiple- 
choice Plan, the True-false Test, and the Completion Test) 
can all be used to advantage by the class teacher, or by 
the college lecturer, in weekly or monthly tests. They 
permit a tremendous amount of ground to be covered in 
a half-hour test, and they can be marked by any assistant 
or even a clerk, who can supply to the teacher or lecturer 
not only the marks scored by each member of the class, 
but also the frequency with which each question was cor- 
rectly answered, a very useful piece of information. They 
do not permit of padding. Neither, of course—and this 
is a point some will regret—do they permit of any display 
of good English composition. But that is probably best 
tested separately. Its marking needs so much time that 
it cannot be frequently combined with a wide-range test 
of subject knowledge. 
The principle of the age scale is also used in achievement 
tests, and a performance or achievement age in each sub- 
ject can be obtained in the same way as a mental age in 
intelligence. For example, Mr. Cyril Burt’s Reading Tests 2 
1 At the spring meeting in 1924 of the American College Entrance 
Examination Board, a body which holds examinations admitting to 
a large number of American colleges, it was resolved to make a practical 
test of the new type examinations in elementary algebra and in ancient 
history. For two years a commission of the Board has been directing 
experiments with the new type examinations in certain schools and 
colleges. At Bryn Mawr College, for example, it was found that such 
examinations gave results considerably closer to the school reputation 
of the pupil than did the regular Entrance Examination in ancient history, 
and somewhat closer in algebra.

195 
   
-P-A-G-E-194
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
have samples of reading of a difficulty suitable for each 
age. This suitability is not decided by Mr. Burt’s opinion, 
or anyone’s opinion. It is decided by actual trial on 
thousands of London children. Every child who is tested 
by that reading scale adds his own small influence to the 
determination of the norms of performance, as a bet regis- 
tered by the pari mutuel modifies the odds. The piece of 
reading labelled x years is of such difficulty that 50 per 
cent. of London children of x years fail in it, 50 per cent. 
pass, by actual trial. The average child just passes. 
In this particular test the paragraphs for reading are 
suitably printed on cards, and the examiner hands them 
to the child one by one, beginning with an easy example 
which he can certainly read, and climbing up the scale of 
difficulty to where he breaks down. A “‘reading age”’ is 
thus obtained. 
A statistical measure which has come into wide use in 
America of late years is the Achievement or Accomplish- 
ment Quotient (in contradistinction to the Intelligence 
Quotient). We can form a general achievement quotient 
from a combination of tests of different sorts, or we can 
form a separate achievement quotient for each school 
subject, for instance, for reading. In this last case the 
Reading Achievement Quotient would be obtained by 
‘dividing the reading age, not by the chronological age, but 
by the mental age. Thus an Achievement Quotient of 100 
means that a child’s school performance is equal to that 
of the average child of his own mental age. His perfor- 
mance may be considerably beyond the average for his 
chronological age; but if he is intelligent above the 
average, this is only what we are entitled to expect 
from him. Or his performance may be considerably 
below the average of his chronological age. But if he 
is handicapped by inborn dullness, he deserves praise 
if he has made as much of his one talent as can on 
the average be expected.

Here boys A, B and Care of different degrees of intelligence, 
as is shown by the differences in I.Q. But each of them 
is doing work as hard as can be expected from him, for in 
each case the performance age is the same as the mental 
age; and therefore each of these three boys has an A.Q. 
of 100. For their respective handicaps, they are doing 
equally well. 
Boys D, E and F show a different picture, and one more 
in accordance with what experiment has actually found 
in schools. D has the lowest I.Q. And his performance 
too is, absolutely, the poorest. But relatively to his mental 
age it is a better performance than that of F, and D excels 
F in A.Q. Usually in school experiments, A.Q.s have been 
found more closely grouped round 100 than are I.Q.s, just 
as here in these six cases. And the high A.Q.s have not 
infrequently gone with the low I.Q.s. This may partly be 
of mathematical origin, what is known as spurious index 
correlation. But it may in part mean that the teachers 
help on the lame dogs, and get them over the stile, whereas 
the clever boys, on the other hand, though they do good 
work, could usually do better, and ought to do better in 
view of their intelligence. Often they should be promoted 
to a class where more will be required of them. 
If a pupil’s Performance Ages in all school subjects are set 
197
-P-A-G-E-196
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
out on a diagram we get a profile of his school performance. 
Three such profiles are shown on the adjoining figure.1 
In these the mental ages have been found by a Stanford 
individual Binet Test, and the subject ages and average 
educational age by the Stanford Achievement Test. The 
three children are members of a Special Opportunity Class 
of Public School 165, Manhattan, near Columbia University, 
and are, within three months, of the same age. The middle 
profile shows what is often found in ordinary classes where 
such gifted children are not being given the opportunity 
to go ahead with school work, for No. 52 has an educational 
age considerably below his powers. No. 8, on the right, 
has, however, an educational age practically equal to his 
mental age, while No. 29 on the left has an educational 
age exceeding his mental age, a rare phenomenon with 
cleverer children though common with those below I.Q. 100. 
The zigzag lines show where each child is strong and where 
comparatively weak. 
For the elementary subjects, profiles such as the above 
can also be made with the tests given in Burt’s Mental 
and Scholastic Tests, or by tests such as Ballard’s, in Eng- 
land ; while in America a host of tests can be purchased, 
for example, the Thorndike-McCall Reading Scale (Teachers’ 
College, New York), and Monroe’s General Survey Scale in 
Arithmetic (Public School Publishing Company, Blooming- 
ton, Illinois). From these two publishers and from the 
World Book Company, Yonkers, N.Y., information about 
a majority of the American tests can be obtained. 
The experienced teacher who first hears about these 
standardized tests is not slow to ask questions about weak 
points in their use, as he imagines them. First of these is, 
cannot a teacher coach his pupils in these very questions, 
so that they will appear to be much better than they really 
are? Secondly, does not this plan of measuring everybody

intangible, only to be appraised by an individual judgment 
of an experienced teacher, and likely to be quite missed by 
these patchwork tests? The parts of the machine may 
be there, but yet no machine. 
To the first question the answer must surely be yes. A 
child might, for example, learn Burt’s or Haggerty’s Reading 
Tests as a 1 edieval hedge clerk learned his neck verse ; 
and rattle them off on recognizing the first three words, 
or the general pattern of the printing. In the bad old 
days (or the good old days) of payment by results in Eng- 
land children did practically learn by heart whole Readers, 
so that the examining inspector was prone to produce 
jealously guarded, unknown tests from his pocket. A 
remedy has been suggested in multiplying alternative forms 
of the tests. But it seems to me that the only real way 
to avoid coaching is to hand the tests over to the teacher 
as a means by which he can satisfy himself as to the standing 
of his pupils and to accept his verdict. When authorities 
wish to know in a more formal way how the children in 
their schools stand compared with other districts, an already 
published standard test can only be used if it is practically 
certain to be unknown in the district ; or an ad hoc test 
must be constructed. This latter is comparatively easy if 
co-operation between authorities can be secured. For let 
a new set of questions, say in arithmetic, be made as similar 
in all relevant respects as can be to a standardized test. 
Let both sets then be given to, say, one thousand unselected 
pupils (whole forms or classes) in some distant district. 
And let the scores in the new questions be standardized 
by comparison with the scores obtained in that test which 
is already well known. This leaves something to accident, 
200
-P-A-G-E-199
  ACHIEVEMENT TESTS 
but is a great improvement on any plan which gives quite 
untried questions. The comparison would not alone be of 
the home district with that distant district (though that 
would be incidentally obtained) ; but through that to the 
comparison with the wider population on which the norms 
of the older test were based. The second objection noted 
above is not, I think, well founded. If a wide enough area 
is taken for the standardized norms, then I think the natural 
competitive spirit in man will see to it that there is a steady 
effort to beat the average ; and this will raise the average. 
In many American schools I have seen charts on the wall 
showing how the class stood with regard to so-and-so’s 
standard test in such a subject, and have noted the upward 
climb of the curve to equal and pass the average. In the 
sublimation of the instinct of emulation, indeed, this rivalry 
with a neutral set of norms plays an important part. 
It is more true, probably, that such tests encourage mere 
memory work. If I set a general question in class to be 
answered by an essay, the pupil has the chance of showing 
a great deal more than his mere knowledge. He can arrange 
his thoughts clearly or badly, make his points in a telling 
and emphatic manner or confusedly and unimpressively. 
And all of this we take into account in giving the essay 
ana, f, ory. On the other hand, we must not forget that 
experiments have shown how variable our judgments of 
such answers are, and how dependable on the whim of the 
moment. And although more than memory is required of 
the candidate, there is sometimes a danger that memory is 
minimized and that a lot of fine talk hides the absence 
of knowledge. The best pupils may not like the American 
achievement test so well, the worst pupils will fear them 
more: for they certainly demand the facts.1 
1 “Tn a large course in English last year, shortly after the new type 
of examination was introduced, the librarian and the manager of the book 
store inquired of the professor what had happened to his course. Both 
reported a quite unprecedented drive on the part of the students to 
borrow, buy, or steal the required books” (Dean Hawkes, Columbia 
Alumni News, 1924, xv, 391).

INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
In general, English and American examination questions 
appear to me to differ in this way, the English questions 
being less pointed and less likely to lead to similar answers, 
the American questions more parcelled out into bits, 
hampering the style of a really good candidate, but finding 
out more about the other candidates. For example, in a 
School Certificate Examination in England in 1923, there 
was asked the question ! : 
What evidences are there to show that the opening of the Panama 
Canal has appreciably influenced the trade routes of the world ? 
In the Regents’ Examination of the State of New York 
in January of 1924 (an examination of somewhat similar 
standing and performing much the same function) it 
happened that a question was asked about the same 
subject, but worded thus : 
Write on the Panama Canal touching on (a) location and length, 
(6) nation controlling it, (c) three cities directly benefited by it, 
and (d) two commodities that are brought nearer to important 
markets by this canal, stating from what market and to what 
market each is shipped. 
These questions are by no means identical in intention, 
but yet there is something common. The second one, 
however, pins the examinee down much more, is less likely 
to lead to verbosity, and will be easier to mark. A mature 
geographer would prefer the former; children, except the 
best of them, will prefer the latter, and on the whole will, 
I think, be more justly marked by it. 
Each of these questions is good in its way. But some- 
times we get questions which are definitely bad, at both 
extremes ; at the one end being the ultra-mechanical (to 
which weakness the Achievement Test in certain subjects 
is undoubtedly prone), and at the other the over-ambitious 
of the kind like that in the story (‘‘ Describe the universe 
and give two examples’’). There is here, as everywhere, 
a golden mean. In their place, however, these new

ACHIEVEMENT TESTS 
Achievement Tests are excellent. Especially in the tool 
subjects of reading and arithmetic they are revolutionary. 
The law of diminishing returns applies here as everywhere, 
and some of the very best teachers, there can be no doubt, 
expend time and energy in attaining an over-perfection of 
efficiency, when the trial of a few standardized tests would 
assure them that their classes were already in the top 
quartile for these subjects, so that attention might better 
be given to exploring the pleasant fields lying alongside 
the beaten track of the Three R’s. Individual weaknesses 
can be diagnosed. Poor classes can be confronted with 
performance results. And rewards can be given for improve- 
ment, for beating an average man, not an impossible ideal. 
I have often wished I knew, for a golf hole, not the “‘ bogey ” 
score, but the norms of actual performance, the median 
and the quartiles. I might regain self-respect.

CHAPTER XX 
GENERAL AND SPECIAL ABILITIES 
THERE are two questions concerning intellectual ability 
which are continually cropping up, and which from different 
aspects have an interest which is now philosophical, now 
practical, now scientific, and now even mathematical. In 
the first place, is the degree of ability of which an individual 
is capable due mainly to inherited qualities or is it mainly 
decided by environmental influences ? In the second place, 
is ability general or specific, can it be guided by schooling 
and opportunity along any channel, or is its direction as 
well as its amount settled by inborn fate? The two are 
closely connected ; for if the answer to the first is that 
environment is all important, then the second question is 
already answered. On the other hand, if ability is mainly 
inborn, it might yet only be decided by nature whether 
the individual is to have a lot or a little of it, leaving to 
nurture the decision whether the given amount shall be 
invested in this or in that activity. 
For their answer, moreover, these questions demand a 
consideration of all sides of the mind, of the feelings and 
the will as well as of the cognitive processes, of interest as 
well as intellect. In theory, the intellectual powers may 
be general, but yet inherited specific interests may impel 
their owner to employ them in fixed directions, a result 
practically indistinguishable from the inheritance of special 
abilities. The question arises whether interest creates 
ability or ability interest ; and moreover, we all know men 
204
-P-A-G-E-203
  GENERAL AND SPECIAL ABILITIES 
whose abilities and whose interests appear to pull in 
‘different directions. 
The rise of intelligence tests, and generally of quantitative 
measuring methods in psychology, has again thrown these 
questions into sharp relief, and has led to the consideration 
of new evidence. Early tests, in the late nineties of last 
century and the first few years of this, mainly endeavoured 
to measure specific items. Speed af reaction to different 
kinds of stimuli; discrimination of two points on the skin, 
of different tones, or of different colours; memory of non- 
sense syllables, sometimes visual memory only, sometimes 
auditory or kinesthetic; these and other functions were 
measured and, to one looking back at that work from a 
distance of a quarter of a century, it seems that it was, on 
the whole, carried through in the belief that the mind was 
a mosaic of such elements, separately measurable and able 
to function separately even if they commonly combined in 
carrying out a complex problem. Whatever the beliefs of 
the master minds engaged in it, there can at any rate be 
no doubt that such was the impression likely to be gained 
by lesser disciples. 
With the advent of Binet’s work came a new point of 
view. His tests were a medley of all sorts and kinds. 
Some of them would have been described as tests of 
sensorial discrimination, some as depending upon visual 
imagery, some upon imagination, some upon auditory 
memory, and so on. But these classifications were im- 
material to his purpose. He simply took care that there 
was a good mixture of different sorts of tests; or else, 
by not caring at all about it, he obtained the same result 
by chance. An individual’s standing in the Binet tests 
depends upon his performance in all these different kinds 
of activities. A Binet score, in short, measures an indi- 
vidual’s average ability. If we picture two very unlike 
individuals, with very dissimilar psychological profiles, 
they may yet have the same average score. Binet and 
205
-P-A-G-E-204
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
his disciples gave up, at any rate for the time being, the 
attempt to discrimiate special abilities. An intelligence 
quotient measures an average of the individual’s intellectual 
powers, what M. Claparéde calls the “ global ”’ intelligence. 
When we classify children according to age and intelligence 
quotient we are only putting together children alike in 
average ability. They may yet have great individual 
differences, as two countries may have the same average 
‘ height yet very different distributions of mountain and 
valley. 
At about the same time that M. Binet’s work began to 
attract attention, Professor Spearman had already carried 
out some of the experiments, and drawn some of the con- 
clusions, which have led him to enunciate his Theory of 
Two Factors. According to that hypothesis, anyone’s 
ability in any particular form of mental activity is the 
sum of two factors, one general and common to all mental 
processes, the other specific and peculiar to that particular 
activity. Spearman’s “g” or general ability is properly 
so called (if his theory be confirmed) for it is really general 
to all activities. It is the lowland from which the moun- 
tain peaks spring, whereas what is measured by Binet 
Tests is a hypothetical average height of the mountains. 
On a _ psychological profile Binet’s average measure, 
Claparéde’s global intelligence, is a horizontal line running 
through the zigzag, with some actual performance points 
below it, some above. Spearman’s general ability is, 
loosely speaking, the horizontal line below which no per- 
formance falls. A third line suggests itself, the line through 
the topmost peak, the height to which some special talent 
rises. All three are important educational data. Spear- 
man’s concept is of peculiar theoretical importance, but 
its actual consideration in psychological literature has 
involved to such an extent the use of mathematical devices 
from statistics and the theory of probability, and is to so 
great a degree the subject of ee (in which the 
206
-P-A-G-E-205
  GENERAL AND SPECIAL ABILITIES 
writer has opposed Dr. Spearman) that it would be out 
of place as material for discussion in a book such as the 
present. Average or global intelligence is in no danger of 
being overlooked while intelligence quotients are being so 
freely discussed in pedagogical literature. There does, 
however, seem to be a peril in the possibility that our 
educational machine nowadays may not care about the 
peaks. To utilize talent of a special kind it may be neces- 
sary to let time-tables and syllabuses go by the board, and 
that is harder nowadays, especially as matriculation 
approaches, than it was in more primitive educational 
ages. A colleague of mine once had in his class a youngster 
who had a talent for drawing so great that my friend 
absolved him of all necessity of keeping to time-tables or’ 
even following any monthly assignments. He could draw 
when he liked. He is not now a world-famous artist, as 
the story tempts one to say. But he is a highly successful 
and artistic designer of well-known posters, and has, I 
think, justified his freedom. 
How does experimental and statistical evidence point 
in regard to such special talents? The chief fact is one 
which we learn from correlational investigations, namely, 
that most correlations between different activities are 
positive. A correlation coefficient, it will be remembered, 
is a fraction which expresses the degree of resemblance of 
two lists of men, say, the one list giving their rank in one 
ability, the other list giving their rank in another ability. 
If,all ability were quite general, not only in its potentiali- 
ties at birth, but in its actuality at any moment, then the 
order of merit of 100 men would be the same for Latin, or 
for a Binet Test, or for musical discrimination, or for any- 
thing else whatsoever. All correlations would be perfect. 
Now they are not perfect—far from it. But they are 
almost always positive. They are hardly ever negative. 
This means that there is a tendency towards general 
ability. Not that this admits the existence of a “g” in 
207
-P-A-G-E-206
y 
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
Professor Spearman’s sense. It only says in words what 
| the correlation coefficients say in numbers, that if a man 
is above the average in one line, he is likely to be above 
‘the average in another. By no means certain to be. In 
some subjects not very likely to be. But hardly ever is 
the betting actually against him. 
The popular belief to the contrary can be traced to two 
sources. In the first place, exceptions are elways more 
noticed by the public than commonplace usual occurrences. 
And so, any men who are exceptionally good at one thing, 
and exceptionally bad at another, are remarked, and taken 
as the type instead of being recognized as exceptions. 
And in the second place, an easily understood desire for 
justice in the world makes the mass of the people feel that 
if Jones excels them so clearly in x, there is probably some 
other line in which they could individually rise superior to 
Jones. 
One hundred years ago, Sir Walter Scott felt and feared 
this prejudice: 
The public are, in general (he said) very ready to adopt 
the opinion, that he who has pleased them in one peculiar mode 
of composition is, by means of that very talent, rendered incapable 
of venturing upon other subjects. . . There is some justice in 
this opinion, as there always is in such as attain general currency. 
. But much more frequently the same capacity which carries 
a man to popularity in one department will obtain for him success 
in another (Introduction to Ivanhoe). 
Correlations reported between different school subjects, 
different kinds of mental tests, etc., tend to vary between 0°2 
and 0°9, with a frequent occurrence of values round about 0°5. 
I think, from a considerable experience of the literature of 
correlation, that this is approximately a correct report of 
the facts. Now these correlations, even although they are 
all positive, leave plenty of room for much individual 
specialization of talent. The best way, perhaps, of con- 
vincing the reader of this, is to give some correlational facts 
tm extenso in the form of a correlation table. Here is one

showing scores of 100 children in an examination in mathe- 
matics and in French. It represents a correlation of 0°51, 
but yet the reader will see that there are many cases of 
children good at the one and weak at the other subject. 
The median marks are 45 in mathematics and 60 in French, 
and of the upper 50 children in mathematics 16 are below 
the median in French.1 Of the whole, only 68 per cent.

is, are strong in both or weak in both.? 
1 This cannot be checked by the reader because the mathematics 
median comes in the middle of the group with forty-odd marks. 
2 Of course, in an examination such as this the correlation is dependent 
not only upon the inherent connection in the child’s mind between ability 
in French and in mathematics, but upon differences in the ability of 
teachers of these subjects. In the same examination, for these 100 
children, the correlation between French and English was 0°35, between 
English and mathematics was zero. It is tempting but dangerous to 
209 °
-P-A-G-E-208
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
Indeed, just as among the public there may be an exaggera- 
tion of belief in specialization of talent, so there has been, 
I think, among research workers in psychology and pedagogy, 
jan exaggerated idea of the amount of similarity connoted 
| by correlation coefficients. There has been noticeable 
‘during the past year a tendency to emphasize the lack of 
agreement between lists which a correlation of 0°5 or 0°6 
or even 0'8 permits, and minimize the former regard for 
their resemblance. The general fact seems to be fairly 
stated by saying, that while it is true that correlation 
coefficients are positive for the most part, yet they are so 
far removed from unity that great diversity in talent may 
yet coexist with them. It is not until a correlation co- 
efficient is well over 0°9 that any predictions based thereon 
are of much practical value. | ; 
Two lines of investigation which bear on the question 
of average ability being inherited or acquired are (1) 
inquiries into the mentality of twins and siblings, and (2) 
researches into the constancy or otherwise, with advancing 
age, of the intelligence quotient. Twins are notoriously 
more likely to resemble one another than siblings—brothers 
and sisters of the same family who are not twins. Again, 
however, there exists the possibility of explaining this 
resemblance, as far as mental qualities go, either by saying 
that the reason is the identity of inheritance, or by claiming 
that it is due to the exceptional identity of home circum- 
stances. Researches by Galton, Thorndike, and others 
point to the former factor, inheritance, as being more 
potent. Thorndike compared twins of different ages, and 
found that young twins resembled each other mentally just 
as much as old twins did, whereas if the identity of home 
circumstances were the cause of the resemblance, then its 
| 
draw conclusions from such numbers as to the relationships existing 
between the inherent abilities, the nature of the teaching, and the skill 
of examining, in these subjects. It is very desirable that large public 
examination authorities should employ a statistician to compute and 
publish correlations of this kind based on their extensive data. 
210
-P-A-G-E-209
GENERAL AND SPECIAL ABILITIES 
effect ought to go on increasing up to the time when they 
left the home. Galton followed up cases of great mental 
similarity between twins, and also great dissimilarity, 
which not infrequently occurs. If home identity were the 
cause of the similarity, one would expect twins brought up 
in different homes frequently to show dissimilar mentalities. 
But in fact, in Galton’s data, twins brought up in the one 
home were as often dissimilar as were those brought up in 
different homes (having been separated at or near birth). 
Their similarity or dissimilarity appeared to be independent 
of the environment. 
Mental correlations between twins are of the order of 
magnitude of 0°7, thus exceeding in size mental correlations 
between ordinary siblings, which are of the order of magni> 
tude of 0°5. In their turn, however, these latter correla- 
tions exceed correlations between pairs of individuals of 
different parentage, who, indeed, show no correlation if 
care is taken to make the selection really random, and to 
avoid certain technical sources of spurious correlation. 
Again, we are faced with the question whether this 
mental correlation of siblings is due to their sharing the 
same home advantages or disadvantages, or to their inheri- 
tance from a common ancestry. Researches are conflicting 
in their testimony, but when care has been taken to make 
allowance for various subtle mathematical troubles which 
tend to camouflage the true facts, they seem to me to 
speak more decidedly in favour of the importance of 
heredity than environment. The need for independent 
repetition of the more important experiments is great. If 
such repetition were to confirm the following results obtained 
by Dr. Kate Gordon,! the prepotence of heredity would 
seem to me to be fully established. 
Dr. Gordon tested the intelligence of over 200 pairs of 
siblings, all 400 of whom had lived for ten years and more, 
not in their separate homes, but in three orphanages in 
1 See Elderton, Biometrika, 1923.

California. Here there is no home environment tending 
to make brother and sister both better, or both worse, than 
the average. The common orphanage environment could 
not make brother and sister resemble each other any more 
than it made any boy resemble any girl inmate. But the 
siblings still showed a strong mental similarity in their 
departure from the average, with a correlation 0°52 prac- 
tically identical with that found for home-dwelling siblings. 
If this is not an accident of coincidence, and is confirmed 
by repetition, and if no mathematical sources of spurious 
correlation remain undetected, then it would seem that 
this similarity of siblings is entirely explained either by 
inheritance, or by the common home environment of very 
early infancy before transfer to the institution. This latter 
seems rather unlikely in view of their ten years or more of 
orphanage life. 
We turn now to the question of the constancy of the 
intelligence quotient. Many psychologists believe in this 
constancy. That is to say, they believe that a clever child 
of five will be a clever child of fifteen, a dull child of five 
a dull child of: fifteen. They do not mean, of course, that 
this is the absolutely unvarying rule. But they do believe 
that it is much more, very much more, the rule than the 
exception. For the evidence in favour of this constancy 
of intelligence quotient the reader should turn especially 
to Terman’s book on The Measurement of Intelligence in 
Children, and to articles which appear frequently in the 
current psychological literature. Intelligence quotients of 
children have been measured as much as seven years apart 
in children’s lives, and have been found on the whole to 
be only slightly changed. The average change reported 
is about five points of I.Q., sometimes up, sometimes down. 
I have tested a few children myself over four years, and 
found practically no change in the Binet I.Q. And by 
group tests, which give a much less reliable measure, I 
have tested some eleven hundred children at an interval 
212 
|
-P-A-G-E-211
GENERAL AND SPECIAL ABILITIES 
of one year, and found 84 per cent. of them to have sub- 
stantially the same I.Q., meaning that they were placed 
within one category of the former position, a category 
embracing ten points of I.Q. 
Against the doctrine of constancy of I.Q. are voices from 
various quarters. First of all, in the reports from psycho- 
logists themselves, despite the fact that the majority of 
measured I.Q.s remain fairly steady, there are also in- 
stances, in a small but important minority, of cases where 
there is serious change of I.Q. It can be said of such, 
however, that they are more rare with careful individual 
tests than they are with group tests; and they are more 
rare with carefully trained examiners than when untrained 
persons do the testing. When such sources of error are 
removed, and when obvious physical reasons have been 
eliminated, there are not many discrepant cases left. 
In the second place teachers, parents, and members of 
the public are widely convinced that many children develop 
late, and do not show their real intelligence during the 
elementary or lower school years ; and that, on the other 
hand, clever children often wither away mentally, and prove 
to be no more intelligent, as adults, than their duller school 
comrades. As Sir Walter Scott said, no doubt there is 
some truth in any opinion so widely current. But it has 
to be discounted a little for one or two reasons. 
Firstly, the measure of intelligence employed in the 
school period of these children is usually their success with 
school work. But the psychologist may assert that had he 
been given a chance to test these children by. modern 
methods, he might have found out that these apparently 
precocious children were not really clever but only crammed ; 
and that these apparently poor pupils were not really dull 
but only uninterested. Martin, in Tom Brown’s Schooldays, 
probably did badly in Latin verse, but he probably had a 
high 1.Q. 
Then the measure of intelligence in later years is often 
218
-P-A-G-E-212
INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
success in the world’s work, perhaps success in business. 
Now success in business is by no means ensured by intelli- 
gence alone. Zeal, ability to work hard, and even to endure 
drudgery, a liking for financial rewards, tact in getting on 
with other men, these and other factors all play their part. 
In some careers ruthlessness of character may be of great 
importance, and even a certain disregard for niceties of 
conscience not a handicap. Especially, persistence and hard 
work may explain many a slowly developing child without 
any need to suppose that he has become more intelligent ; 
and lack of those qualities may explain the reverse 
phenomenon without any actual daa in intellect having 
occurred. 
There can be no harm in encouraging average students 
to hope that hard work may improve their intellectual 
standing. In effect, it will do so. But there is consider- 
able power for harm, I think, in the exaggerated doctrine 
preached by some, according to which it would almost 
appear that the best guarantee of success in life is to be 
unsuccessful at school. The grain of truth in it is, that 
bookish success at school, if it is won at the expense of 
mixing with others, at the expense of exercising powers of 
leadership in clubs and games, is not worth while. But 
all-round school success, with a leaning to work rather than 
to play, is much the best guarantee of later success. 
The whole of the question is rather complicated by 
doubts whether Binet Tests do meagure only such part of 
the intellect as is explicable by heredity. In all discussions 
about these questions there is considerable danger of arguing 
in a circle. Here it shows itself in a tendency to say that 
our tests should only test inherited intelligence, not acquired 
knowledge, and that such tests can be identified by the 
fact that they continue to place a group of children in the 
same order of merit as they grow up. Tests which do not 
do this are rejected, and then the fact that the surviving 
tests show constancy of I.Q. is held to prove that intelli- 
214
-P-A-G-E-213
GENERAL AND SPECIAL ABILITIES 
gence is inborn and unimprovable. Now on the whole, I 
believe that intelligence really is inborn and comparatively 
unalterable, but I feel some danger in the circular nature 
of the above argument. The fact that some tests can be 
discovered which show comparative constancy of I.Q. with 
increasing age is the central fact, and it proves that some- 
thing intellectual exists which is mainly inherited. But it 
does not seem to exclude entirely the possibility that other 
parts or phases of intellect can be changed by schooling, 
unless we define intellect only as that which persists un- 
changed.

  CHAPTER XXI 
THE INFLUENCE OF SCHOOLING ON INTELLI- 
GENCE AND THE LIMIT OF ITS GROWTH! 
Two pieces of work in particular, which were undoubtedly 
of first-class experimental character, show very much 
dependence of intelligence on schooling, or rather depend- 
ence of the Binet I.Q.’ on schooling. The first was' a 
research by Mr. Cyril Burt, in which at great labour he 
obtained for each child in a whole school the Binet mental 
age (B), the mental age according to Mr. Burt’s own 
Reasoning Tests (I), the school age (8), and the’ actual 
age (A). By complicated, but as I ‘believe perfectly valid 
mathematical calculations using partial correlation, he then

so that ‘“‘ school attainment is the preponderant contributor 
to the Binet-Simon tests,” and with these tests 
a child’s mental age is a measure not only of the amount of intelli- 
gence with which he is congenitally endowed, not only of the plane 
of intelligence at which in the course of life and growth he has 
eventually arrived; it is also an index, largely if not mainly, of 
the mass of scholastic information and skill which, in virtue of 
attendance more or less regular, by dint of instruction more or less 
effective, he has progressively accumulated in school. 
These conclusions are very important, and the experi- 
ment ought to be, and doubtless will be, repeated several 
times. Meanwhile, there are two points which deserve 
mention in the argument which has followed.

  THE INFLUENCE OF SCHOOLING 
In the first place, supposing the above numerical equation 
were fully confirmed, it might be illuminating to change 
the emphasis in Mr. Burt’s sentences, and say, ‘‘ only to an; 
extent of about one half does performance in the Binet 
Simon tests depend on schooling.” That is a great deal, ‘ 
to have tests half independent of schooling, even if they 
are not wholly independent as enthusiasts hoped and 
believed. 
Tests more independent of schooling, however, would be 
a great boon in doing justice to children who have had 
different educational opportunities. And such tests Mr. 
Burt’s results show that we have, in his own Reasoning 
‘Tests ; which brings me to the second point of the argument. 
In his own discussion of this experiment, Mr. Burt uses 
throughout the term “intelligence ”’ tout court, for the per- 
formance in his Reasoning Tests. This has led some to 
reject his conclusions very summarily, saying that he has 
simply chosen arbitrarily what is to be called intelligence. 
But this is not just. It was perhaps a little unwise to use 
the word ‘“‘intelligence’”’ all alone. But if he had said 
“native intelligence,” he would have been entirely justified 
as far as this experiment goes. For the same data from 
which the above much-quoted equation is calculated enable 
anyone skilled in correlational mathematics to see that I, 
the mental age according to Burt’s Reasoning Tests, is 
indeed here entirely independent of schooling. It seems to 
have very largely escaped notice that this is so, and it 
would have been exceedingly interesting had these tests 
been employed, in addition to the Terman-Binet, in the 
other crucial experiment to which we now turn. 
This research, carried out by Mr. Hugh Gordon, puts to 
a prolonged trial the assertion made by many test enthu- 
siasts, and not altogether unsupported by definite instances, 
that almost total absence of schooling leaves the Binet I.Q. 
uninfluenced. To test this in a systematic way Mr. Gordon 
turned to two special classes in England, gypsies and canal 
217
-P-A-G-E-216
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
boatmen, whose children get very much less schooling than 
the ordinary child. His general plan was to see whether, 
under such neglect, the I.Q. sinks as the child gets older, 
‘jand his evidence points to this being indeed the case. 
~ True, he did not measure the same children as they grew 
older, but only older brothers and sisters in the same family. 
The younger children averaged about 100 I.Q., but this 
decreased as older children in the family were tested, 
) strongly suggesting that they were handicapped by lack 
' of schooling. The phenomenon was more marked among 
the canal boat children, who not only go least to school, 
but mix least with others. 
We learn from some references by Dr. Ballard that these 
same children are being retested by non-language tests, 
and are giving different results ; while, as we said before, 
it would have been very interesting to have had them 
tested by Burt’s Reasoning Tests. 
As they stand at present, the experiments indicate that 
reasonable schooling is necessary to develop that which is 
measured by Binet tests. This may mean either that 
intelligence is. developed by schooling, or that Binet tests 
measure something in addition to intelligence. The possi- 
bility that Burt’s Reasoning Tests measure something 
uninfluenced by schooling lends colour to the latter 
alternative. 
But, indeed, it seems incredible that such great lack of 
schooling should not depress the intelligence. In garden-. 
ing there is, no doubt, inherent in each seed a maximum 
limit of size and quality. But no gardener, nobody, but 
knows that more than good seed is necessary. It is not 
immaterial whether it be sown upon a rock, or by the 
wayside, or in good ground ; nor must it lack moisture. 
As we go out from the city into the rural districts, we 
often find the average I.Q. of the children, as measured 
by the usual tests, becoming lower. Is this due to a real 
decrease in intelligence, or is it due to the fact that the 
218
-P-A-G-E-217
  
THE INFLUENCE OF SCHOOLING 
country children, though intelligent enough, are less ready 
with verbal responses and are less familiar with the type 
of material used in the intelligence test? And if the 
decrease in intelligence is real, is it caused by lack of book- 
learning, lack of vocabulary, lack of the stimuli to the 
sharpening of wits which the town child finds; or is it 
caused by the pull of towns taking away the more imagina- 
tive and the mentally more alert ? 
Mr. Burt’s and Mr. Gordon’s experiments, showing as 
they do a considerable influence of schooling on the Binet 
1.Q., would indicate that part of the difference is due to 
that factor. Country schools are, in general, less likely to 
have as many books, or teachers with so much cultural 
| experience, as town schools, though here and there an 
exceptional man or woman may prefer the peace of the 
hills to the lectures and library books of the town. Many 
country schools are small, and intellectual intercourse may 
thereby be limited. The children live in smaller com- 
munities or even in isolated farms, and converse but little 
compared with their town cousins. All these things may 
dull the intelligence either fundamentally and really, or 
apparently and as misjudged by the academic mind. 
But there is some reason to think that the selection 
factor, the draining away of the talent of the countryside 
to the towns, is even more important ; and that the less 
stimulating life of the farm is the cause of the phenomenon 
not by actually producing a lower intelligence, as the tests 
define it, but by repelling the more active minds. Both 
in Yorkshire and in Northumberland experimental tests 
have shown, not conclusively but at least suggestively, that 
at a still greater distance from the town and out of the 
immediate range of their attraction, a change in the 
opposite direction sets in, and the average I.Q. rises again, 
though not to the level of the suburbs populated by the 
successful members of the city. 
In 1916-17 Miss M. E. Bickersteth tested individually 
219

  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
a large number of children in the Yorkshire Dales, and 
found some surprising instances of remote talent. 
Some of the schools (she tells us) ! were only reached after a walk 
of many miles over the fells, and . . . at these schools, far from 
any village, and attended by children living in lonely farms on 
the moors, sometimes three or four miles from the school, the 
performance at the tests was almost invariably above the average 
for the Dales as a whole. In these remoter Dales 84 per cent. 
of the children were above the average for the Dales as a whole in 
the Reasoning Test, and 74 per cent. in the Memory Test, while 
very marked ability was not infrequently shown in the case of 
individual children. 
In 1921 and 1922 the present writer devised, and 
standardized by preliminary experiments, group tests 
which were administered to large numbers of children in 
the schools of Northumberland, about 3,000 in the former 
and 14,000 in the latter year. The primary object of 
chese tests was to discover children worthy of free secondary 
education among those elementary schools which had not 
sent in any candidates for the orthodox examination in 
English and mathematics on which such free scholarships 
were usually awarded. For it was feared that the lack of 
candidates from these schools might at least in part be 
due to a feeling that in such an examination their pupils 
could not successfully compete with the more favourably 
situated town children. The distribution of intelligence 
suggested by the 1921 tests was that the highest ability 
| was found close to the cities and far away from the cities, 
as though the intermediate areas had been drained by 
selection. 
In 1922, when larger numbers were available, this 
phenomenon was, though less well marked, still I think 
apparent. Northumberland is divisible into an urban area 
along the River Tyne, bordered by a densely populated 
coalfield, beyond which lies the large and sparsely popu- 
lated hill region of the Cheviots. In the urban region the

THE INFLUENCE OF SCHOOLING 
proportion of children with I.Q.s over 130 was 1 in 96, 
rising in one very favoured suburb to 1 in 30. Outside 
this urban region, up to the 260-foot contour line, the 
proportion fell to 1 in 231, to rise again in the hills to 1 in 
95. The possible errors of these experiments are such that 
one dare not feel certain about the conclusions. But they 
seem to point in the direction indicated! A factor to be 
borne in mind is that the population of these hills is not 
descended from a peasantry but from the very active 
reivers and raiders of the marches, who pitted their wits 
against the equally alert Scots across the Border. 
* * * * 
A question which has aroused even more controversy 
than the preceding, and one which is fundamentally con- 
nected with it, is that of the limit of the growth of intelli- 
gence. Probably no one, who, before the advent of tests, 
had been asked to what age he thought intelligence con- 
tinued to develop, would have replied with any age less 
than twenty-one ; and I judge that most would have given 
a much higher age. One of the surprises of tests has been 
the discovery that average performance in them, which has 
been increasing steadily from year to year up to about 11, 
begins to slow down and reaches an upper limit at or 
about 16 years. The exact age is disputed, whether 
14, 15 or 16, but workers with tests agree on the general 
fact. nia iss 
The first answer of a plain man to such a statement is, 
so much the worse for the tests. But the phenomenon 
needs more careful description. It is seen most clearly in 
group tests in which a point-score is given. For example, 
in the Otis Advanced Tests the maximum score is 230, 
and the average score obtained by different age groups is 
as shown on page 222. 
1 See Thomson, Brit. Journ. of Psychology, 1922, xii, 201; and Duff 
and Thomson, in that Journal, 1923, xiv, 192. 
221
-P-A-G-E-220
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
After the age of 18 there is no increase in the average 
score, and not much after 17. 
Now one possible flaw in this is that it may be due to 
the speed factor. The Otis Advanced Test is timed page 
by page and, we may think, perhaps 130 is not the limit 
set by intelligence but by speed. Some individuals, how- 
ever, obtain a very high score, over 200, so that there is 
evidently no physical impossibility in exceeding 130. What 
one would like to know, nevertheless, is how the above 
numbers would have run had as much time been given as 
the candidates wished for.t My own experience with 
college students leads me to believe that in their case all 
but a very small number would get scores of 200 and more 
  
  
if given more time, and many would get perfect scores. 
Now English college students probably approximate to the 
level, intellectually, of the upper 10 per cent. of the popu- 
lation, so that one cannot make any general conclusion 
from them. But-it is at least possible that giving plenty 
of time would not only raise the above curve bodily, but 
displace its turning-point towards a higher age. 
Another possible criticism of the 16-year limit of intelli- 
gence is that perhaps there is something in the tests which 
creates it, in this way. The commonest form of test is 
one which uses material which, it is supposed, is the common 
property of everyone, the possession of which does not 
1 See Ruch, Journ. of Educ. Psychol., 1924, ix, 39. 
222
-P-A-G-E-221
THE INFLUENCE OF SCHOOLING 
depend upon schooling, or only upon such schooling as 
inevitably comes to every child. Now towards the age of 
14 it becomes increasingly difficult to make questions which 
are confined to such material and are hard enough to 
extend the cleverer children. They could do more difficult 
thinking, perhaps, but examples of such are always placed 
in some province of reasoning where particular knowledge 
is also necessary, such as mathematics, economics, or 
engineering. Perhaps the curve turns at 16 just because 
it is impossible to make tests which both are hard enough 
to extend the older cleverer subjects and also are confined 
to common knowledge for their materials. 
There is, however, another type of test which gets over 
the difficulty of community of knowledge in another way, 
namely, by giving a lesson, as it were, on the subject and 
then testing. Such, for example, is the cipher test in the 
Terman-Binet series, where a standardized lesson is given 
on the cipher, and then the pupil is examined as to his 
ability to use it. Such, too, is the Hindustani Test, + in 
which a method of identifying the words is taught, and 
then a test which can be worked in the same way is applied. 
It seems possible that tests of this sort might push the 
“ limiting ” age up past 16. In the case of the Hindustani 
Test the average marks obtained by elementary school 
children in Northumberland who were neither retarded nor 
accelerated in school were as follows : 
th ge sty bes otis 103 114 123 13% 
Marks, per cent. 16 27 39 54 
These marks show no signs of reaching a limit at 14 (as 
the American Army Tests did) nor even at 16. The slight 
curvature of the graph is against the idea of any limit 
being even near at hand. There is, perhaps, some possible 
2 See page 188. 
2238
-P-A-G-E-222
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
fallacy in the circumstance that only children in their 
normal school class were taken. But there were at the 
time in Northumberland as many accelerated as retarded 
children. It is true also that the 3,000 children tested at 
the time included a large proportion who were put forward 
by their headmasters as candidates for scholarships. But 
they were mainly accelerated in school, and as such are 
not included in these norms. In any case, this is a per- 
fectly well defined set of children, those who go through 
school with one grade or standard per year; and in their 
case at least it seems certain that what is measured by the 
Hindustani Test does not cease improving at 14 years, and 
improbable that it ceases at 16, from the shape of the curve. 
The other and more orthodox point of view (for a psycho- 
logist) is well illustrated by curves which can be drawn 
from the figures in Mr. Burt’s book? on page 133. There 
the percentage of children who can pass each test is given 
for each year of age. In the easier tests this percentage 
reaches 100 at an early age. With tests lower down the 
list this point is later. The curves of increasing percentage 
for the hardest tests are more and more gentle in slope. 
Many of them, at the highest age (14) which Mr. Burt’s 
table shows, have by no means reached the 100 per cent. 
point ; but a little consideration of their shapes convinces 
one that it is improbable that they ever will, and that it 
is not at all unlikely that they turn and run parallel with 
the base line at some age such as 16. 
We do not know. If I confess myself as by no means 
convinced that the limit of growth of intelligence occurs as 
early as sixteen years, I must confess also that the evidence 
on the whole points that way. We need many individual 
studies to learn whether the age of cessation is different in 
different individuals or the same closely for all. And if it 
is different, whether a high or low I.Q. at 10 years goes 
with prolonged growth. Most prediction to-day is based

224 
 
-P-A-G-E-223
  THE INFLUENCE OF SCHOOLING 
on the belief that the intelligent child of 10 will go on 
developing at least as long as the dull child, and most 
research tends to confirm this. I think that if tests could 
be devised and standardized which would give a fair chance 
to the superior intellects to show their powers of abstract 
thinking, they would be found to go on developing for 
years after sixteen. Excepting for the speed limit, there 
is nothing in any intelligence test which cannot be done by 
such adults ; and they could do far more difficult thinking 
than is there represented. And I do not believe they could 
do it at 16. It is impossible to make tests which are diffi- 
cult enough to strain superior adult intelligence (as dis- 
tinguished from judgment) and yet are confined to every- 
day situations common to educated and uneducated alike, 
if we except questions of a catchy or puzzle nature. If 
we could make such, or could measure in some other way, 
I think we would find intelligence growing far past 16 in 
the case of the superior. And they would cause the average 
also to continue with an upward tendency, if a slight one, 
past that age. 
* * * * 
It will be seen that there is here a connection between 
the two parts of this chapter. My belief is that intelli- 
gence of a superior sort can, after about 16, no longer 
find.in commonly grasped situations opportunity to show 
itself (though good judgment may); but that only in the 
more abstract situations attained through education, in- 
cluding self-education, can this occur. It is impossible, 
even in tests before 16, to keep out those which require 
some schooling. After 16, there are none, except tests 
requiring schooling, which are capable of measuring the 
more intelligent. It may not be a mere coincidence that 
the age given for the cessation of growth of intellect is 
approximately that at which schooling commonly ceases. 
However, here as everywhere, we must bow to experiment, 
225 e
-P-A-G-E-224
  
INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
though while awaiting experiment’s decision we may be 
content with experience. Experiment finds it impossible 
to demonstrate a growth of intelligence (in the average 
man) after sixteen. Experience must not refuse to note 
this interesting fact, and may not pooh-pooh it. We have 
to remember that doubt which creeps in when we decide 
against an argument which we dislike. We may have 
decided against it because we dislike its conclusions. And 
assuredly none of us likes to think that he is no more 
intelligent now than when he was sixteen.

CHAPTER XXII 
DIFFERENCES IN WILL AND TEMPERAMENT 
Mokrz important for the happiness of the individual than 
differences in intellect are differences in disposition, which 
also no doubt have their inherited foundations, but are, it 
would seem, more open to education and more influenced 
by environment. But whereas intelligence is measured, as 
it were, up and down a single scale, in speaking of tempera- 
‘ment or of disposition we commonly use several variables. 
The traditional classification of temperaments, and it is 
still pretty well as good as any other, is into the sanguine, 
the melancholic, the phlegmatic and the choleric.1 The 
sanguine is fickle, changeable, mercurial. The phlegmatic 
is difficult to move, unenthusiastic, takes things as they 
come; is placid and solid. The melancholic is emotional 
enough, but of a sentimental poetic mood, inclined to 
mysticism, and to depression. The choleric is single of 
purpose, headstrong, bigoted, the stuff that reformers and 
die-hards are both made of. Micawber was sanguine, 
Columbus was choleric, Don Quixote melancholic ; but no 
great or interesting person was ever phlegmatic. At most, 
he put on the appearance of it. 
When we cast round in our minds to place heroes of 
history and of fiction, and persons whom we know, into 
their appropriate category in these four temperaments, the 
? These four traditional types are named in conformity with an ancient 
medicinal theory, curiously like the hormone theory of to-day, that our 
temperaments are the result of the preponderance in us of one or other 
of four humours—blood, bile, black bile, and phlegm ; of which blood 
gave the sanguine, bile the choleric, the black bile the melancholic or 
atrabilious, and phlegm the phlegmatic. 
227
-P-A-G-E-226
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
most striking fact we notice is that they refuse to fit in. 
Always they have some tincture of other types. Always 
they fail to supply some aspect of the type to which other- 
wise they seem most to approximate. Indeed, people are 
not divided into any such clearly defined classes, nor are 
boys and girls in school. They deviate more or less in 
radiating directions, from one general average individual. 
And yet it is convenient to make the attempt to classify, 
provided we do it with caution ; and useful to have a stock 
of names to identify the classes. The best way to treat 
the fickle, sanguine, mercurial, butterfly-minded child in 
school is to scheme to engage him or her, together with a 
group of steadier comrades, in some interesting project 
which will last for some time. The choleric has to be given 
his head, but other things than those to which he naturally 
attends have to be linked on to his rather narrow interests 
so as to appear indispensable to his main object. Such 
a boy has energy, and will do his mathematics if he believes 
it will help him to go to sea, if that happens to be his aim. 
The melancholic, the artistic, should above all not be 
ridiculed for his probable lack of interest in games and 
the common life; but can be linked with a mixed team 
of temperaments to do a combined job, such as getting out 
a school play, where his usually wide reading and his good 
taste can be utilized and he can be saved from becoming 
too self-centred. The phlegmatic boy will take no harm. 
If he is too easy-going he needs the spur, and he is not 
necessarily stupid because he is unresponsive. Some 
interest will be the strongest, and should be sought out 
and cultivated. 
Very many other temperamental classifications have 
been made through the ages. As the above is one of the 
oldest, so one of the newest is the division into extrovert 
and introvert, and into stable-minded and unstable-minded. 
Tansley gives one of the best expositions of this product 
of the New Psychology; and in his book references will 
228 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
DIFFERENCES IN WILL AND TEMPERAMENT 
be found to Jung (who mainly created the introvert- 
extrovert distinction) and to Trotter (whose book on 
Instincts of the Herd gave us the classification stable- and 
unstable-minded). The extrovert looks outward for the 
outlets of his energy. He is a man of action. The 
introvert creates his world within, and is a thinker, per- 
chance a mere dreamer ; but if he does turn again to action, 
his powers of thought make that action often of far-reaching 
importance. 
The stable-minded man has fixed opinions, generally 
consistent with those of the “herd ” to which he belongs. 
He does not readily change them, or conceive them as open 
to question. The unstable-minded is more changeable, 
being sensitive to experience: a trimmer and opportunist, 
his enemies would say, were he a politician. The four 
combinations give us as types the stable-minded extrovert, 
the typical man of action, guiding his life by principles 
which he has accepted from his caste and will never change ; 
the unstable-minded extrovert, setting his sails to catch 
every wind of public opinion or of changing opportunity ; 
the stable-minded introvert, the thinker along traditional 
lines ; and the unstable-minded introvert, inconstant even 
with himself. Education cannot want to create any one 
of these uninviting types. Rather it will wish to encourage 
true flexibility (rather than instability) which will modify 
principles when that is really shown to be necessary, but 
not lightly. Education will desire a combination, or an 
alternation, of introversion and extroversion, rather than 
one or the other exclusively. The great trouble about all 
classifications is the danger of making divisions where none 
exist. This particular classification strongly suggests that 
men of action cannot think ; that men of thought cannot 
act ; that men of principles cannot abate one iota of them ; 
and that men who learn by experience are unprincipled. 
Each is called these things by his enemies. The truth is 
that any man is more or less each of these four, it is only 
229
-P-A-G-E-228
INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
a question of balance; and further, any man is the one 
thing at one time, and another at another, is of the one 
type in one province (say religion) and of the other type 
in another province (say his profession). 
Many classifications have been made which are as much 
classifications of the intellect as of the temperaments ; as, 
indeed, in fact those already considered have been. Such, 
for example, is that made by Ostwald into the romantic 
and the classical types.1 It is given by Ostwald as a 
classification of intellect ; but it seems to me to be a classi- 
fication mainly of temperament. All the cases quoted by 
Ostwald are men of genius. There is no suggestion that 
the one type is more intelligent than the other. Rather 
the one is sanguine and impulsive, the other steady and 
long burning. As Rignano says, “‘in the determination of 
the different characteristics of the logical faculty which 
above all one would call intellectual, the affective nature 
of the individual has yet a very great importance.” # 
Ostwald had been asked by a young Japanese student, 
who was inspired thereto by his government, “ how one 
could know in youth those who were destined to be great 
scientific discoverers”; the inquiry being directed to 
Ostwald because he had had great fortune in discovering 
such men as young students and assisting in their develop- 
ment. Thinking it over, Ostwald came to the conclusion 
that the essential criterion was that the young student 
should demand more work and wider work than was laid 
down for him in the regular courses in which he was 
engaged. 
He was impelled, however, by this request to probe 
deeper into the matter, and he did this by what would now 
in America be called the “case method”; that is to say, 
he took what appeared to him to be typical specimens of 
the type of man in question, and studied them in detail, 
in what he calls a biological manner. From these studies,

( DIFFERENCES IN WILL AND TEMPERAMENT 
several of which form chapters of his book, he draws a 
number of conclusions which he emphasizes from time to 
time and then puts together at the end in special 
chapters. 
In the first place, he distinguishes sharply between the 
two types for which he coins the names romantic and 
classical. The man of romantic type is especially differ- 
entiated by the extraordinarily rapid character of his 
thought, the varied nature of his researches, his precocity, 
his usually early decay, and his tendency to dilettantism 
which in all but the greatest leads to much second-rate 
work. Such was Humphry Davy, and such was Liebig. 
The classical type, on the other hand, is distinguished 
by a slower form of thought, a slower development in his 
life history, and a devotion to one particular problem, the 
solution of which is often obtained intuitively early in the 
history of the research, the remainder of the individual’s 
powers being occupied with the scientific justification and 
proof of the position then taken up. Ostwald’s first and 
most typical example is (and the choice will seem strange 
to English eyes) Robert Mayer, the physician who first 
calculated the specific energy of heat and whose priority 
to real scientific claims in this matter were, especially at 
first, strongly opposed in favour of Joule, whose work was 
admittedly more definite and exact. Gauss, also quoted 
by Ostwald, would seem to us to be a happier example of 
the classical type; Faraday, whose life is given very fully, 
to be rather a doubtful case; while the clearest example 
which occurs to one is that of Darwin, with Huxley as his 
correlative Romantiker. 
The Romantiker, according to Ostwald, has a much 
greater personal influence, a greater power of inspiring either 
students or audiences. 
The man of classical type does not publish his results in 
the way he has arrived at them, but in a classical and 
often deductive form, whereas the real approach was by 
281 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
induction and intuition. The crying example is Euclid, 
whose deductive method in his publication tempted the 
whole world for centuries to follow this most unnatural 
method of study and discovery. 
Ostwald is strongly of opinion that a great mass of genius 
is submerged by the unfavourable environment of its early 
years, either by reason of physical harm, perhaps even 
jeopardizing survival, or by the crippling effect on the 
mind. Faraday he cites as almost the only case of a really 
first-class scientist coming from the very lowest stratum, 
the majority coming from the middle classes.1 
In the vocational guidance of individuals, in addition to 
tests of intelligence and skill, estimates of temperament 
and disposition are coming to play a larger part. Schneider, 
quoted by Hollingworth, gives a number of pairs of adjectives 
descriptive of dispositions, which are useful in considering 
children ; including settled or roving, indoor or outdoor, 
directive or dependent, creative or imitative, adaptable 
1 Ostwald concludes by giving, among others, the following criteria 
of extraordinary scientific ability between ten and sixteen years of age. 
(1) Precocity, or early maturing. 
(2) The boy strives after something more than the school, since the 
mental activities of the latter do not suffice for him. 
(3) Therefore, there are often conflicts with the school authorities, 
which become sharper with advancing years. The reports of 
teachers are, therefore, to be taken with caution. They usually 
assert that the scholar was formerly excellent but that he has 
deteriorated owing to attending to hobbies and other interests. 
(4) The boy produces work of great intensity in some one-sided pro- 
vince, that is to say, in subjects and matters oriented about 
some special tendency. 
(5) Definite traces of creative activity, ic. inventive or independent 
work, such as collections, compositions, physical or chemical 
experiments. 
(6) He is frequently able to inspire his fellows of like age to similar 
activities, in which he acts as leader. 
(7) He succeeds in all manner of ways in obtaining books with which 
isfy his thirst for knowledge. 
(8) The chance and possibility of working freely in his chosen province 
appears to him the highest possible happiness, and he especially 
prefers it to any other path leading to gain or distinction. 
(9) His companions of like age bear towards him feelings of mixed 
ridicule and respect. Which of these two is the greater depends 
much on his disposition, and probably upon the kind of home 
he comes from.

or self-centred, deliberate or impulsive, concentrated or 
diffuse, rapid or slow, dynamic or static. Finally, in recent 
years attempts have been made to measure will and tem- 
perament by short tests, as intelligence is measured. This 
side of human personality would seem a priori to be even 
more difficult to estimate in an hour than is the intellect. 
On the other hand, the attempt is very often made to do 
so in interviews, as when candidates for scholarships, or 
for posts in a business, are sized up by the interviewer 
according to their general manner of answering questions : 
and the tests may be looked upon as standardized interviews. 
The best known and one of the first, if not the very first, 
is the Downey Will-Temperament Test. In it suggestion 
seems to play a not inconsiderable part ; and, indeed, self- 
confidence and resistance to suggestion is an important part 
of character. For example, early in the test period (in the 
group form of the test) ten words are read from an oblong 
white card by the examiner, twice over. Later, after several 
other tests have been carried out, the subject is asked to 
mark sixteen statements (which have reference to the words 
read, to the examiner’s position while reading them, etc.) 
as true or false, and to underline doubly the response if it 
is made with conviction and certainty. The scoring here 
depends on the number of replies thus made confidently 
and marked as certain. Now the sixteen statements (state- 
ments such as : “ The first word was book ” ; ‘‘ The shortest 
word was ice”; “In myright hand I held a pencil ”’) are, 
as a matter of fact, all true. But, as a test of compliance, 
the pupil is next told that eight were true and eight false, 
and invited to reconsider his verdicts; the scoring here 
depending on the extent to which he resists this suggestion. 
This kind of test may seem rather unfair. But whatever 
it may be as a test of the individual subject, it is instructive 
as showing to what an extent suggestion, when made by a 
person occupying a position of prestige, can succeed in 
obtaining responses clean against the facts. For though 
238 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
we recognize the suggestio falsi when it concerns a neutral 
matter like the shape of a card, do we always do so when 
it concerns the form of an opinion, political, religious, or 
esthetic? In this realm of testing suggestibility Binet 
was again an early pioneer, and one of his experiments is 
very instructive to the teacher. A card was shown to each 
of a large number of children who were afterwards questioned 
as to the objects attached to the card. These included a 
button, a postage stamp, a small picture of a crowd outside 
some gates, etc. Before being questioned, the children 
were divided into three groups. To one group the questions 
were put in a perfectly straightforward non-suggestive way, 
as “ How was the button fastened to the card?” [Even 
this suggests that it was fastened.] To a second group 
a more suggestive form was used, viz.: “‘ The button was 
sewn on to the card by thread, was it not ? ” The third 
group was asked, ‘“‘ What was the colour of the thread by 
which the button was fastened to the card ?” 
Now the button was in fact glued on, and there was no 
thread there. The three sections of the class responded 
as might be expected, the last group being almost unanimous 
in accepting the suggestion that thread was used. The 
first lesson for the teacher is to beware lest his questions 
are worded so as to suggest too strongly one particular 
answer. The teacher is not entirely forbidden, as is the 
advocaie in a court of law, to ask suggestive questions. 
But he should know clearly that he is asking them and for 
what purpose, and on the whole he should avoid them, lest 
he deceive himself as to his pupil’s ability. 
But a still more important lesson to learn, one dealing 
not merely with teaching technique, but with fundamental 
principles, is that we may, all unconsciously, be assuming 
in our teaching that the button is sewn on, and be busying 
ourselves only with the colour of possibly non-existent 
thread. In matters of xsthetic taste, of religion, or of 
politics we are peculiarly liable to word all our teachings and 
234 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
  DIFFERENCES IN WILL AND TEMPERAMENT 
all our questions in such a way, and to be unable to put, 
either to our pupils or to ourselves, the direct question. 
In these matters, indeed, it takes a genius or a man of 
remarkable character to do so. 
* * * * 
We have seen, in Chapter XVI, how important the years 
of early infancy are, in the opinion of the Freudians, for the 
formation of character, in view of the repressions and 
sublimations of instincts which may then take place. 
Another school of psychologists, led by John B. Watson, 
sees the importance of these early years for other reasons, 
and attributes to chance actions of the environment in 
that period many deep-seated emotional reactions which 
profoundly modify the subsequent character. According 
to these workers, the original emotional reaction patterns 
are few, consisting probably only of fear, rage, and love : 
and the complexity of emotion and impulse in the adult 
is accounted for mainly by the “ conditioning ” of the simple 
reactions, that is their attachment by coincidence to some 
stimuli other than the natural and inborn stimulus. They 
suggest that “the early home life of the child furnishes a 
laboratory situation for establishing conditioned emotional 
Tesponses.” 
For example, fear reactions can be called out in the baby 
by sharp noises and by the sudden removal of support : 
and Watson and his co-workers doubt whether any other 
situation can produce fear, except by accidental association 
with one of these. Albert B., at nine months, had never 
been seen in a state of fear or rage, and practically never 
cried. He responded without fear, and mainly by “ manipu- 
lation,” i.e. playing with the object, to a live white rat, 
a rabbit, a dog, a monkey, masks with and without hair, 
cotton-wool, burning newspapers, etc. Then, however, 
arrangements were made to produce a loud sound (by 
striking a hammer on a suspended steel bar) at the moment 
235  
-P-A-G-E-234

INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
when his| hand just touched the white rat in reaching for it 
(at eleven months). Seven such joint stimulations, given 
two on one day and five more a week later, were sufficient 
to cause jthe baby to show pronounced fear reactions at the 
sight of the white rat. This fear also was shown when the 
rabbit, 4 dog, a sealskin coat, were shown, though he had 
previously played freely with these. This persisted for many 
weeks, with two or three “ freshenings ” by giving the sound 
with the|rat, or with the dog: and once the latter provided 
an unexpected bark which had the same effect. The experi- 
menters | conclude that such “conditioned” emotional 
responses “persist, although with a certain loss in the 
intensity of the reaction, for a longer period than one 
month ”| and state that their view is that they “ persist 
and modify personality throughout life.” Had Albert, 
who was|of an extremely phlegmatic type, been emotionally 
unstable) they believe that the results would have been much 
more marked. 
Both the Watsonians and the Freudians then attribute 
to the action of the environment a great deal of the formation 
of personality. In the Freudian theory, it is repression, 
mainly of the sex instinct, which is responsible. In Watson’s 
it is assogiation of fear (or rage or love) with situations other 
than the natural stimuli which plays the major part. In 
both, the home life of the first two years is all important. 
But both admit the influence of heredity (‘‘Albert was 
extremely phlegmatic”’). It is the form which hereditary 
forces e which is determined by the home, not the 
strength} There can be no doubt as to the substantial 
truth of this, even if we take leave to doubt whether it would     
   
  ith these trials has assured me of his conviction 
that this also could be done. All nurses and mothers act 
on the assumption that fear and love can be thus associated, 
and their failures as well as their successes show it. Differ-

ences, if not of temperament, at least of forms of reaction, 
may then be products of education as much as of inheritance, 
and if, as is hoped, positive constructive results can be 
obtained as definite as the undesirable reactions, we may 
yet have a definite technique for influencing character 
in infancy. At present we have only the belief that the tree 
grows as the twig is bent, and the general conviction that 
a placid, regular, lovable existence is best for baby’s 
character, without repressions due to adult anger or secrecy, 
and without fears caused by tales or threats.

from the |shelf that ‘“‘ best sermon ever preached,” and read 
it again.| But a secondary and very practical question 
may perhaps be discussed. To what extent do habits 
enforced by authority improve character ? Are such habits, 
enjoined |by rule and regulation, merely a Procrustean bed 
to which) character cannot be fitted except by amputation 
and rackings which kill the spirit 2? Or was Sadoleto right 
when he |said : 
True, habit impressed by careful government from without is 
not real virtue, but only the semblance and image of virtue; yet, 
as legend and story tell of Pygmalion’s statue of a woman, by the 
kindness of heaven, it comes about in the course of time that this 
image takes on the spirit and life of true virtue." 
The truth is that either of these things may happen. 
One school creates a living independent character, another 
produces only unwilling obedience to the letter of the law. 
There must be some difference in the nature of the authority 
which produces such different results. Two things are 
largely responsible for the deadening, antagonizing effect 
which authority sometimes produces. The one is having 
too many rules: the other is their arbitrary nature. 
It is a great mistake in school, or class, or community, 
to make any rules which can be done without. For whoever

PYGMALION OR PROCRUSTES ? 
makes a law creates a crime. Without china one cannot 
break crockery. Some laws, of course, need no making, they 
only need setting down exactly. Such are some of the ten 
commandments—perhaps all of them. But some other 
Tules are very obviously man-made, teacher-made. 
Any law creates a crime. An arbitrary law creates 
criminals. “If there was a special law enacted against 
red-haired men,” said Hugh Miller in his essay on The 
Crime Making Laws, “red-haired men would in a short 
time become exceedingly dangerous characters.” They 
would become a race of outlaws, their hands against all 
men. And since one might as well be hanged for a sheep 
as a lamb, they would probably commit numerous real 
crimes, and acquire a reputation which would be cited 
whenever anyone proposed to ameliorate the “red-hair 
laws.”” Now many school regulations are about as absurd 
as these, being directed against innate childish impulses 
hardly more preventable than red hair: and they have a 
similar effect. Before making a rule, therefore, the teacher 
should consider whether it is humanly possible for the healthy 
boy to keep it. He cannot, for example, sit still for hours. 
He cannot, as a young boy, keep from talking to others 
without unnatural repression. He cannot always remember 
to close the gate into the garden. 
In another way, too, a rule may create criminals, when 
insufficient steps are taken to enforce it, to detect infringe- 
ment, and to inflict punishment. For then the temptation 
to break the rule is too great, and a habit of breaking rules 
is being inculcated. Any authority making a rule which 
may be broken without much danger of discovery is faced 
with a dilemma. Either the law will be broken right and 
left, or a punishment must be inflicted on those who are 
caught sufficiently severe to outweigh the unpunished 
offences: and that would be too severe a punishment to 
receive the endorsement of public opinion. 
It is this endorsement of public opinion which is the 
239
-P-A-G-E-238
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
essential requisite. For then the law will certainly be 
policed, since the majority will be policemen, not to report 
to authority or to tell tales, but to punish by public dis- 
pleasure. And this endorsement of public opinion, or of 
school opinion, can only be obtained if the government 
gtows from within, instead of being enforced from without. 
Hence the feeling that systems of self-government are 
psychologically sound. They have been tried in many forms, 
some moderate, some extreme. The dominie who tries 
the more extreme forms is liable to be dismissed as at least 
unnecessary. Wiser is he who remembers that children 
walk before they run and guides their steps. Government 
by fellow-comrades has for half a century or more been 
the rule in the great English Public Schools, though there 
the prefects are chosen by a “tyrant,” the head. Self- 
government on an elective basis has been tried in “ Little 
Commonwealths,” and in “School Councils,” and the like. 
All are efforts to enlist public opinion on the side of the 
laws when made, as well as means of training pupils to 
fulfil the duties of citizens. 
Authority has, however, ‘ways of moulding character 
other than the making of rules. Very potent weapons are 
the school assembly, traditional ceremonies, and the 
presentation of models to be imitated, of heroes to be 
worshipped. In the school assembly the members of the 
school feel themselves to be one body. When gathered 
together en masse children and adults alike are more open to 
suggestion, which seems to infect the less enthusiastic by 
contagion from the more easily influenced. The singing 
together of school songs, giving American college yells or 
just plain British hurrahs, answering in turn to a roll-call, 
tossing a pancake on Shrove Tuesday, or meeting a famous 
“old boy ” at the school gates, all these things help enor- 
mously in creating esprit de corps. They can be used just 
as well to inculcate narrow-minded class ideals as broad. 
Indeed, they probably have been used more often for the 
240  
-P-A-G-E-239
  
PYGMALION OR PROCRUSTES ? 
former than for the latter purpose. They are not only in 
that case regrettable because the end is less desirable, but 
also because they are more liable to lead to that defect of 
character resulting in “going to the dogs.” For a man 
must be an officer andagentleman. Ifheis only agentleman 
because he is an officer—if his keeping to the right path 
of conduct is only motivated by the wish for the approval of 
a narrow class of comrades, and is defined by an unbreakable 
code of convention which is accepted without fundamental 
understanding—then should that code be broken, that 
approval lost, no anchor remains. Whereas, if in addition 
there is a wider sense of right and wrong there is no escape 
from self-condemnation, nor need to give up self-respect 
even if one be ostracized. 
The path to that higher type of character, however, 
probably lies through the lower. The unselfish motives 
began no doubt when co-operation came into play in the 
evolutionary process, in addition to competition. Sometimes 
the importance of competition in Darwinian and allied 
theories makes one forget the equal importance of co-opera- 
tion. In any multicellular animal, co-operation has largely 
taken the place of competition as between the cells of the 
body. The right hand does not compete in cut-throat 
fashion with the left. And then in the family, the tribe, 
the nation, co-operation finds further scope. It is, no doubt, 
co-operation in order that the body corporate may compete 
the more successfully with others. But still, co-operation 
it is, calling for unselfish sacrifice in place of selfish striving. 
So the road to unselfishness seems to be through the herd 
instinct, esprit de corps, team games. The only danger 
is stopping too short. Everyone stops somewhere. The 
great distinguishing feature of Christianity was the height 
to which it rose in this respect, far beyond the level of 
paganism. 
And though the ascent seems to have been from the 
instincts which centre round the ego, up to those which find 
241 Q  
-P-A-G-E-240
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
their function in the herd, yet strangely enough the energy 
seems to come finally from the former. For it is in a self- 
respect which does not permit of selfishness that the best 
character appears to find its strength. 
* * * * 
One of the greatest dangers of failure in character training — 
arises from the assumption that teaching ideas will lead to 
actions. Ideas, of course, have an influence on actions ; 
but when they come into conflict with habit impressed 
by past activity, or with sentiments based on instincts and 
emotions, they lose the battle. The saying that there is 
no impression without expression is true in the intellectual 
sphere, but doubly true in the moral. For teaching moral 
ideas without causing them to emerge at once into action 
is not merely failing to produce that action ; it is encouraging 
a habit of dwelling on moral ideas without acting on them. 
These are the good resolutions which pave the road to Hell. 
Character training means, therefore, behaviour training, 
and the methods of controlling behaviour here are the same 
as the methods of controlling behaviour of the cognitive 
and manipulative kind. Situations must be planned which 
are likely to lead to the occurrence of the desired behaviour. 
When it occurs it should be “‘ rewarded.” When its opposite 
occurs it should be “ punished.” But not all punishments 
and rewards are equally efficacious, equally desirable, or 
equally free from unwanted by-products 
Under “rewards,” of course, we include not only actual 
tangible prizes, as money or books, not only visible privileges 
such as extra holiday or permission to have tea in one’s 
study, but also more subtle matters, as the approval, felt 
or expressed, of teacher, comrades, or one’s inner self. And 
a similar list may be made of punishments. It is because 
of this that the legal view of punishment, which Bentham 
clarified, is so inapplicable in education. Legally, a punish- 
ment is clearly inefficacious if it does not outweigh the 
242
-P-A-G-E-241
  
PYGMALION OR PROCRUSTES ? 
benefit gained by the crime. When this benefit and that 
punishment can be exactly measured, then such a principle 
is workable. Were the fine for stealing five pounds only 
four pounds and nothing else, the merry game of pilfering 
five-pound notes would go on faster and more furiously. 
But in school, and in large measure in the courts also, the 
punishment is less easily sized up, and the art of the trainer 
of boys lies partly in making the same punishment have 
greater effect, the same crime appear to bring less pleasure. 
Nevertheless, it is true that to “punish” too lightly is 
encouraging ‘“‘crime”’; yet as lightly as possible is best. 
The more important point about rewards and punishments 
is that they should be as inevitable as possible. They need 
not be of great magnitude, but they must be certain. It 
was in part this which Herbert Spencer emphasized in his 
book Education, when he urged that punishments should be 
“natural” : for Nature’s punishments are, he said, certain. 
Fire always burns. The only trouble about this is that it 
is not true. Certainly fire always burns, but a draught 
does not always give me a cold, nor mince pie indigestion. 
No doubt other circumstances explain these inconsistencies, 
but to the onlooker many of Mother Nature’s rewards and 
punishments appear just as erratic as those of the weakest 
of human mothers. However, it is still true that certainty 
is desirable. The other factor in Nature’s punishment 
which Spencer stressed was that of fitting the crime. And 
he urged that this should be so in the nursery and schoolroom 
too, that the punishment for leaving toys about should be 
the natural one of losing them (nurse having cleared them 
away), or the punishment for lateness in coming to school 
be the natural one of getting away late at the close. There 
is much truth in this, for such punishments tend to sidetrack 
any resentment against a person. They are in some measure 
felt to be only natural. 
In this discussion of rewards and punishments there is 
not intended to be any suggestion that school discipline is 
243 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
only to be obtained by prizes and canings. On the contrary, 
the terms are merely used to cover all marks of approbation 
and all signs of disapproval. Whether we will or no, we 
do “reward” and “punish.” ‘‘The mother neglects her 
children when they are quiet, and plays with them when they 
ery,” says Thorndike ; “consequently there are many crying 
babies. The child is refused a favour when he asks once, but 
if he teases a score of times it is finally granted; conse- 
quently there are many teasing boys.” 
One of the most potent rewards, one of the most satisfying 
situations which exists for human adult or child, is the 
realization that one can do what one’s fellows can do. 
Imitation in the automatic narrow sense may be of rare 
occurrence in man, as some aver. But in a wider sense, 
as the habitual result of finding satisfaction in being like 
others, it is one of the commonest of human qualities. 
Children naughty at home become quiet, obedient, and 
cheerful at school, because it pleases them to be like others. 
A child who has found no pleasure in trying to read finds a 
pleasure in trying to do what his comrades can do. Clearly 
this kind of imitation easily shades off into emulation and 
competition. But it is desirable that its main strength 
should not go down this channel. There is another way in 
which the instinct can develop. Instead of the child’s 
impulse to be like his comrades growing into a wish to excel 
them, it may grow, if properly directed, into a wish to be 
like other and more ideal characters. Out of imitation may 
grow emulation, but also hero-worship. Very early the 
baby wants to play at doing what father and motherdo. For 
some years this occupation employs much of the child’s 
leisure time. The imitation becomes more fundamental 
and less superficial Knowledge of the details and the 
meaning of the parents’ occupation grows, and the imitation 
grows paripassu. It extends to comprise imitation of many 
other adults, the milkman, the policeman, the blacksmith. 
The manipulative instinct joins forces and helps to develop 
244
-P-A-G-E-243
PYGMALION OR PROCRUSTES ? 
the imitation of the other occupations, leads to making a 
sawmill, or a derrick, ora fireengine. The love of adventure 
leads the imitation into paths peopled by soldiers and 
sailors, cowboys and Indians, Vikings and Cavaliers. Heroes 
are chosen and abandoned. Everything depends on just 
which heroes come to have a prolonged influence. For 
the imitation will extend to matters other than those which 
are the primary source of attraction, and it is in this way 
that a shifting of the focus of imitation sets in which may lead 
either upward or downward. The boy imitates, is attracted 
by “ Single-Shot Sam ” because of his thrilling adventures, 
his bravery, his personal prowess. But he also imitates his 
bad language, his disdain of the law, his cruelty. Luckily, 
there are heroes of fiction in boys’ stories who are more 
desirable characters, though it is, apparently, hard to keep 
them equally interesting. But several writers of a generation 
ago did so with success ; and, on a very high plane of litera- 
ture, Kipling does so now, and others with him. Boys’ 
characters are more moulded by what they read, I believe, 
than is commonly realized. 
It comes all to this, that the hammer of Procrustes is the 
tule or law arbitrarily enforced, and grudgingly obeyed ; 
while the chisel of Pygmalion is the tone set by the school 
as a community, the unwritten law enshrined in custom 
and tradition. As ever, direct suggestion is likely to fail, 
suggestion believed to come from within likely to succeed. 
Not without a bearing on character training is the question, 
to what extent education is a preparation for the future, to 
what extent it is for the present. One type of schooling 
looks upon childhood as entirely a period of preparation for 
manhood. Sometimes it is preparation for the cultured 
leisure, sometimes for the business or vocation, sometimes 
just for the snobbishness, of later life. In its noblest form 
it is preparation for the trials and moral struggles of this 
world, into which the pupil at adolescence is to be thrown. 
Many of these are right and proper aims of education. But 
245  
-P-A-G-E-244
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
if they loom too large they tend to make school gloomy 
and distasteful, and divorced from the proper interests of 
childhood. At the other extreme is that education which 
says to the children, ‘ Eat, drink, and be merry, for to- 
morrow you grow up,” that education which lays itself out 
to give the children just what they are interested in now, 
and knows no drudgery, no monotony. 
With little children, life must be lived in the present. 
Things which are in themselves immediately interesting 
alone hold their attention. But as they grow older, there 
must be training in forethought. They have to learn to 
do things which at the moment are in themselves distasteful 
in order that some goal may be attained. And so more and 
more the subjects attacked are, as the first novelty wears 
off, means to some end. But when habits of regular work 
and study have carried on the machine over the next stretch 
of the road, the reward comes in a quickening of interest in 
the study for its own sake. In this sense, too, it may 
come about that the image takes on spirit and life, and the 
student becomes wedded to studies which were undertaken 
merely to pass an examination.

CHAPTER XXIV 
BACK TO THE LEARNING PROCESS 
THE BEST METHODS OF MEMORIZING AND 
or Acquiring SKILL. 
Ir we wish to memorize anything (as a poem, a formula, 
a list of dates, an argument), or if we wish our pupils to do 
so, the most important points are to see that it is understood, 
that a need for it is felt, that it is attended to intently, 
that it is attended to as a whole as well as in parts, that 
several senses are brought to bear on it so as to reinforce 
one another, that the time devoted to the necessary repetition 
is scientifically distributed, that the repetition does not lapse 
into passive repetition but involves active recall, and that 
the material when learnt is not only integrated within itself, 
but is linked up with the other knowledge possessed by the 
mind. 
The influence of the understanding on the memory can 
be shown very readily by attempting to learn by heart a 
set of nonsense syllables, and comparing the difficulty of 
doing so with the comparative ease with which an equal 
number of syllables, forming a paragraph of connected prose 
can be learnt. There are, of course, some matters which 
have to be learned by heart which are quite arbitrary, and 
are not, in any ordinary sense, understandable, such as the 
fact that the port light of a ship is red, or that “address ” has 
only one “d”’ in the French language, or that in measuring 
angles, the positive direction is counter-clockwise. Such 
things, however, are either unimportant, or, if they play an 
important part in our lives, we grow into their usage by 
247 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
frequent repetition without conscious memorizing. They 
are the cases when, at need, a mnemonic may be excusable, 
as when a landsman remembers that the port light is port 
wine coloured, or when we say “ Thirty days hath September, 
April, June, and November.” 
Whenever possible, however, pupils should be discouraged 
from memorizing by means of such tricks, or by means of 
sheer repetition, and encouraged to remember by under- 
standing. Having children understand and be interested 
is of far greater importance psychologically than any of 
the other facts about economical learning which experiment 
has given us. For example, it is better that they should 
rather slowly reconstruct a required formula than that 
they should learn it so as to reproduce it quickly by heart. 
This is one of the ways in which examinations encourage 
bad teaching; for it pays a teacher to make his pupils 
learn formule by heart, whereas it would be far better for 
their mental development if they relied entirely on under- 
standing them. True, by making them memorize, teachers 
can get some pupils through an examination who would 
never pass on the other method. But they never should 
pass, they ought to be doing something else. 
It should not on the other hand be assumed that a formula, 
or any piece of mental apparatus, should necessarily be 
completely understood before it is used. Use leads to under- 
standing, if there is from time to time a conscious effort to 
understand, and use will lead to memorizing. It is only 
conscious learning of stuff which is unappreciated that is 
reprehensible. Examples should be worked from first 
principles rather than from rules. 
Understanding will go a long way even with historical 
dates. At least it prevents a child from dating Sir Walter 
Raleigh before the voyage of Columbus. Sheer memorizing 
of dates can be done before the age of eleven : but the experi- 
ments of Sturt and Oakley have shown that the development 
of an understanding time-sense is not to be expected much 
248  
-P-A-G-E-247
  
  BACK TO THE LEARNING PROCESS 
before that age, so that a mere date to a boy of mental age 
nine is almost nothing. 
Material will not be learned by heart unless there is a 
felt need for its memorizing—at least, not easily. This 
is the interest doctrine in another form. A boy will rapidly 
learn a formula if it enables him to do something he wants 
to do, such as make a propeller for his model aeroplane, or 
tune his radio set. He will learn poetry more willingly if 
he wants to take part in the fifth-form play than if he is 
merely required to learn it asa task. It is hard for a teacher 
to discover real needs which will, in a boy, lead to a demand 
for all the mathematics, or for the classical languages, or 
any of the school subjects. But by using the pupil’s manipu- 
lative instincts he can get a lot of mathematics and science 
out of needs connected with motor bicycles and similar toys ; 
and from the dramatic and adventure instincts a good deal 
of literature and language. 
In learning by heart, ten minutes’ really close attention is 
worth an hour’s slack repetition. As, in physical exercises, 
one can often see pupils languidly going through the motions, 
and others putting force and snap into them, so here in 
memorizing. Close attention is facilitated by putting on 
its outward bodily signs, the unwavering direction of the 
eyes, the characteristic muscular strain in the bodily attitude. 
But these things do not guarantee it. They may, indeed, 
become themselves the object of attention, as may often be 
seen in a class sitting in military stiffness. They may lead 
to just gazing at the material to be learned, whereas an atti- 
tude of inward questioning is wanted. Actual questioning 
of the class by the teacher, actual self-questioning by the 
student, helps. Various aspects of the things studied have 
to be sought for. In a poem, the alliteration in this line, 
the visual picture called up by that phrase, the frequency of 
long vowels in a certain verse, all help, if noted consciously, 
to assist recall. 
The experimental work on memorizing which is best 
249
-P-A-G-E-248
  
INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
known, and has been most often repeated with consistent 
results, is probably that which contrasts the ‘“ whole ” 
method of learning with the “part” method. By the 
“whole ” method of learning a poem, is meant the plan of 
saying the whole poem through and through, over and over 
again, whereas in the more usual “ part ” method it is learned 
a verse at a time or a few lines at a time : even one line at a 
time perhaps, with little children. Experiment has almost 
invariably shown the former method to be from 10 to 30 
per cent. better than the latter. The poem is learned more 
quickly and is retained more completely. 
Obviously, there must be a limit to the length of the poem 
thus to be learnt as a whole. If the principle were being 
applied to school work, the poem would presumably be such 
as could be learned by the “‘ whole ” method in a reasonable 
time, say half a term. 
But there are difficulties in the way. In the experiments 
which have demonstrated the superiority of the “whole ” 
method, the subjects have taken special pains to work 
as hard when using the one plan as when using the other. 
When this is so, then the superiority of the “‘ whole ” method 
can show itself: a superiority which lies in the fact that no 
unnecessary associations are practised (such as occur, in 
the “part ” method, between the last word of a verse and 
the first word of the same verse, when it is said over and 
over). 
But with children the case is different. By the “part” 
method they know at what rate they are making progress, 
and gain confidence. The teacher, too, can test a pupil 
to see how many lines he knows, but cannot easily test him 
to see how far he has advanced in the ‘‘ whole ” method. 
And so the learner is apt to lose heart. He cannot believe 
that presently the whole poem will rise above the threshold 
of his memory, somewhat as the one-horse shay disappeared 
all at once. So all one can assert is, that provided confidence 
and a sense of progress can be sustained, it is better to 
250
-P-A-G-E-249
  
BACK TO THE LEARNING PROCESS 
learn as large portions of a poem as possible and avoid 
snippets. 
There is one special case of learning where the “ whole ” 
method is quite inapplicable, that is in cases where the 
material does not really constitute a whole, a unit, but is 
essentially a collection of separate associations. Thus in 
the seven times multiplation table the final aim is not to 
know it in serial order, though that order may be convenient 
for building it up and for understanding it, but to know 
7 X 6 (say) when standing along by itself, plucked out of 
that order. While, therefore, the serial order will be used in 
the stage when the whole table is being built up by the 
repeated addition of seven, presently what is wanted is 
practice in random order, not in serial order, to avoid the 
weakness of having to say the whole table through up to that 
point in order to remember 7 x 6. To assist in this, a useful 
device is to print the items of the table on separate cards, 
which can then be shuffled like playing cards before being 
shown, one by one, to the pupil who is required to give the 
answer to each item, as 7 X 3, 7 x 8, etc. Ifa pupil ora 
class shows special weakness in one item, say in 7 x 6, then 
it is easy to add a duplicate or triplicate of that card to the 
pack and thus obtain additional practice in the weak asso- 
ciation. 
For most individuals, it is an aid to memorizing if several 
senses are used. Then the one may come to the assistance 
of the other when recall is attempted, as when we write a 
word to see what it looks like, when we are not sure of the 
spelling. A little child, taught its letters by the Montessori 
plan, where they are formed of sandpaper and are traced 
over by the finger, will sometimes be unable to recognize 
a letter by sight alone, but will do soifitis traced. Students 
who find it difficult to recall the substance of a lecture find it 
1 One of the things which struck me in the schools of New York City 
was the greater amount of drill work, in which such “ flash cards” play 
@ constant part. 
251 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
helpful to say some of the lecturer’s sentences to themselves, 
or to see in the mind’s eye headings and chief points, as the 
lecture progresses. Largely, no doubt, this is because of the 
direction of attention thus introduced, but partly because 
not everything is left to hearing. And just as a good teacher 
puts headings and unfamiliar words on the blackboard, so 
the student, teaching himself, writes these down and looks 
them carefully over. 
The distribution of time in learning is definitely of great 
importance. Suppose that only one hour can be devoted to 
learning securely a poem, and suppose that it can be just 
repeated without error after fifteen minutes’ practice. There 
remain 45 minutes in which to deepen the impression by 
further repetition, so that the poem will be known not barely 
but confidently. In such a case it is the poorest economy 
to use the remaining time at once. Far better is it to post- 
pone further practice till next day, and to use the time in 
short practices on successive days, stopping on each occasion 
shortly after the poem has been brought up to the point 
where it can just besaid. The main reason for the superiority 
of this over the solid hour is that one gains a knowledge 
each day of which parts of the poem are most liable to be 
forgotten, and directs special attention to these weak spots, 
not so much by separate repetition as by closer scrutiny. 
It is desirable, when repeating a poem in order to memorize 
it, to try as soon as possible to look away from the book. 
The active effort to recall the lines is more effective than 
merely repeating them passively. In the same way, when 
next day certain parts cannot at first be recalled, it is 
inadvisable to fly at once to the book. A little patience 
often leads to the restoration of the missing words or phrases, 
and they are then much more firmly fixed than would have 
been the case had they been taken again from the text. 
It is astonishing how a verse of which at first only fragments 
can be remembered will come to mind in the course of an 
hour, if it is reverted to again and again in the intervals 
252
-P-A-G-E-251
BACK TO THE LEARNING PROCESS 
of some other work. Probably one of the reasons why some 
students learn so much better than do others, is that they 
utilize odd moments in the day to recall pieces of knowledge, 
and each such recall serves as several repetitions. When a 
piece of knowledge acquired in a certain classroom and in 
a given subject is only recalled under exactly the same 
circumstances, it cannot be said to be available for use. 
Whereas if it is required or revived against other backgrounds 
it gains an independent strength, another reason for the 
correlation of studies and the avoidance of bulkheads 
between subjects. 
People sometimes acquire the unfortunate habit of 
believing that they have bad memories, a belief which is 
usually unjustified. It is true that our brain substance 
probably does differ from one individual to another in that 
quality which corresponds to memory. There age probably 
these vital and inherited differences in memory just as there 
are differences in the durability of paths through different 
forests. A path made through one forest will last for 
years, through another it will be overgrown again in a week. 
Through one kind of vegetation paths are made only with 
immense difficulty, through another with the greatest ease. 
But the condition of the path system of a forest, though it 
depends somewhat on these differences, depends far more 
on the interest which men have in traversing it, and the 
frequency with which they do so. In the same way a 
man’s memory in a given province will depend far more upon 
interest and frequent recall than upon the quality of inherited 
memory. A boy knows his favourite cricket team’s per- 
formances by heart because he is interested in them and 
is always running over them. Powerful instincts of com- 
petition, possession, and pride in personal prowess cause 
the interest. If equally powerful interests could be enlisted 
in the subjects of classics or chemistry, he would remember 
the oxides of nitrogen or the tenses of seqguor just as well as 
he remembers sporting records. It is probably curiosity 
258 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
and wonder which are at the root of most success in studies, 
and so again we come back to the instincts. ‘‘ The most 
vital factor is curiosity,” says Dewey in How We Think. 
“ Desire and curiosity are the two eyes through which he 
sees the world in the most enchanted colours,” says R. L. 8. 
in El Dorado. And so a teacher’s task in ‘“‘ making children 
learn ” is largely the job of arousing their curiosity in the 
lesson and obtaining keen attention. 
s * * * 
Acquiring skill and dexterity is very like memorizing in 
some respects. Indeed, for the Behaviourists, even thinking 
is only a language habit. Many of the ways in which 
memorizing can be facilitated are also applicable to skill. 
The best distribution of practice has been studied in learning 
to typewrite, to juggle with balls, etc., and has been found 
to follow the principles laid down above. The felt need, 
careful attention, and active effort are as important here 
as there. The “whole” method has, however, been, 
questioned in this province by one experimenter 1 who caused 
his subjects to trace by touch alone miniature mazes of 
grooves, with many blind alleys. The mazes could be 
learned in parts, and though the “whole” method was 
superior to a “ part ” method in which no attempt was made 
to put the parts together till each had been learned 
separately, yet a modified “‘ part” method was still more 
superior, in which first a was learned, then ab, then abc, 
and so on. 
Two new points attract attention in a survey of the 
literature of acquiring skill. One is the existence of plateaux 
on curves of learning, the other the much greater permanence 
of skill over knowledge. Once a man has learned to swim, 
to skate, to cycle, he possesses the art for life. He may 
feel a trifle clumsy for a few minutes when he has not skated 
for ten years, but there is no question of beginning to learn 
1 Pechstein, Journ. of Educ. Psychol., 1917, viii, 303. 
254
-P-A-G-E-253
    
BACK TO THE LEARNING PROCESS 
again. Very little practice brings him quickly to his former 
skill, and beyond. Most probably this is because the neurone 
connections involved are on a comparatively low level, 
and not so far removed from instincts and reflexes as are 
those concerned in recalling a poem or a series of facts or 
an argument. Indeed, some of them, as those involved in 
swimming, were perchance once innate. 
Though less likely, it is, however, possible that the greater 
permanence of skill is due to the greater amount of over- 
learning. In a poem, a new verse is a new verse, and can 
be learned without deepening the memory of the earlier 
verses. A new part of a skilled action, however, usually 
demands for its practice or for its very existence that earlier 
and simpler movements be repeated and thereby made more 
certain. I cannot practise tossing three balls in the air 
without practising tossing up one ball. I cannot learn 
to rattle off -tion or -able on the typewriter without practising 
striking ¢ or a, or without practising moving the spacer or 
the line changer. And so certain fundamental motions 
get a tremendous amount of practice beyond their immediate 
needs, and may form the scaffolding which persists so 
obstinately in the face of neglect. 
“ Plateaux ” are flat places in the curve of improvement, 
periods during which little or no advance is made, though 
practice be continued with unflagging perseverance ; after 
which there is again improvement, as though paths in the 
brain were gradually perfected, and then suddenly thrown 
open: as though canals were being dug, into which after 
much weary spade work the water rushes and communi- 
cation is established. 
In part such plateaux may be due to the nature of the 
task, which requires in the first place certain simple acts 
which are learned rapidly, but then have to be practised a 
considerable time before the next stage of combining them 
into complex acts can be attacked. Thus in reading tele- 
graphic dots and dashes, the separate letters have to be 
255 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
mastered, then syllables and words come to be recognized 
as wholes, then phrases and sentences. There would 
thus be three curves of improvement, separated by plateaux, 
during which reorganization without advance went on. 
Instead, or in addition, it may be that plateaux are 
due to boredom, and then a sudden fresh access of energy 
and interest, due to a holiday, or a new aim, or a threat 
of dismissal, or realization that someone else is improving. 
All these things may occur unconsciously. When plateaux 
occur with pupils or with ourselves we should not be unduly 
disappointed nor give up heart. The teacher should try 
to call attention to the new problem, if the case is anything 
like the passing from words to phrases in telegraphy. A 
special effort should be made after a while to get the new 
rise in the curve to begin. 
Finaily, we should realize that many of us, and many 
of our pupils, are living contentedly on such plateaux, 
mere shelves in the upward sloping hill of progress, under 
the impression that we have reached the peak of our powers. 
It may not be worth while, but in almost any of our activities 
any one of us probably could, if he wished and gave thought 
and effort to it(ift himself on to a new upward curve and 
reach a higher level of skill. We have to choose, for time 
and energy would not permit each of us to be expert in 
everything. But in what we choose we could probably 
improve further and possibly attain a new permanent level 
from which we would not slip back. 
256

CHAPTER XXV 
THE WINGS OF THOUGHT 
In discussing the ascent in the animal scale from instinct 
to intelligence we have distinguished several levels which 
can be seen exemplified in different animals as their 
respective normal modes of reaction, or can be seen, each 
of them, in man, in his responses to various situations. 
There is first the automaton, unable to make any response 
except that which is fatally called out by the situation, 
as when “ the mole-cricket, which is in the habit of escaping 
pursuit by burrowing in the earth, makes violent motions 
with the forelegs, even if it be placed upon a plate of glass 
into which it could not possibly burrow.” 4 
Slightly above this level is the animal which, although 
it always makes response a to a given situation, will then 
proceed to make response } and c if a fails. Its inner 
“attitude ” changes with failure, though we do not know 
whether this attitude is a consciousness or not. Its 
responses, however, are always in a definite order a, 6, c, d. 
Considerably higher comes the animal whose responses 
to any situation which is at all novel are much less 
predictable ; the animal which, to escape from captivity 
or to reach food, will try, one after the other, a very large 
number of responses in what appears to be almost a random 
order, from which the reward of success selects one which, 
when the situation recurs, will be prepotent, and will occur 
sooner than otherwise, and ultimately will be the habitual 
response. So far these responses have all been actual pieces 
1 The Evolution Theory, August Weismann. Tra. J. A. Thomson, 1904. 
257 R 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
of explicit behaviour. But hereabouts certain substitutes 
for overt muscular behaviour begin to show themselves. 
Actions are imagined instead of being actually carried out. 
These substitutes are (probably) first images which not 
ouly stand for the actual objects and the actual actions, 
but look and feel like them, albeit less vividly. Later, 
pieces and fragments of these images come to stand as 
symbols for the actual behaviour, and last of all come pure 
symbols, such as are most words, which do not in any 
way resemble the objects but mean them. 
In man, who has the power of using this last weapon 
in the armoury of response, one nevertheless sees all the 
‘other stages occurring. To more brilliant light he 
“responds,” quite unconsciously, by a contraction of the 
pupil of the eye. To an unexpected loud noise, as a pistol 
shot, he responds not quite so inevitably and certainly, 
though usually, with a start. To a situation such as a 
difficult puzzle he responds by a number of almost random 
actions and manipulations. To some situations he responds 
largely by images, as, when climbing a mountain, he hesitates 
before tackling a difficult bit. Finally, he often responds, 
in addition, by thought in terms of inner speech, as when 
he sits meditating on some problem of policy of a more 
abstract kind, say on how he should vote in an election. 
To some extent these stages are passed through with 
advancing years. ‘“‘We grown people can tell ourselves 
a story, give and take strokes until the bucklers ring, 
ride far and fast, marry, fall, and die ; all the while sitting 
quietly by the fire or lying prone in bed. This is exactly 
what a child cannot do, or does not do, at least, when he 
can find anything else. He works all with lay figures and 
stage properties,” says Stevenson. And largely it is true 
that the more abstract substitutes come later. 
With the growth of symbolic response there comes the 
possibility of responding to very abstract elements in 
situation, the power of seeing the qualities and properti 
258
-P-A-G-E-257
  
  THE WINGS OF THOUGHT 
of objects, and discussing them apart from the things, the 
power of formulating general laws by observation of many 
situations, and of applying these general laws to other 
situations to assist in deciding upon the proper response. 
The stage of reasoning proper has then been reached. For 
the teacher, two things about reasoning seem to me of 
prime importance. The first is that the traditional division 
of reasoning into inductive and deductive reasoning is 
dangerous in the classroom, because real thought must 
necessarily use both intermingled. We can no more think 
inductively, or think deductively, than a bird can fly with 
one wing, or a man breathe only by inhaling. The second 
is that the ordinary processes of reasoning, either inductive 
or deductive, are comparatively easy matters to grasp, and 
are commonly used correctly by all but the least: intelligent. 
It is rather the degree of abstraction and complexity in what 
is reasoned about which makes reasoning more or less difficult, 
and the care with which its results are tried and verified 
which makes it accurate. ‘‘ The inductive method has 
been practised ever since the beginning of the world by 
every human being,” says Macaulay writing on Bacon. 
“Tt is constantly practised by the most ignorant clown, 
by the most thoughtless schoolboy, by the very child at 
the breast.”” The teacher’s task is not so much to get his 
pupil to make inductions, it is rather to get them to do so, 
in Macaulay’s words, “with patience, attention, sagacity 
and judgment”: and also to lead them to apply their 
powers to more abstract matters than they would commonly 
choose as subjects for their exercise. This is again a matter 
of interest: and given an interest in the subject, children 
are not likely to make errors in deductive reasoning either, 
though falle<ies here are more common. 
It is ia the teaching of science that the alternation of 
inaction and deduction is best seen. All thinking involves 
the examination of data, the recognition of a problem to be 
solved, the tentative formation of a hypothesis, its applica- 
259 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
tion to the already known data to see if it is consistent 
with present facts, and its employment to predict new facts 
which are then searched for and, if found, held to be very 
strong evidence of the correctness of the hypothesis. I 
believe this outline to be true of all thought, both deductive 
and inductive, but it is more obviously applicable to what 
is commonly called induction, so let us begin with that side 
of teaching. In Chapter XV a lesson on the common 
pendulum was introduced as an illustration. Let us now 
trace the details of such a lesson, considered as an exercise 
in thinking. The problem, which we may suppose had 
arisen in connection with inaccuracy in the school clock, 
is to find how the rate of oscillation of a pendulum depends 
upon itslength. Simple experiments show that it is constant 
for constant length (with small oscillations) and that the 
tate increases, the pendulum swings more quickly, as it is 
made shorter. The obvious next step is to measure the 
length and the time of swing and put them down in black 
and white for a number of cases. When this has been done 
older pupils of college standing might find the square root 
connection, or those of higher intelligence might find it, 
with no more help. But with younger pupils the course of 
events has to be stage-managed by thé teacher if the class 
is to have any chance of success. The proper time at which 
to introduce any problem to a class is when their habits 
of methodical thinking and experiment have reached 
_ such a development that not too much “ stage-managing ” 
is needed. In the present case a little change in the form of 
the problem at a certain moment makes all the difference. 
Suppose we start with a yard-long pendulum and see ho 
often it swings through the position of rest in one minute, 
and say that it is found to do so 58 times. Then the nex 
question may be worded in two ways, either 
(a) How many times would a 2-yard pendulum swing in 
minute ? or 
(6) How long would a 2-yard pendulum take to swing 58 times ? 
260
-P-A-G-E-259
  
THE WINGS OF THOUGHT 
The second form is much easier from the point of view of 
ascertaining the law, especially if the instruction is added : 
“* Express your result in minutes and decimals of a minute.” 
‘Suppose, however, this last advice is not given. The tabu- 
lation of the work done is as follows : 
Length of Pendulum. Time to Swing 58 Times. 
| 1 yard 1 minute 
2 yards ? 
How long will the 2-yard pendulum take? The proper 
‘scientific attitude is to hold judgment in suspense. But it 
is equally a proper scientific attitude to try to form a working 
hypothesis. “I wonder if twice as long in yards will mean 
twice as long in minutes ” is a germ of a hypothesis. Already 
a tentative generalization has been made (during what would 
ordinarily be called the “ presentation”), and we really 
proceed to an application or trial of it when we time our 
2-yard pendulum over 58 swings. It takes 1 minute 25 
seconds! So our hypothesis was false. However, let us 
go on to try a 3-yard pendulum : 
Length of Pendulum. Time to Swing 58 Times. 
1 yard 1 minute 
2 yards 1 minute 25 seconds 
3 yards ? 
Commonly when I have asked a class at this stage how long 
they think the 3-yard pendulum will take, someone has 
suggested 1 minute 50 seconds, a number based on a 
generalization that for each yard added to the pendulum 
25 seconds will be added to the time. Letustry. It takes 
1 minute 44 seconds! So this theory is also wrong, it would 
seem. A state of mind rather like that of a pupil of Socrates 
after a course of his famous questions is apt to ensue. But 
in many pupils there is distinctly present a realization of 
the fact that time is not increasing at the same speed as 
the length. A guess for 4 yards which I have frequently 
had presented to me is 1 minute 57 seconds. This is based 
on the idea that since the steps in time are getting shorter 
261 
   
-P-A-G-E-260
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
their decrease may be constant. 25 seconds was the first 
step, 19 seconds the next step (6 less): so this will be 13 
seconds. 
Length of Pendulum, Time to Swing 58 Times. 
1 yard 1 minute 
2 yards 1 minute 25 seconds 
3 yards 1 minute 44 seconds 
4 yards ? 
On trial the time is found to be not far from that predicted, 
and possibly three or four trials will be needed to make 
certain that a discrepancy exists. It takes almost exactly 
2 minutes.? 
Now note that instead of going through the formal steps 
of preparation, presentation, association, generalization, and 
verification once each,” we have already generalized three 
times and verified the fact that our generalization was wrong 
each time. All the while the “ presentation ”’ has gone on, 
the accumulation of data. (‘‘ Presentation” suggests 
too strongly that the pupil is a recipient, instead of partici- 
pator.) Instead of going through five regular steps, 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, to the solution of one question, we rather 
ascend a winding staircase in which the steps 3, 4, and 5 
keep recurring on higher and higher planes : 
1, 2, 3, 4, (5) 
3, 4, (5) 
3, 4, (5) 
the (5) representing the fifth step resulting in disappointment. 
How many times had Archimedes gone round that circle 
before he ultimately could cry Eureka ? 
I have only occasionally got the actual solution of the 
pendulum problem from unaided pupils. But I have got 
1 Nots.—A 4-yard pendulum is too long to get into most classrooms, 
and even if a thread can be got round a hook on the ceiling, a very heavy 
bob is needed to keep it going long enough. Yards are better to talk 
about; but I have used a 2-foot measuring rule often as unit. Feet 
are too short for demonstration.

it from pupils to whom I suggested putting the times into 
minutes and decimals 
l yard 1 minute 
2 yards 1-42 minute 
3 yards 1-73 minute 
4 yards 2. minutes 
and who then recognized the square roots. Now in each 
application of a tentative hypothesis to a new length of 
pendulum we have an example of deductive thought, 
inasmuch as a general law is applied to a specific case. 
In crudely syllogistic form the reasoning runs, “ the time is 
the square root of the length, the length is 5 yards, therefore 
the time will be 1/6 minutes.” Or more formally, “ all 
pendula obey this law, this is a pendulum, therefore it 
will obey this law.” But this is a very primitive form of 
deduction, and induction has undoubtedly played the major 
part in the lesson. A law obtained in this way, by repeated 
guesses which are verified by trial, is called an empirical 
law, and does not satisfy the mind in the same way in which 
a law deduced from first principles satisfies it. Deductive 
thinking seems, therefore, at first sight to rise above the trial 
and error procedure which we have followed up from its 
lowest stage to the level of scientific induction. But we 
shall make the attempt presently to show that in deductive 
thought also there is a large element of groping, feeling 
along now this and now that path, and that the difference 
is not so striking as might at first appear. 
An empirical law is unsatisfying because of some inner 
wish to know “ why,” and because of the fear that, in the 
absence of a rational foundation, the law may be found to 
be only an approximation. Sometimes empirical laws will 
carry one as far as experiment will at the time reach, and yet 
break down when further testing is possible. For example, 
in the above pendulum lesson, I have had the hypothesis 
put forward that the second order differences are being 
halved each time, as shown on page 264. The pre- 
; 268
-P-A-G-E-262

diction for 6 yards based on this would be that the next 
second order difference would be 14 seconds, the next 
increase therefore 14} seconds, and the next time therefore 
1344 seconds, which would agree with any measurements 
the class could make. Yet further experiment would show 
the incompleteness of the law suggested. 
We have the wish, therefore, to “prove” the formula, 
as we say, after we have arrived at it: that is, to show by 
deductive thinking, of a higher level than the mere applica- 
tion of a general law to an obvious instance, that the formula 
is already contained in those simple intuitive generalizations 
to which we give our assent without question, such as that 
things equal to the same thing are equal to one another. 
This proof, in the case of the pendulum law, contains, how-

ever, too much mathematical reasoning to be suitable for 
illustration here. 
In similar fashion, when a class has learned by many 
trials that the three angles of a triangle equal two right angles, 
they can presently be led to see that this must be so from 
simpler facts, for instance, from the two facts (1) that if we 
walk right round a triangle we must have turned through 
four right angles, and (2) that at each corner an external 
and internal angle total two right angles, making six right 
angles in all. Those four right angles subtracted from these 
six leave the two right angles inside. 
In realms other than the mathematical it is not always 
easy to see the way in which a deduction of a general law from 
first principles can follow its discovery by an inductive leap. 
264
-P-A-G-E-263
  
  THE WINGS OF THOUGHT 
But in intelligent pupils there is always a satisfaction in 
making a deduction which is at any rate plausible even if 
not certain, a rationalization, in fact. Indeed, it is doubtful 
whether a true inductive leap is ever made without some 
feeling in the thinker’s mind of a “‘ reason ”’ for the general- 
ization, a reason deduced from principles, not formed by 
induction from data. Even the theologian who called 
attention to the beneficence of Providence in placing large 
rivers near so many towns was giving a reason for his 
observation. And it would be difficult for any observer to 
conclude from a number of examples that great towns 
often are situated at the junctions of rivers without an 
inkling of the mundane reason. 
Yet some generalizations remain on the empirical level. 
I am aware that p-f-b-—p often pass over into 
one another in that order as we go from a Latin word to its 
English equivalent, and that similar series are formed by 
t-th-d-t and c-h-g-c. If I were teaching 
_ that law, I would cause the pupils to collect instances which 
show it well, as 
pater father 
frater brother 
cornu horn 
pellis a fell or skin 
tres three 
duo two 
pedem foot 
dentem tooth 
and many more. But I do not know whether this law of 
Grimm has ever been deduced from more intuitive or more 
widely accepted laws of phonetics, so I must rest content 
with the induction. Yet, whenever I can doso, I want to 
arrive at the deductive proof. For example, I had occasion 
once to perform a long statistical calculation which frequently 
involved squaring numbers of the form 6}, 34, 83, etc. ; 
and it dawned upon me after a while that the square of such 
a number is rapidly obtained by multiplying the whole 
265   
 
-P-A-G-E-264
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
number by the number next above it and adding a quarter 
unit ; the square of 63 being thus 6 x 7 and a quarter, or 
42}. As soon as I realized this I had to stop work for a 
minute to think out (deductively) the truth of this law, 
which I had discovered inductively, by imaging a 64 square 
which I turned into a 6 x 7 oblong, with a little square—the 
ito spare. An empirical law is a provocation to the 
pupil to find the “reason ” and should be used as such by 
the teacher. Newton’s great law of gravity, an induction 
inasmuch as it is evolved from a mass of data, is as much 
deductive as inductive in its psychological nature, for the 
facts are complex, and the possibility of seeing that each 
case is an instance of the law depends upon ability to carry 
out a considerable flight of deductive, mathematical thinking. 
Darwin’s law of the origin of species was an induction, but 
most of his book is concerned with working out, deductively, 
the way in which it explains case after case. 
Wrong thinking in the classroom is not infrequently due 
to making the work too exclusively inductive or too 
exclusively deductive. A teacher causes a class to perform 
an experiment whereby they learn that iodine in contact 
with starch produces a blue stain. She then gives them 
leaves from which the green chlorophyll has been removed 
by alcohol, and invites them ‘to test them with iodine. The 
leaves turn blue, and without any further encouragement, the 
pupils agree that this proves the presence of starch. As an 
introduction to a homily on the crime of jumping too hastily 
to conclusions this would be all right. But young teachers 
have been known to agree with the children and say, ‘“‘ Yes, 
this proves the presence of starch in the leaf.” The fact that 
the conclusion is correct makes the bad reasoning all the 
more insidious. Apparently a syllogism is present in such 
a teacher’s mind after this fashion : 
Starch turns iodine blue. 
This leaf turns iodine blue. 
Therefore this leaf contains starch. 
266
-P-A-G-E-265
  THE WINGS OF THOUGHT 
Now this fallacious deduction is so because an induction 
is lacking, a set of experiments which would entitle us to 
change the first sentence into : 
- Only starch turns iodine blue. 
For instance, alcohol (in which the leaves have been recently 
steeped) might also turn iodine blue, or sugar might do so, 
or common salt. One might maliciously suggest a parallel 
experiment of stabbing a pig with a knife. The knife turns 
red. Evidently a good test for pigs. An animal in a poke, 
being then produced and stabbed, is shown to be a pig 
by the redness of the knife, though further investigation 
might let a cat out of the bag. 
If inductive and deductive thought interpenetrate as 
closely as is being suggested, and if it is agreed that inductive 
thought at least, as exemplified by the pendulum lesson, 
is largely a matter of trial and error, it may be worth 
investigation whether even deductive thought is not of the 
same nature. Take for instance any detective story. Does 
not the endeavour to deduce the explanation of the crime, 
and find the criminal, take the form of trials? Is it the new 
butler, or the mysterious stranger, or the bankrupt brother, 
who killed Mr. Smith? The reader may reply that it is 
only the clumsy policeman who thinks thus, whereas 
Sherlock Holmes “deduces”? the answer to the riddle. 
But is the process really different in his case, or is it 
that the rejection of these trial solutions is more rapid 
and certain ? 
Here is a reasoning problem used as a test by Mr. Burt. 
Is it not also solved by rejecting, after trial, the hours 
which do not fit the data ? 
John said: ‘“‘I heard my clock strike yesterday, ten minutes 
before the first gun was fired. I did not count the strokes, but 
I am sure it struck more than once, and I think it struck an odd 
number.” John was out all the morning, and his clock stopped 
at five minutes before five the same afternoon. When do you 
think the first gun was fired ? 
267  
-P-A-G-E-266
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
Or take a “rider” (a “deduction, ” an “ original”) in 
geometry. If it is just too hard for you to solve easily, 
do you not find yourself trying now this path and now that ? 
Or if it is so easy that you do it in a flash, try it on a less 
accomplished mathematician, and find that he makes false 
starts. Is it not probable that the only difference in your 
own thinking was that these false starts were more promptly, 
almost instantaneously, rejected ? That the reader may not 
lack a geometrical problem, here is one: A BCD isa 
parallelogram, E is the middle point of A D, and C E meets 
BDinF. Prove that the area of the triangle B C F is one- 
third of the area of the parallelogram. 
It is these false starts, of which thinking so largely consists, 
which give to any piece of written work the character of 
being thoughtful. It is the careful trial and rapid rejection 
of the alternatives which impresses the reader, who values 
the work the more highly, the more abbreviated these false 
starts are, provided their rejection is conclusive. Thinking 
over an essay which we are reading consists mainly in trying 
the paths which the writer has declared to be blind alleys, 
and in endeavouring to discover others. 
As a practical corollary to this point of view we can con- 
elude that it is very desirable to encourage children to make 
trials even should they prove to be false starts. The answers 
to deductive problems of any sort are not usually found as 
a mechanical result of logical procedure. They are selected 
from a number of possibilities which occur to one, selected 
because they fulfil the logical requirements. In algebra, it 
is true, there are rules guaranteed to give the solution of 
equations of given sorts: but the employment of these 
tules is not thinking, though the choice of the proper rule 
may be. And how often does one find a student unable 
to solve a certain equation because it is of a new form, 
when a little trial would easily find the answer and probably 
suggest a rule for new examples ? 
It is bad teaching, therefore, to discourage any ways of 
268
-P-A-G-E-267
  THE WINGS OF THOUGHT 
solving a problem which a child is willing to try. If persisted 
in, it results in inability to attack any problem fot which a 
tule is not known. The pupil should, however, be taught 
to put the trial to the test, and reject it for other means if 
it proves unsatisfactory. A common reason for failure is 
persistence in a certain unfruitful method of attack and 
reluctance to try new points of view. 
There are ways of eliminating errors which are of general 
use and which are worth encouragement. One such special 
form of trial is that which pushes right on to the end of the 
problem disregarding minor mistakes, disregarding quanti- 
tative inconsistencies, disregarding lack of knowledge as to 
just how a certain step can be performed, but assuming that 
it and the other steps have in fact been carried out and the 
goal attained, after which the steps are retraced and the 
difficulties attacked in reverse order. The “ hypothetical 
construction” in geometry is of this class. By pushing 
on to the complete solution, even though gaps remain in the 
chain of reasoning, a view of the whole is obtained which 
enables the gaps to be filled. 
The process is particularly clearly seen in quantitative 
details. Suppose, for instance, that I am desired to draw 
the figure known as the Walls of Troy. Even an adult, 
attempting to do this, is liable to leave insufficient room for 
some part of the figure. Either in the imagination, or 
actually with pencil on paper, he pushes on to the complete 
figure, and then, going back over it, he scales it and then 
redraws it correctly. He reduces his trials to one, and even 
that may be only an image. A similar process occurs when 
the child is asked to subtract 7 from 12, and says, “‘ Seven 
and what are twelve—seven and five are twelve.” The 
use of an x, or any symbol, which can be manipulated as 
though it were the thing it stands for, is similar in nature. 
A half-way step is to carry out the manipulation with some 
standard quantity, as when we are asked how much money 
will amount to 676 dollars in 5 years at 4 per cent. per 
269
-P-A-G-E-268
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
annum compound interest, and we find first what 100 dollars 
would amount to in that time. 
There is nothing in all this, except the degree of abstract- 
ness of the material, which differs from a practical workman’s 
behaviour in face of a concrete problem. The first boat 
which Robinson Crusoe constructed was a failure, just 
because he did not imagine it completed and picture to 
himself how he was going to get it into the water. You 
remember that, after spending many, many days in 
laboriously hollowing out a huge tree which he had felled, 
he found that he could not move it. He made actual 
attempts to do so with the aid of rollers, and other attempts 
to dig a canal to bring the water to the piragua, but gave 
them up. That was thinking of a primitive sort. More 
refined thinking operates with images and words instead of 
with rollers and: a heavy canoe, that is all. The naval 
architect, designing a new ship, makes his trials with sketches 
and formule before he makes them in the trial tank, or 
ultimately with the finished boat. 
A considerable part of our education consists in learning 
to recognize something general in a situation, and to reject 
in consequence a number of possibilities which are known 
to lead only to failure. ‘That “something general ” is then 
usually given a name. It need not be anything very difficult 
of recognition, it may only be recognizing that a triangle 
remains a triangle even if it is now long, now short, now 
scalene, now equilateral. With these concepts we learn 
to operate as we did with pieces of actual behaviour, and 
later with images; and with their aid many deductive 
problems are solved because they are seen to come under 
a higher concept. Children and students cannot be given 
these concepts ; they have to win them for themselves, but 
the teacher can plan situations where they are likely to be 
seen, and can consistently give his encouragement to their 
formation. 
Tn the inductive portions of a lesson, the great need is 
270
-P-A-G-E-269
  THE WINGS OF THOUGHT 
to encourage freedom of hypothesis making, accompanied 
by honest trial and rejection. The line between wild guessing 
on the part of the pupils, and legitimate hypothesis, is hard 
to draw, but so it is also in real scientific work. 
I should not be surprised (said A. S. Eddington after proposing 
@ hypothesis concerning the internal constitution of the stars), 
if it is whispered that this address has at times verged on being 
a little bit speculative ; perhaps some outspoken friend may bluntly 
say that it has been highly speculative from beginning to end. 
I wonder what is the touchstone by which we may test the legitimate 
development of acientific theory and reject the idly speculative. 
We all know of theories which the scientific mind instinctively 
rejects as fruitless guesses ; but it is difficult to specify their exact 
defect, or to supply a rule which will show us when we ourselves 
do err. It is often supposed that to speculate and to make hypo- 
theses is the same thing; but more often they are opposed. It is 
when we let our thoughts stray outside venerable, but sometimes 
insecure, hypotheses, that we are said to speculate. Hypothesis 
limits speculation. Moreover, distrust of speculation often covers 
loose thinking ; wild ideas take anchorage in our minds, and influence 
our outlook ; whilst it is considered too speculative to submit them 
to the scientific scrutiny which would reject them. 
If we are not content with the dull accumulation of experimental 
facts, if we make any deductions or generalizations, if we seek for 
any theory to guide us, some degree of speculation cannot be 
avoided. Some will prefer to take the interpretation which seems 
to be most immediately indicated, and at once adopt that as a 
working hypothesis ; others will rather seek to explore and classify 
the widest possibilities which are not definitely inconsistent with 
the facts. Either choice has its dangers; the first may be too 
narrow a view and lead progress into a cul-de-sac; the second 
amay be so broad that it is useless as a guide, and diverges indefinitely 
from experimental knowledge. When this last case happens, it 
must be concluded that the knowledge is pot yet ripe for theoretical 
treatment, and speculation is premature. The time when specu- 
lative theory and observational research may profitably go hand- 
in+hand is when the possibilities, or at any rate the probabilities, 
can be narrowed down by experiment, and the theory can indicate the 
teats by which the remaining wrong paths may be blocked up one 
by one. 
And in a passage later in the same address, Eddington 
urges us to be bold in making hypotheses, as both Icarus 
and Dedalus were bold in venturing to use wings: but 
271 
 
-P-A-G-E-270
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
then to soar like Icarus right up to the sun, to put our hypo- 
theses to the hardest tests, to strain them “ to the breaking 
point till the weak points gape,” and not fly safely like 
Dedalus through the middle air, and by excess of caution 
fail to bring their hidden weakness to light. 
The differences between aviators are largely tempera- 
mental, and so, too, the differences between makers of 
hypotheses are not entirely intellectual in origin. One 
man will be willing immediately to change his hypothesis _ 
as soon as contradictory instances are met, another will 
attempt far-fetched interpretation in order to smooth 
over the difficulty, another is unwilling to make any change 
in his pet theory, and shuts his eyes to the facts which do not 
fit in, and yet another is emotionally upset, and gives up the 
problem as a bad job. These types are well shown in an 
interesting experiment made by Mr. Zing Yang Kuo, in which 
English-speaking students were asked to memorize 88 
Chinese characters, although, unknown to them, it was not 
really their memory which was being tested, but their powers 
of inductive inference. For through groups of the Chinese 
characters there ran certain radicals, such as a roughly 
oblong character meaning mouth (not unlike part of the Red 
Dragon symbol on a Mah Jong tile), just as a general law can 
run through a number of special instances. Some of these 
characters containing the oblong mouth symbol might have 
other ideas in common, as to bark, to hoot, singing, which all 
include the idea of sound. But other instances showed that 
this was not the meaning of the oblong symbol, such as 
to bite, drinking, or saliva. The behaviour of his subjects 
towards these “negative instances,” as shown by their 
answers after the conclusion of the test, and by the type of 
mistake they made, led Kuo to formulate the above types 
of reaction to instances disagreeing with a theory. And 
we can, I think, see these types in everyday life.+

CHAPTER XXVI 
REVIEW 
Tue general idea which I have taken as my beacon in writing 
the previous chapters has been the way in which man’s mind 
has grown out of the animal mind. And in following this 
course I have, from time to time, gone about on two different 
tacks, not always heading directly towards the beacon, 
but always, I hope, nearing it; some chapters have dealt 
mainly with intelligence, and others mainly with character. 
Out of instinctive behaviour which at first is blind and 
automatic, grows the beginning of reason, as the reactions 
grow less inevitable, as the animal comes to have a repertory 
of responses which it tries over and over in solving a problem. 
Its “thinking” at this stage is active, actual behaviour. 
Evolution creates out of this animal, in turn, an animal 
which replaces some of the behaviour by substitutes which 
save time. Even our sense organs which act at a distance 
serve this purpose, so that we need not run our heads against 
a stone wall, it is sufficient toseeit. But imagery, born of 
such senses, in particular of the distant senses of sight and 
hearing, comes in as a more obvious substitute, and we stop 
when we see the stone wall merely in the mind’seye. Finally, 
symbols, unlike the actual behaviour, come to replace it still 
more subtly. Words, particularly, whose meanings have to 
be acquired and passed on by each generation, play an 
extraordinarily important part in reasoning, and bring 
with them the dangers of parrot learning as well as the powers 
of abstract thought. Especially has the attempt been made 
to see how far the idea of trial and error can carry us, trial 
and error at first among acts, then among images, then among 
2738 8  
-P-A-G-E-272
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
symbols. The alternatives which are presented for selection 
become increasingly more abstract, increasingly more plastic 
and indefinite. It seems possible that the only physiological 
concomitant is increasing complexity in the neurone patterns 
which accompany the reasoning. The educational implica- 
tions of this way of looking at intelligence are first, that we 
should in our teaching recognize the trial and error aspect of 
creative thought, and secondly, that we should provide 
for increasing abstraction in the materials. We should 
provide opportunities for problems to arise, and treat them 
as the children of our pupils’ brains, not as inflictions or set 
tasks. We should encourage the widest variation in the 
solutions offered, the hypotheses formed, but should insist | 
on ruthless rejection after trial. We should have our’ 
pupils push their theories to the limit, to discover their 
breaking points. We should praise intellectual honesty 
which tries and finds out, and we should condemn intellec- 
tual laziness which theorizes and does not verify. Weshould 
see that the apparatus of abstraction is supplied to the pupil 
as fast as he feels the need for it—vocabulary, mathematical 
symbols, moral fables, parables and instances—and no 
faster. Throughout, we should ask whether our thinking 
hangs together, is consistent, and whether its predictions 
are verifiable. We should avoid formule and cut-and-dried 
methods and go back to first principles. Above all, we 
should encourage thinking, theory-making, and have the 
selection made by trial, not by authoritative repression. 
The same plasticity of response which, in the task of finding 
means, leads to intelligence, leads in the choosing of ends, 
to charaeter. Between muscular responses to a situation, 
and intellectual responses to a situation, the difference is one 
of abstraction, and the latter is made possible by the possi- 
bility of the former. In not dissimilar fashion, the fact that 
in man emotional drives and sources of energy can readily 
be tapped by numbers of diverse situations, and not merely 
by certain narrow stimuli, gives rise to the possibility of 
274
-P-A-G-E-273
    
REVIEW 
directing the impulses along noble or vicious channels. For 
the simple situations which are the desired goal of animal 
action, such as obtaining food, or possession of a mate, or 
regaining contact with the herd or pack, are substituted 
lofty ideals or ugly passions. Both in intellect and in 
character, education means redirecting behaviour along new 
channels. In both, education means learning to look ahead. 
In both, the mistake of repressing instead of redirecting is 
one which leads to failure or even to disgrace. In character 
formation, it has to be recognized that good habits grow out 
of instincts, and that the latter have to be accepted and 
remodelled. In intellectual education, it has to be recog- 
nized that abstract thinking grows out of actual action, and 
is a substitute for it : so that to divorce thinking from acting, 
to make ‘ book-learning ” different from doing things, 
to repress activity of muscular behaviour instead of subli- 
mating it into thought, is as harmful to reasoning as blind 
repression of impulse is detrimental to character. There 
can be logic-tight bulkheads between thought and action as 
injurious as those between religion and everyday life. 
Another leading idea which has emerged is the necessity 
for a very real integration of school life into one whole of 
diverse yet interconnected subjects of study. Yor otherwise, 
I do not see any way out of the “ formal training ” paradox. 
If the training we give our pupils is only going to improve 
them in that subject alone, and not transfer except in minute 
amounts to life situations, then logically we ought to give 
up teaching most of the subjects found in school and practice 
vocational training only. But if, in a study of various sub- 
jects, each under different aspects, and with different 
material, there are used general methods of reasoning, veri- 
fying, controlling, testing, then from them all, the student 
may get by abstraction the lesson of how to think, which may 
transfer from the whole though not from any one. The 
specialist at 16 would be in danger of merely learning his sub- 
ject, while the pupil getting a wider education was learning 
275   
 
-P-A-G-E-274
  INSTINCT, INTELLIGENCE AND CHARACTER 
to think—provided this second pupil was not only being 
made a specialist in each of six subjects. It is with many 
mnisgivings that some of us see the increasing departmentalism 
of schools, and the growing wish on the part of teachers to 
teach one subject exclusively. I know well the answer, that 
the subjects are becoming so advanced that teachers must 
specialize, and cannot become expert in special methods 
unless they stick to their lasts. But I am not altogether 
convinced, and fear that only cobbling may result : and, on 
the principle that if you want really honest criticisms, you 
should send the Sporting Editor to the play, and the 
Dramatic Critic to the match, I would like the English 
teacher to teach a little chemistry and the chemistry teacher 
to teach a little English. And having thus made many 
enemies (for I know what they will say, and perhaps they 
are right), I will remember, too late, that least said is 
soonest mended. 
Perhaps all of the rest is summed up in the general notion 
that play has been the great maker of mankind. Fixed 
inherited instincts got a long way, but they could never, 
I imagine, have given us speech. Speech, and the innu- 
merable muscular dexterities of which man is capable, 
came because man inherits random tendencies to make 
noises, and enjoy playing at the game of doing so, and ran- 
dom tendencies to manipulate things this way, that way, and 
any way. We call the period childhood. It is helpless first 
because it has so few really definite responses, but for the 
same reason, it is potential of everything. And in nature 
the random activities which ensue are called play, and from 
them the environment selects the fittest: a Darwinism of 
" responses rather than of responders. Play is therefore the 
natural form of education, and school must use it, passing 
over gradually to earnest as the years go by. 
And as they go by, school will watch anxiously, to strike, 
as James says, when the iron is hot, to use each impulse as 
it comes up. And this, whether the theory of the transitori- 
276
-P-A-G-E-275
  REVIEW 
ness of instincts is correct or no. If they are transitory, 
so much the more important. But in any case, it were 
foolish to have the newest impulse against one instead of 
acting with it. 
These, then, appear to be the main ideas urged: the 
continuity of action and thought, the importance of 
originality, and the danger of authority in intellectual 
things, the need of subjecting theory to trial, and of seeing 
general methods in several subjects, the importance of 
re-directing instincts and avoiding mere repression, the value 
of play methods, and methods seizing upon the instinct of 
the moment with younger children. Throughout, education 
should look more and more ahead, both in cultivating intelli- 
gence and in creating character. For the latter can be 
created, while intelligence, it would seem, is much more a 
matter of heredity. In it, individual differences seem more, 
inborn than in character: and the task of the school is 
rather that of discovering than of making talent, the task 
of finding the shape of the pegs, not whittling them to fit 
the square or the round holes. Intellect 1 guidance and 
character training. 
Each member of a free community (said the late Lord Bryce 
in a Yale address) must be capable of citizenship. Capacity involves 
three qualities—Intelligence, Self-control, Conscience. . .. Of the 
three requisities, the two former are the more frequent and are the 
more easy to produce by proper training. 
Contrary to his opinion, however, seems the verdict of 
psychology, as regards intelligence. Self-control and even 
conscience seem much more modifiable by the influence of 
education than is intelligence, even though the latter may 
not be entirely unchangeable. A certain type of character\ 
can almost be guaranteed by a school if it has its pupils/ 
long enough, but not a level of intelligence. It seems to 
be the function of the teacher to form character and find) 
out about intelligence. In so far as he can influence the 
latter, he will do it through the former.

REPORT 
The Superintendent is again forced to call attention to the negli- 
gence of County Superintendents in making reports to this De- 
partment. We must remedy this, and it is believed that if the Gen- 
eral Assembly, soon to meet in this city, will adopt the suggestions 
made by the Convention of School Officers, and make the necessary 
amendments to the school laws, much of the trouble experienced in 
collecting statistics will be obviated. 
AMENDMEMTS. 
The following amendments were recommended : 
1. “That the scholastic census shall be taken annually, during 
the month of May.” 
This amendment is made at the request of the cities, and should 
be adopted. It is a very difficult task to take a correct school cen- 
sus during the month of July in the large cities, from the fact that 
so many of the families are out of the cities during the hot weather. 
The change from July to May cannot operate against the country, 
but would favor the cities. The change should be made. 
2. “That all reports due the County Superintendents from the 
District Directors shall be submitted on or before July 15, an- 
nually.” 
3. “That all reports from the County Superintendents shall be 
made on or before August 1, annually.” 
These amendments should be made for the reason that the State 
Superintendent could gather statistics much more readily. The 
school year ends June 30, and the Directors are not required to re- 
port to the County Superintendents until the 15th day of September, 
and the County Superintendents are not required to report to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-11
Aa ON 
State Superintendent until the Ist day of October. This is simply 
absurd. The time is so long from the close of the school year until 
that of making the reports, that no correct report can be had— 
books, papers and men in many instances are gone. 
4, “That the school district and the civil district shall be iden- 
meal) 
This is by all means the most important recommendation asked. 
The power to change the lines of school districts and to form new 
school districts should be taken from the County Courts. The cut- 
ting up of school districts is doing us more damage than any other 
one thing. In some communities the schools that were prosperous 
have almost been destroyed. We cannot establish secondary 
schools except in localities where the population is dense, or where 
we have large districts to draw from. 
I will not enter into lengthy argument on this subject, but sub- 
mit the same to the intelligence of the members—especially those 
who have had occasion to examine carefully the workings of our 
schools for the past few years. 
5. “That the County Superintendent be authorized to approve 
all warrants except those for teachers’ salaries.” 
The tramp chart fiend has robbed this State annually for the past 
twenty years of more than $10,000. The only remedy for this is 
to give the County Superintendents the authority to approve the 
warrants for all purposes except for teachers’ salaries, and then the 
tramp above mentioned must seek a new field. The tramp will - 
begin to get in his work upon the members of the General Assem- 
bly as soon as his eyes shall fall upon this recommendation, and 
unless the members give heed to those who are trying to protect the 
school fund, the annual raids will continue. 
6. “ That the County Superintendents be authorized to call Dis- 
trict Directors to meet twice each year. The annual meeting shall 
be on the first Saturday in September, and the semi-annual at such 
time as may be designated by the County Superintendent. The 
meetings shall be one day each, and $1.00 shall be allowed those 
who attend.”
-P-A-G-E-12
  age 
This should become a law. We need more system in many coun- 
ties of the State, and there is no better way to bring this about than 
by having the directors meet in a body and agree upon some line ~ 
of policy. The only objection that can be urged against this amend- 
ment is that it will cost something. Yes, that is trne; and if we 
had not required so much work done for nothing, we would have 
been in much better condition to-day. The School Director gives 
more time to the schools, and without pay, than should be de- 
manded of him. A little pay will secure better service. 
7. “That in the election of District School Directors the term of 
office shall be six years, and one Director shall be elected at the 
biennial August election.” 
There are many reasons why this amendment should be made, 
the most important being that as the law now is, all three of the 
Directors are elected at the biennial August election, and in many 
instances an entire new board is elected. Then comes trouble. 
The schools have just begun ; the new board thinks everything done 
by the old board was illegal, and general confusion is the result. 
We have many lawsuits pending in the State from this cause, and 
some schools destroyed. 
Tae most important legislation that can be done upon the school 
question is that which will better protect the school fund. The re- 
quest has so often been made, and seemingly ignored by former 
Legislatures, that it appears almost useless to mention this subject 
again. 
I recommend that an additional clerk be given the Comptroller, 
whose duty shall be, under suitable legislation, to look after the 
collection and disbursement of the school fund. If this is done, I 
am sure that not less than $500,000 will be saved annually to this 
fund. This may appear startling to those who are not familiar with 
this subject, but I know what I say on this point, and all will be 
convinced of the correctness of the assertion if suitable legislation 
ean be had. There are so many interested in this to the contrary, 
that I fear no action can be had until public opinion asserts itself, 
and those in authority are brought to realize the will of the people.

pee Oe 
SoME oF THE Reasons wHy THE ScHoon Disrricr anp Crvib 
District SHOULD BE ONE AND THE SAME. 
1. To secure in each district as many schools—more or less as 
may be found best; all of them, however, so organized as to be 
parts of a system adapted to the special wants of each community. 
2. To end disputes about, district boundaries. 
3. To dispense with a large number of school officers, and to re- 
duce largely the number of school elections. 
4. To provide for each child going to that school which is most 
convenient and beneficial to him, considering his attainments and 
the studies he is pursuing. 
5. To diminish the aggregate expenses of the schools. 
6. To secure an efficient system of school supervision for each 
district. 
7. To enable every district to establish a system of graded schools, 
thus giving to each district one or more secondary schools. 
8. To secure for schools better teachers, and for teachers better 
compensation. 
9. To improve school-houses, and to provide them with what is 
needed for use of the schools. 
10. To promote uniformity of text-books, and to introduce better 
methods of teaching and courses of study. 
11. To obtain more reliable statistics. 
12. Tosecure and to care for district libraries, containing a greater 
variety and larger number of books than can be obtained under the 
small district plan. 
AMERICAN History 1n SOUTHERN UNIVERSITIES. 
I call your special attention to the action taken by the State 
Teachers’ Association, at the annual meeting held at Murfreesboro
-P-A-G-E-14
a ie 
July 3-4-5, upon the subject of American History in Southern 
Universities, and ask that the General Assembly be requested to 
make an appropriation to temporarily endow the chair that has 
been established by the Trustees of the State University at Knox- 
ville. The following is the action of the State Association : 
CHAIR OF AMERICAN HISTORY IN SOUTHERN UNIVERSITIES. 
Superintendent Frank M. Smith called the attention of the Association to the re- 
cent action of the Board of Trustees of the University of Tennessee in establishing 
achair of American History, upon recommendation of the Confederate Veteran 
Association. He said: “You are all familiar with the organization of the Confed- 
erate veterans. This association has had for many years a committee on school 
histories. At the meeting held in Birmingham in April, 1894, it made a report 
upon this subject, which was adopted. I presented this report to the Trustees of 
the University of Tennessee, and they, on the 14th of last month, established a 
chair of American History. The Trustees also appointed a committee, consisting 
of Governor Peter Turney, Dr. C. Deaderick, Hon. M.S. Cockrill, Hon. M. P. Jar- 
nigan and Frank M. Smith, to memorialize the Legislature. 
“T wish to present a resolution that I have prepared bearing on this subject, and 
trust the Association will unanimously indorse the same. It is as follows: 
“Wuenreas, The Association of United Confederate Veterans, at the meeting 
held at Birmingham, Ala., April 25-27, 1894, made valuable recommendations and 
suggestions relative to securing the preparation and publication of true and reli- 
able histories of the United States and of the several Southern States, which rec- 
ommendations, as adopted by said Association, are more fully set forth in the fol- 
lowing extract from the report of the Committee on History, composed of the fol- 
lowing gentlemen: S, D. Lee, Chairman; J. N. Stubbs, W. R. Garrett, and J. W. 
Nicholson : ; 
“«The order of the Association creating this committee requires us to formulate 
a plan for securing a true and reliable history of the late civil war. In attempting 
to formulate this plan, the committee has been led to examine the whole field of 
history. We find, as has been heretofore set forth in this report, that justice to the 
South requires that the entire field of history be explored, and its neglected facts 
be faithfully gathered and portrayed. We need a renaissance of history through- 
out the South. We have looked around for the best agency to effect this object. 
‘What will be the most efficient agency? It must be a universal agency, a contin- 
uing agency, an influential agency. It must be an agency that can stimulate his- 
torical research, create historical taste, produce not only one work, but many 
works; employ not only one mind, but many minds; make the work assume 
various shapes, not only in the form of standard histories and school histories, but 
also State histories, magazine articles, historical essays, popular sketches, local his- _ 
tory, etc. It is unfortunately true that our people have neglected history. They 
have not only neglected to write, but they have neglected to read what is written. 
Historical taste and historical literature must assume various phases. There is a 
deplorable lack of knowledge of State history and of local history. Here is a mine 
rich in unexplored history and poetry. We need workers in the field. Very few, 
even of our educated citizens, have devoted much attention to the histories of their
-P-A-G-E-15
cde 
respective States. This history, when developed, will touch the popular heart. No 
one mind can explore this wide field, and no one work can cover the ground, We 
need a separate history for each State. Besides, we do not wish to limit our work 
to the present time. Can we not kindle a flame which will not burn out with the 
life of our generation? There is but one agency which can compass all the pur- 
poses, and can add to these another of great value, That agency is our leading 
Southern universities. They have the means, the prestige, the appliances, the un- 
dying life. They could put work into immediate operation, and continue it for- 
ever. We therefore suggest that the Association recommend the following plan: 
““Let every university in the South establish a chair of American History; that 
this chair be not overloaded with additional work, but its occupant be allowed 
leisure, and be provided with appliances for historical investigation and author- 
ship; that the occupant of this chair be selected with special reference to his fitness 
for historical authorship, and also for inspiring students with a spirit of original 
historical investigation ; that the chair of American History should include a com- 
prehensive course, embracing not only a history of the United States, but also a 
history of the entire American continent, and should be taught in a manner to suit 
matured minds, and to lead them to original investigation. The inauguration of 
such a course in our Southern universities, leading to a full comprehension of the 
history, geography, and relation of the various members of the American continent, 
would give the coming generation of Southern youth a broad knowledge, which 
would bring to the South a benefit which need not be enlarged on. 
“<2. That the Association recommend to the Legislatures of the several South- 
ern States to provide, in the public school course, for teaching the history of the 
native State one year; and also for teaching the history of the United States one 
year, and for the establishment and support of a chair of American History in the 
State university, or in some suitable State institution ; and also for encouraging 
the preparation of State school histories. 
“<3 That the Association recommends that all private schools and academies 
make provision for teaching the history of the native State one year and the his- 
tory of the United States one year. 
“*4. That the Association appoint suitable committees to memorialize the sev- 
eral Legislatures and authorities of universities and schools, and to request the co- 
operation of State historical societies, State literary societies, the press, etc.’ And, 
“Wuereas, The University of Tennessee did, at the meeting of its Board of 
Trustees, in June, 1894, establish the chair of American History, being the first 
institution to respond to the recommendations of the Confederate Ve(iraas? Associ- 
ation ; therefore, be it 
she 1 Resolved, That this Association, representing the various departments of ed- 
ucation throughout the State of Tennessee, does most heartily indorse the recom- 
mendations of the Confederate Veterans’ Association. 
“2. That this Association does most cordially congratulate the University of 
Tennessee upon its prompt and patriotic action, and this Association takes pride 
in the fact that Tennessee, through its State university, has pen bed, forward as the 
first volunteer in this laudable work. 
“3, That a committee of five members of this Association be appointed by the 
President, whose duty it shall be to represent this Association in conveying our 
congratulations to the University of Tennessee, and in petitioning the General As- 
sembly to enact such legislation as may be needed to carry into successful opera-
-P-A-G-E-16
lin Beaa 
tion the several recommendations of the Confederate veterans and to sustain the 
action of the State university. 
“The foregoing resolutions were unanimously adopted, and the following com- 
mittee appointed: Frank Goodman, Chairman, Nashville; Thos. H. Paine, Jack- 
son; H. D. Huffaker, Chattanooga; Wharton S. Jones, Memphis; and S. V. Wall, 
Franklin.” 
Talso present the full report of the Committee on “Teaching 
American History,” made to the Public School Officers’ Associa- 
tion, held in this city December 11-12-13, 1894, and unanimously 
adopted by said Association, viz.: 
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON TEACHING AMERICAN HISTORY. 
To the President and Members of the Public School Officers’ Association of Tennessee : 
Your Committee on Teaching American History report as follows : 
First—We recommend that the course in history in the public schools be made 
more complete and thorough than heretofore. 
Second—That this course embrace (1) The History of Tennessee; (2) The His- 
tory of the United States; (3) The History of the entire American Continent. 
Third—That these subjects be taught topically and practically, and cover the 
statistical, social, political and geographical history of the American Continent. 
Fourth—That we indorse the action of the Tennessee State Teachers’ Association 
in its recommendations to the Legislature of Tennessee, made at the meeting at 
Murfreesboro in the summer of the year 1894. 
Fijfth—That we approve the action of the University of Tennessee in establish- 
ing the chair of American History, and we recommend to the Legislature to make 
suitable provision to sustain the action of the State University. 
Sixth—That the Committee on School Laws for this Association be instructed to 
co-operate with the committee of the State Teachers’ Association in presenting the 
above resolutions to the Legislature.

people, and I trust it will be treated in a non-partisan spirit, and 
such legislation be had as its importance demands. 
InsTITUTES. 
The report on Institutes was published in pamphlet form for the 
benefit of the Peabody Board of Trustees, from whom the principal 
part of the funds was received to defray the expenses, and I deem 
it of such importance that I present that report in full, to be in- 
cluded as a part of this report.

NasHVILLE, TENN., August 9, 1894. 
Hon. J. L. M. Curry, Washington, D. C.: 
Dear Smr—I have the honor to submit to you a report of the work done in the 
institutes of this State during the present summer, especially those known as 
Peabody Institutes. 
At the annual meeting of the County Superintendents of Schools, held in this 
city, it was decided to hold two grades of institutes—County Institutes, and Peabody 
or State Institutes; the former to be of two weeks duration, and to receive such 
aid as the State Superintendent could give, the counties receiving assistance to de- 
fray one-half of the expenses; the latter to be of four weeks duration, and to be 
made as efficient as possible. 
A course of study for each of these institutes was prepared, embracing all the 
studies required to be taught in the public schools of the State, the said course of 
study being divided into two parts each, the first part to be taught this year, and 
the second part next year. 
It was also decided to hold a school of at least two weeks for the purpose of 
training institute conductors. 
The following circular was issued in February and sent to all parts of the State:

Ogu: 
An engagement was made with Dr. W. H. Payne, President of the Peabody 
Normal College, to take complete charge of the school for conductors, and manage 
the same in every particular. 
This school was advertised thoroughly. The school opened on June 11th, and 
held for the period of two weeks. (See report of Dr. Payne for particulars). 
At the close of this institute the following persons were employed as conductors 
of county institutes, and sent to various counties in the State :

The four Peabody institutes, Knoxville, Monteagle, Nashville and Jackson, 
began July 9th, and held for four weeks. Prof. T. C. Karns, principal of Teach- 
ers’ Department, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, principal of the institute at 
that place, was assisted by Profs. T. W. Jordan, GC. D. Schmitt, C. F. Vanderford, 
J. B. Henneman and Superintendent J. C. Ford. 
The institute at Monteagle was conducted by Prof. A. P. Bourland, of the 
Peabody Normal College, and he employed the assistants, 
The institute at Nashville was conducted by Dr. W. H. Payne, and the other 
members of the faculty were employed by Dr. Payne. 
The institute at Jackson was conducted by Hon. Thos. H. Paine, Superintend- 
ent City Schools, Jackson, Tenn., assisted by Prof. Wharton S. Jones, Memphis; 
S. A. Mynders, Lexington; Price Thomas, Union City; G. R. McGee, Trenton; 
Miss Jennie Dyer, of Mississippi, and Mr. W. R. Garrett, Nashville. (For par- 
ticulars see the reports of the conductors herewith submitted). 
The work of the year has been satisfactory beyond my expectations. I am not 
prepared to say that the county institute work should be managed exclusively by 
the counties, and that no aid should be rendered such institutes by the State; but, 
to the contrary, the county institutes have done an excellent work—a work that 
would not haye been done except by State aid. The work has been practically 
uniform. The syllabus prepared by the convention of superintendents was fol- 
lowed almost literally, and the conductors were much better prepared for the 
work, 
The school for conductors was a very important factor in the work, and should 
be continued annually for several years. The money expended upon this school 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
te Gea 
will show greater returns than that expended in any other way. The only regret 
that I have about the school is, I did not have sufficient funds to give employment 
to all those who were in attendance. 
The Peabody institutes did the great work—the grandest work that has ever 
been done in this State. We have reached that period in our educational deyelop- 
ment when these schools become a necessity. A few years ago such schools could 
not have been maintained, but the demand now is for fewer institutes and longer 
terms, with a regular course of study, and, as far as possible, a permanent faculty. 
These institutes are now established in this State, and will continue to grow in 
usefulness as the years go by. 
In conclusion, permit me to thank you and the Peabody Board of Trust for the 
material aid you have rendered. An earnest effort was made to carry, out the sug- 
gestions made by you, and I trust the result will be satisfactory. 
Yours truly, 
Frank M. Surra, Superintendent.

Dear Str—I herewith transmit my report of attendance at the conductors’ 
institute held at the Peabody Normal College, beginning June 11, and closing 
Tune 21, 1894. * 
I was assisted in the work of instruction by Miss Aristine G. Glover, principal 
of the Winthrop Model School. 
The membership of this institute was of high quality, and the fidelity, intelli-

COUNTY INSTITUTES. 
CAMPBELL COUNTY. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent Public Instruction: 
My Dear Srr—Our State institute at Jacksboro, Campbell County, Tenn., com- 
mencing July 16 and closing July 27, was a grand success—in fact, it was one of 
the best we ever held. We had one hundred and thirty-three teachers present, 
representing a large area of country. The following counties in Tennessee were 
represented: Anderson, Campbell, Scott, Union, and some from Kentucky and 
Virginia. All the sessions were well attended by citizens. Much interest was 
manifested on the part of teachers and those about to become teachers. The gen- 
eral educational meetings were attended by a large number of persons—in fact, we 
had a crowded house at each meeting. Every one expressed themselves as being 
highly pleased with the workings of the institute; many kind expressions were 
given us by teachers and citizen

FRANKLIN COUNTY. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent Public Instruction : 
Dear Str—In accordance with your appointment, I held a county teachers’ in- 
stitute at Winchester, Franklin county, from June 25 to July 6, inclusive. It was 
the first institute that had been held in Franklin county for upward of fourteen 
years, and this fact makes the results accomplished all the more gratifying. I met 
with a warm welcome, and a willing spirit was evinced by all who attended to 
make the meetings a success. 
There were seventy teachers enrolled, and frequently the attendance of teachers 
and the public exceeded one hundred. Better and more earnest attention and in- 
terest I have seldom seen shown in an institute. All the various branches of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
I 
course of &tudy in the public schools were discussed, and I am satisfied the teachers. 
of Franklin county have a high appreciation of the great work intrusted to their 
hands. New resolution and spirit to do better hereafter, it seems to me, were 
engendered, and if this beginning is added to in the future by successive yearly 
institutes, I feel sure that Franklin county will not lag behind in educational 
progress and advancement. I recommend to you and the county authorities most 
strongly that this first institute be yearly followed by more thoroughly organized 
ones—they will undoubtedly accomplish great good. 
County Superintendent Hannah heartily held up my hands, and my thanks are 
especially due to Profs. Horton and Reynolds and Miss Clark, of the Winchester 
Normal, and Supt. Parker, of the public school for their invaluable assistance. 
Very respectfully, 
A. D. Wuarton, Conductor. 
JULY 28, 1894. 
GIBSON COUNTY. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent Publie Instruction : 
Dear Srr—Acting under your instruction, I reported for duty June 25, at 
Trenton, Gibson county; took charge of the institute, and, with the aid of Super- 
intendent Baker and many of his active and competent teachers, am gratified to 
state that we held a yery satisfactory and successful institute. 
I found that the Superintendent had done his part well in advertising, and that 
he held his teachers well in hand, the result of which was that from the very be- 
ginning the institute moved off nicely, and the intetest increased daily until its 
very close. 
TIendeavored to make the work practical, insisting that everything possible be 
placed upon the board for inspection, as also every teacher present take some part in 
the work. Have never known teachers to respond more promptly, and seemingly 
more interested in the discussion and development of every subject. The primary 
and secondary courses were taken up in order, and a strict compliance, as far as 
possible, with your syllabus maintained. Was especially gratified with the un- 
usual interest taken by the lady teachers; they certainly “came to the front,” and 
very clearly demonstrated the fact that they were not an ‘ unknown quantity” in 
the educational work of that sectioa. There were enrolled one hundred and 
twenty-five teachers, sixty of whom were ladies, and fully 90 per cent. in attend- 
ance all the time. Certainly it was a successful meeting. We took especial pains 
to enlist the citizens in the interest of our work, and were amply repaid, not only 
in the aid given us, but also by their attendance and the part that some of them 
took in our exercises, thereby manifesting a deep interest in the welfare of the 
public school system. Illustrative of this interest, I would mention that the quar- 
terly court, being in session, cordially invited the institute, as a body, to spend a 
few hours with them, which was accepted, and right well was the time spent. We 
were received by the county judge, who turned over everything to. the institute, 
and gave profound attention whilst we remained. This being a body of repre- 
sentative men, we “brought home,” and endeavored to impress upon them, the 
importance of such subjects as school buildings, uniformity of books, competent
-P-A-G-E-24
  i poms 
teachers, active school directors, live superintendents, and, in truth, all the essen- 
tials of the system. The hour spent with them, I think, was not only very enjoy- 
able but most profitable, and that good seed was sown in good ground. 
Was delighted to have you visit the institute, and your yery appropriate and 
forcible talk certainly had a telling effect upon teachers and citizens. After your 
departure I could frequently hear it whispered that our State Superintendent 
meant strictly business. 
To the citizens of Trenton, who seemed so deeply interested in our work, and 
who were so cordial and courteous, I feel deeply grateful, and especially would I 
mention Dr. Happel, the Hon. George Hicks, Senator Harwood and Hon. Mat 
Neil, and the Rev. Mr. Ryal, all of whom rendered us valuable aid and contrib- 
uted largely toward the success of the institute. Feel also that we are indebted to 
the following teachers, who were so prompt and did so much good work for us 
during our meeting, to-wit: Mrs. McGhee, Misses McDearmon, Butler, Blake- 
more, Fitzgerald, McConnell; Professors Wright, Meadows, Jackson, Boone, Jor- 
dan and many others. 
In conclusion, would answer to the oft-repeated question, “Are our institutes 
doing much good?” I, after an experience of fourteen years in the work, unhesi- 
tatingly answer yes, thrice yes. The improvement is visibly manifest all along the 
line. The profession is being elevated, our people becoming deeply interested in 
education, and, in truth, would our State appropfiate doubly the amount hereto- 
fore given to this department, I am satisfied that in a few year we would be 
abreast with the foremost of our country. Let the work go forwardsby all means, 
and a rich and fruitful harvest in the end will be the resu t. 
Respectfully, 
©. 8. Douanass, Conductor. 
JULY 30, 1894, 
GILES, SUMNER, TROUSDALE AND MADISON COUNTIES. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent Public Instruction : 
Dear Srr—I have the honor to submit the following report of my work in the 
State teachers’ institutes during the summer of 1894. 
In obedience to your instructions, and in accordance with your printed 
programme and syllabus, I conducted State institutes of one week each at Gallatin, 
Lebanon and Hartsville. In addition, I spent one week at the Peabody institute 
at Jackson, and conducted the county institute, of one week’s duration, at Pulaski. 
PULASKI, 
The county institute at this town, which is the county seat of Giles county, con- 
vened June 18, and was in session one week. It was held under the supervision of 
the able County Superintendent, Mr. Merritt Eslick, and was participated in by 
about one hundred teachers and school officers of the county. Much interest was 
manifested in its proceedings by the citizens of Pulaski and the vicinity, the large 
court-room in which it was held being full nearly the whole time. I suppose that 
not less than five hundred people were present at different times. The programme 
and syllabus for the State institutes was followed in the main. Valuable assistance 
in the work was rendered by the leading teachers of Giles county, which will be 
e 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
ee 
reported to you in detail by the County Superintendent. The school work in this 
county is in a good and progressive condition, and the teachers are alive and 
earnest, There are no better teachers in the State. 
GALLATIN. 
The State institute at Gallatin, the county seat of Sumner county, convened at 
the Howard Female Institute, June 25, and continued two weeks. I conducted the 
exercises during the first week. Miss Pattie Malone, County Superintendent, her- 
self an excellent institute worker, continued the work for the second week. 
The institute was organized by electing Miss Pattie Malone as President and Miss 
Milliken as Secretary. The exercises were conducted in accordance with your 
printed syllabus. Valuable assistance was rendered in the work by Messrs. Gviflin, 
Hobdy, Caldwell and Peden, and by Mrs. Griffin and Misses Simpson, Harper, 
Stewart and Holder. About fifty teachers were in regular attendance. The public 
attendance was small. The exercises were professional, and the work was earnest. 
At the close of the first week the permanent organization of a county institute was 
effected, of which Mr. Caldwell was elected President, and the teachers decided to 
meet monthly at the institute, and to pursue a course of reading and study in con- 
nection with the institute work. 
LEBANON. ° 
The State institute at Lebanon convened Monday, July 9, at the Preparatory De- 
partment of the Cumberland University. The teachers of Wilson County, to the 
number of about fifty, attended regularly. The institute was organized by electing 
Mr. H. R. Birchitt, County Superintendent, as President. 
The exercises were conducted in accordance with your syllabus for State insti- 
tutes. We were fortunate in haying with us two of the ablest institute instructors 
in the State, viz.: Prof. W. J. Grannis and Prof. F.M. Bowling. They both per- 
formed regular work as instructors. In addition to these gentlemen, several other 
leading teachers rendered useful assistance, and did some beautiful work. Among 
these were Messrs. G. W. Rice, A. R. Harris, W. Caulkins and others. County 
Superintendent Birchitt, by his addresses and active work, contributed much to the 
success of the institute. The work of the teachers was particularly earnest and 
vigorous. 
HARTSVILLE. 
The institute at this place was, perhaps the most enthusiastic and popular, and 
the largest in attendance, that was held in the State. The number of enrolled 
members, including teachers and school officers, as reported by the Secretary, was 
one hundred and seven. The attendance of visitors, including the citizens of 
Hartsville and vicinity, was estimated by the County Superintendent to be fifteen 
hundred. It may be stated with certainty that more than one thousand citizens 
were present during some portion of the sessions. At one of the night sessions 
more than half of those in attendance were unable to gain admission to the hall. 
This institule was in the nature of an educational revival, and the entire popu- 
lation of Hartsville and vicinity seemed to be filled with enthusiasm. The exer- 
cises at the morning and afternoon sessions, however, were strictly professional. 
The night exercises partook more of a popular character. The remarkable public 
enthusiasm was largely due to the popularity and active exertions of County Su- 
perintendent Morgan Fitzpatrick. 
‘
-P-A-G-E-26
on 
In organizing the institute, Supt. Fitzpatrick was elected President, Mr. A. J. 
Donoho, Secretary, and Miss Sallie Chambers Assistant Secretary. 
We were fortunate in securing the services of Prof. W. J. Grannis, of the Cum- ~ 
berland University at Lebanon, who conducted all the lessons in mathematics, 
We were also fortunate in securing the services of a number of leading teachers 
from the adjoining counties, in addition to the assistance of leading local teachers. 
The institute was held for the counties of Trousdale, Macon, Sumner, Smith, and 
Wilson. Mr. J. C. Price, the progressive Superintendent of Macon county, attended 
with a fine corps of his teachers, and representative teachers were present from all 
the counties named. 
Dr. A. M. Burney, the distinguished President of Howard Female College, at 
Gallatin, remained two days, and delivered two excellent lectures. Practical and 
useful instruction was given by Mr. Gold, of Smith county, Supt. Price and Mr. 
Howser, of Macon county, Miss Lavinia Curry, of Nashville, Mr, G. W. Rice, of 
Wilson county, Mr. Hibbett, of Sumner county, and Miss Bennett, of Nashville. 
The leading local teachers also rendered valuable assistance. Among these may 
be mentioned Miss Sallie Chambers, Messrs. A. R. Harris, H. N. Grannis, James 
Burton, Chas. Martin, Walter Robeson, and Misses Minnie Cox, Mary Dishman, 
and Mrs. Beshears. Some excellent work was done by Supt. Fitzpatrick. At the 
morning and afternoon sessions the exercises were conducted in accordance with 
your syllabus for State institutes. At the night sessions popular addresses were 
delivered on educational topics, and the exercises were interspersed with music and 
recitations, many of which were excellent. We were indebted to the young ladies 
of the vicinity for several beautiful songs, which contributed much to the pleasure 
of the audience. 
The minutes and resolutions of the institute are herewith filed. 
JACKSON, 
I spent the week beginning July 23 at Jackson, and participated in the exer- 
cises of the Peabody institute held at that place. The report of this institute will 
be made to you by the conductor, Hon. Thos. H. Paine. 
It may not be improper for me to state to you my impressions of the work of 
this institute, which I can do freely, as my own part was that of a visitor rather 
than that of a regular member of the faculty. 
The conductor and his faculty were well selected. They fully comprehended 
the character of the work suited to such an institute, and they have organized and 
~ conducted it with wisdom and skill. I have neyer seen better work done in an in- 
stitute. It was strictly professional, and admirably suited to the needs of the 
teachers. 
About one hundred and eighty teachers were in regular attendance. I never 
saw a more intelligent body of teachers assembled together. They seemed to be the 
picked teachers of West Tennessee. They were earnest, industrious and respon- 
sive. They are already better scholars and better teachers, and when they com- 
plete the two years’ course of this institute, they will derive a solid benefit which 
will accrue not only to themselves, but will be felt in the higher standard of edu- 
cation throughout West Tennessee. 
With thanks for the encouragement and courtesy which you have extended to 
me in the discharge of the duties assigned me, I have the honor to be 
‘Your obedient servant,

RESOLUTIONS. 
Mr. Cuarrman—We, your committee appointed to draft resolutions, respect- 
fully submit the following: 
Wuereas, This association has brought together some of the most able and 
efficient teachers of the State; and, 
Wuereas, The presentation of their methods and the discussions emanating therefrom will be productive of great good to the teachers and to the public gen- 
erally ; and, 
Wuereas, The people of Hartsville have been so kind and generous in their 
entertainment of visiting teachers; therefore, be it

HARDEMAN COUNTY. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent Public Instruction : 
T have the honor to submit the following report of the State institute held at 
Bolivar, Hardeman County, beginning June 25, and continuing two weeks. 
On arriving at Bolivar I found that the institute had been well advertised, and 
all necessary local arrangements made, County Superintendent Roland and Prof. 
Henry Fusch, of the Bolivar High School, showed great interest in the work, and
-P-A-G-E-30
     eons 
used every effort to make it a success. We enrolled one hundred and three actual 
teachers, and had a large attendance of citizens at every session. 
Before beginning my work, I tried to ascertain the true condition of educational 
affairs in the county. I found thatno effort had been made to grade the county 
schools, and that there was no county teachers’ association or library. No insti- 
tutes, except a few one-day district institutes, had been held for several years. 
I reviewed with the teachers the entire primary school course, giving methods, 
model recitations, and dwelling on the difficult points in teaching. I gave par- 
ticular attention to the subject of grading district schools, teachers’ organizations, 
libraries, etc. 
I am pleased to be able to report that I succeeded in effecting an organization of 
teachers with eighty members, pledged to attend monthly meetings and grade their 
schools. We also established a teachers’ library. I found the teachers ready and 
willing to take hold of everything looking to the improvement of their schools, and 
the people gave me their co-operation and encouragement. 
I have received by mail a copy of the resolutions adopted after I left, which I 
submit as a part of this report. 
Resolved, That the citizens and teachers of Hardeman county, attending the State 
institute held under the direction of Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent 
of Public instruction, and so ably conducted by Prof. S. A. Mynders, A.M., of Lex- 
ington, Tenn., do deeply appreciate the efforts made on behalf of the public schools 
of this county, and heartily indorse all the work done or suggested by the conductor. 
Be it further resolved, That we tender to Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superin- 
tendent, our sincere thanks for his interest in our schools, and for sending us the 
right man in Prof. S. A. Mynders, who has, by his energy and timely suggestions, 
effected a county organization of teachers, established a county library, and set the 
machinery at work for a general grading of the schools of the county. 
Be it further resolved, That we, the teachers of Hardeman county, will do our ut- 
most to train public opinion in the direction set forth in the previous resolution 
and pledge ourselves to make an effort to grade our schools immediately. 
Be it further resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be sent to Hon. Frank M. 
Smith, State Superintendent, and a copy handed the Bolivar Bulletin for publication 
in the same. 
Lalso worked four weeks in the Peabody State institute held at Jackson, begin- 
ning July 9. A report of that work has been sent you. 
Respecfully submitted, 
S. A. Mynprrs, Conductor.

JOHNSON COUNTY. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith State Superintendent Public Instruction : 
Our Normal institute, held at Butler, Johnson County, Tenn., was the most. 
prosperous institute we have ever held. We had ninety-five teachers present, rep- 
resenting alarge area of country. Three counties were represented, namely, Carter, 
Johnson and Unicoi. All the sessions were well attended by citizens, and an in- 
creased interest was manifested on the part of the teachers and those about to be- 
come teachers. The general educational meetings were well attended—in fact, the 
college chapel was crowded.

LEWIS COUNTY. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent Public Instruction : 
On Monday, July 2, we began the institute work, with nineteen members and 
no visitors. My associate, Mrs. D, B. Evans, any myself at once gathered all the 
information we could concerning the schools of the county, with a view to adapt- 
ing our work as nearly as might be to the needs of the county. We gathered the 
following statistics: 
Number of schools in tlie county.. 
Number of teachers in the county, 
Average length of school term, about (months)... 
Average salary paid teachers, less than (per month) A 
Number school children in the county....... sss. cesses seseee eeeeree 1,045     
Knowing that a stronger educational interest ought to be awakened in the 
county, and wishing to take advantage of every opportunity for the same, I at 
once sent a message to the County Court, which was then in session, asking the 
privilege of addressing them that afternoon on the subject of education in Lewis 
county, and that the lecture be publicly announced, and everybody, old and young, 
be urged to be present. The privilege was granted, and the court-room was very 
well filled when the hour arrived for me to address them. I talked to them about 
an hour, Asa result, we had an attendance at the institute the next day of sixty- 
five, a large number of them being old men and women. We had two or three 
days of very rainy weather the first week, but still the interest and attendance in- 
creased daily, until, at the close, we had ninety-five present, with thirty-six en- 
rolled members. During the whole institute the average number of members was 
twenty-five; average number visitors present per day, forty-four; average number 
of members and visitors present each day, sixty-eight. To further the interest as 
much as possible, we had night exercises in reading, reciting, debating, ete., which 
were largely attended. 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  bea 
During the two weeks, I talked to the County Superintendent, leading teachers, 
and others, about organizing a monthly county institute, and succeeded in stirring 
up an interest which resulted in the organization of the same about the close of the 
institute, with every teacher in the county a member, also two teachers near the 
line in adjoining counties, and some old ex-teachers. The time and place of meet- 
ing was fixed and the programme of the first meeting arranged. 
No educational journals were taken by the teachers of the county, but a repre- 
sentative of some journals came in during the second week and took orders for 
fifteen—three of them weekly journals—and he sold three copies of Page’s Theory 
and Practice of Teaching. 
I have never seen so much real interest taken in institute work anywhere as the 
people, both teachers and citizens, took in the work at Newburg after the first few 
days. I left everybody in high spirits over educational work in general, and a 
strong desire for higher education and more thorough work upon a rational plan 
in Lewis county. Iam compelled to believe that this institute has been of real 
and lasting good to the county. Respectfully submitted, 
W. F. Davis, Conductor.

MAURY COUNTY. 
Hon. Frank M, Smith, State Superintendent Public Instruction: 
Dear Str—I have the honor to report that the institute at Columbia was duly 
held at the time appointed by you—July 9 to 20 inclusive. One hundred and fifty- 
eight teachers were enrolled. I followed the programme, as published by you, 
almost to the letter. I had no paid assistant, but I found the good teachers of 
Maury county sympathetic, responsive and helpful. 
In Maury County they have a county teachers’ association that meets monthly. 
The institute had been discussed and emphasized in these meetings to such an 
extent that the teachers attended the institute almost to a man. 
greater degree of interest and enthusiasm in an institute. 
The names of those. who rendered valuable assistance would form too long a 
list to be written here. 
In regard to the “ Program and Syllabus of County Institutes,” as published by 
you, I desire to say that I think it would be better to discuss a smaller number of 
subjects and to discuss them more in detail. So many things are included in this 
programme that it is hard to bring about any logical sequence of thought in the 
work as it proceeds from day to day. It is too much like a patchwork. Still, 
there are some points of excellence about this programme and syllabus that have 
greatly assisted me, Very respectfully submitted, 
P. H. Mannrxe, Conductor. I never saw a 
  
ROBERTSON COUNTY. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent Public Instruction : 
Dear Str—To-day brought to a close one of the most enthusiastic and success- 
ful teachers’ institutes ever held in Robertson County. During the two weeks we
-P-A-G-E-33
32 = 
enrolled eighty-three teachers and a large number of visitors. The average daily 
attendance of teachers was sixty-five. 
The success of the institute was due, in a large measure, to the untiring efforts 
of Superintendent J. E. Ruffin and the hearty, intelligent co-operation of my 
assistant, Miss Bethenia H. Nance, of Nashville, Tenn. I was ably assisted also 
by Prof. J. W. Huey, of the Springfield Collegiate Institute; Prof. M. E. Moore, 
of the Coopertown High School; Prof. N. J. Pritcharc, of the Central Tennessee 
Normal School, Greenbrier, Tenn., and Profs. J. T. Taylor, J. H. Dean and W. R. 
Sims. 
More than two-thirds of the time was spent in strictly professional work; the 
remaining time was devoted to a review of the subject-matter, chiefly in the sec- 
ondary branches. 
The teachers seemed to appreciate the privilege of having a State institute, and 
" were earnest in their efforts to obtain the most possible good out of it. 
A meeting of the teachers’ library association (organized 1893), was held, and I 
think this year will see it established on a firm basis. 
County institutes will be held monthly during the school term. 
Respectfully, 
J.J. Keyes, Conductor. 
JULY 6, 1894. 
WASHINGTON COUNTY. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent Public Instruction : 
Dear Sir—Having just closed our institute at Jonesboro the past week, I send 
you a condensed report of our proceedings. The institute was called to order at 
the appointed time in the courthouse, and the work was taken up as arranged in 
the official programme and syllabus, which was followed as closely as practicable 
during the entire session of the institute. 
On the first day we enrolled fifty teachers and had twenty-three visitors. There 
was a daily increase in numbers of both teachers and visitors until the close of the 
institute last week, when the record showed an enrollment of one hundred and 
fourteen teachers (not including the County Superintendent, Mr. Trotter, and my- 
self) and over seven hundred visitors. The teachers gave us their closest attention 
during the entire session, and there was a strong feeling of co-operation, which 
aided greatly to make the institute a success. Those in attendance were free to 
express their methods and to take notes of methods presented by the teachers in 
charge. The people of Jonesboro showed an interest in our work, and very often 
the room was filled with visitors. The recitation in the history of Tennessee was 
a source of much interest. Some of the older citizens consented to give us ad- 
dresses upon historical topics, and enlightened us with many facts concerning the 
county that have not yet been written in history. There was a strong feeling to 
have a history of Washington County gotten up. 
During the last afternoon of the institute we succeeded in organizing a Wash- 
ington County teachers’ library ‘association, and raised $36 to start the movement, 
Several educators were present from different parts of the State, and gave us 
encouragement and assistance. Among them we would mention—

WEAKLEY COUNTY.

School officers of Weakley County attending.. 
Male teachers of Weakley County attending... 
Female teachers of Weakley County attending .        vs

Average experience of teacher   
None but aciual teachers are counted in this enrollment, and the number of 
months taught by them is 2,243. 
The attendance was good, the zeal of the teachers unprecedented, and from be- 
ginning to end we had harmonious and earnest work. 
There were only eleven teachers present who were regular subscribers to a 
school journal, but quite a number subscribed during the institute. Only five 
teachers present had read any book on psychology, and only nine had read a book 
on pedagogy or on school methods or management. We promptly organized a 
county teachers’ library, and urged all to use it to the utmost of its usefulness. 
I left the teachers of Weakley County and the people of Dresden in good 
‘morale, and full of enthusiasm for the school work of the coming session. 
Respectfully,

ABSTRACTS ©F MINUTES. 
Your committee to whom was delegated the duty of reviewing the work of this 
institute, and emphasizing important things for the future benefit of school work- 
ers in Weakley County, take pleasure in saying that this institute has been a suc- 
cess from the beginning. ‘ 
The presence on the first day of Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of 
Public Instruction; of the institute conductor, Prof. G. R. McGee, and of our 
3 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
BERR 
County Superintendent, Prof. W. I. Moore, was a pleasing prophecy for the two 
weeks’ work that had been so well planned. The enrollment was good on the first 
day, and it has grown better all the while. The maximum number reached is one 
hundred and twelve. The daily attendance has been largely in excess of that 
heretofore reported for similar gatherings in our county, and this despite oppres- 
sive heat and the dust lying deep along the roads that many of the teachers have 
daily traveled. 
The attention has been close throughout the presentation and discussion of 
every topic. The readiness to respond has been gratifying, while the man with a 
grievance has not appeared in the assembly, nor lifted up his voice in the congre- 
gation of teachers. 
To our laborious and painstaking chief officer as individual workers, we are in- 
debted for much of the net result in gain. But the wheels within wheels, turning 
with the beauty that belongs to endless progression, deserve the tribute of every 
honest heart. The County Superintendent, the directors and the teachers, working 
with one mind and one purpose for the greatest good to those whom they serve, haye 
realized in the past, at least, that there must be only the friction that comes from 
motion forward—that each and every one must recognize relation to the State, to 
the State Superintendent, to the County Superintendent, to the school board, to the 
parent, to the commuity, and to the important trust that the State has committed 
to him or to her through the appointed power. 
Your committee, therefore, begs leave to recommend: 
1. A more diligent study by the teachers and the people of the school laws of 
Tennessee, believing that by so doing most of the grievances complained of will 
cease. ; : 
2. That teachers be active co-workers with all duly appointed authority. 
3. Thatthe Weakley county institute be made more effective by increased interest 
by the teacher—by better preparation and attendance. 
4. to secure this, let reading circles be formed, and have the committee on pro- 
gramme report at each monthly meeting of the teachers setting apart one hour of 
said meeting for the exercises of the circle. 
5. That the register of this institute be kept by the County Superintendent, that 
he may know the average of attendance at the monthly meeting. 
6, That each teacher in attendance upon this institute treasure the thoughts — 
presented by Prof. McGhee in his excellent talk on “ Beginning Work”: 
1. Have a daily programme 
2. Have a morning service—preferably a song and a prayer. 
8. Give short recesses ; be neat and tasteful in dress; be pleasant and courteous 
be grave rather than gay. 
4, Haye regard to people’s prejudices, and defer to them where there is no sacri- 
fice of duty or principle. 
5, Bear and forbear with the refractory until their example becomes hurtful to. 
others; then your authority ceases, and the State becomes supreme. i 
“6. Secure, if possible, uniformity in text-books; study the ground to be gone 
over in the time that you will teach; teach that thoroughly, and attempt nothing 
more. Review often with written examinations where the advancement and age of 
the pupil will justify the nervous strain. 
7. Recognize always that ignorance is ignorance, and a mighty power for evil ; 
and in all your teaching impress moral character. If you neglect this, you are
-P-A-G-E-36
  peat 
making criminals for the State, and not citizens. The more you educate a villain 
the greater power you give him as a wrong-doer and for wrong-doing. We urge 
upon the teachers active efforts in their respective fields to arouse interest in the 
building of better school-houses and in better furnishing, including desks, back- 
boards, etc. Children must be comforable, to do good work. 
8. Finally, we have placed on the board an outline of work for the different 
grades, that we hope will assist the teacher in answering that often asked question, 
“ How shall we grade?” ‘ 
As to close work, the teacher of tact will soon learn how to economize time ; how 
to combine classes; how to make a really effective organization out of even the raw 
material of our Volunteer State.

PEABODY INSTITUTES. 
EAST TENNESSEE. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent Public Instruction : 
Dear Str—With regard to the Peabody State Institute for East Tennessee, I 
have the honor to report as follows : 
The institute was held at the University of Tennessee, in Knoxville, beginning 
July 9, 1894, and ending August 1, 1894. The territory embraced was composed 
of all the counties of the Eastern Division of the State. Three hundred and twenty- 
five teachers were enrolled. Other friends of education who attended would swell 
the number to four hundred and fifty or more. The attendance came from points 
pretty well distributed over East Tennessee, reaching from Hamilton county on the 
southwest to Sullivan on the northeast. Some of the various counties represented 
were Anderson, McMinn, Washington, Hamilton, Campbell, Hawkins, Sullivan, 
Blount, Loudon, Monroe, Roane, Sevier, Knox, Hamblen, and Jefferson. Among 
others, the following States were represented: Alabama, Georgia, Kansas, Missouri, 
Virginia and Mississippi. This latter attendance, however, was more or less inci- 
dental. 
Tt was observed that a large per cent. of those in attendance was made up of 
County Superintendents, principals of secondary schools, and other teachers of ad- 
vanced standing. This was to be expected, since the institute was of a higher 
order and more comprehensive in its work than usual. At future meetings this 
feature will, no doubt, be more prominent. 
The faculty was composed of Thomas W. Jordan, A.M.; John B. Henneman, 
M.A., Ph.D.; Cooper D. Schmitt, M.A.; Charles F. Vanderford, and T. C. Karns, 
A.M, all from the faculty of the University of Tennessee ; and also Mr. J. C. Ford, 
Superintendent of Schools for Knox county. 
A regular programme was adopted from the start, and carried out with very great 
precision. It was intended to embrace, so far as practicable, all the studies of the
-P-A-G-E-37
Pe Gi 
State primary and secondary schools. Two lectures were arranged for each period 
after the first. The first period, during a portion of the term, was devoted to lectures 
school law and civil government before the whole institute. The daily session 
began at fifteen minutes to eight o’clock, A.M., and continued till twelve o’clock, 
noon. Devotional exercises were held at the opening in the morning. 
The extent of the work and its character may be gathered from the following 
summary : 
Prof. Thomas W. Jordan gave lectures and quizzes on United States history 
from the discovery down through Washington’s administration. This included 
methods of teaching the subject. He also gave two lectures on the Constitution and 
its amendments. Considerable time was also devoted to Tennessee history and in- 
stitutions, and a few practical talks on public speaking were given, with a view to 
the delivery of original thought in a sensible and effective manner. Physiology 
and hygiene, to a limited extent, were also included in his work. Prof. Jordan’s 
work extended through the third and fourth weeks only. 
Dr. John B. Henneman lectured on English grammar and rhetoric for two 
periods daily during the entire institute. He took up first the outline history of 
the English language and its various elements, followed by the alphabet; history 
and uses of parts of speech ; analysis of sentences; order and arrangement of words; 
punctuation and capitals; common errors in sentence construction. Under the 
head of more advanced English, Dr. Henneman discussed the elements of rhetoric 
and the qualities of style; practical composition and pure form; the uses of books 
and the value of a library; literary topics and helps; the study of prose style; 
characteristics of poetic diction, and the poets. Under each of these heads several 
different lectures were in most cases delivered. Practical methods for carrying the 
work out in schools were inclnded. 
Prof. Cooper D. Schmitt occupied two hours, in which he gave two lectures each 
day on mathematics. These lectures were more in the nature of practical lessons 
on the subjects discussed. Arithmetic was taught during the first two weeks of the 
institute. The work centered mainly on fractions and percentage, with its appli- 
eations. During the last part of the institute arithmetic was succeeded by 
geometry. This work extended through Books I. and II. and a part of Book IIT. 
Algebra was discussed by Prof. Schmitt through the entire four weeks of the insti- 
tute. He took up first factoring and its applications; then fractions and equations 
of the first degree; exponents and surds; quadratics and other equations. Each 
of the subjects given was discussed in several lectures. 
Prof. Charles F. Vanderford gave lectures two hours a day during the first two 
weeks upon the following subjects: Book-keeping, its principles and its necessities 
in all vocations; geology of Tennessee, illustrated and explained by a careful ex- 
position of the stratiography of the vicinity of Knoxville and a general view for 
the whole State, practical field work having been carried on by a portion of the 
class; physics, what to teach and how to teach physics in the secondary schools; 
elements of the science of agriculture, how much and in what lines to attempt its 
instruction in secondary schools, followed by a rapid summary, with special dis- 
cussion of soil origins, natural fertility and its conservation, 
Superintendent J.C. Ford discussed the school law, touching the duties, pow- 
ers, etc., of the State Superintendent, County Superintendents, school directors 
and teachers; also the disposition of the school fund. Under civil government he
-P-A-G-E-38
es 
treated, in detail, of government as shown forth in the family, the school and civil 
districts, the county, the State, the city and the general government. 
With the exception of two periods given to Principal J. H. McCallie, men- 
tioned in another place, Prof. T. C. Karns lectured two hours daily during the 
term on the following subjects: General pedagogics, primary methods, school dis- 
cipline and management, and moral training of children. Also an advanced 
course on history of education, psychology and its applications, county supervision 
of schools, graded school supervision and methods of conducting teachers’ insti- 
tutes. The matter of these lectures was brought out as practically as possible, the 
teachers having been constantly encouraged to take part in asking questions and 
giving illustrations from their experience. The text books assigned by the State 
Superintendent and the syllabus were followed as far as practicable. 
Principal J. H. McCallie, of the Knoxville city schools, delivered two excellent 
lectures on school helps, In connection with his talks he exhibited a large quan- 
tity of school apparatus, and explained its use. He also displayed some very 
interesting work done by pupils in his school. This part of the programme added 
much interest to the exercises, 
The work previously mapped out by State Superintendent Frank M. Smith con- 
sists of a two years’ course, including both home study and the work to be done in 
the institutes. The course of lectures given above was constructed with a view to 
covering, as far as practicable in the short time allotted, the work thus laid out. 
The lectures of the present institute covered the ground for both years. No pro- 
miscuous “tatks” by visitors were allowed. The regular work was adhered to 
strictly. 
Before the opening of the institute the faculty had intended to bring in a great 
deal of practical work in connection with the lectures. It was also thought that 
systematic study on the part of those in attendance could be secured during the 
afternoon and evenings. After a faithful trial, this was found, in a great meas- 
ure, impossible. Many teachers seemed not inclined to provide themselves with 
books, and the greater part neglected to hand in the written exercises required. 
Evidently only a small per cent. of those in attendance had in contemplation the 
regular work which will be necessary to pass the examination at the end of two 
years. At the same time, no lack of enthusiasm was indicated. Very few failed 
to show that they were deeply interested, and expected to profit greatly by what 
they received. 
The prospects for the future are good. Considering the fact that this is the first 
year, the attendance was highly satisfactory. The continuance of the work on the 
lines begun, and extensive advertisement at the proper time, will, of course, bring 
out a much larger attendance in the future. Some new features might be very 
profitably introduced in the next programme. Among these I will mention draw- 
ing and vocal music. It is also likely that one or two noted lecturers on educa- 
tional subjects from abroad, employed for limited time, would add to the profit and 
entertainment of those in attendance. I may add that those who expect to com- 
plete the course of study and pass the examination must do a great deal of work 
during the year, and not depend upon what they can receive during the sessions of 
the institute. 
Before closing, I desire to call attention to one especially good result of the in- 
stitute. Irefer to the unification of State education. The University manage- 
ment, embracing President Dabney, the trustees and the faculty, sustained the en-
-P-A-G-E-39

terprise most heartily, throwing open the buildings and equipment of the Univer- 
sity to the free use of the institute. All the resources of the University, including 
a handsome financial donation, were brought to bear in furtherance of the work. 
The consetjuence was a bringing of the public school teachers of the State’into a 
close and hearty sympathy with the University and its work, and especially with 
the teachers’ department, which is now being pushed forward vigorously, with a 
view to supplying teachers for the public schools of the State. The result cannot 
but be a great mutual good to both parties. 
I close by congratulating you, sir, and Dr. J. L, M. Curry, agent of the Peabody 
Board, upon the pronounced success of this, your first effort to establish a higher 
order of institutes in Tennessee. 
Respectfully submitted, T. C. Karns, 
Principal Fast Tennessee Institute. 
AuGusT 9, 1894, 
Hon. Frank M. Smith State Superintendent Public Instruction : 
My Dear Str—I have the honor to submit herewith report of my work in the 
Peabody Normal Institute, at Knoxville, just closed. 
I delivered eight lectures ‘on United States history, with methods of teaching 
the same, two on public reading and speaking, three on the history of Tennessee, 
two on the Constitution of the United States, and one on physiology. Two days 
were lost out of our original plan, on account of the election, 
It seemed best to take up some one of the various subjects assigned me and treat 
it consecutively one hour a day for the entire two weeks. Selecting for that the 
history of the United States, I carried it forward to the close of Washington’s ad- 
ministration, as follows, using outline tables and plans on the blackboard : 
I. Period of discovery. 
IL. Period of settlement. (a) Beginnings of Virginia and the coming of the 
pilgrims. (b) Settlement of the other colonies; race elements. 
III. The Indians—Tribes, mode of life, traits, early Indian wars, etc. 
IV. Life in the colonies, homes, products, animals, amusements, commerce, serv- 
ants and slaves, laws, ete. 
V. Colonial wars. 
VI. Government of the colonies—royal, charter, and proprietary, with early 
struggles for liberty. 
VII. The revolution. 
VILL. (a) The adopiion of the constitution. (b) Washington’s administration. 
With each lecture my plan was to take some one topi¢ and illustrate methods 
of teaching it: (2) How much to assign. (b) How to prepare the outline for the 
blackboard. (c) How to ask questions. (d) How to get the pupils to compare 
authorities, etc. 
I laid special emphasis upon tne grouping of the chief incidents of a topic 
around the life of the most prominent or interesting man concerned, and upon the 
ability of the teacher both to tell and get the children to tell such stories in a brief, 
accurate, comprehensive, and attractive manner. 
Public Reading and Speaking. 
I. Reading—What is good reading; how vicious habits are acquired; how they 
may be corrected ; indistinct articulation; faulty inflections; emphasis; subject- 
matter.
-P-A-G-E-40
» 
—39— \ 
II. Speaking—Teaching children to declaim; selection of material; breathing; 
management of the voice; posture, gesture, etc. 
My great desire was to impress the value of natural, distinct, forcible reading 
and speaking, and to discourage the ranting and acting which has so often mas- 
queraded under the guise of “elocution.” 
History of Tennessee. 
I. Early settlement. 
II. The State of Franklin. 
III. Admission to the Union and administration of Sevier. 
Treatment of the subject may be seen from the method of United States History. 
Constitution of the United States. 
I. Articles of confederation, weakness of; history of the convention; the com- 
promises ; the constitution itself. 
II. Amendments to the constitution; history of best methods of teaching; analy- 
sis of. 
Physiology. 
I. Exhibition of the organs by means of the manikin; their relative positions 
in the body and chief functions, with talk on the hygiene of the school-room. 
The lecturers on United States history occupied the hour daily from 9 to 10, the 
others from i0 to 11. Average attendance on the former, 56; on the latter, 51. 
I am gratified to add that I have never seen more marked attention and interest. 
The earnestness of the large majority of these teachers, and their eagerness to get 
anything that would be of service to them and their classes is most hopeful. 
The classes of next year will finish the histories of the United States and of 
Tennessee. Subjects for the other lectures will be announced later. 
Respectfully submitted, 
T. W. Jorpan.

WEST TENNESSEE, 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent Public Instruction : 
Dear Str—We have the honor to submit the following report of the Peabody 
State Institute, held at Jackson, beginning July 9, and continuing four weeks: 
The faculty, consisting of Thomas H. Paine, Wharton S. Jones, G. R. McGee 
Price Thomas and S. A. Mynders held a meeting on the 31st of March and ar- 
ranged the work. The institute was well advertised by circulars and letters. The 
local board at Jackson showed great interest in the work, and did everything pos- 
sible to make it a success. They arranged the large and beautiful West Jackson 
building for the meeting, and provided for all necessary local committees and 
arrangements. 
The institute met on the morning of July 9, with Thomas H. Paine as Presi- 
dent and S. A. Mynders Secretary. Miss Martha Fleming, of Jackson, was made 
Assistant Secretary. The daily sessions were announced to commence at 8:00 a.m. 
and to close at 1:00 p.m. 
Notwithstanding the institute opened at a time when trains were not running 
on some of the most prominent railroads in West Tennessee, owing to the great 
strike, our opening attendance was very encouraging. We enrolled one hundred 
and eighty teachers, and had a good attendance of citizens. Of the teachers en-
-P-A-G-E-43
Apes 
rolled, one hundred were from other counties than Madison. This shows that the 
influence was not purely local in its nature, but reached out over this entire sec- 
tion of the State. The attendance was regular. Nearly all teachers enrolled were 
present at every session, and manifested intense interest in all the proceedings. 
As the plan provided for a different work from that of our former institutes, we 
watched the results with a good deal of interest. 
The teachers had evidently obeyed the instructions given in the syllabus, and 
made preparation in the branches to be taught, as well as the professional work 
for the first year. All of the instructors departed from the old lecture system, con- 
ducting regular recitations, and giving attention to both subject-matter and methods. 
Thomas H. Painé, as instructor in school law, institutes, civil government, etc., 
gave daily instruction in the history and work of the public school system in Ten- 
nessee, emphasizing the valuable services of the agent and trustees of the Peabody 
Education Fund in the development of the system. He also gave lessons in civil 
government and school management. 
Wharton S. Jones, of Memphis, gave daily instruction in mental and practical 
arithmetic, His recitations emphasized the necessity of a careful study of princi- 
ples as well as formule. Every subject in the practical arithmetic was reviewed 
with the class, and they were given original work and ‘exercises. The mental 
arithmetic drills were very interesting. Many experienced teachers, that have 
been attending institutes for years, pronounced the work of Mr. Jones the best they 
had ever had on the subject. 
Mr. G. R. McGee, of Trenton, on the subject of history, reviewed the subject of 
United States and Tennessee history by means of outlines and topics, given from 
the blackboard. The teachers studied these closely, and their daily recitations 
showed the wisdom of Mr. McGee in the selection of his method of doing the work. 
In addition to the regular recitations, he gave, by means of lectures, the benefit of 
his extensive researches and reading. 
Mr. Price Thomas, of Union City, gave instruction in primary methods and 
elementary science. He emphasized the importance of teaching by simple scien- 
tific experiments and object lessons in primary grades. His instruction was well 
received by the teachers, as evidenced by their close attention and notes. 
S. A. Mynders had the department of pedagogy, applied psychology, and En- 
glish. He used as a text-book Dr. Payne’s revision of “ Page’s Theory and Prac- 
tice of Teaching,” and gave lectures on principles of applied psychology. In En- 
glish, he gave model recitations in language lessons, composition work, literature 
teaching in primary grades, technical grammar, etc. 
Miss Jennie Dyer, of Mississippi, a graduate of the Cook County Normal, gave 
lessons in structural geography, sand molding, etc. Teachers were sent to the 
blackboard and sand tables, and required to do the work. Her work was of a very 
high order, and opened a new field to many of our teachers. 
Capt. W. R. Garrett, ex-State Superintendent, was present one week, and added 
greatly to the success of the institute. His work is too well known to need any de- 
tailed report. His excellent lectures on history, school law, etc., will be remem- 
bered by those present as among the’ most pleasaut and valuable features of the 
meeting. 
Prof. Jameson, of the commercial department of the Southwestern Baptist Uni- 
versity, gave lessons daily in penmanship. The teachers present showed their ap- 
_preciation for the services of this practical and expert teacher.
-P-A-G-E-44
Peggul 
At the close of the month’s work written examinations were held on all the sub- 
jects taught. A report of these examinations will be kept in the faculty register. 
The results were very satisfactory. 
In all our work we endeavored to impress upon the teachers the great responsi- 
bility of their position, and the necessity of a thorough knowledgy of child-nature 
and development, as well as subjects to be taught. The leading thought through- 
out the entire work was the elevation of the teaching force, and giving a higher 
conception of the teacher’s work and profession. 
We, as a faculty, after witnessing and reviewing the year’s work, are pleased to 
report that we regard the plan and work as eminently successful, and we most cor- 
dially indorse the action of State Superintendent Smith in holding these central 
institutes, with a regular course of study. It reaches the great body of teachers, 
actively in the work, who are not able to attend the Peabody Normal College. 
They are studying. While for this, the first year, our work was only on the pri- 
mary school branches, teachers were instructed to make preparation for the next 
year in the secondary branches and the professional work laid down in the insti- 
tute syllabus, 
The faculty unanimously adopted the following resolution : 
Resolved, That at each annual session a special programme of exercises be pre- 
ared and carried out, in commemoration of the life and philanthropy of George 
eabody, and in presenting as an important part of the educational history of Ten- 
nessee, the invaluable services of the General Agent and Board of Trustees of the 
Peabody Education Fund. 
Very respectfully submitted, 
S. A. Mynpers, Tomas H. Payne, 
Secretary of Faculty. President of Faculty. 
AvGUST 3, 1894, 
Country SUPERVISION. 
A serious defect in our law is that incompetent persons are elected 
to the position of County Superintendent. 
The law requires that the County Superintendent shall be a 
“person of literary and scientific attainments.” In many counties 
this is ignored, and persons are elected who have no qualification 
to render them either useful or respectable in the office. We 
should do, as a great majority of the States have done: require the 
applicants for the position of County Superintendent to undergo an 
examination before they are eligible to election to that responsible 
position. Teachers are required to undergo an annual examination 
before they can contract to teach school. How much more im- 
portant that the County Superintendent shall be competent to dis- 
charge the duties of the office he seeks. This office of County Su- 
perintendent is by far the most important position of the entire 
school system, and such restrictions thrown around it as will keep 
it in the hands of those who are competent to discharge the duties 
of the same.
-P-A-G-E-45
OrEAN 
The city authorities know full well the importance of intelligent 
supervision, and select none except those who are entirely compe- 
tent in every way to supervise the schools. How different in the 
counties! Many persons have been selected because they were ob- 
jects of charity. Iam sorry to make this statement and let it go 
to the world that such has been done in Tennessee, but the fact re- 
mains, and a remedy should be provided. 
WATER CLOSETS. 
There is need of radic1l changes in the water closets now in use 
in the country districts. I have not the language to describe some 
of these that I have seen. They are simply an outrage upon de- 
cency, and some legislation is needed to force the district directors 
to provide suitable closets, and keep the same in proper condition. 
TEACHERS’ OFRTIFICATES. 
The grade of certificates has been advanced so that a first grade 
certificate requires an average of 85 per cent. on all the subjects re- 
quired to be taught in a secondary school. A second grade certifi- 
cate is the same as a first grade, except it requires an average of only 
65 per cent. A third grade certificate embraces the subjects of the 
primary course, with an average of 85 percent. This is a step far 
in advance of the requirements of former years; but I am firmly of 
the opinion that no one is competent to teach whose scholarship is 
not broader than the branches required to be taught. 
The time has come when a teachers’s certificate should mean 
something more than a mere license to teach. It should mean that 
a person holding a first grade certificate has the soundness of char- 
acter and cultivation of mind to be worthy of admission into the 
best of American homes.

The tables 9 and 10 show the financial condition of the various 
‘counties. This table is not correct, because the books of many 
Trustees are so kept that a correct statement cannot be given. A 
table of errors has formerly been given, but this has done no good. 
An effort has been made to correct the returns as they came in from 
the counties; but when this could not be done, I have given the 
figures as received. Something must be done to protect the school 
fund. The counties of Claiborne, Clay, Perry, Putnam and War- 
ren failed to make any financial report.

  EXTRACTS FROM ANNUAL REPORTS : 
OF 
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
ANDERSON COUNTY. 
  
W. W. Unprerwoop, Superintendent. 
  
I send you herewith my annual’ report. We have more money 
and a better grade of teachers this year. Consequently, I think 
our schools will be much better. 
My brother and I visited all the schools in August, and I am 
now teaching at Coal Creek. I hope to see the time in the near 
future when the county will pay the superintendent enough to 
justify him in devoting his whole time to the work. 
BLEDSOE COUNTY. 
  
S. W. McReynotps, Superintendent. 
  
Enclosed please find my second annual report for Bledsoe County. 
Our school work is improving. Teachers are taking more interest
-P-A-G-E-110
—i1ll— 
in institutes and in the reading circle. We have one library estab- 
lished. Our County Court made a very liberal increase in school 
levy. Viewing the field from every standpoint, I think the cause 
is looking upward. 
My salary is only $150. I send you a list of directors. 
BRADLEY COUNTY. 
  
J. J. Harrison, Superintendent. 
  
I herewith submit my second annual report of the schools of 
Bradley County, and will say that the decrease in the average num- 
ber of days taught this year was caused by the schools running too 
long last year, which caused the districts to be in debt. 
Iam under many obligations to the teachers and directors of my 
county for being so prompt in sending in their reports. I have had 
but little trouble along this line this year. 
Our teachers are wide awake, and are doing nobler and better 
work every year, although most of them are young men. 
You will notice that the salaries of the teachers are not quite so 
high as last year, as the public funds were not so large, and on ac- 
count of the depression in financial affairs. 
Our teachers were somewhat disappointed when the State Insti- 
tute, which was to have been held at Chattanooga, was called in; 
and we now appeal to you to give us an institute there next year, 
We think that much good could be done for this and adjoining 
counties if an annual institute were permanently located at Charles- 
ton.
-P-A-G-E-111
—112— 
  CAMPBELL COUNTY. 
  
Rurna B. Davis, Superintendent. 
  
I enclose my second annual report for the year ending June 30, 
1893. I have used every effort to get my report exact, and I 
think I have it very near. 
Our normal began July 16, and continued two weeks. We had 
185 enrolled. We received valuable instructions from our con- 
ductor, J. W. Hyden, of Knoxville; Capt. C. Douglas, of Galla- 
tin, and Superintendent Ford, of Knox County. We were visited 
by many good educators, and still meet every two weeks in an in- 
stitute. Our good people are all on a stir in the educational work. 
I have visited most all the schools in my county, and intend to 
still visit until they close, I can say every teacher is using the 
best material in the school-room. We are haying better work and 
attendance than has ever been known before. We have a library 
started and it still continues to grow, but we need more money and 
better houses, and trust we may soon reach this point, for we are 
all working together as one true team, and desire our county in the 
front. 
CANNON COUNTY. 
  
W. N. MitcHeExt, Superintendent. 
  
I have been delayed in sending in my annual report. I was ap- 
pointed the 16th of October to fill out the unexpired term of E. 
Mears. His reports, in many instances, had not been sent in, so I 
was forced to go to nearly all the districts before making my re- 
port. The districts are all out of debt at this time. The school 
term is entirely too short to accomplish much in educating the
-P-A-G-E-112
—1138— 
children of the county. The worst drawback in the schools isa — 
need of sufficient money to run a five-months’ term. 
We have'a number of good private schools in the county, which 
are well attended and doing much to raise the standard of educa- 
tion. 
CARROLL COUNTY. 
G. P. WurrEHoRN, Superintendent. 
Herewith find enclosed annual report for Carroll County, which 
is as nearly correct as I can make it from reports received. 
Our schools are in better condition than ever before. 
CARTER COUNTY. 
M. D. ALLEN, Superintendent. 
I herewith submit my annual report. Our schools are doing 
well; directors and patrons interested. I held a county normal in 
July, which was well attended. I also held four teachers’ insti- 
tutes during the school term. They, together with almost constant 
work on my part, increased the attendance more than 20 per cent. 
Our teachers are awake to their duty, and excellent results will 
follow. 
Our County Court is beginning to believe in longer and better 
schools ; hence, our fund is increased nearly 30 per cent. over last 
year, which will give us more than five months this year.

-P-A-G-E-113

  There is a marked improvement in educational work all along 
the line. The joint normal for Johnson and Carter, which you 
kindly gave us, was a grand success. There were nearly a hundred 
teachers in attendance all- the time. It was the best normal we 
have ever had. Prof. John W. Hyden, the conductor, did most 
excellent work. Asa normal conductor he has no superior. He. 
was ably assisted by Prof. R. H. Freeland, who gave general satis- 
faction. The conductors more than pleased all, and we hope that 
we will have them again. 
The teachers and superintendents of both counties highly appre- 
ciate your favor in giving us the State normal. 
COCKE COUNTY. 
W. J. Hatiey, Superintendent. 
I herewith enclose you my annual report for the year ending 
June 30, 1894: 
Iam proud to state that we are making some progress in the 
educational cause. The schools of this county are gradually im- 
proving. We have adopted a uniform series of text-books to come 
into use as the old books are worn out. 
The adopted books are now used more or less in all the schools 
of the county, and I think they will be used exclusively in a short 
time. 
‘We enjoyed a very successful County Institute the second week 
in July, conducted by Superintendent E. M. Wright, of Greene 
County. There were more than 100 teachers in daily attendance. 
We tender our sincere thanks to Miss Lena Bible for her suc- 
cessful and efficient services as organist. We also thank Dr. J. F.
-P-A-G-E-114
—115— 
Spence, Profs. W. A. Wright, Josiah Holbrook, R. P. Driskill, H. 
F. Ketson, the Walker brothers and others for their interesting 
lectures delivered during the institute. They are all good educa- 
tional workers, and we hope they will be with us again. 
CROCKETT COUNTY. 
J. R. McDona xp, Superintendent. 
  
Enclosed find my report for year ending June 30, 1894. Our 
population shows a slight increase over last year. Our. white 
. teachers are doing better teaching than ever before. I can’t say 
much for the colored schools. 
Some of our directors are fully alive to the importance of their 
work. 
The best institute last summer we ever had. It lasted two weeks; 
colored institute one week. I conducted both, but was ably assisted 
by our teachers. We succeeded in haying our County Court to 
visit the institute in a body. All seemed to be highly pleased. 
The educational force of Crockett County want Supt. Frank M. 
Smith to “live long” and prosper. 
CUMBERLAND COUNTY. 
8. C. Brown, Superintendent. 
  
I have the honor to herewith submit my second annual report, 
and in doing so I am pleased to report favorable conditions in the 
public schools of Cumberland County. There has been no cessation 
in keeping alive the educational interests of the county. The sys- 
tem in this county is gradually growing better with each year.
-P-A-G-E-115
  —116— 
I held a teachers’ institute at Crossville the last week in June, 
conducted principally by Prof. J. 8. Cline, principal of the Cross- 
ville school. 
A splendid attendance was had, and much interest manifested. 
The institute was interspersed with written examinations of appli- 
cants to teach. 
Tuesday evening, Rev. H. E. Partridge, pastor of the Congre- 
gational Church at Crossville, delivered a very appropriate lecture _ 
on the “ Moral Qualifications of the Teachers.” Thursday evening ; 
a general educational address, which delighted and entertained all, 
was delivered by Rey. Dr. John F. Spence, Chancellor of the 
American Temperance University. 
Since the schools opened this fall I have held six institutes and _ 
mass meetings combined, giving the forenoons to institute work and 
the afternoons to literary renditions and public addresses, while 
bounteoues picnic dinners were served as the noon repasts. 
These meetings rapidly mould public sentiment towards the public 
school course. 
Most of our teachers are awake to their duties, and are assisting, 
with their devotion, in elevating the standard of education. 
Our County Court has been very public spirited for the last few 
years, having given us the highest rate of school tax of any other 
county in the State, and it is hoped that the new court may do as 
well. 
DAVIDSON COUNTY. 
A. H. Wrieut, Superintendent. 
I beg leave to enclose my second annual report. You will see 
that it is not quite as good as it was last year in the point of en- 
rollment and attendance. This is caused by the decrease in 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  —117— 
scholastic population, as you will see by referring to that item ; 
otherwise we have had a very successful year. Each year seems 
to be an improvement on the previous year. Indications point to 
still greater success, though our finances seem to be shorter this 
year than common. Our directors are trying to offset the deficit 
in funds by being as economical as possible, and thereby hope to 
run the schools as long as usual. 
DYER COUNTY. 
Miss Mouure Pierce, Superintendent. 
  
I herewith submit my fourth annual report of the schools of Dyer 
County. Increased interest on the part of both teachers and 
directors have been manifested. 
The idea of making the school and civil districts identical is fast 
becoming a popular one, and I hope in another year to have them 
the same. 
Power of local taxation conferred on school districts by consti- 
tutional amendment would be a good thing for each county. 
In licensing teachers I adhered strictly to the plan given in 
your circular of February 10, and the standard of qualifications is 
therefore two-thirds greater in Dyer County. ~ 
FENTRESS COUNTY. 
  
W. D. Smira, Superintendent. 
  
Enclosed you will find my first annual te of the public 
schools of Fentress County.
-P-A-G-E-117
  —118— 
I am glad to say that our schools are doing better work that 
Iever observed before, considering the shortness of our terms. 
This conclusion is based on my visits and general expressions from 
the patrons and friends of education. The delay in making my 
report was caused by the directors failing to make their reports 
promptly. However, I am glad to say that some kind of reports 
have been received from every clerk. All of the schools are not 
graded, but the system is gradually spreading throughout the 
county, and perhaps by the end of another year nearly, if not all, 
the schools will be graded. 
Our county normal institute, conducted by Prof. John Lacy, a 
graduate of the Alpine Institute, was a complete success. Forty- 
six teachers were in attendance. : 
Upon the whole I think the interest of education is on rising 
ground in Fentress County. But to raise education to the point it 
should be would take a long, hard, united effort of school officers, 
teachers and patrons. 
FRANKLIN COUNTY. 
Joon G. Hannan, Superintendent. 
  
I submit herewith my anoual report for the scholastic year end- 
ing June 30, 1894, 
Our schools were never in better condition ; attendance good, and 
our teachers giving better satisfaction. 
Our institute, conducted by Prof. A, D. Wharton, was a success. 
Seventy teachers were enrolled, and many of them manifested great 
interest in the work. We feel very grateful to Profs. H. H. Hor- 
ton, J. B. Parks, and Miss Lizzie Clark, of the Winchester Nor- 
mal, for valuable work in the institute. The teachers gave a vote
-P-A-G-E-118
Songs 
of thanks to President Clark for his kindness in letting us have the 
use of the Normal building. 
The Winchester Normal and Terrell College are furnishing two- 
thirds of the teachers for our public schools, and they teach as they 
have been taught, and success is generally the result. 
Our schools are progressing and our teachers are giving general 
satisfaction. 
GIBSON COUNTY. 
  
J. M. Baxgr, Superintendent. 
  
Enclosed find the annual report of the County Superintendent of 
Gibson County for the year ending June 30, 1894. I believe it is 
correct in the main. I have received reports from nearly every 
clerk in the county, which shows a decided improvement on the 
part of the directors. The interest in behalf of education in Gib- 
son County is gradually growing. The people of various commu- 
nities are speaking out for high schools and are uniting private. 
means with the public funds to sustain eight and ten month 
schools. 
The Gibson County Teachers’ Circulating Library Association is 
growing and is accomplishing good results. To date we have 115 
volumes belonging to the Association, and about $50 in the 
treasury. 
The State and County Normal, conducted by Captain C. S. 
Douglass, was an unrivaled success for institute work in Gibson 
County. 
The teachers are all interested in monthly meetings, and I find 
great good resulting from meetings in which the teachers, directors 
and patrons take part.

GILES COUNTY. 
  
Merritt Esxiox, JR., Superintendent. 
  
I herewith submit my annual report for the scholastic year end- 
ing June 30, 1894. Owing to the failure of the trustee to report 
to me my report is incomplete. 
Our schools are in very good condition, and, I am glad to say, 
are still improving. I held two county institutes in June—one for 
the white and one for the colored teachers. The white institute 
was conducted by Capt. W. R. Garrett, of Nashville. About 110 
teachers were in attendance, and greater interest was manifested in 
institute work than ever before. é 
GRAINGER COUNTY. 
  
C. C. Justus, Superintendent. ve 
  
In submitting my fourth annual report of the public schools of 
Grainger County, I am pleased to report continued progress. We 
have about completed the work of grading—a work which is indis- 
pensable to our schools. The schools will continue in this line, 
bringing the work within the teacher’s grasp, and making the schol- 
arship of the pupils uniform, unless they are retarded by an ineffi- 
cient successor. 
By referring to the statistical report inclosed herewith, you will 
note an excess of enrollment and attendance over last year. We 
have built during the year four houses, at an average cost of $400.
-P-A-G-E-120
—121— 
We have expended $925 for globes, maps and charts, within the 
last two years—only 57 white schools, with a per capita of $1.25, 
we cast our “‘ mite into the treasury.” 
I not only visited the schools of my county last year, but several 
in other counties, including Knox. For system, order, neatness 
and efficiency, Grainger is keeping pace. The condition of her de- 
fect is her meager funds. Her people do not lack interest. 
The “circulating library,” which was permanently established 
October, 1893, is closing its first year’s work of reformation with | 
satisfactory results to all, and now numbers 200 volumes. We in- 
tend for it to grow with the progress of our schools. Such a library 
will reform the teaching of any county. 
The attendance at local institutes is opening with a parallel to 
792 and ’93. At five of these meetings last year we had an average 
attendance of 500. The “ Grainger County Teachers’ Association’? 
is largely attended, and is doing much to popularize public educa- 
tion. Circular programmes are issued in advance for both of these 
meetings. 
Our normal, which closed June 29, was one of the most pleasant 
and interesting ever held in the county. But for the State insti- 
tute last year, we would consider it the most beneficent of any in re- 
cent years. The seating capacity was crowded, and the average at-» 
tendance of county teachers exceeded her number of schools. 
Among the most interesting features of the normal was Wednesday 
night’s treat, “ Word Wonders,” by Prof. M..B. Aston. Dr. Chas. 
F. Bateman, of Union County, gave us two excellent lectures: 
“How Far a Teacher Should be Influenced by Public Opinion,” 
and “ Teachers’ Needs.” Revs. Wm. Senter and W. L. Winfrey 
made profitable addresses. Too much praise cannot be given Prof. 
J. C. Webster, of Hampton-Sidney, for his most efficient work, 
both as condutor and an instructor. Ex-Superintendent I. W. 
Daniel always deserves mention. 
Grainger County teachers are awakening in all the departments 
of their work. While many are young, yet they are aiming at pro- 
fessional work, and are striving to keep pace with the rapid educa-
-P-A-G-E-121
—122— 
tional progress of the times, They need encouragement, however ; 
for with the poet: 
“Of all professions that this world has known, 
From clowns and cobblers upwards to the throne; 
From the graye architect of Greece and Rome 
Down to the framer of a farthing broom, 
The worst for care and undeserved abuse, 
The first in real dignity and use, 
(If skilled to teach and diligent to rule,) 
Is the learned master of a little school.” 
The new board of directors is an improvement on the retiring 
board; however, the old was a good average. A few members of 
the old board, who thought females were incompetent to teach, were 
defeated, and I rejoice to see that the people know that such men 
are not competent to serve them. The new County Court is up 
with the times, I think, and I aim to open a campaign for addi- 
tional funds. 
I feel that a brighter day is dawning, and that Grainger will con- 
tinue her march of progress. While I have enjoyed my four years 
of superintendence in full measure, yet I feel that by reason of the 
meager salary it were, financially, “a martyrdom to live.” So I 
trust that my successor may have a more pleasant and successful ad- 
ministration, and that the lamp of progress will hold out to burn 
until every school-house becomes a citizen of the highest civiliza- 
tior, where both teacher and pupil believes that ‘the gods help 
those who help themselves.” 
P.S. Since writing the above a ‘joint institute for Grainger, 
Knox and Union was held at Blaine (a town on the M. & C. G. 
Railroad, in Grainger), which deserves mention. The large attend- 
ance, picnic dinner, excellent music, bright day, pretty academy 
and town, made it the climax institute of the year. An address 
on “The Public Schools of Tennessee,” by Superintendent J. C. 
Ford, of Knoxville, was the treat of the day. Addresses by Miss 
Lena Thompson, of Knox; ex-Superintendent J. W. Daniel and J. 
C. Webster, of Grainger, were above par. 
The new academy, with Webster as principal, indicates that 
Blaine is to become an educational center.

GREENE COUNTY. 
E. M. Wriaeut, Superintendent. 
Our schools are doing remarkably well. Our worthy court favors 
public education ; hence we have a good fund. The average term 
- is five months, with an average daily attendance of 9,600 pupils. 
I have devoted considerable time to institute work. Ten thou- 
sand persons have attended our institutes during the past two years. 
Needs—We need better supervision; better teaching; more 
“money; comfortable desks; good blackboards; a few more com- 
modious school-houses, and last, but not least, a teachers’ training 
school. 
The institute cannot serve the purpose of a training school. We 
boast of our schools, but our schools do comparatively little for 
want of efficient instructors. 
One of the surest signs of the regeneration of society will be the 
elevation of the art of teaching to the highest rank in the commu- 
- nity. 
The teacher needs more than a knowledge of the philosophy of 
teaching; more than the statement of the formal modes of teaching. 
He needs practical illustration. He needs practice under the eye of 
experienced educators. Therefore the training school is a necessity. 
Ezaminations—I am of the opinion that we could have uniform 
examinations. It occurs to me that the Public School Officers’ As- 
sociation could authorize and empower a committee to prepare a 
list of questions for various applicants throughout the State, and 
by this means secure uniformity in every county. 
A certificate issued by the Superintendent of Washington County 
would be good in any other county in Tennessee without further 
examination. Such a measure would be fair, just and right.

Mothers’ Day Celebration—I shall recommend that Enda Dee. 
14, be observed as Mothers’ Day. 
On this day the parents will be invited to visit the schools; the 
pupils will be required to prepare and recite appropriate selections 
on Mother, Home, ete. 
GRUNDY COUNTY. 
L. V. Woopieg, Superintendent. 
  
Enclosed please find my fourth annual roport of the schools of 
Grundy County. 
On account of the negligence and carelessness of the directors 
and most of the teachers in sending in their reports my report is 
made at the last minute allowed me. I have just returned from a 
two weeks’ visit over the county getting up their reports. 
The schools of Grundy County are reasonably well up and an 
increased interest is being manifested in some localities, but as a 
general thing more vim and enthusiasm are needed. 
HAMBLEN COUNTY. 
E. H. Moors, Superintendent. 
  
Iam glad that I can report progress for Hamblen County. In 
many respects she is making progress. 
In the first place I have prepared a graded course of study and 
had it published in pamphlet form and a copy of it placed in the 
hands of every director‘and teacher. I have explained to them 
the law and shown them their duty, the result of which is graded
-P-A-G-E-124
  —-125-- 
schools and a uniformity of books. Two things have been accom- 
plished, upon which depends the success of schools. 
Secondly, our institutes are a success. They have created an in- 
terest among the teachers, directors and patrons. They haye 
caused the teachers to feel that their work is a profession, and to 
_ keep abreast of the times they must prepare for teaching as pre-— 
paring for any other profession. So it is not an uncommon thing 
to find in the possession of the teachers such books as “ Parker’s 
Talks and Teaching,” White’s Pedagogy, Watts on the Mind, ete. 
We have organized a teachers’ library association, which I think 
will soon be in good working order. We have raised the standard 
of examinations, and by so doing it has raised the standard of 
schools. I visited all the schools twice and some three times, and 
each visit proved that the cause of education is advancing in Ham- 
blen County. 
HAMILTON COUNTY. 
H. D. HurraxkeEr, Superintendent. 
The schools of Hamilton County are in excellent condition. 
The attendance is larger than ever before, and our directors and 
teachers are doing much to make the work more efficient. 
I give herewith a statement showing the condition of the 
schools July 1, 1894, as compared with their standing in July, 
1886, covering a period of eight years, which will give you a fair 
idea of our educational advancement. It is as follows:

From the above figures it will be seen that the scholastic popu- 
lation has increased in eight years 82.4 per cent.; the number of 
schools, 830 per cent.; the number of teachers, 70.1 per cent.; the 
length of term, 14 per cent.; the average salary, 22.7 per cent. ; 
value of school-houses and grounds, 326.9 per cent.; value of fur- 
niture and apparatus, 3,102.8 per cent. ; total value of school prop- 
erty, 392.2 per cent.; total school fund, 121.6 per cent., from: 
which we find the average per cent. of increase of the school facili- 
ties in eight years to be 471.3 per cent. It may be well to state 
further that during this period the schools have been graded; text 
books made uniform, thereby saving the people thousands of dol- 
lars annually; a system of graduating pupils from the public 
schools put into successful operation ; circulating libraries of pro- 
fessional books for teachers established, and a general awakening 
of interest in educational matters has been felt, not only in the 
centers of population, but likewise has reached the remotest cor- 
ners of the county, until now a comfortable school-house may be 
found in every community. 
‘  HARDEMAN COUNTY. 
I. N. Rowanp, Superintendent. 
Herewith please find my annual report. Upon some of the items 
it is not correct, owing to the carelessness of the directors in mak- 
ing their report to me. 
We had a State institute last summer, conducted by Prof. 8. A. 
Mynders. You have his report. 
We now have a teachers’ association, which meets monthly. We 
hope much good will be the outgrowth.

Joun T, Harpin, Superintendent. 
The schools of Hardin County are in a thrifty condition. The 
greatest trouble with which we meet is the want of money, that 
our terms might be longer. The general average is fifty days to 
the district in this county. We have some fair teachers in the 
public school work in this county. We have quite a number of 
young teachers who are not very well qualified, but we notice some 
improyement in the last year. Our public school fund is so light 
that most of the districts have school every two years only. 
HAYWOOD COUNTY. 
  
W. A. Tanner, Superintendent. 
I herewith submit my third annual report, which, though a little 
late, I hope is on time. We have had a better teaching force the 
_ past year than any previous one during my official term. Our 
teachers are beginning to realize the importance of a more thor- 
ough preparation for the responsible position of instructors of the 
young. I think our public schools are constantly growing in in- 
terest and usefulness and in popularity with all classes of people. 
I have visited all the schools in the county and many of them the 
second time, and am better satisfied with their condition than in 
the past years. 
We held two county normals in June and July, continuing one 
week each. The attendance of the teachers was 50 per cent. 
larger than heretofore and the interest about in the same ratio. I 
feel sure that Haywood County is gaining ground in educational 
interest.

reports of directors. 
JAMES COUNTY. 
  
J. D. Campse, Superintendent. 
  
T herewith submit my sixth annual report of the schools of James 
County, Tenn., for the scholastic year ending June 30, 1894. 
My tardiness is solely due to the tardiness of the Trustee in 
making his financial report. Hope this report will come to your 
office in due time. 
We have by far the best corps of teachers this year that we have 
ever had, one-third of whom are lady teachers. On visiting the 
schools I found them well attended. Three-fourths of the schools 
this year have been instructed in normal studies, to-wit: Knox- 
ville, Fountain City, Peabody and Richwood Normal. 
At our teachers’ normal last July our teachers passed a resolution 
that all teachers in James County shall stand an examination in 
History of Education, Pedigogy and Theory and Practice before 
they can be licensed to teach. 
I think we are in the right road, but somewhat in the rear. I 
know that there’is more development and less mere advancement than 
ever before. The greatest lack of our county now is money to make 
our school terms longer.

JEFFERSON COUNTY. 
  
D. C. Hrx1, Superintendent. 
  
Enclosed find my fourth annual report. I am proud to state 
that the educational interests of Jefferson County are greater than 
at any former period. The improvement in our schools is slow but 
sure. The teachers are doing much better work ; they attend the 
normal and institutes, and seem to be wide awake, and want to 
keep up with all the late methods of teaching. They are beginning 
to realize the fact that they must keep up their reading and 
studies or get out of the work. If I could only get the directors 
and patrons as much interested in the welfare of the schools as the 
teachers are, I would feel that I had won a great victory, and it 
would be but a short time until Jefferson County would be second 
to none in the State in the way of education. 
The colored people seem to be greatly interested in education. I 
held two normals, one week each, for the white and colored in the 
month of July. My board of examiners consisted of four of the 
ablest educators we have in the public school work. We examined 
two or more of the branches of the public school course each day, 
and it proved to be a great success. About 85 per cent. of the 
teachers were in attendance. I have visited most all of the schools 
and made brief talks. I am going to make an effort to get our 
County Court to levy a heavier school tax and give us more money 
at the next January term. 
Should I be re-elected I will make a great effort to get the di- 
rectors and patrons more enthusiastic over the subject of education. 
One of the greatest disadvantages to our schools is that we have 
too many. We have eighthty-three schools, and should have about 
fifty-eight only. Lessen the number of schools, and that will give 
us better, larger and longer schools. 
JOHNSON COUNTY.

The State Institute held at Butler, this county, for Johnson and 
Carter, two weeks in July, and conducted by Prof. John W. 
Hyden, Superintendent of Hampden Sydney School, Knoxville, and — 
assisted by Prof. R. H. Freeland, Superintendent of Johnson City 
schools, was a grand success; ninety-five teachers were enrolled 
and 250 visitors. This institute was of great benefit to the teach- 
ers of the county, creating an educational enthusiasm that has been 
productive of much good in interesting patrons, and the result is 
that I ‘have found a larger enrollment and better attendance this 
year than I have ever found in the schools of the county before. 
We are getting a start on a teachers’ circulating library, which I 
am sure will be of much benefit to the teachers of the county. 
We have permanently established a Directors’ Association, which 
meets in April and August. Although we have had but four meet- 
ings I can see that it has already been productive of much good, 
and I am satisfied that this association can be made a very impor- 
tant factor in creating an educational interest in the county. 
I have visited all the schools in the county, made short talks at 
the most of them, and am talking and working for an educational 
revival in general. -

I herewith submit my annual report, in which I am pleased to 
to state that our schools are in a better condition and more im- 
proved than ever before. Also have a better grade of teachers, 
who seem more interested in fitting themselves for the work, not- 
withstanding they cannot be induced to attend institutes and take 
part in them. I presume, in some instances, the higher examina- 
tion stimulated to greater ambition to fit themselves for better

work. Have an increased tax for school purposes, which will 
admit of longer terms hereafter. 
LEWIS COUNTY. 
  
Baski HeNsiEy, Superintendent. 
  
In connection with my annual report I desire to say that the 
schools of my county are improving. Most of the teachers are 
alive to the times, and are doing good work. We had a very suc- 
cessful institute in our county of ten days’ duration, conducted by 
Prof. W. F. Davis and Mrs. D. B. Evans, of Nashville. The seed 
sown by those very worthy educators has already produced good 
results. We have a monthly institute which meets once a month. 
This is doing great good in inspiring interest among our teachers. 
In the matter of grading I will say that I have endeavored to 
have all the schools graded the best I could, but in our county, 
where we have such a variety of books, it is very difficult. I have 
been trying to have a uniform system of books adopted. 
LOUDON COUNTY. 
  
Joun T. HENDERSON, Superintendent. 
Our county is increasing in educational interest. The schools, on 
an ayerage, are better taught this year than they were last year. 
The people generally are taking more notice of what is going on at 
the schools. I am well pleased with the increased interest among 
the people. Six new houses have been erected within a little more 
than one year.
-P-A-G-E-131

The county institute was held one week in July. Superintend- 
ent E. M. Wright, of Greene County, conducted it. It was, per- 
haps, the most interesting institute ever held in this county. On 
the different nights interesting addresses were delivered by Judge 
Rodgers, of Loudon; Superintendent. Wright, of Greeneville ; 
President Holbrook, of Knoxville; Chancellor J. F. Spence, of 
Harriman. Beside these gentlemen, several other prominent edu- 
eators from Knoxville, Harriman, Athens, Sweetwater and Chatta- 
nooga, were with us at different times, and added much to the in- 
terest of the work. Several one or two-day institutes have been 
held since the schools opened. 
I have arranged a graded course of study for our schools; have 
had enough printed for nearly every family. I have monthly grade 
blanks printed for all students in the public schools; so I think 
that by another year we will have a good graded system in opera- 
tion. '

Enclosed please find my report of the schools of Macon County. 
Think it is as nearly correct as it is possible to make it, from the 
reports and statistics I have been able to gather. I have done 
everything in my power to get our directors and teachers to make 
out their reports at the proper time, but have not fully succeeded 
in getting this done. However, Iam proud to say that the cause 
of education is advancing in the county of Macon, and while our 
schools are not what they should be, still there is a marked im- 
provement in them. 
I have visited all of the schools of the county, and have tried in 
the best way I knew to encourage them and to instill into them a 
new life in the direction of a more perfect educational system,

MADISON COUNTY. 
Tuomas H. Drake, Superintendent. 
Enclosed you will find my annual report. I would not try to 
make the impression that the schools of our county have reached 
anything like perfection, but I am safe in saying that it is the ver- 
dict of the people that the schools of Madison County have made 
commendable progress in the last few years. The popular impres- 
sion of a few years ago that any one who could read, write and 
cipher some, was qualified to teach a primary school, has been 
abandoned by directors and by patrons. The full importance of 
correct primary teaching is not yet recognized by all, but the intro- 
duction of improved methods into the country schools by pro- 
gressive teachers has made a favorable impression, giving us reason 
to hope that in a short time the fact will be generally accepted, that 
if there is any place in our school system where adepts are needed 
it isin our primary schools. Nearly all our directors are now on 
inquiry for teachers who have madesome preparation for their work, 
in addition to that of simply having gone through a course of school 
study. 
I can attribute this favorable change to nothing else so much as 
to the presence in our midst of a well conducted institute for the last 
three summers. In this connection I take pleasure in referring to 
the Peabody State Institute for West Tennessee, held in Jackson 
July last. It is sufficient for me to say that of the 180 teachers 
present about 50 were of the active teaching force of the country 
schools of this county, and, as this is about the number of white 
teachers employed during the school term, I may state that all our 
teachers were present. Many of them were regular in their at- 
tendance, and manifested their interest by studious work. They 
have been rewarded as a rule by being placed in charge of our 
schools again. In my visitation of the schools since the institute, 
I find that the teachers have a new inspiration for their work ; that 
they caught some of the enthusiasm of the teachers whose instruc- 
tion they received in the summer school. While the faculty made
-P-A-G-E-133
  —134— 
no effort to display their learning, they presented many of the sub- 
jects in such a way as to impress forcibly upon our teachers the fact 
that mere text-book knowledge does not constitute teaching quali- 
fication, and that to interest and profitably instruct pupils, teachers 
must draw from other sources than the book in hand. 
This is inciting our teachers to broader culture in the field of gen- 
eral knowledge, and must soon result in good to the children of our 
country. 
In conclusion, I must say that we were all pleased with the result 
of the institute, and that with this school located in our midst our 
teachers feel that they have something tangible for their improve- 
ment. We trust that every county may be fully represented another 
year, and raise the number to 400 or 500. 
MARION COUNTY. 
D. A. Tate, Superintendent. 
Our great drawback in school progress is lack of funds. Our 
people are becoming more and more interested in education, and 
the desire for more school tax is becoming general. 
My enclosed report is not as favorable as some of my former re- 
ports; but I think the reason for it is that I have succeeded in 
getting more accurate reports from the teachers and directors. 
I think our County Court will levy more school tax for 1895, and 
our schools will increase in importance and usefulness accordingly. 
In the amount of money received from the State there are three 
payments of interest included. For some cause one payment, due 
for 1892, was not paid until after the pro-rate was made.

McMINN COUNTY. 
  
N. B. Gororrn, Superintendent. 
After so long a time I send my first annual report to you, and 
under the circumstances it has been a rather hard task. The di- 
rectors’ reports, as sent in to me, have been very unsatisfactory, and 
it has been almost impossible for me to get exactly correct statistics 
as to the amount received from county, State, ete. I tried to get 
figures from the private schools, but failed to get all, so, as you see, 
T left that blank. 
I think on the whole that our county is coming to the front 
right along, and I am doing everything in my power to advance 
the educational interest all over the county. 
Another great trouble is the number of school “districts. I 
think if we could abolish all except the civil districts we would be 
able to do things more satisfactorily. 
MEIGS COUNTY. 
A. GALLAHER, Superintendent. 
In submitting my second annual report, I take pleasure in stating 
that our schools are steadily improving. We have a good corps of 
teachers this year, and they are doing excellent work. Our great- 
est need is longer terms. The law (provides) says where the fund 
is not sufficient to run the schools five months the County Court 
shall make provision. Why is not the law enforced? We had 
sixty-two days last year—only fairly started and in good working 
order. : 
The time is surely coming the superintendents, teachers and pat- 
_ rons will unite in one grand effort for longer terms.

MONROE COUNTY.

Herewith find my report for the year ending June 30, 1894. 
A decided improvement over last year’s work is noted. 
Our county institute, held in Madisonville, was well attended, 
and was very profitable. 
A: teachers’ association has been organized, and a teachers’ library 
started. 
About seventy per cent. of our teachers take educational journals ; 
about twenty-five per cent. were in the Teachers’ Department at 
Hiwassee College during the spring term. 
Profs. J. L. Bachman, W. L. Lawrence, O. N. Smith, and Dr. 
J. M. Clemmer deserve special mention for their work at the county 
normal, : 
MONTGOMERY COUNTY. 
.   
P. L. Harnep, Superintendent. 
In Montgomery County the schools are doing well, but there is 
always room for improvement. I began earlier and worked harder 
to get a report of all the county schools in order that this, my 
fourth annual report, might be absolutely correct, but some few 
mistakes made by district clerks in their reports will occur, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
—137— 
this accounts for so small an increase in scholastic population over 
last year. 
The County Court appropriated $50 again this year for our 
library, and our county teachers’ library now affords its members 
a large number of books for their perusal. In addition to this, we 
have a course of pedagogical study through the school year, and 
about twenty-five to forty teachers are earnestly pursuing this 
course. In the regular monthly meetings the course of reading 
for the month is thoroughly discussed, and we can already see good 
results coming from it. We notice, too, that the teachers who take 
an active part in this are fast becoming our leading teachers, and 
draw the largest salaries paid. I am of the opinion that too many 
teachers are looking for a “royal road” to their profession, and 
such, as a general thing, never make a success. I do not think it 
a good plan for the State to appropriate money to educate the 
teachers. If the prcfession is not worth the money and time one 
spends in the preparation it is not worth anything. Not the proper 
class of people always seek for this free-for-all arrangement, and I 
strongly advocate the plan of the teacher’s spending his own time 
and money for his training, and, while we might not have so many, 
yet we would have a very high grade of teachers and high-grade 
schools. We have too many schools, unless they were better, and 
when we have fewer, but of a higher grade, there will be more 
good work done, The district that has several little schools taught 
by poorly-paid teachers is in a bad condition, viewing from an edu- 
eational standpoint. 
MORGAN COUNTY. 
J. N. NeEpHAM, Superintendent. 
  
I herewith submit my annual report for the year 1894, and it is 
not necessary to say that the required time is nearly gone.
-P-A-G-E-137
  —138— 
We have had but little trouble this year in securing full and com- 
plete returns from our directors. 
We do not wish to make Morgan County conspicuous, but rather 
let the prosperous tide flow smoothly on till she ranks, educationally, 
with any of her sister counties. : 
Our July institutes were a complete success. The one at Mt. 
Vernon was the leading institute of our county. We attribute this 
success to Prof. D, R. Case, one of our best teachers. . 
Weendeavored to follow your instructions as to licensing teachers ; 
by doing this we secured efficient teachers, and rid our schools of a 
number of incompetent teachers. 
This fall we have a body of workers that will compare favorably 
with any county in Tennessee. 
Now, if you find any gross errors in my report you will please 
inform me at once, and I shall try to correct the same. 
You may find a difference in my report and the trustee’s—he fails 
to report as he should, because the Superintendent is paid out of 
the county funds, and he did not so report. This being the case, I 
had to make changes before I could report correctly. I made 
changes and swapped in order to make this year’s report agree with 
last year’s. This did not change the financial condition of the county. — 
OBION COUNTY. 
J. H. Jackson, Superintendent. 
It affords me great pleasure in this, my third annual report as Su- 
perintendent of Public Schools for Obion County, to say that our 
schools are in a more prosperous condition than ever before in the 
history of Obion county. 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
    —139— 
Since my first annual report I have distributed seven hundred 
copies of our graded course of studies among the magistrates, direct- 
ors and teachers of this county, and thereby secured the interest and 
co-operation of nearly all our school officials in behalf of a graded 
system of school work. 
I have revised our graded course of study, and aim to have sey- 
eral hundred additional copies printed immediately, for distribution 
where they will give promise of the most effective results. 
Our adoption of a uniform system of text-books, July, 1892, af- 
- forded great assistance in our efforts in successfully grading our 
schools. 
Our annual institutes have caused an increased interest each suc- 
ceeding year in behalf of our public school system, and has very 
' greatly stimulated and developed an increased interest among our 
teachers, aiding us to reach a higher plane in the business and pro- 
fession of teaching. 
Two years ago we enrolled one hundred teachers in our institute 
work. Last year the number reached one hundred and fifty. This 
year we enrolled one hundred and eighty-two in our white insti- 
tute. The institute this year was conducted by Hon. Thomas H. 
Paine, of Jackson, Tenn.; Prof. W. A. Muse, of Rutherford, and 
Miss Ida Flynn, of Kenton. The institute was held in Union City, 
and was in session for ten days. The teachers and the public were 
unanimous and emphatic in their endorsement and loud in their 
praise of the excellent and practical results accomplished. 
A colored institute was held in Union City this year, during a 
session of ten days, under the able and approved supervision and 
management of Prof. Thos. MeMackin, of Union City graded col- 
ored schools. There were thirty-five teachers enrolled in this insti- 
tute. 
We have regular monthly meetings of white teachers, and also of 
colored teachers. The meetings are remarkably well attended, and 
have been productive of much good in a social and professional
-P-A-G-E-139
—140— 
  way. The associations for white teachers meets each succeeding 
time in different parts of the county, and thereby a much greater 
number of patrons and school directors is reached, whose co-oper- 
ation is necessary for successful school work. 
We have faithfully endeavored to carry out the suggestions of 
the State Superintendent and the school laws and regulations with 
reference to the examination of teachers, and have by this means © 
secured a better grade of teachers each year, which accounts for 
our having better schools now in Obion County than at any former 
period. All examinations of teachers are written and kept on file 
for reference for twelve months. Our teachers have come to real- 
ize that they belong to a great and important profession, and that 
success therein can be attained only by earnest, persistent and con- 
scientious effort. After our schools closed last year many of our 
teachers attended higher schools and this year are teaching in the 
same schools in which they taught last year. 
We are establishing a teachers’ library, which is meeting with 
considerable encouragement and gives cheering promise of success. 
In my judgment we have as a chief difficulty in the way of snecess 
too many small schools and too many school officials. 
By reference to my report you will find we have in this county 
eighty-nine school districts, consequently 267 school directors. 
The people seem to desire a school-house and a school taught 
within sight of every man’s dwelling. This renders it impossible 
to have good secondary schools, and, I might say, impossible to 
have first-class primary schools. 
It is my intention to recommend to our County Court the re- 
districting of our county for the purpose of reducing the number 
of schools and thereby secure better schools and longer terms at 
the same cost. Our last County Court, by making liberal appro- 
priations for county institutes, placed itself on record as the special 
friend of higher graded teachers, and consequently better schools. 
This course has greatly benefited the cause of education in our 
county. Our present County Court has many new magistrates, but 
I sincerely trust they will not take a backward step in this regard.

OVERTON COUNTY. 
JB. Lue, Superintendent. 
You will find enclosed my annual report for the scholastic year 
ending June 30, 1894. 
We held a summer institute of two weeks. Prof. A. J. Taylor 
was the conductor. The interest manifested was greater than 
usual. The attendance was eighty-four. Many distinguished per- 
sons visited us during the two weeks. 
Iam very proud to inform you that our county is taking great 
interest in education. 
PICKETT COUNTY. 
S. M. Turner, Superintendent. 
I herewith submit my annual report as Superintendent of Pick- 
ett County ; am late owing to a failure on the part of the trustee 
to hand in his report. The schools in this county are in a much 
better condition than three years ago. Teachers take a great deal 
more interest in their work and patrons are more closely looking 
after the school interest. 
We have a much higher grade of teachers, and the standard of 
education is looking up. 
We had no schools in this county last year owing to the fact 
that the money of each year was paying the schools of that year, 
and it was thought best to hold the schools out and get the system 
in such shape as the teacher could get his money when his work 
was done.
-P-A-G-E-141
—142— 
Our schools are not in as good condition as they would have been 
but for that fact, though greatly improved. 
We had a normal of two weeks in which the entire body of 
teachers in the county were present except two, and manifested 
great interest. 
I am of opinion that the greatest factor in our school system is 
the normal institutes which are being held over the State, and 
would suggest that no county superintendent allow any person to 
teach unless they attend an institute in the county where they in- 
tend teaching at least two weeks, and would prefer four weeks. 
The lady or gentleman who has not interest enough in schools 
and education to attend such institutes are teaching for revenue 
only, and will never become live, active teachers; hence, should be 
excluded from teaching by the school officers. 
Great interest is being taken by the State Superintendent in our 
school system, but unless aided by county officials his work cannot 
be as effective as it otherwise would be. And just here I take oc- 
casion to say that county courts should take such interest in their 
schools as to elect persons county superintendents who want the 
place, not merely for the money paid them, but who take an interest 
in their schools. 
The people should also look well to the election of directors, for 
upon these officers in a great measure the welfare of the school sys- 
tem depends. To them the people have a right to look for good 
schools; hence, the importance of having these positions filled with 
those who have an interest in the welfare of schools. 
TI have had four years’ experience as county superintendent here ; 
expect in the near future to turn the work over to another ; hence, 
I take the liberty to make these suggestions, believing, as I do, 
that a great deal has been lacking on the part of these officers, and 
especially is it so as to directors, and that great improvement can 
and should be made in our schools by getting men into office who 
have the good of schools at heart. é

I have endavored to make my report as nearly correct as possible ; 
however, I cannot say that it is entirely without defect, but I trust 
it contains the information desired. 
I will say, in reference to our public schools in Polk County, I 
think we are slowly but steadily gaining ground iu every particular 
that pertains to public school work. We held our teachers’ normal 
institute at Benton, July 9, and also at Ducktown July 16. There 
were present every teacher in the county that is now teaching except 
three, who assigned good reasons for their abscence. I must say that 
our teachers were all interested and did the best work we have ever 
done in Polk County. I have visited forty schools in our county, 
and I find our teachers doing good, honest work.

I send herewith my annual report for the scholastic year ending 
June 30, 1894. You will observe some increase in enrollment and 
attendance over the preceding year, though not so much as I had | 
hoped for. I have been very careful in obtaining and compiling — 
statistics from the school districts, so that I think my report is as 
accurate as it is possible to make it. Seven of the houses reported 
built are in place of old ones torn away, so that our total is only 
one more than at the beginning of the year. 
Our schools have started off reasonably well this fall. We have 
the best corps of teachers we have ever had. Doing away with 
thesecond grade primary certificates has “ side-tracked” some of the: 
and stimulated others. We hold monthly institutes and we have 
the nucleus of a teachers’ circulating library. We are all working 
together in peace and harmony, determined to bring our good old 
county to the front educationally. 
SCOTT COUNTY. 
H. K. Pemperton, Superintendent. 
I have the honor to submit my annual report of Scott Coun 
for the scholastic year ending June 30, 1894. t
-P-A-G-E-144
—145— 
At the present time there are nineteen school districts in Scott 
County, in which there are sixty-five sub-school districts, sixty-two 
for white children and three for colored children. 
We have sixty-one white primary schools, one white secondary 
school and three colored primary schools. 
During the year the directors have had four very good school- 
houses erected. 
I held two county normals, one for the white teachers and the 
other for the colored teachers. 
The regular county normal for white teachers, which began Mon- 
day, June 25, 1894, and closed Friday, July 6, 1894, was con- 
ducted by Profs. Porter, Superintendent of West Knoxville City 
Schools; Clemens, Principal of Huntsville Academy, and Owens, 
Principal of New River Baptist High School. 
There were eighty-three enrolled as normal students. 
This was one of the most successful normals we have ever wit- 
nessed in this county. 
Our teachers show their interest in attending the normal and 
teachers’ meetings. 
We now have a uniform system of text-books adopted for Scott 
County. 
Our schools are graded. Directors, teachers and patrons are in- 
terested in the educating of the rising generation. 
Many of our teachers attended school after the close of their 
schools. 
Our schools are in a very good condition, but ‘there is room for 
improvement. 
ip SEVIER COUNTY. 
W. S.gOcin, Superintendent. 
Some days ago I mailed you my sixth annual statistical report 
of the public schools of Sevier County for the scholastic year end- 
10
-P-A-G-E-145
—146— 
ing June 30, 1894. Our schools have made fair advancement for 
past year, yet they are not what they should be; but the school in- 
terest in this county is steadily growing each year and is gaining a 
stronger hold on the affections of the people than ever before. 
While we are poor in money we are strong in energy, and I believe 
no county in the State has, as a whole, a more enthusiastic corps of 
teachers, who do as good work for as little money as Sevier. 
There is one thing very detrimental to our schools, and that is 
the meagerness of our school compels many of our directors to pay 
small salaries, which has caused much of our best teaching talent 
to seek more remunerative fields. 
T held an eight days’ normal institute at Sevierville, in Murphy 
College, assisted by Profs. W. S. Bryan, G. W. Baker and W. W. 
Mainey. This was a very successful institute, being well attended 
by both teachers and people of the town and surrounding country. 
Our institutes have done a great deal to arouse the teachers to a 
sense of their duty and stimulate a popular sentiment in favor of 
education. 
Our local teachers’ institutes have been well attended. Through 
the influence of these meetings the people become interested in the 
cause of education. Here all can “ meet ona level” and discuss 
methods and plans for the betterment of our schools and the edu- 
cation of the masses. 
We have two high schools, Murphy College, H. C. & N. 
“Academy, and a number of other private schools in our county 
doing a good work and helping to raise the standard of education 
in our county. i 
The graded system has greatly improved our schools, the major- 
ity of them being very well classified and graded according to the 
course of study prepared by myself. 
Our school property has been very much improved during the - 
last year. The old log houses are rapidly giving way to neat frame 
houses, well furnished with desks, charts, blackboards, etc. 
This closes the sixth year of my supervision of the public schools 
of Sevier County, and during this time I have enjoyed the hearty 
   
-P-A-G-E-146
—147— 
co-operation of the teachers, directors and school officers and am 
proud to note many improvements and advancements in the educa- 
tional line, and can safely say that our schools are in better con- 
dition now than ever before, and, taking everything as a whole, I 
think we can compare favorably with any other county in the State 
in education, although our financial resources are very limited. 
SEQUATCHIE COUNTY. 
Isaac Hicks, Jr., Superintendent. 
  
I held in July my annual institute for five days. We had a very 
interesting time; we had, not boasting, the best attendance that I 
ever saw in Dunlap. Our examination was more rigid, and the re- 
sult is we have a better corps of teachers. 
In regard to district directors, I believe that most of our directors 
are trying to discharge their duty. Some of our school districts 
failed to elect directors, and in such cases I would select the most 
efficient men I could find, who I thought would act in harmony. 
The scholastic enumeration is not as great as last year, but the 
daily attendance is better. This is due to the efficiency of the 
teachers. 
In regard to grading the schools, I am trying to get the students 
who are not about completing their education graded as the law 
directs, but for those who are not likely to go to school but little more 
I think it useless. 
The County Court of Sequatchie gives us a liberal school tax of 
40 cents on real estate and $2.00 on polls, which gives us $2.40 per 
capita. This gives us a five months’ term in most of the districts, 
but in some of the more thinly populated districts it falls short.

SHELBY COUNTY. 
  
Miss Lipa G. THomas, Superintendent. 
T herewith enclose to you my annual report for 1894, The delay 
has been caused by failure on the part of newly elected school di- 
rectors to send in reports. The old directors should do this, but 
almost invariably they shift the duty on the new, who have not 
always the proper materials with which to get up a report. 
I would like for you to examine carefully this report, as I think 
it evinces improvement on all lines, and we would especially like 
your commendation on our progress. 
Our schools are not all graded. We are grading them rapidly, 
and on an approved and systematic plan. 
You will notice a falling off in the number of licensed teachers, 
especially among colored applicants. This is due toa strict ad- 
herence to the regulations you have set forth in issuing certificates 
to only those who reach advanced standard—85 per cent. 
This report is accurate in its every detail, as I have heard from 
all the districts, and in some cases have resorted to teachers’ ab- 
stracts in order to correct inaccuracies. 
SMITH COUNTY. 
  
B. L. Gorn, Superintendent. 
  
I herewith submit my second annual report of the schools of 
Smith County. Our schools are moving along nicely and pleasantly. 
A better per cent. of attendance is being made this year than was 
ever mde in this county before. Our teachers are gradually be- 
coming better scholars and more thoroughly drilled in the methods 
of teaching. Consequently our schools are on the increase.
-P-A-G-E-148
—149— 
We have better schools and better houses every year than we had 
the previous year. Our summer normal institutes and monthly as- 
sociations, which have been so freely attended for the last two years, 
have done a great deal toward giving us our present condition of 
education. We have had at least six thousand in attendance this 
year. The discussion of educational questions in their presence has 
done a great deal to give us the high per cent. of attendance we are 
having, and we hope that the greatest benefits to be derived from 
them are yet in the future. A great per cent. of our teachers are 
alive and wide awake to the great importance of keeping apace with 
the great strides of improvement being made, while a few are yet 
lagging back ; and we hope that enlightened discussion in these meet- 
ings will help to raise the curtain of deceit from before the people 
that they may know who is and who is not educated. 
We move our monthly associations from one district to another, 
thereby enabling every one to attend at least once a year. If we 
can get our teachers to catch and hold the educational enthusiasm 
of the age success is ours. 
SULLIVAN COUNTY. 
J. E. L, SENEKER, Superintendent. 
In presenting this, my second annual report, I am gratified to 
be able to report that the tendency of our educational interests is 
still “ onward and upward.” 
There has been quite a good deal of improvement in the scholas- 
tic and professional qualifications of most of our teachers during 
the past year. There has been, also, a more thorough and system- 
atie study of the science of teaching, and a more intelligent appli- 
cation of principles in the work of the school-room, and, conse- 
quently, the work done has been productive of better and more 
satisfactory results. 
Our annual institute was well attended, and all seemed deeply 
interested in the work of the institute. The good advice and solid
-P-A-G-E-149
2 160— 
instruction given by the instructors were received with such an 
earnestness of purpose that they cannot fail of doing good. 
Our teachers’ association is now well organized. 
I have visited all the schools, some of them several times. In 
my visitations I endeavored to note the general condition of the 
houses, grounds, furniture and apparatus; the order, classification, 
interest and facilities for work in the schools, and the methods of 
instruction and discipline on the part of teachers. Such words of 
encouragement were spoken to the pupils, and such suggestions 
were given to teachers as the circumstances in each case seemed to 
warrant, 
TIPTON COUNTY. 
Jos. F. Corron, Superintendent. 
I have the honor to enclose herewith my fourth annual report. 
I am glad to note a steady advance in our school system. Our 
County Court makes an annual appropriation of $100 for a county 
normal, which we have tried to use to the best advantage, securing 
for the teachers instruction for ten days from the best educators of 
the State. 
UNICOI COUNTY. 
R. W. H. Gupert, Superintendent. 
  
I herewith submit you my report for the year ending June 30, 
1894. Inall my former reports I have spoken favorably of the 
schools and educational interests of Unicoi County ; and in that re- 
spect this will be similar to my other reports, except to emphasize 
the remark that the educational interest here is better than ever 
¢
-P-A-G-E-150
—151— 
before. This is evident from the increased enrollment in the schools 
this year over the corresponding period last year. There is now a 
fraction over 90 per cent. of the scholastic population already en- 
rolled in the schools; and the per cent. of attendance, while not 
entirely satisfactory, is in every respect encouraging, and is already 
in advance of any other year in the history of the county. The 
Erwin Academy has already enrolled over 100 pupils, an increase 
of 18 per cent. over last year. 
The normal which I held at Erwin last July was more largely 
attended and more interest manifested than at any one previously 
held in our county. This year our teachers seem more enthused, 
and are reading more educational literature than heretofore. 
UNION COUNTY. 
Joun 8. BAKER, Superintendent. 
Iam proud to say our directors have done better about report- 
ing this year than heretofore ; hence, this report is about correct. 
Our schools are not what they should be by any means, yet I 
think we can note a steady improvement in most of our schools, 
which gives us encouragement. 
Teachers are taking a greater ‘interest in our institutes. Our in- 
stitute held at Maynardville last summer was one of the best ever 
held in our county. Fifty out of fifty-four teachers now teaching 
in this county attended at least a part of the time during the 
normal. 
I have visited some schools, and find all doing reasonably well. 
Some teachers are more energetic than others. 
We, who work for the cause of education in Union County, still 
live in hopes of receiving more money and more enthusiasm for 
education in the near future. Then our advancement will not be 
so slow.

WASHINGTON COUNTY. 
  
F. T. Warts, Superintendent. 
  
The historic county of Washington greets you with a scholastic 
population of 7,902; teachers wide awake to the interest of our 
public schools; also with a great desire for better schools and more 
money. Our State normal this summer was a success. Profs. Andes 
and Trotter labored faithfully. We enrolled 114 teachers. Wash- 
ington County can boast of some splendid houses—in fact nearly all 
our public school houses are good houses. A large number of our 
houses are well furnished with patent desks, maps, charts, globes, 
etc. There is not a county in the State that can boast of better 
houses, better supplies and better teachers than Washington County. 
Inside of two years we expect to have one of the best libraries in 
the State for public school teachers. 
WAYNE COUNTY. 
  
Lavra THORNTON, Superintendent. 
  
You will find enclosed my annual report, which is as near cor- 
rect as I could make it. As you will find, the trustee failed to 
make out his report, and my report is left partly blank. If he 
makes it to me in a short time I will send it to you. 
Our ‘public schools are improving every year. They are much 
better this than they were last year. Teachers manifest a greater 
interest in our institutes than ever before. I have visited most all 
of the schools of the county and I found most of the teachers 
active, energetic ~ faithful. I hope to see the good work still— 
ale:
-P-A-G-E-152

WEAKLEY COUNTY. 
  
W. I. Moors, Superintendent. 
e   
I know we are improving, not so rapidly as we would like, but 
surely. There is greater interest manifested than ever before. 
We are doing more satisfactory work in grading the schools for the 
last year. We are not attempting to grade, but are grading. The 
institute that was conducted by Prof. G. R. McCue last summer 
_ was largely attended. I think we have a better grade of teachers, 
and they are striving harder to do better work. We mean to be 
among the best counties of the State. I think there should be 
some changes made in the law to compel teachers and directors to 
send in their reports. If teachers had to make’a monthly report 
and file it with the Superintendent at tle end of each month, be- 
fore he could get his money, the reports made to the State Surperin- 
tendent by County Superintendents would be correct ; as it is some 
things are so very difficult to get correctly. Can’t something be 
done to remedy this defect? A great many teachers and directors 
in several counties never make a report. They are out and gone 
as soon as school closes, and the directors say they do not know 
anything about making the reports that the teachers ought to have 
made. I think County Superintendents should get better pay, and 
_ the term should be four years instead of two. 
WHITE COUNTY. 
  
D. L. LanspEn, Superintendent. 
  
I herewith send the second annual report of Superintendent D. ; 
L. Lansden, who has been sick six weeks. He engaged me to visit 
the schools of the county and otherwise act in his capacity during 
his illness, :
-P-A-G-E-153
—154— 
Tam glad to say that as far as zeal and earnestness go. the ma- 
jority of the teachers of White County are unsurpassed, though 
there is much room for improvement in qualification on the part 
of many. 
Our school fund has not been judiciously handled. The county 
is greatly in arrears to the schools, which has necessitated the sell- 
ing of warrants at a discount of from 10 to 20 per cent. for several 
years, thus making the teacher’s salary so meager that many of the 
best have quit the profession. Added to this is the idea of many 
directors that $20 teachers and nine-month schools are the things 
to build up our system. This has compelled the employment of 
inferior instructors, while many of our first-class teachers have 
been forced to seek employment in another field of labor. But Iam 
glad the idea is running aground, and the future promises better 
salaries and a higher grade of instruction. There is also a grow- 
ing sentiment toward paying off the county’s indebtedness and get- 
ting the schools on a basis of solid finance. 
So the future is far from inspiring a feeling of gloom. Like a 
mariner in a storm-tossed ocean, who looks out through the fast 
dispelling clouds and sees an azure sky that betokens a peaceful sea 
and a successful voyage, I look beyond the difficulties that beset 
us and see a bright future for the public schools of White County.

—157— 
REPORT OF PEABODY NORMAL INSTITUTE. 
NAsHVILLE, TENN., Jan. 17, 1895. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent Public Instruction : 
Dear Srr—We have the honor of submitting an outline of the 
work announced for the Peabody Normal Institute at Monteagle, 
July, 1894, and take pleasure in reporting that the work was car- 
ried out with far more completeness than promised. A careful esti- 
mate placed the average daily attendance at two hundred; teachers 
and others interested in educational work from every section of the 
South. The number enrolled as regular and actual attendants was 
one hundred and sixty-three; these came from every section of Ten- 
nessee, as well as from adjoining States. 
The work was done with great thoroughness, and elicited unusual 
enthusiasm that continued even through to the last moments of the 
largely attended closing exercises. 
Strong resolutions were adopted expressing gratitude to the Pea- 
body Board of Trust, and to the State Superintendent of Public In- 
struction of Tennessee, for the establishment of the institute at 
Monteagle, and assuring both that they made no mistake either in 
the location or in the able faculty employed. 
In addition to the regular work, conferences on educational prob- 
lems were held, and proved very helpful, as well as delightful. 
The general testimony was that ours was a model institute, worthy 
of being propagated in other sections. 
With gratitude, sincerely, 
A. P. Bourtanp, 
Conductor. 
P. S.—It was estimated that 750 different persons heard various 
parts of the work. f

INTRODUCTION. 
The objects of the Peabody Institute are as follows: 
1. Regular, systematic work in the theory and practice of teach- 
ing. Those who enter as students of the schools will attend lect- 
ures on these subjects, and will be regularly examined on these 
lectures afterward. 
2. The students will be drilled in academical studies, toa certain 
extent, with regard to acquiring the subject matter as well as to 
illustrate methods. 
3. The course for the present shall require two years for comple- 
tion. Those who stand satisfactory examinations on the lectures 
and work done in the institutes for the two years, as well as on the 
text-books required in the course of study, and the subjects re- 
quired to be taught in the primary and secondary schools of the 
State, will, at the end of the two years’ course, be given certificates 
and placed on the roll of honor in the office of the State Superin- 
tendent. Those whose names are on this roll of honor, and who 
hold these certificates, will be recommended for teachers’ certifi- 
cates without examination. 
4, The courses of study of the institutes will be identical, so 
that students can attend any of them both years, or may attend 
one the first year and another the second. The faculties of these 
institutes will be permanently appointed, and will be composed of 
the very best talent in the State under control of the State Board 
of Education. 
5. The outlines for professional work given in the Syllabus are 
to be substantially followed by instructors in these institutes. Es- 
pecially are they designed as a guide to home study for those who 
want to prepare for an intelligent hearing of the lectures. 
By this means it is confidently hoped that the great body of 
teachers may be easily reached, and organized, as it were into a
-P-A-G-E-159
—160— 
general school for uniform instruction in the best approved princi- 
ples of their profession. Better qualified teachers will thus be ob- 
tained for our schools. County Superintendents are requested to 
send to the State Superintendent a list of those who desire or ex- 
pect to attend. 
COURSE, OF STUDY. 
FIRST YEAR. . 
Teachers will be required to have studied the following books, 
and to pass an examination on them at the Summer Normal Insti- 
tutes: 
Primary Work—Parker’s Talks on Teaching. 
Pedagogics—1. Pageon Teaching (revised by Payne). 2. White’s 
Pedagogy. 
Discipline and Moral Training—White’s School Management. 
3. Watts on the Mind. 
Text-books—All primary school branches. 
SECOND YEAR. 
History of Education—Painter’s. 
Applied Psychology—Hewett’s Psychology for Young Teachers. 
Supervision of Graded Schools—Payne White’s Schoo] Manage- 
ment. 
Text-books—All secondary school studies. 
It is expected that teachers will pursue these studies at home 
during the year, and be prepared to pass rigid examinations on the 
examinations on the same at the annual meeting, and not rely upon 
what may be taught in the institue. 
The institute instructors will, in their work, review with pupil- 
teachers the more difficult points in the various branches, and illus- 
trate the methods of teaching all studies, so that this really furnishes 
a school for teachers desiring to qualify themselves for better work.

point will have exhaustive consideration. 
ALGEBRA. 
The advantages of the study and the uses of algebraic processes 
will be considered. Special stress will be laid upon notation, defi- 
nitions of terms, the factoring of expressions, and the practical solu- 
tion of simple and of quadratic equations.

KINDERGARTEN SCHOOL. 
MISS MARGRETTA WILLIAMS. 
Pupil of Chicago Free Kindergarten School, Teacher of Kindergarten, Ward Sem- 
inary, Nashville, Tenn. 
THE KINDERGARTEN METHOD. 
The Kindergarten method of instruction is based on Plane Geom- 
etry, and comprises twenty gifts, or occupations, for the develop- 
ment of the child’s mind. The Kindergarten is divided into four 
parts. Beginning with the fall, all of the work has reference to the 
fullness thereof. The gathering and putting away of stores. The 
culminating of this work being Thanksgiving Day. We compare 
this with the completeness of the life of man. Then we are getting 
ready for Advent season, which brings us to Christmas and the 
birth of Christ. From Christmas till Easter and spring, our work 
has reference to the coming up of everything, compared with the 
resurrection of Christ, during which time the child is taught about 
the growth of plants, flowers, etc., bringing in with each season 
our work of trades and occupations of man, both from the artistic 
and practical side of life. 
THE FIRST DAY AT SCHOOL. 
Opening with morning prayer. Getting acquainted with the 
children. Drawing them all around you. Telling them some story 
bearing on your work for the week, which must have reference to 
the time of the year and the text, always drawing from the child as
-P-A-G-E-163
—164— 
smuch information as you can without allowing it to absorb your in- 
-dividuality, in this way developing thought and expression, which 
shows how to group the children according to the power of ob- 
servation, then bring in a lesson with one of the gifts bearing on 
the text. Some appropriate song, or songs and giving them a simple 
lunch nicely served, and closing with an evening sofig. 
OUTLINE OF WORK FOR THE MONTH OF JULY. 
Trinity Sunday. Teat :—‘“ For we now behold the beauty of the 
handiworks of the Lord as we visit His hills and temple each day.’ 
Beginning with conversation lessons on the time of year. Drawing 
attention to the general color of everything (being green), and in 
in this way bring out one of the important lessons of the Kinder- 
garten—color. The combination and contrasting of color, va-

REPORT OF PEABODY NORMAL COLLEGE. 
Hon. Frank M. Smita, State Superintendet Public Instruction : 
Dear Srr—In accordance with your request I hereby transmit 
my annual report as President of the Peabody Normal Nii for 
the academic year ending May 30, 1894. 
The accompanying table shows the attendance by States, from the 
organization of the college in 1875, to the year 1893-94, inclusive. 
Beginning with the year 1888, this table shows a continuous and 
rapid rise in enrollment, from 177 in that year, to 560 in the year 
1893. Owing to the financial uncertainties of the country, and 
probably even more to the higher standard for admission, the en- 
rollment for the year 1893-94 shows a falling off of 52 students; 
and an analysis of the table discloses the fact that this loss is in 
students from Tennessee. There was a rapid increase in students 
from this State, from 69 in 1888, to 311 in 1893; but during the 
last year the number fell to 256, a loss of 55. Our records show 
that this loss was mainly from Nashville. 
Under the redistribution of scholarships which was made five years 
ago, on the basis of the white population of the several Southern 
States, the quota for Tennessee was 14; but the State Board of Ed- 
ucation effected an arrangement with Dr. Curry, the general agent 
of the Peabody Education Fund, whereby this number was in- 
creased to 33, thus giving a scholarship to each Senatorial District 
in the State. Each scholarship is good for two years, and entitles 
the holder to $100 a year and his railroad fare from his home to 
Nashville and return, The sum thus paid to Tennessee students 
during the year 1893-94 was $3,600. 
The distribution of scholarship students throughout this State is 
shown in the following table:

The yearly return to society of such a number of liberally edu- 
cated young men and young women, able to deal intelligently with 
the educational questions and problems of the day, is an event of 
on the sympathy and support shown by the community in which it 
the highest significance. It means the gradual dissemination of 
right opinion on questions lying at the very root of national well- 
being, the function of the public school, the rights and duties of 
citizenship, the habits and virtues requisite for an honorable and 
useful life, both private and public. The Germans have a saying 
that whatever is to go into the life of a nation must first be put 
into its schools; and it may be added that whatever is to go into 
the schools must first be put into the minds and hearts of their 
teachers; so that the fundamental problem in national life is the 
education of the teaching class. 
The time is now rapidly drawing near, when by the terms of 
Mr. Peabody’s will, the trustees of the education fund may invest 
the whole or a part of the principal in the endowment of institu- 
tions to carry into effect the great philanthropist’s purpose in be- 
half of Southern education. A frequently avowed purpose of the 
trustees, and particularly of its venerable President, is the organ- 
ization and endowment of an institution for the education and 
training of teachers, which shall be superior in scope and grade to 
any similar institution now existing in this country. Such a school,
-P-A-G-E-173
—174— 
to use Mr. Winthrop’s happy phrase, is to be “ The living monu- 
ment to the memory of George Peabody.” The establishment of 
such a school, somewhere, may be regarded as an absolute cer- 
tainty, and though the place of its location is yet to be determined, 
there is a well grounded probability that Nashville will be its per- 
manent home, and that the Peabody Normal College, sufficiently 
endowed, improved and enlarged in buildings and in teaching 
force, will itself become, in due time, this “living monument.” 
From the very first, the policy of the trustees of the Peabody Edu- 
cation Fund, in the distribution of its income in the way of aid, has 
has been co-operation with local effort ; and it is not to be doubted 
that in the investment of the principal in permanent institutions 
the question of local sympathy and local support will form a very 
important factor in the final decision. It is evident to both trustees 
and people that the State in which the school is permanently located 
will receive the larger share of the benefits growing out of it, and 
that the final success of the undertaking will turn in large measure 
on the sympathy and support shown by the community in which it 
has its home, Iam not authorized to speak for the trustees in the 
least degree, but I feel sure that they are strongly and favorably 
impressed by the magnanimous spirit shown by the General As- 
sembly in the appropriations it has made in aid of the Normal Col- 
lege, and by the kindly sympathy and warm friendliness manifested 
on all oceasions by the citizens of Nashville toward the institution 
and those entrusted with its management. If this school finally 
comes to Tennessee and to Nashville it will have its home among 
firm friends, among public-spirited, intelligent citizens, who, while 
properly influenced by local interest and local pride, are broad 
enough to lend their support to an institution designed to bless the 
sisterhood of States. 
In furtherance, doubtless, of their ultimate aims, the trustees, at 
their late meeting in New York, appointed a special committee to 
accompany Dr. Curry, their general agent, on a visit to Nashville 
and the Normal College, in February, 1895. This committee con- 
sisted of Bishop Whipple, of Minnesota; Chief Justice Fuller, of 
Washington, and President Gilmore, of Maryland. The coming of 
these distinguished men will be an event of great importance, not 
only to the college, but to Nashville and to Tennessee; for the
-P-A-G-E-174
—175— 
future of the school and the place of its permanent location will 
doubtless depend very largely on their impressions and on their 
subsequent report. Iam heartily glad that this committee will thus 
have an opportunity to test the spirit and temper of our people, to 
feel the public pulse, and to know by personal observation on what 
they may count in the way of material and moral support toward 
the maintenance of such an institution as they propose to found. 
As far as the state of public education would allow, the standard 
for admission to the Normal College has been raised, and the grade 
of academic and professional attainments correspondingly advanced. 
Any sudden or radical rise in the requirements for admission would 
effectually cut the schooi off from its constituency ; and so wide is 
the field from which we gather our students, and such the difference 
among the States with respect to secondary or preparatory schools, 
that requirements which would be reasonably easy in one section 
would be comparatively difficult in another; so that practical wis- 
dom has consisted in preserving a medium course, in making a 
moderate but steady advance along the whole line. The lowest 
class in the college has now been discontinued and one uniform 
standard for admission is required of all students, whether scholar- 
ship or non-scholarship; and an interval of two years, instead of 
one, as heretofore, has been placed between the Licentiate Degree 
and the Bachelor’s Degree. According to the natural course of 
events in such cases a considerable decrease in enrollment might be 
expected ; but while it is too early in the year to predict the final 
outcome, present indications do not point to any large loss in mem- 
bership. The essential thing just now, however, is quality rather 
than quantity, and in this sense the results of these changes have 
been most happy. 
The relation between the Peabody Normal College and the Uni- 
versity of Nashville does not seem to be generally understood. 
This connection is vital, and for all the higher purposes of the in- 
stitution indispensable. This will be readily understood from the 
following statements of fact: 
1. The entire material outfit of the college, in the way of build- 
ings and grounds, is the property of the University of Nashyille. 
2. The entire income from University funds, now amounting to 
about $3,000 a year, is devoted to the current expenses of the 
school, chiefly in the way of repairs and improvements.
-P-A-G-E-175
—176— 
8. The Chair of Modern Languages is an endowment by the 
University Alumni Fund. 
4. The Normal College course proper terminates with the Licen- 
tiate Degree, attained after two years of study; and all students 
who remain longer, with the intention of earning Bachelov’s or 
Master’s Degrees, are students in the University of Nashville. 
The Normal College has no power to grant these degrees. At the 
last commencement, in May, 1894, forty-one University degrees 
were conferred on students who had previously been graduated 
from the Normal College with the only degree it can confer, that 
of Licentiate of Instruction. For preferment in the teaching pro- 
fession a University degree from some reputable institution is a 
prerequisite, and when this institution is itself a professional 
school of high grade, as the University of Nashville is, its degrees 
haye an additional and peculiar value; they not only imply gen- 
eral scholarship of the liberal type, but in connection with it a 
training in the theory and the art of education. 
The relation of the Peabody Normal College to the State of Ten- 
nessee needs also to be explicitly understood, and the statement of 
this relation is easily made. At an expense of only $15,000 a year 
the State of Tennessee has all the advantages of a State normal 
school that would cost, for the mere plant, $100,000, and for run- 
ning expenses at least, the annual sum of $35,000. 
In February of the current year the community and the college 
suffered a very severe loss in the death of Mr. Edward D. Hicks, 
Secretary and Treasurer of the University of Nashville. He was a 
zealous and noble friend of both of these institutions, and their in- 
terests occupied a large share of his time and thought. He was 
quick to see the needs of a growing school, and was prompt and 
liberal in his measures for relief. He was a man of absolute in- 
tegrity, of wide intelligence, a great reader, and a lover of curious 
books. He had the taste of an antiquarian, and had gathered the 
finest collection of pre-historic flints owned by any private collector. 
The elegant cffice building on the university campus is a monument 
to his benevolence and business capacity. 
The news of Robert C. Winthrop’s death has just reached me. 
It was not unexpected, for he had been in failing health for several 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
—177— 
months, and was unable to attend the meeting of the Peabody Boand 
on October 3 in New York. Though absent, he presented his usual 
report, couched in its usual kindly tone, and remarkable as a vigor- 
ous public document written by a man in his eighty-fifth year. 
Mr. Winthrop was illustrious by lineage and illustrious by per- 
sonal worth and attainment. He was an American statesman of the 
highest and purest type, a philanthropist by instinct and by devoted 
service, a high-minded, patriotic citizen, a scholar of wide attain- 
ments, a man of unexcelled probity and honor. 
He was selected by George Peabody to organize a board for car- 
rying into effect the philanthropist’s bequest to Southern education, 
and from the day of its organization to the day of his death was its 
honored President and author and director of its general policy. It 
has been well said that no board on this continent has a member- 
ship of such illustrious names, and it was Mr. Winthrop’s states- 
manship and sagacity that made it such. 
Next to his merely personal concerns the object nearest Mr. Win- 
thop’s heart was the Peabody Normal College, and every incident 
touching its prosperity was noted with the tenderest interest. Each 
of his reports records some affectionate regard, some benevolent 
wish for the “living monument” to the memory of his illustrious 
friend. Each year brought to the college library some choice vol- 
_ umes from his own collection of books; and whenever a visitor 
from Nashville called to pay him his personal respects his first ques- 
tions were: “ What can you tell me of our great Normal College?” 
“What news do you bring from the State Board of Education ?” 
This friend of ours has gone, but his work endures. His trust in 
us and in the possibilities of the college shall be honored; and so 
far as it may depend on us, his benevolent wishes for the South shall 
be realized. 
A good man and a just 
Bas entered into rest. 
Respectfully submitted, 
WiiraM H. Payne, 
NasHVILLe, Noy. 20, 1894. President.

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES 
OF THE 
UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE, 
FOR THE TW) YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 20, 1894. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction : 
S1r—The Board of Trustees of the University of Tennessee re- 
specifully submit this, their biennial report for the two years end- 
ing December 20, 1894, as ae by the law of the State (the 
Code, Section 327). - 
During the year now about to close the University of Tennessee 
has passed the date which marked the centennial of Blount College, 
its parent institution. Under a charter granted by the first Gen- 
eral Assembly of the Territory South of the Ohio, in September, 
1794, the Boird of Trustees, consisting of the Rey. Samuel Car- 
rick, President, and his Excellency William Blount; the Hon. 
Daniel Smith, Secretary of the Territory ; the Hon. David Camp- 
boll, the Hon. Joseph Anderson, Gen. John Sevier, Col. James 
White, Col. Alexander Kelly, Col. William Cocke, Willie Blount, 
Jossph Hamilton, Archibald Roane, Francis A. Ramsey, Charles 
MsClung, George Roulstoae, George McNatt, John Adair and 
Robert Houston, esquires, op:ned Blount College in Knoxville, 
Tennessee, on September 10, 1794. Tae present University of 
Tenaessee is the lineal dsscendant of that institution. It was thus 
born with the State, and its history is intimately wrapped up with 
tha: of the State all dowa the century. Under an act of Congress 
of 1806 providing for the establishment of two colleges in Tennes- 
see, Eist Tean2ssee College was chartered on October 26, 1807, and 
received the franchise and property of Blouit Co!leze. The name
-P-A-G-E-184
—185— 
of the institution was changed, by act of the General Assembly of 
January 29, 1840, to East Tennessee University, and by an act 
of March 10, 1879, to the Universsty of Tennessee. The Board 
of Trustees is still operating under the charter granted to East 
Tennessee College in 1807. 
The centennial of the founding of Blount College was properly 
celebrated on Tuesday, June 12, 1894, the day before the com- 
mencement of this year. The Alumni Association of the Uni- 
versity were requested to take charge of the occasion, and they 
elected Edward T. Sanford, Esq., of the class of ’83, as alumni 
orator. The leading feature of the Centennial celebration was his 
address on the history of the University. This discussion, which 
showed great research and a deep devotion to the venerable insti- 
tution, was clothed in eloquent language and delivered in an im- 
pressive manner before a great and warmly interested audience, 
composed of alumni, students, officers and friends of the Uni- 
versity. It was a most appropriate celebration of this great event 
in the history of Tennessee, and one which will long be remem- 
bered. Believing that this centennial address will prove a valuable 
contribution to the history of the State, a copy of it, with the ac- 
companying charters and extracts from laws pertaining to the insti- 
tution and a few other appendices of great interest, which have 
never hitherto been published, is transmitted with this report with 
the earnest request that it may be published for more extensive cir- 
culation among the people of Tennessee and the country. This 
centennial celebration is only the forerunner of the great one in 
1896, and this publication will, if extensively circulated, do much 
to inform the people and awaken the interest in the State Cen- 
tennial. 
The finances of the University remain in a safe condition. The 
Board has received all funds due it from the State and the United 
States government, and has disbursed them in accordance with the 
laws of the State and the statutes of the United States. The bi- 
ennial report of the Treasurer, which is transmitted herewith, will 
show the detailed receipts and disbursements. 
The chief material improvement to the property of the Univer- 
sity during the past two years is the brick and stone building, with
-P-A-G-E-185
—186— 
a slate roof, which has recently been erected upon the farm. This 
building is designed especially to accommodate the agricultural 
students engaged in practical work upon the farm. The only 
building hitherto provided there for them was a very small wooden 
cottage. The new building contains an office and reading-room, a 
well-appointed kitchen and dining-room and dormitory rooms suf- 
ficient for the accommodation of twenty or thirty agricultural stu- 
dents. Preference will be given to those students who take the 
agricultural course and perform practical work upon the farm. In 
the tower of the building will be placed a full outfit of meteoro- 
logical instruments, which will be a very valuable addition to the 
equipment of the Experiment Station, and will furnish another 
and most valuable means of instruction, 
The portion of the campus hitherto used ‘as a drill-ground and 
play-ground for the students has recently been enlarged and beau- 
tifully graded... This improvement is highly appreciated both by 
the military department and the various athletic organizations of 
the students. 
No action having been taken by the last General Assembly with 
regard to the matter of appropriate and permanent buildings for 
this institution, the Board feels constrained to renew the petition 
contained in their last biennial report. 
All the prominent buildings upon our grounds are very old. 
They were cheaply constructed in the first instance, and are rapidly 
approaching that condition in which repairing is expensive, indeed 
impossible. The University is beautifully and conveniently located 
in a healthful section. It owns a magnificent site, on a noble hill 
overlooking the Tennessee River. It is generally conceded that 
this is a most desirable situation for an institution of learning. 
Through the bounty of the United States the institution has a 
moderate income with which to pay its teachers and the necessary 
current expenses. These prerequisites—a site and an income—we 
have, but the buildings are wholly unworthy of the site of the 
University. They are doing much, as we feel, to prevent the in- 
stitution from exercising the influence in education, and doing the 
work for the youth of the State, that it could otherwise accomplish. 
W e, therefore, feel it our duty to call-your attention to the matte r
-P-A-G-E-186
—187— 
and to petition you to make an appropriation, at your present ses- 
sion, for the removal of the old buildings and the erection in place 
thereof of a suitable main academic building, which shall be an 
honor to the University and a pride to the State. 
No one can question the wisdom of providing for higher educa- 
tion of the sons of the people who seek their training at this place. 
Every State recognizes the obligation to mainfain a university as 
the head of its public school system. But the State of Tennessee 
is under special obligation in this matter. In accepting the land 
grant made by Congress in 1862 for the establishment of agricul- 
tural and mechanical colleges in the various States, and the several 
additions thereto made since, the State of Tennessee placed itself 
under a solemn obligation to provide all the buildings, land, and 
other natural equipment necessary for the success of the insti- 
tution. 
The act of Congress, approved July 6, 1862, and accepted by 
the General Assembly of Tennessee in 1869, says: ‘‘ That any 
State which may take or claim the benefit of the provisions of 
this act shall provide, within five years at least, not less than one 
college as described in the fourth section of this act, or the grant to 
such State shall cease.” Another section provides that “no por- 
tion of said fund, nor the interest thereon, shall be applied, directly 
or indirectly, under any pretense whatever, to the purchase, erec- 
tion, preservation or repair of any building or buildings.” In 
other words, the State was to “provide” the “college,” with all 
that pertained to it, especially the land and buildings, while the 
United States provided a perpetual fund with which to carry it on. 
When the State of Tennessee, through it General Assembly, took 
supervision of the East Tennessee University, reorganized its 
Board of Trustees and created out of it the University of Tennes- 
see, it only began the work. It did not discharge its obligation 
by that one act. In accepting this grand trust, and founding its 
State University upon it, the State undertook a continuing respon- 
sibility ; one that must grow with the State and the demands of 
its people. It must provide additional buildings for the University 
as no other fund is provided for this purpose. Plans have. been 
prepared for a building of brick and stone, in general outline 
about two hundred and ten by seventy-five feet, and four stories
-P-A-G-E-187
—188— 
high above a good basement, which would be an honor to the State. 
It is estimated that the building would cost about $100,000, com- 
plete, with heating apparatus, plumbing and furniture. 
Feeling, thus, that the usefulness of the institution is being 
greatly hampered, we come to you with our earnest petition, which 
is that you make an appropriation of $100,000 for the removal of 
the old buildidgs on the top of the university hill, and the erection 
in place thereof, of a substantial and handsome building, suitable 
for general academic purposes. If you see fit to grant our petition, 
we pledge ourselves to execute, with all diligence and faithfulness, 
the new trust committed to us. 
The last General Assembly confirmed the election of the follow- 
ing trustees, whose names had been submitted to them, in the bi- 
ennial report of this board for the two years ending December 20th, 
1892, in accordance with the provisions of the charter of the insti- 
tution: 
From the First District, Hugh G. Kyle; from the Second Dis- 
trict, Milton P. Jarnagin; from the Third District, James B. Fra- 
zier and Xenophon Wheeler; from the Fourth District, William 
C. Dismukes; from the Fifth District, W. B. Lamb; from the 
Sixth District, William H. Jackson; from the Seventh District, 
Campbell Brown and Z. W. Ewing; from the Highth District, 
James D. Porter; from the Ninth District, Frank P. Bond; from 
the Tenth District, Marye B. Trezevant and Jo. W. Allison. 
During the last two years the Board has lost from its member- 
ship, by death, Campbell Brown, Esq., from the Seventh District ; 
and by resignation, W. B. Lamb, Esq., from the Fifth District, and 
William H. Jackson, from the Sixth District. To fill these vacan- 
cies, Hon. Thomas J. Myers, from the Fifth District, Hugh L. 
Craighead, Esq., from the Sixth District, and Hon. T. F. P. Alli- 
son, from the Seventh District, have been elected. These gentle- 
men haying accepted membership, and having qualified and acted 
as members of the Board under the provisions of the charter, their 
names are now respectfully submitted to the General Assembly for 
confirmation,

sity has been as follows during the last eight years:

  In consideration of the fact that all preparatory classes have been 
abolished, and that the standard of admission to this department of 
the University has been considerably advanced during these years, 
the steady increase in numbers shown in the above table is deemed 
the very best evidence that thorough work is being done by the in- 
stitution. The report of the president will show great advances 
have been made in the requirements for admission to the institution 
and the reasons therefor, and the report of the Dean of the Academ- 
ic Department, with the accompanying reports of professors, clearly 
demonstrates the wisdom of this step. 
The attention of the General Assembly of 1893 was called, in our 
last biennial report, to the exceedingly complicated system of exam- 
inations followed by appointments to free scholarships in this insti- 
tution by Representatives and Senators, first enacted in the Act ap- 
proved March 26th, 1879, entitled “An Act to provide a more effi- 
cient and salutory method for the appointment of State cadets in 
the University of Tennessee,” and then in Sections 327 to 329 of 
the Code, and it was explained how this method had become wholly 
inoperative and obstructive. The system referred to requires the 
efficient co-operation of at least four State officials, namely: the 
Representative or Senator, the State Superintendent of Public In- 
struction, the county or city superintendent, and the President of 
the University, in order to appoint one person to a State scholar- 
ship, with free tuition, in this institution. The result was that even 
after the most diligent effort on the part of the State Superintend- 
ent and the President of the University, the system has never been 
even partially successful. In 1892-93, for example, after extensive 
correspondence, these officials only succeeded in getting forty-five
-P-A-G-E-189
190 
students appointed by Senators and Representatives out of a total 
number of two hundred and sixty-six actually registered in the in- 
stitution from Tennessee. For these apparent reasons the Board 
requested the General Assembly to repeal the law referred to. 
A bill designed to accomplish this purpose passed both branches 
of the General Assembly, but, failing to receive the signature of 
the Governor through some inadvertence, and not through pur- 
pose, as we are assured, it did not become a law. This request is 
renewed therefore, the experience of two additional years having 
fully confirmed the opinion that the system there provided is 
wholly inoperative. 
In the absence of any efficient system for designating those stu- 
dents who should receive the benefits of free tuition, this Board 
proceeded to devise a plan which would be in perfect harmony with 
the will of the people expressed in the bill above referred to, with 
the interest of the public school system of the State, and with the 
methods of the best State institutions in this country. They be- 
lieved that the time had arrived when the doors of the State Uni- 
versity should be thrown wide open to all persons from everywhere 
who were prepared to enter and enjoy the advantages here provided 
for them. The only conditions of admission should be: Is the 
person of proper age and character, and has he or she sufficient 
preparation to improve the advantages here provided ? 
The Board hereby announce to the General Assembly and to the 
people of the country that this institution now offers free tuition to 
all students of proper age aud character who apply and pass the re- 
quired examinations for admission to its classes. The system of 
admission is as follows: 
First—All schools, public and private, whose courses of study at 
least equal that provided in the laws of this State for secondary 
schools, and which have been accredited to the University of Ten- 
nessee as giving this instruction thoroughly, are authorized to cer- 
tify students to this University, who shall then be admitted to its 
lowest class without examination, and shall receive free tuition. 
The superintendents and principals of these accredited schools are 
requested to supply the President of the University with lists of
-P-A-G-E-190
—191— 
students thus found qualified, and to notify such students of their 
privileges under this plan. 
Secondly—The Faculty of the University is instructed to hold, 
or cause to be held, at convenient points throughout the State, ex- 
aminations for admission, for the purpose of giving opportunities 
to such persons as may uot have had the opportunity to attend any 
of the above schools. All who pass these examinations are also 
received with free tuition. 
Persons desiring to enter one of the higher classes are required, 
in addition to the certificate or entrance examination, to pass an 
examination on all the subjects taught in the class below the one 
which they seek to enter. 
This new plan has worked most successfully during two seasons, 
and this fact is an additional argument for-the repeal of the inop- 
erative law referred to. 
Unsolicited by him or by any one for him, the President of this 
University, Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., was, in October, 1893, 
tendered the position of Assistant Secretary of Agriculture of the 
United States. At a meeting of the Board of Trustees, held on 
December 12, 1893, Dr. Dabney informed the trustees of this fact 
and submitted to them the question of his acceptance, promising to 
be governed by their decision. The Faculty of the University, 
through a committee appointed for the purpose, presented their 
opinions to the Board. They were as follows: 
“That, in view of the existing conditions, well known to you all, 
it is the unanimous judgment of the faculty that Dr. Dabney should 
accept the position of Assistant Secretary of Agriculture; that we 
earnestly request that Dr. Dabney continue to retain and exercise. 
the authority and control in the affairs in the University with which 
he is at present charged to the fullest extent possible under the con- 
ditions of the leave of absence to be granted to him; and that such 
distribution of his other duties be made as, in the judgment of the 
Board, will best conserve the interests of the University in his ab- 
sence.” 
The position referred to was not a political, but a scientific and 
educational one. The Assistant Secretary has direction, under the 
Honorable Secretary of Agriculture, of the scientific bureaus and
-P-A-G-E-191
—192— 
divisions of this great department, with the supervision of the agri- 
cultural experiment stations connected with the agricultural colleges 
of the country. Appreciating the honor conferred upon the institu- 
tion, and the great opportunities thus offered, for acquiring informa- 
tion and experience that would be of advantage to this institution 
in the future, the Board of Trustees, after a careful consideration, 
decided to grant President Dabney a leave of absence upon the 
terms recommended by the faculty ; “ Provided, That he agreed to 
relinquish $3,000 of the salary annually paid him by this Board so 
long as he remained absent as the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture 
and drawing the salary of that office.” These terms were agreed to 
by all concerned, and President Dabney entered upon his duties as 
Assistant Secretary of Agriculture on the Ist of January, 1894. 
In accordance with this agreement President Dabney has attended 
the meetings of this Board, visited the University at frequent inter- 
vals, and has continued to direct its policy and administer its general 
interests. 
The wisdom of the arrangement has been fully shown by subse- 
quent events. The other members of the faculty have effectively 
performed the local and routine duties of the President; he has 
visited the University as often as needed, and has closely supervised 
its affairs, so that the institution has not suffered by his absence. 
On the contrary, we feel sure that his experience and administrative 
ability have been of great value to the cause of agriculture through- 
out the country. The University and the people of the State owe 
him a lasting debt of gratitude for his successful labors in their be- 
half. 
The Board would respectfully call your attention again to the ab- 
sence of any provision for publishing the annual and biennial re- 
ports of the University of Tennessee and the annual reports and 
bulletins of the Agricultural Experiment Station. We would espe- 
cially request that some provision be made for publishing this bi- 
ennial report for distribution among the members of the General 
Assembly, the teachers of the State, and the patrons of the institu- 
tion. 
For the Board of Trustees,

REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT. 
  
Jo the Honorable the Board of Trustees of the University of Ten- 
nessee : 
GENTLEMEN :—In beginning this, my fourth biennial report as 
President of the University of Tennessee, I am reminded again of 
the honor bestowed upon me by you seven years ago, and of the 
great kindness and absolute fidelity which have characterized your 
dealings with me personally, and the wisdom and faithfulness exhib- 
ited in your conduct of the affairs of this institution during this 
time. When one looks back over these years of earnest striving 
and compares the condition of the University to-day with its con- 
dition at the beginning of this period, we see much to be grateful 
for and something to be proud of, although we are compelled to note 
also some failures and disappointments. We may well be proud of 
the material improvements upon the University hill, of the in- 
eveased appropriations, and of the increased favor bestowed upon 
the institution by the people of Tennessee and of the Suuth ; but we 
rejoice, most of all, in the advanced standard and the improved 
character of the work being done by both professors and students, 
and especially in the high moral tone and the spirit of earnestness 
which now pervades the entire institution. While the material im- 
provements, and especially the provisions of new buildings, have 
fallen far short of the hopes and expectations of seven years ago, we 
may truthfully say that the development of these intellectual and 
moral forces has been more rapid than we ever dared to hope. 
New Pian oF ADMISSION. 
The old system of appointing State students, owing to its compli- 
cations, had proven an utter failure, and the time seemed ripe for 
the substitution of a more rational plan based upon the work of the 
secondary schools, the city high schools, and the better private 
schools of the country. In our biennial report for 1892, the de- 
fects of the old system of appointments by Representatives and Sen- 
ators, on examinations of county superintendents, were therefore
-P-A-G-E-198
—199— 
fully explained, and the General Assembly was requested to pass a 
bill repealing the old plan. This proposal received the unanimous 
approval of both branches of the General Assembly, but failed to 
become a law through an accident which deprived it of the signa- 
ture of the Governor, a fact that was not known until it was too 
late to be remedied. In pursuance of the proposal, which had met 
with such cordial approval, the Board adopted a new plan of ad- 
mission, under which every person, of a proper age and character, 
and having the proper preparation, is admitted to the class for 
which he or she is found qualified, and receive free tuition. It is 
needless to say that this liberal system is a great success. It is 
hoped, therefore, that the next General Assembly will repeal the 
law establishing the old plan of appointments, which is no longer 
needed, 
ADVANCEMENT OF THE STANDARD. 
In 1886-87, owing to the very poor character and limited num- 
ber of preparatory schools in this section, the University was still 
conducting, as it had throughout its entire existence, a preparatory 
department consisting of three classes below the Freshman class. 
This was deemed necessary in order to secure well-trained students 
for the academic courses. Your Board at that time adopted a dif- 
ferent policy, namely: that of building up the preparatory schools 
of the State, and of gradually cutting off the preparatory depart- 
ment of the University. First one, then another, class in this de- 
partment was cut off, until there remained only a single sub- Freshman 
class below the regular college course. This class was next reduced to 
a fraction ofa class by allowing only those who were lacking in math- 
ematics, Latin, or Greek, to receive this instruction here. Finally, 
at the opening of the present session, the sub-Freshman instruction 
in mathematics was cut off, so that at last the University of Ten- 
nessee has gotten rid of all English and mathematical preparatory 
work. As the public schools teach no Latin or Greek, the sub- 
Freshman instruction in them must be continued for the present. 
The records of the institution show very clearly that it does not 
help either the students, the University or the State to maintain 
here English preparatory classes below the Freshman class. Dur- 
ing the five sessions from 1889-90 to 1893-94, inclusive, one hun- 
dred and twenty-six persons were enrolled in this institution as such
-P-A-G-E-199
—200— 
sub-freshmen, During the first portion of this period this was a 
separate class ; during the last three years of the period they were 
only conditioned Freshmen, haying special instruction in Latin, 
Greek or mathematics. What were the results? Our records 
show that of this number only eleven have reached the Sophomore 
class in any academic course, four the Junior class, and that ouly 
three have graduated. The conclusions are irresistible, therefore, 
either that the vast majority of these persons were hopelessly back- 
ward, or that this was not the proper place for them to make up 
their lost opportunities. Some worthy persons have secured the 
elements of a liberal education in this class, but the figures show 
that they never got beyond the elements. We have decided, thus, 
that it is wrong to encourage such persons to come to an institu- 
tion like this when they are not fully prepared, and that the only 
hope is in the upbuilding of better preparatory schools, both pub- 
lic and private. To this work the University will, therefore, ad- 
dress itself with renewed energy and increased hope. 
ACCREDITED SCHOOLS AND ADMISSION. 
In the meantime everything possible has been done to encourage 
the establishment of town and city high schools and other public 
secondary schools, and of university schools and academies under 
private auspices. Without having any direct connection with them, 
the Faculty of the University has in various ways assisted in or- 
ganizing such schools in many different towns in the State. 
The General Assembly of 1891 was induced to pass an Act per- 
mitting school directors to establish and maintain “secondary 
schools,” consisting of three years’ work in addition to the five 
years already provided in the public schools, in the course of which 
there should be taught, among other things, “ the elements of alge- 
bra, of plane geometry, of natural philosophy, of civil government 
and of rhetoric or higher English.” The Superintendent of Pub- 
lic Instruction states in his report for 1893 that six hundred and 
forty-one of these schools for white persons and twenty-four for 
colored persons have been organized. The report for 1894 will 
show that many of these schools had been organized up'to June 30, 
1894. When their courses have been thoroughly organized and 
graded these schools will contribute greatly toward the advance- 
ment of higher education in Tennessee.
-P-A-G-E-200
—201— 
As far as possible the removal of the preparatory work and the 
advancement of the standard in this institution were made “ pari 
passu” with the organization and progress of the preparatory 
schools, both public and private. As soon as a number of sec- 
ondary schools had been organized throughout the State the Uni- 
versity gave notice that it would, beginning with September, 1894, 
adyance its standard to a point that would enable the student to 
begin comfortably with this course left him. 
It is universally admitted that every institution of learning must 
have the right to determine the requirements for admission to its 
own courses. In exercising this right, we have decided that while 
on the one hand it would be improper to do any considerable part 
of the work of the public schools, the city high schools, or the 
better private schools of the State, it is our clear duty, on the other 
hand, to keep our requirements for admission down to the average 
point ut which the best public secondary schools, city high schools 
and private schools leave the majority of their good pupils. It 
would be improper, on the one hand, to fix the condition of ad- 
mission at the maximum point to which the best schools take 
their pupils, as it would be unjust on the other to fix these con- 
ditions at the minimum accomplished by the ordinary common 
school. The point at which the best schools lose their best students 
is not necessarily the point of graduation. In our best city high 
schools and private schools it is unfortunatoly often below their 
point of graduation. Such are the attractions of business and the 
necessities of our modern civilization that the boys, especially, are 
with difficulty held in these preparatory schools until the entire 
course is completed. This is greatly to be regretted, and school 
principals and college presidents should labor together to remedy 
it. It is very desirable in the interests of the pupil, the high school, 
and the college alike, that the young people should complete the 
high school and academy courses before they are admitted to the col- _ 
lege or university. A requirement to this effect, when it is possible 
to make it, would enable the colleges to advance their standards and 
improve their courses, while it would give the young people a much 
better training for either practical life or the pursuit of an advanced 
education. It is earnestly hoped that the day is not far distant 
when such a rule as this can be adopted.
-P-A-G-E-201
—202— 
The faculty of the University have organized a permanent com- 
mittee on accredited schools and admission, with a secretary who 
corresponds with the principals of the various preparatory schools 
of the State, for the purpose of informing them with regard to the 
requirements of the University and of encouraging them to improve 
their courses of study to such a point that they may be recognized 
and accredited by our faculty as competent to prepare students for 
admission to our Freshman class. This committee also makes all 
the arrangements for the local examinations for admission held 
through the State, and grade the papers of the candidates. Their 
work divides itself, thus, into two heads; first, the examination and 
approval of schools, which, when enrolled, are known as accredited 
schools, and are authorized to certify students for admission without 
‘examination to our Freshman class; and, second, the direction of 
examinations held at the University at the beginning of each term 
and at various points throughout the State for the accommodation 
of persons who have not had the opportunity to attend the accredited 
schools. 
The great want of uniformity in the courses of study in the public 
schools of the cities and towns, and the still greater diversity among 
the privaté schools, has greatly delayed the enrollment of accredited 
schools. Any high school, academy, or other institution whose 
course of study covers the branches required for admission to our 
Freshman class, may be put on the list of accredited schools, by 
vote of our faculty, after application and examination by a repre- 
sentative of the University. Analphabetical list of the schools thus 
accredited, with the names and addresses of their principals, is pub- 
lished annually in the announcement. The list published in the 
last announcement contains twenty-five schools, both public and 
private, in Tennessee, and six in other States. Graduates or pro- 
ficients, duly recommended by the principals of such schools, re- 
ceive free tuition, and are admitted to the Freshman class without 
examination, the right being reserved to examine candidates for ad- 
mission to any higher classes, upon the subjects taught in the Fresh- 
man and other classes beneath it. The total number of persons ad- 
mitted on certificates from these accredited schools at the opening 
of the current session was seventeen. 
As a means of encouraging preparatory schools to advance their 
courses of study, and of informing the teachers of the State defi-
-P-A-G-E-202
—203— 
nitely with regard to the requirements for admission to the Univer- 
sity, as well as for the accommodation of candidates, a considerable 
number of examinations for admission were announced throughout 
the State during the past spring and summer, and nineteen exami- 
nations were actually held in this State at other points than Knox- 
ville. Thirty-three persons tried these examinations, and fourteen 
passed them and were admitted to the University, only one with 
conditions. Forty-seven persons tried the examinations for admis- 
sion at the University in June and September. Thirty-seven of 
these passed without conditions, and four with conditions. The 
total number who tried the entrance examinations this year was 
eighty, and the total number admitted by examinations was fifty- 
five, including five only who had conditions. No notice is made of 
a very large number who made inquiries about the examinations 
and many who attended them, but failed to hand in their papers. 
Considering the advancement of the standard with the opening of 
this term, and the great difficulty in obtaining money at this time, 
these are very good results. It is the uniform testimony of the 
Dean and the professors in the academic department that this sys- 
tem of accredited schools and examinations for admission is secur- 
ing us a much higher grade of students than the old system of ex- 
aminations and appointment by Representatives and Senators. 
The new plan throws the dvors of the University wide open to 
all who are of the proper age and character and properly prepared. 
It is a question, not of friendship or possible favoritism of Senator 
or Representative, but of merit. No one of proper age and char- 
acter, and having the proper preparation, has ever been, or ever will 
be, excluded from the institution. This we believe to be the only 
plan to be followed by a great institution belonging to all the 
people. 
GovERNMENT. 
It is now four years since the system of military government, 
with its numerous detailed rules and regulations for all sorts of pur- 
poses, which had prevailed at this institution for many years, was 
abolished, and the control of the students was assigned to the Dean. 
In the announcement for 1890-91, the Dean stated the principles 
of his government in a single short paragraph, as follows:
-P-A-G-E-203
e004" 
“The University does not undertake to prescribe in detail either 
its requirements or prohibitions. The students are met on a plane 
of mutual regard and helpfulness. Our appeal is to a proper sense 
of the proprieties of life and the necessities of such an organiz tion. 
It does not require a gross and overt act to sever the connection of 
a student to whom such appeal proves vain. It is expected of every 
student that he will be a gentleman in all relations and associations ; 
that he will be diligent in study, prompt and regular in attendance 
on all prescribed exercises, etc.” 
Two other sentences stated the ordinary requirements of an insti- 
tution like this, and this simple code of government concludes with 
the warning: “ Indulgence in vice in any of its forms will lead to 
the prompt exclusion of the person from the University.” 
It is deeply gratifying to learn from the report of the Dean, as ~ 
well as from the testimony of the entire Faculty, and, I may add, of 
the whole community, that this simple code of principles, faithfully 
carried out, has accomplished all that was necessary for the estab- 
lishment of good order, and for the maintenance of a high standard 
of morals and of work. 
The advancement in the requirements for admission and the ad- 
mission of women of a fairly mature age to the University have un- 
doubtedly contributed to this happy result. But these good results 
must be attributed chiefly to the earnest and dutiful spirit of the 
students and the affectionate and faithful ministrations of the Dean 
and other officers of the institution. “Gratifying evidence of the im- 
provement in spirit is found in the total abolition of all hazing or 
other rudeness to new students, and the almost total ubsence of 
those silly and boisterous disturbances that sometimes characterize 
large bodies of young men. 
ADMISSION oF WOMEN. 
At a meeting of the Faculty on the Ist of May, 1893, a resolu- 
tion was unanimously adopted requesting the Board of Trustees to 
make a declaration in favor of the admission of women of a proper 
age to the University. There was nothing in the laws of the State 
or the regulations of the institution to exclude women, and the Act 
of Congress creating the endowment of the college seemed to imply
-P-A-G-E-204
05 
that they should have their share of its benefits. The Board were 
petitioned, therefore, to adopt a settled policy with regard to this 
subject. Accordingly, at a meeting of the Board of Trustees on the 
5th of June, the resolution of the Faculty was referred to a special 
committee, with instructions to draw up regulations under which 
women might be admitted to the Academic Department of the in- 
stitution. Their report was unanimously adopted, and was as fol- 
lows: 
“The University of Tennessee declares its intention hereafter to 
admit women of the full age of seventeen years to all the benefits 
and privileges of this institution; but for their safety and proper - 
protection they will be subject to the following regulations, viz. : 
“1. They will have no dormitory or domicile on the University 
grounds, except in the families of the Faculty. 
‘2. They will not board or lodge in any family in which male 
students board or lodge at the same time, and then only in families 
approved in writing by the Faculty, or by their own parents or le- 
gal guardians. 
«3. A building on the University grounds shall be set apart 
temporarily for their use as reception rooms whilst awaiting their 
recitations. " 
“4, The Faculty is charged with the utmost diligence in the ob- 
servance of these regulations, and such others as may be adopted by 
them under the supervision of the Board; and those wh» accept 
the benefits of this school thereby pledge themselves to dutiful ac- 
quiescence in the same.” 
‘Tnis action was promptly published to the people of the State, 
and the result was that forty-eight young women were admitted in 
the regular way during the session 1893-94. After another year’s 
experience, the President of the University can only repeat with 
added confidence what he said in his annual report for 1893. He 
said there: 
“Tt gives us pleasure to testify that the young women whu have 
entered are well prepared and are doing admirable work. They
-P-A-G-E-205
—206— 
were admitted on the same terms precisely as men; that is, upon 
examinations or high school certificates. The women take the reg- 
ular courses. Not a single class was changed, nor a new one 
started, for their special benefit. They wanted the benefit of the 
facilities for higher education and scientific training previously pro- 
vided at the University, and they were admitted to the existing 
courses, and were required to take a full quota of work, fifteen 
hours a week, unless physically disqualified or especially exempted 
by the Faculty, and all women wanting only special classes like 
literature, French, etc., were excluded. The University offers, as 
yet, no instruction in music, art (other than freehand and indus- 
trial drawing), or any of the so-called ‘accomplishments’ * * * 
Everything was thus done to discourage that class of young women 
who merely wanted to be polished or ‘ finished’ from entering the 
institution; but everything reasonable was done to encourage 
women who wanted a thorough, liberal education, training in some 
specialty, or education for some profession. * * * Under 
these circumstances the Faculty cannot but be greatly gratified, 
both by the large number entering for the regular work and the 
earnest spirit manifested by them. The results prove beyond 
question that the step was a wise, just and much needed one.” 
The time has already passed when the officers of this institution 
look upon women as forming a separate class or factor in our life 
and work. They have taken their places with quiet dignity by the 
sides of their brothers, and will be known hereafter merely as 
students of the University earnestly seeking the best results in the 
higher education, and will receive the same attention and encour- 
agement heretofore bestowed upon the men, 
It is a pleasure, however, to report that as a result, possibly, of 
the intense determination of the women admitted during this first 
session (1893-94) to make a record for themselves fully equal to that 
of the men, three women took the Faculty scholarships given to the 
best students in the Freshman, Sophomore and Junior class, respect- 
ively. This evidence of their excellent preparation, admirable 
ability, and high spirit was a source of much gratification to the 
Faculty and Trustees, who had taken the responsibility of their ad- 
mission at this time.

IMPROVEMENTS TO PROPERTY. 
A new brick and stone building of two stories, and having a 
slate roof, has just been completed on the college farm. It will be 
used as a domitory for agricultural students, enabling them to live 
nearer to their work. It contains a reading-room, dining-room, 
well-equipped kitchen, and sufficient sleeping-rooms for twenty or 
thirty young men. The building is heated by steam and has a 
bath-room, with an abundant supply of water, etc. A full descrip- 
tion will be found in the report of the School of Agriculture. 
The water pipes of the West Knoxville Water Company have 
been extended through the University grounds and fire hydrants 
have been erected. A hose reel is kept in a building on the cam- 
pus, and some of the students are organized as a fire company. 
A minor improvement, but one that is very highly appreciated 
by the members of the military department and the students inter- 
ested in athletics, was the grading of a portion of the campus for 
a drill ground and athletic field. 
A new lecture-room, a reading-room and a museum-room have 
been arranged, refitted and partly furnished for the Teachers’ De- 
partment. é

TreacHERS’ DEPARTMENT. 
The standard of the work of this department has been consider- 
ably raised during the last two years. The shorter course for 
teachers corresponds very closely to the Freshman and Sophomore 
years of the literary course of the college, the chief addition being 
a practical course of instruction in psychology, principles of teach- 
ing, organizing, grading and conducting schools, ete. Advanced 
work in pedagogies is given as an elective in the Senior year of the 
literary and scientifi: courses. This course embraces the philoso-
-P-A-G-E-208
ze909== 
phy of education, history of education, educational systems, super- 
vision and contemporary education in various countries. Twenty- 
three persons were enrolled in this department during the session 
1892-93 and forty-seven during the session 1893-94. 
In view of the important work that this department is doing in 
training teachers for the public schools, it is suggested that it de- 
serves and should receive some direct State aid. No public money 
is better spent than that used for training teachers for the public 
schools. A large number of teachers are annually required for the 
new secondary schools, and it is very difficult to find them. Any 
aid given to this department will greatly promote the training of 
teachers for these schools. 
With the aid of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction 
and the Peabody Board, the University conducted a summer school 
for teachers last July, which was attended by over three hundred 
persons. This school was designed to supplement the work of the 
Teachers’ Department, and give an impulse to those teachers in the 
public schools who could not leave their work long enough to take 
the regular course in this institution. It is proposed to continue it 
in the future, if the co-operation of the State Department of Public 
Instruction can be secured. i 
Law DEPARTMENT. 
This department has increased steadily during the last two years, 
and may now be considered as permanently established. Having 
no endowment, but being supported entirely from the fees paid by 
its students, it had necessarily to first establish itself in the public 
fayor. The department is closely connected with the academic and 
other departments, and is receiving a number of the graduates and 
other students from these departments. Some of the academic stu- 
dents take the Junior law course during their Senior year in the 
college course, planning to remain here after graduation from the 
academic department until this additional course also has been 
completed. The numbers in attendance have been more than 
doubled during the past two years. 
InpustriaL DEPARTMENT FOR CoLoRED STUDENTS. 
This department of the institution has made marked progress 
since the last biennial report. The industrial building mentioned 
14
-P-A-G-E-209
—210— 
in that report has been still better furnished and equipped, and 
there are provisions for work in wood and iron, for laboratories of 
chemistry and botany, for drawing rooms, and a printing office. 
Twenty-seven students were enrolled during 1892-93, and forty- 
six in 1893-94. There are two courses of study, one in agriculture 
and one in mechanic arts. They both include the usual English 
branches, in addition to the sciences and technical subjects, and 
each extends over five years. As an additional encouragement 
to the students of this department, a number of apprenticeships 
have been established, which are awarded to meritorious and prom- 
ising students taking one of the regular courses. They secure work 
in the shops and onthe farm of the department, for which fair re- 
muneration is allowed. 
Nereps oF THE UNIVERSITY. 
Our greatest need is a new central academic building to take the 
place of the old ones which now occupy the crown of the beautiful 
University hill. Two of these buildings have already become too 
dilapidated to be effectively repaired. The necessity for replacing 
them was fully discussed in the last biennial report of the board, 
and need not be repeated here further than to say that two years 
have left them in a still more wretched condition, and have illus- 
trated to all in many ways the necessity for a new building to ac- 
commodate the growing work of the institution. By neglecting to 
provide the institution with adequate buildings, the State is greatly 
retarding its development and injuring its usefulness. The funds 
now expended here would be far more effectual in the education of 
the youth of the State if the proper buildings were provided. 
There is also a great demand for better equipment for the en- 
gineering and scientific schools. In the biennial report for 1888 the 
demand in the South for practical men was discussed, and the Gen- 
eral Assembly were earnestly petitioned to make adequate provision ” 
' for the training of young men at this institution who will go out 
and do the engineering and scientific work required for the devel- 
opment of our section. We have seen a very considerable develop- 
ment of our material resources since that time, but the conviction is 
well nigh universal that this portion of the South is now about to 
enter upon a period of advance along all industrial lines that will
-P-A-G-E-210
oni 
surpass anything that has been known here in the past. It is well 
known to all who are familiar with the management of the rail- 
roads, factories, mines, etc., now operated in this section that the 
executive and scientific departments of these establishments are, as 
a rule, filled by men who are not natives of the State or section. 
The higher the scientific qualifications called for and the salaries 
paid, the more certain it is that the men found in charge will not 
be natives of the State. If our section experiences this revival there 
will, of course, be a large demand for competent young men. But 
relatively few of these places will be open to Tenesseans, for the 
reason that few of them will have been trained to fill them. It is 
needless, therefore, to say that, Tennessee ought to have a great 
school of natural science and engineering, with buildings and equip- 
ment equal to the best in the land. The University of Tennessee, 
_ located, as it is, in the center of the coal, iron, and hardwood sec- 
tion of the South, which is destined to contain the majority of these 
mines and factories, should be made such 2 school. What is needed 
in order to do this is more equipment for its schools of engineering 
and the natural sciences. 
The institution has already done everything it could in this way, 
and has opened departments of civil, mechanical, and electrical en- 
gineering, and laboratories for chemistry and physics, which are as 
well equipped as the funds in hand will permit. But all of these 
schools need larger and better buildings and more equipment be- 
fore-they can compete with the technological institutions in the 
North and East. The school of Civil Engineering urgently needs 
a building and equipment for testing materials. The school of Me- 
chanic Arts needs a foundry building and equipment for instruction 
in casting the various metals. While a much larger sum will be 
needed to equip these separate departments as they ought to be, 
twenty or thirty thousand dollars would more than double their 
present outfit and do much to aid the students of the institution in 
qualifying themselves for these important practical professions. 
LIBRARY. 
The library of the University has been re-arranged and put into 
a much more useful condition since its removal to the new apart- 
ments in Science Hall. A librarian and assistant are employed, and
-P-A-G-E-211
—212— 
are regularly in attendance. The reading room and seminary room 
are kept open during the entire day, and the delivery room is open 
several hours during each day. The library has thus been made a 
working laboratory instead of a storehouse for books, as heretofore. 
The result is that the professors and students are using it as they 
never did before. In fact, the use to which this rather small, but 
well-selected and well-arranged library, is put is, I am informed, 
almost unequalled in the history of such institutions. During the 
first three months of the current session, for example, nearly two 
thousand volumes were taken out by one hundred and thirty-four 
professors and students, or an average of about fifteen books per 
person, or five for each person each month. This indicates a most 
diligent pursuit of knowledge on the part of these members of the 
institution. During the last year only one book was lost, while 
about five hundred were added by purchase and gift. During the 
last two years two thousand and twenty-eight volumes have been 
added. The library now contains eleven thousand, four hundred 
and eighty-one bound volumes, and about three thousand unbound 
volumes and pamphlets. 
Respectfully submitted.

REPORT OF THE DEAN OF THE ACADEMIC DEPARTMENT 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
Dear Srr:—In submitting this report to you and, through you, 
to the Board of Trustees, I am gratified to note the continued im- 
provement and development of the entire work. If a group of 
more diligent, painstaking, conscientious and enthusiastic workers 
is to be found than the professors in this department, I do not 
know where to look for them. They are always on hand and 
always ready in class and out of it to stimulate, encourage and aid 
their students, furnishing by example, as well as precept, models 
for young men engaged in scholarly pursuits. If any criticism 
were made upon them, it would be on the score of wishing and 
endeavoring to do, and have done, too much rather than too little. 
They are, furthermore, without exception, active members of the 
various Christian churches, and are a distinct moral, as well as intel- 
lectual, force in the University and community. It is not proper 
for me to comment on their attainments or ability, but this cer- 
tainly is true that what they have is given without stint to the 
charge committed to them; and, most fortunately, there is neither 
friction nor faction among them. That they should see each year 
increasing the fruits of their labors is only to be expected. You 
will see these in the detailed reports which they present herewith. 
ADMISSION OF STUDENTS. 
Candidates are admitted upon written examinations held here in 
June and September and at various points throughout the State 
during the summer. The questions are all given out from the Uni- 
versity, and the papers are inspected by the respective professors. 
I am guided by the reports of these in admitting or excluding. A 
- large number of those who applied for this year were not found 
qualified. A good working knowledge of grammar (English), com- 
position, geography, spelling, United States history, arithmetic, and 
algebra as far as the theory of exponents, is essential. These sub- 
jects are taught in the secondary schools of the State, and we cer-
-P-A-G-E-213
ofa 
tainly cannot be expected to teach them here. The difficulty is 
found to be in the fact that while pupils have been taken over 
them, they have no adequate knowledge of them. It is greatly to 
be desired for the efficacy of the whole public school system of the 
State that these subjects should have more attention to the exclu- 
sion of efforts to teach those advanced scientific subjects for which 
neither teachers nor pupils are prepared. Add to the above two 
years of good drill in Latin (for the Latin scientific course) and 
one in Greek also (for the classical course) and the student is pre- 
pared to enter the Freshman class in any course offered here. For 
the courses open to students and leading to various degrees refer- 
ence is made in our annual catalogue, which will be sent on appli- 
cation. 
ACCREDITED ScHOOLS. 
Nothing has contributed more to the improvement of our Fresh- 
man material than the schools which have been accredited and are 
now sending us their pupils. Candidates recommended by the prin- 
cipals of these are allowed to enter the Freshman class without ex- 
amination, but only the Freshman. Applicants for higher standing 
are subject to examination for classification. We desire to foster 
these high schools by every means in our power, fully assured that 
the interests of the University, as of the real education of the young 
people of the State, are involved in their success. But on account 
of the small number capable and willing to do this essential work 
properly, we find ourselves sorely perplexed. If we admit students 
that ought to be in them, the schools are damaged and discouraged. 
If we fix a standard that will exclude all such, we are liable to the 
charge of putting the benefits of the University out of reach of those 
for whom it was intended. But the best good of all the people lies 
in building and sustaining these high schools, and insisting that 
they do thoroughly this preparatory work and do not attempt what 
they are not in a condition to accomplish. 
NumpBers. 
In the effort to still further exclude from the University those 
who are not prepared to profit by it, the number of matriulates this 
year will be somewhat smaller than that of last (834). But thereisa 
distinct gain in the quality, remarked by all the professors. Wecould
-P-A-G-E-214
—215— 
easily have had a much larger number, but to the detriment, rather 
than the benefit, of the University and the cause of education in the 
State. The severe financial depression stopped a number who had 
stood the examination and expected to come. But while we welcome 
every earnest student who comes, it is not upon numbers, but upon 
the character of the work that we seek to establish the institution 
in the favor of the people. 
Women STUDENTS. 
The admission of women to the Uuiversity at. the beginning of 
last year has worked in practice just about what reasonably may 
have been expected. Forty-five were admitted, and the number 
will be about the same this year, a good proportion of them pre- 
paring themselves for teachers. As a body they have proven most 
worthy and successful students, ranking considerably above the 
average. They cannot enter under seventeen years of age, and are 
on the grounds only during the working hours. A building is pro- 
vided jor their comfort while here, and under the control of an ex- 
ecutive committee of five of their own number. This committee is 
also charged with the interests of the women students in general, 
and reports weekly to the Dean in writing. If anything arises 
which cannot be corrected by themselves, then the names of the 
offenders are given to the Dean for final action. All board with 
friends in the city. 
The exactions of the work here are such that it is not probable 
that a large number of girls will care to undergo them, but the 
facts prove that there are some to whom these opportunities are wel- 
come, and they furnish one of the most satisfactory elements in the 
lecture rooms. The majority of them are remakable, beth for dili- 
gence and attainments. A building specially designed for their needs 
is almost a necessity. 
ORDER AND GOVERNMENT. 
This is now the second biennial report since the control of the 
students was placed in my hands. Setting out with the firm con- 
viction that such an institution cannot be a reformatory for bad 
boys, and that one who does not know how to behave, or is unwill- 
ing to observe the conditions necessary to its suecess, ought not to
-P-A-G-E-215
—216— 
be here, I have acted on it more and more rigidly. Discarding all 
specific laws, an appeal was made to the sense of right and duty only. 
_ The success of this appeal has been most gratifying. The quiet and 
orderly bearing of the students for these two years has been the sub- 
ject of marked comment. There is no hazing or rudeness to new 
students—none of the petty, vexatious misdemeanors that so often 
mar college life. There is such a self-respecting and loyal spirit 
among the students, and such a cordiality and community of inter- 
ests between them and their teachers, that it is a genuine pleasure 
to live and work here. The Faculty is a unit in putting the high- 
est premium upon truth, honor, and frank sincerity, and in allow- 
ing nothing to atone for the lack of them. No sort of humiliating 
penalty is resorted to. It is thoroughly understood that a rowdy is 
not wanted and will not be tolerated here. If any come they re- 
form promptly, or their parents are quietly requested to withdraw 
them. 
The moral and religious influences are of the most salutary kind. 
The Young Men’s Christian Association is a powerful factor for 
good. The preachers of the city get the roll of their respective 
members at the beginning of the year, and all are made welcome to 
their churches. The majority of the teachers have Bible classes in 
the respective Sunday-schools, and a week night Bible class is con- 
‘ducted by myself in addition. Students are cordially invited to 
join some of these, and many are punctual and regular in attend- 
ance. I submit this report in the confident conviction that more 
satisfactory conditions for the prosecution of those aims for which 
a school is founded would be difficult to find. 
Respectfully, 
[Signed] i T. W. Jorpan, Dean.

REPORTS OF SCHOOLS. 
1,—_SCHOOL OF LATIN LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
Dear Str—I have the honor to submit herewith the report for 
the Department of Latin: 
Sus-CoLLEGIATE. 
1, Beginner’s Class.—This class, chiefly intended for those who 
desire to take the Teachers’ Course, is not organized until the begin- 
ning of the spring term in February. No report can, therefore, be ~ 
made now. It usually contains about twenty to twenty-five 
members. 
2. Cesar Class.—This contains at present twenty-six members, 
and is a continuation of the above. It requires three terms of five 
months each to accomplish the work of these two classes, and this 
is requisite to entrance to the Freshman class. But, while this is 
true of the more mature and earnest men and women in the Teach- 
ers’ Course, it will usually take two full years for others to accom- 
plish this work. It is expected of those who would enter the 
Freshman class that they shall be able to decline nouns, pro- 
nouns and adjectives promptly and accurately, giving genders, 
irregularities, etc.; compare adjectives and adverbs ; conjugate the 
verbs and write readily on the board synopses of same; write 
simple sentences in Latin, showing knowledge of the elements of 
syntax, and be able to translate the simpler prose writers, such as 
Nepos and Cesar. 
CoLLEGIATE. 
Freshman.—Texts: Virgil, Sallust, Gildersleeve’s Grammar (edi- 
tion ’94), Gildersleeve’s Exercise Book, Course I.; Classic Myths 
(Gayley). Meets four times per week throughout the year. Twen- 
ty-five members.
-P-A-G-E-217
—218— 
The hour for recitation is about equally divided between the 
grammar, the exercises in writing and the translation. A rapid 
review of the declensions and conjugations is made, a plain exposi- 
tion of the more common constructions in syntax is given, and 
these are illustrated by the sentences given in English to be writ- 
ten in Latin on the board and from the author read. It is not 
enough that the paradigms can be given by rote. The separate 
forms must be at command; nor is the writing limited to such as 
may be done deliberately and with the aid of the books. A work- 
ing vocabulary with ready application of the same is requisite. 
Sophomore.—Texts : Cicero (Orations and Laelius), Tacitus (Ger- 
mania and Agricola), grammar (exercise book), Courses II. and 
III.; Private Life of the Romans (Preston and Dodge). Three 
hours per week throughout the year. Twenty-nine members. 
The grammatical work of this class includes a fuller presenta- 
tion of the laws of syntax in general, but the emphasis of this 
year’s work is upon the close relations and connected matter. The 
translations are, of course, longer and required to be more true to 
the author and expressed in better and more idiomatic English. 
These courses (II. and III.) of Gildersleeve’s Exercise Book will 
give a fair idea of the written work, but it is not confined to this. 
Junior.—Texts: Livy, books XXI—X XII. ; Horace, Odes and 
Satires. Gildersleeve’s Grammar and Exercise Book, completed. 
Roman Literature—Select readings from Cruttwell’s Roman Lit- 
erature. Prosody. Three hours per week throughout the year. 
Class now numbers thirteen. 
The grammatical work of this class completes the discussion of 
the verb—moods, tenses, sequence, ete., especially the uses of the 
same in oratio oblique and kindred constructions. The fourth 
course in the exercise book will show the character of the sentences 
given in class and written on the board. But, in addition to this, 
in the spring term longer connected exercises are given out weekly. 
The character of these may be seen from the books from which 
they are usually taken, Miller’s or Eaton’s Latin Prose. The 
metres used by Horace are discussed. The quantities of the sylla- 
bles are marked and the verses are read metrically. Further prac-
-P-A-G-E-218
—219— 
tice is given by disarranging the order of the words as given, and 
requiring the class to replace them according to the laws of con- 
struction of the given verse or strophe. 
Senior.—Texts: Juvenal, Seneca, Tacitus, or Pliny. Original 
connected exercises for writing into Latin are continued, putting 
into practice and reviewing all the principles previously discussed. 
A wider reading and fuller acquaintance with the literature of the 
language is gained. Parallel readings in both English and Latin 
are assigned, the details of which it is not necessary to give here. 
No student will be admitted to this class unless he satisfies the pro- 
fessor that his previous training has been such as to enable him to 
profit by it. Practice in sight reading is given, and a part of the 
translation set for examination is taken from authors not before 
read. This class now numbers twelve. It meets three times per 
week throughout the year. 
The examinations in all classes at the end of each term are writ- 
ten. It is divided into three parts: one to the grammar work, one 
to the English to be written into Latin, and one to the translation 
from the Latin, all without notes, lexicons, or helps of any kind. 
Time, five hours. Written translations are required from time to 
time in all the classes, and every effort made to avoid the extremes 
of a bald literalism on the one hand, and, on the other, a weak par- 
aphrase. An accurate interpretation of the thought of the author, 
expressed in idiomatic English, is the constant aim. 
GRADUATE WoRK. 
Candidates for the degree of Master of Arts who elect this sub- 
ject, as well as others who, having completed the college course, de- 
sire to prosecute their studies in Latin still further, are provided 
for as occasion may demand. This work, of course is allotted ac- 
cording to the special needs or wishes of those who engage in it. 
There are at present three such students. The work assigned 
them for this term is comedy. Several of the best plays of Plautus 
and Terence have already been studied. They meet the professor 
at least once a week, generally twice, for reading, criticism, and 
seminary work in general.
-P-A-G-E-219
—220— 
It will be seen from the above that there are altogether one hun- 
dred and eight students in the department, and this will be mate- 
rially increased at the beginning of the next term. As the subject 
is optional, except in the classical course, the exhibit is gratifying. 
The work asa whole is progressing with more satisfaction to my- 
self than ever before. No one is required to take it who does not 
wish it. I am, therefore, relieved, with very few exceptions, of 
those who have no interest or aptitude for the study. The enthu- 
siasm and diligence of the students are most commendable. 
Respectfully submitted. 
T. W. Jordan, 
Professor of Latin.

  During the past session I wrote a letter to various school princi- 
pals throughout the State requesting their co-operation in the effort 
we were making to place our work in Greek upon a higher plane. 
I urged them, if possible, to provide in their curricula a course of 
study which would fit students for a classical course in college, and 
in so far relieve us of any necessity for sub-Freshman work. The 
letter excited interest and inquiry, was published in several newspa- 
pers of the State, and elicited very encouraging and sympathetic re- 
plies from prominent school officials. In some instances active steps
-P-A-G-E-220
—221— 
were taken in the line indicated, and, although no visible results 
as yet are accomplished, I believe a measure of benefit to the cause 
has followed. 
It isa matter of sincere gratification that, with the standard of 
the University raised, there is an increasing number of new stu- 
dents who have had some previous or preparatory training in Greek. 
Of the fourteen students entering this fall and electing Greek, one 
was admitted to Junior Greek, two to Sophomore, and six to Fresh- 
man. A reference to the present numbers in the Greek classes will 
show that the percentage of students in the University who elect 
Greek compares favorably with that in other institutions which are 
engaged largely in the same character of work, and where the study 
has enjoyed uninterrupted recognition. 
Iam much pleased with the work and progress of the classes, and 
take occasion here to commend the excellent work of my assistant, 
Mr. Howell Livingston, who is entrusted with the sub-Freshman 
class.

never larger or more enthusiastic. It will be seen that another 
year is added to the course, made necessary by the demands of Se- 
niors for this senior elective in languages. With this class the first 
term is given to a study of the French drama, and the masterpieces 
of Corneille, Racine, and Moliere. The second term will be de- 
voted to selections from nineteenth century authors, with special 
reference to the spirit and tendencies of contemporaneous French 
literature. 
Tnstruction is given by daily careful explanation, rather than by 
formal lectures. The effort is to teach, not to lecture. In transla- 
tion from the original great care is exercised, not only that the in- 
terpretation shall be accurate, but also that the translation shall be 
in accord with approved standards of English style. Therefore, in 
teaching these languages the fact is never lost sight of that they may
-P-A-G-E-221
—-229— 
be made most powerful vehicles for imparting all the elements of 
correct style. In prose composition work the effort is not to pro- 
duce dexterity in transferring one’s native tongue into foreign 
speech, but to use this exercise as a medium fora clearer under- 
standing and a correcter translation of foreign language. 
History, literature, mythology, and customs, are matters brought 
daily to the attention of the classes and discussed with them. From 
time to time papers or discussions upon assigned subjects are 
presented by members of the classes, thus giving interest and va- 
riety to the exercises and stimulating the love of research. 
In all classes, Greek and French, the work is, practically, that 
outlined in the annual announcement of the University for 1894-95. 
Very respectfully,

Professor of Greek and French. 
III.—SCHOOL OF ENGLISH AND GERMAN, 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee: 
Dear Srtr—I have the honor to submit the following as the re- 
port of the departments of English and German: 
The total number of students enrolled for the academic year 
1893-94 was two hundred and twenty-eight in the English and 
forty-five in the German classes. The distribution was as follows: 
       
  English— 
Freshman class (in three sections)... « 123 
Sophomore class (in two section 72

—223— 
The Freshman class was perhaps the largest on record, and 
after the beginning of the Teachers’ course in January it was found 
advisable to make a third section. This third division of the class 
will be permanently maintained as a special teachers’ section, 
forming always after January 1. Mr. J. M. Black, A.B. 793, B.L. 
94, had the entire charge of the three sections, as my assistant, and 
the satisfaction given was such that he has been reappointed for a 
second year. 
I believe it wise to recommend that one additional hour per week 
be added to the Freshman course in English in future years. I 
wish to emphasize the importance of this class as constituting the 
foundations of the entire English course, and these foundations 
cannot be too thoroughly laid. . Particularly would this prove 
helpful to those students who are taking scientific courses where 
English is often dropped as a formal study at an early stage. Five 
hours per week are given to Freshman mathematics, and in the 
literary courses four hours to Freshman Latin and Greek, but only 
three to Freshman English. The necessity is all the greater be- 
cause, during the first half of the second (or Sophomore) year, 
English is cut down to two hours per week, and only in the latter 
part gets three. It will thus be seen that it is particularly the stu- 
dents in the scientific, engineering and agricultural courses who 
suffer just where possibly the constant drill and practice in the 
points involved is most needed. 
In this connection I could wish, too, that our preparatory schools 
might pay closer attention, not merely to the formal study of gram- 
mar and language, but to practical composition and to actual read- 
ing. If, at least, one composition every week could be demanded 
and corrected, and the reading of some good book every month be 
required in the higher grades of our schools, I feel the difficult 
problem of suitable expression in the mother tongue would soon be 
made much easier. Iam glad to see many of our best town and 
city schools emphasizing both these points and attaining the most 
favorable results. 
Since there have been several changes made, both in the outline 
and methods of the English course, I venture to give these in some 
detail.
-P-A-G-E-223
—224— 
A special examination for fitness, chiefly in the principles of En- 
glish composition, is demanded before entrance of all except the 
students certified to us by accredited schools; and then the object 
is to give a complete English course in the practical application of 
the rules of composition and rhetoric and in the study of literary 
topics, running through four full years. This element of time, 
there can be no doubt, has a great value. 
The first two (the Freshman and Sophomore) years are virtually 
compulsory in all courses, literary and scientific ; the last two (the ~ 
Junior and Senior) years are purely elective, though perhaps as many 
as three-fourths of the students in these classes have been taking 
English. Yet, through the several sifting processes, the number is 
naturally smaller and the character of the work becomes far more 
intensive and special. Side by side with the classes in rhetoric and 
literature, but entirely independent, the course in English philology 
extends through two years, alternating in the subjects treated. This 
is elective for Juniors and Seniors, or is classed as graduate. It is 
intended for those who prefer special linguistic training to literary 
work, or wish to supplement the one with the other. It has not 
been introduced before the present year, as an independent study. 
In the rhetoric and composition courses, facility in composition 
and adequacy of expression is the first consideration. This made as 
practicable as possible apart from the theoretical instruction. Themes 
and written reports are expected each week from the students. 
The theme is usually short and must contain something of the 
student’s own conception and composition. Its character may be 
assigned in order to illustrate some principle, or it may represent 
any event experience, reflection, thought, fancy, mood or inspiration 
whatever. As much originality and license in invention and hand- 
ling is allowed as is consistently possible. When returned, these 
themes are closely criticised in the presence of the class as to the 
subject itself, its treatment, the development of the idea, the choice 
of words, the sentence and paragraph structure, the style and man- 
ner of expression, and indeed any point that may serve to suggest, 
to stimulate and to improve. If a class should be too large to 
handle, as the Freshman and Sophomore invariably are, the necessary 
divisions are made. For the benefit of the constant practice and
-P-A-G-E-224
—-225— 
criticism the theme work is continued through three years, Fresh- 
man, Sopomore and Junior. Naturally the work grows in char- 
acter with the advance of the class. In the case of all written work, 
the University Magazine and the three “literary societies,” apart 
from local associations, suffice often to give practical value to many 
of the attempts. 
The weekly reports are based on individual library work illus- 
trative of class topics. Either the work is mapped out beforehand, 
as in the lower classes, and tasks assigned ; or, as in the upper, the 
written reports are of the nature of essays and discussions which in- 
vestigate further the matter of class study. The class-room work, 
therefore, in the upper classes, consists mainly of lectures which 
will guide and help the student in his material. Steadily increasing 
library facilities aid effectively. The library is regarded as the 
work-shop of the English classes. The seminary room contains the 
specially selected volumes referred to in class during the current 
week or two ; and while these books must be present at certain hours 
for general reference, any volume is allowed to go out over night 
for individual work. From the librarian’s record for the last two 
months (October and November, 1894) one thousand three hundred 
and fifty-one slips show that this number of volumes was taken out 
by the students from the seminary room alone. The large majority 
of these was naturally in the service of the English classes. A total 
of nineteen hundred and thirty-three volumes, all told, taken out 
by the students in attendance in all departments, is a fair showing 
for the general interests and the nature of the practical results. 
In the classes which deal with formal literature it has been found 
that the special study of distinct tepies for a given term is productive 
of the best results. The impression thus left is definite and clear- 
cut, the work seems more concise, and reflects in each part upon 
mutual relations and contrasts, and besides gives opportunity to 
pause at any point, discuss the qualities of an author, and feel the 
distinctive charm of any writing. In one of the earlier classes a 
point has been made of stressing the special study of letters and lit- 
erary life iu America. The serious study of the conditions and re- 
sults of American literary production, just because it contains the 
essence of our nationality, it is believed, brings the facts and possi- 
15
-P-A-G-E-225
—226— 
bilities of American life and individual work closer home to the 
youthful aspirant, whatever his interests and tastes may be. Sim- 
ilarly, the attention given to nineteenth century writers, both in 
prose and poetry, is based on the feeling that these belong more to 
our own day and era, approach more nearly the modern conscious- 
ness, and reproduce more exactly the existing tendencies and habits 
of thought. The prolonged study of Shakespeare by the maturest 
students is in recognition of the poet’s supreme power. 
With these premises as to the general nature of the methods em- 
ployed, the following list of topics, arranged by classes, and show- 
ing the total number of hours devoted to each, will best give an 
idea of the work as conducted the present year : 
FRESHMAN CLASS, 
1. Principles of English Grammar, and Practical Rhetoric (both 
terms, in all seventy-two hours). 
2. Outline History of the English Language, Etymology, and 
Orthoepy (first term, eighteen hours). 
3. Outline History of English Literature (second term, eighteen 
hours). 
SOPHOMORE CLASS. 
4, English Composition (first term, thirty-six hours). 
5. English Prose Style (second term, eighteen hours). 
6. American Literature (second term, thirty-six hours). 
JUNIOR CLASS. 
7. English Prose Writers of the Nineteenth Century (first term, 
thirty-six hours). 
8. English Prose Writers of the Seventeenth and Highteenth 
Centuries (to alternate with ‘ 7’). 
9. Rhetoric and Composition, advanced (first term, eighteen 
hours). 
10. English Literary Criticism (to alternate with ‘9’). 
11. Poetry and Versification (second term, eighteen hours). 
12. English Poets of the Nineteenth Century (second term, 
thirty-six hours). 
13. English Poets of the Renaissance and the Classic Age (to 
alternate with ‘12’).
-P-A-G-E-226
—227—- 
SENIOR CLASS. 
14. The Plays of Shakespeare (both terms, in all seventy-two 
hours). 
15. The English Drama (both terms, in all thirty-six hours). 
16. The English Novel (to alternate with ‘15’). 
OPTIONAL. 
17. Current Periodicals and Books (one every two weeks). 
ELECTIVE FOR JUNIORS, SENIORS, AND GRADUATES. 
18. History of English Sounds and Inflections (both terms, in 
all thirty-six hours). 
19. Old English (Anglo-Saxon) Prose (first term, thirty-six 
hours). 
20. Old English (Anglo-Saxon) Poetry (second term, thirty-six 
hours). 
21. Middle English Texts (to alternate with “19 ”). 
22. Chaucer (to alternate with “ 20”), 
GERMAN. 
In these classes the object is to give an acquaintance with both 
the spirit and the facts of the language and its literature. The 
practical aim set is ease in translation, whether for literary pur- 
poses or for practical needs in future scientific work. The course 
is as follows : 
FIRST YEAR. 
1. German Forms and Exercises (first term, thirty-six hours). 
2. German Readings for Beginners (first term, eighteen hours). 
3. German Readings in both Prose and Poetry (second term, 
fifty-four hours). 
SECOND YEAR. 
4, German Reading for Advanced Students (both terms, in all 
seventy-two hours). 
5. German Word Formation and Syntax (first term, eighteen 
hours). 
6. German Literature (second term, eighteen hours).
-P-A-G-E-227
—228— 
It has not thus far been necessary to form a more advanced sec- 
tion, since the third-year students can be classed with “4,” inas- 
much as all the texts read are changed each year. 
I respectfully call attention to the urgent need of relieving the 
Professor of English of the additional work in German, and, if 
possible, of placing this in the hands of a special instructor. 
Even with the help given by the assistant, the exercise and theme 
swork alone of the English classes involves at least ten to twelve 
~ thours extra work each week, entirely apart from the time needed 
to do justice to the preparation of the lectures on literature. It is 
the hope of the professor in charge to build up the English course 
as mapped out in every point to a degree worthy of our best insti- 
tutions; and this cannot be successfully achieved until the full 
time be left him for this work. 
Very respectfully submitted,

IV.—SCHOOL OF PHILOSOPHY AND HISTORY. 
To Dr. Charles W. Dabney, President University of Tennessee : 
Dear Str—As regards my work in the University for 1894, I 
have the honor to report as follows: 
While the early part of the fall term, as usual, presented some 
discouragements, the work, as a whole, has never been more in- 
spiring. Students seem deeply interested in their studies, and are 
making excellent progress. 
FrEsHMAN HIsToryY. 
Bo) 
The Freshman class}in general history has continued in Profes- 
sor Turner’s care, to whose report I beg leave to refer you for par- 
ticulars. The school is in great need of historical maps and stand- 
ard histories to assign for collateral reading. The work of this
-P-A-G-E-228
—229— 
class is of a most important nature, since the broad foundation is 
here laid for future and more special study. 
SopHomorEe History. 
The Sophomore class studies the History of English during the 
fall term. The work consists, first, in the general survey of a 
period, and then special topics are assigned for development through 
collateral reading in the seminary room, and written reports, or 
theme writing. Interest in studies of characters and events is thus 
procured. The reproduction of formal details and tabulated dates 
is discouraged. Students are taught to see in history a growth or 
development based upon the laws of cause and effect. They follow 
the progress of civilization and the life of the people, rather than 
details of the petty intrigues of rulers. Only leading dates are in- 
sisted upon. The order of succession and the relative significance 
of events, with the general chronology, is considered better than a 
minute acquisition of dates. The imagination is made use of in ac- 
quiring a true historical perspective, and it is sought to give every- 
thing its correct environment in mental reconstruction. The im- 
portance of English history to a correct understanding of American 
history is recognized, especially when the outgrowth of American 
institutions and civilization come to be considered. The necessity 
of a clear knowledge of English history as an escort for the history 
of English literature, when it comes to be studied, is also kept in 
view. 
Crviz GovERNMENT. 
The Sophomore class takes Civil Government during the second 
term. The object in this study is to give a clear origin of our gov- 
ernment considered from the historical standpoint. Fundamental 
features are traced by the student from his Anglo-Saxon ancestors 
on through the course of English and Colonial history. Our Con- 
stitution is shown to be a growth and an adaptation, and not an 
original creation. Practical views of government are also instilled. 
The problem of city government and other perplexing present day 
political questions are studied. All subjects are considered from 
the philosophical point of view, and without partisan bias. A brief 
study of the constitutional history of England is recommended as a
-P-A-G-E-229
—230— 
necessary part of this course. It is omitted only from want of time. 
Our great need here, as elsewhere, is standard books for collateral 
reading. 
PsycHoLoey. 
The Junior class takes Psychology during the fall term. The 
class at first finds the subject difficult, but develops much interest 
and proficiency after becoming acquainted with the technical and 
abstract character of the discourse. The work is carried on from 
the sides both of introspection and external observation. So far as 
practicable, the correspondence between physiological phenomena 
and mental phenomena is traced. The results of latest research are 
sought to be impressed. The metaphysical and speculative feature 
is avoided for the sake of more exact and more scientific knowl- 
edge. A limited amount of time has been devoted to experimental 
work. 
Having no laboratory apparatus, this was of the simplest char- 
acter, as, for example, the locating of temperature spots, the de- 
termining of simple problems of the dermal senses, ete. This 
practical sort of study developed a surprising degree of interest 
and shows what could be done with even a small supply of appa- 
ratus, the procuring of which I most urgently recommend. The 
application of the principles of psychology to education has not 
been neglected, though not pursued as a prominent phase of the 
subject. Another feature of the work has been a comparative 
study of the views of eminent psychologists on given topics. This 
study is carried on in the seminary, where we have a fair collection 
of the works of James, Ladd, and others. The results are pre- 
sented in the form of written reports, or a thesis giving, as an out- 
come of the study, the writer’s own views. In no year have F ob- 
tained more satisfactory work. A very favorable prospect for 
extending the work in this line now presents itself, for which I 
hope an opportunity may be afforded. 
Loaetc. 
This subject is taken by the Junior class during the second term. 
The classes are usually large. Practical methods of study are 
sought. The result aimed at is accurate and vigorous thought.
-P-A-G-E-230
—231— 
Eruics. 
Ethies is taken by the Senior class during the first term. The 
speculative and uncertain character of much of the material of this 
study is a source of perplexity to many students who do not pos- 
sess a philosophical cast of mind. Hence the necessity for clear 
and uninvolved statements. When possible, a practical turn is 
given to the study, especially in the necessity of building up true 
character through the establishment of correct habits in early life. 
Topics are assigned for outside study. The preference here again 
is for that which pertains to life’s duties, such as morals in public 
life, the ethics of business, moral training in public schools, ete. 
The importance of inculcating an altruistic spirit to stem the tide 
of egoism now flooding us is recognized. 
Economics. 
The subject of economics is studied by the Senior class during 
the spring term. More time is needed for this branch. The brief 
period allotted affords opportunity to consider oniy fundamental 
principles. Detailed investigation along the various lines of this 
rapidly growing science is impossible. Its vital importance to the 
successful issue of our complex civilization cannot be ignored, So 
far as possible, we study the most important current problems of 
the day, such as, the labor question, the socialistic tendency of the 
agé, the money question, ete. Standard books for collateral read- 
ing are much needed. 
PEDAGOGICS. 
This subject is taken as an elective in the Senior year. The 
number enrolled for the first term is nine. This class is intended 
only for those who expect to teach. The first term is devoted to . 
the philosophy of education and, so far as the time will admit, to 
the history of education, educational systems, theories, methods, and 
educational psychology. In the spring term, school supervision, 
grading, and the more practical features are taken up. This work 
is designed to prepare graduates of the University to take charge 
~ of city schools, normal schools, and other positions of the higher 
order. The necessity of a body of professional knowledge for suc- 
cess in school work is no longer an open question. Recognizing this
-P-A-G-E-231
—232— 
fact, most leading universities and colleges now sustain a chair of 
pedagogies, from which the science and art of teaching are taught. 
(For further report on Pedagogies, see Teachers’ Department.) 
SocroLoey. 
I here take the liberty of recommending that the subject of so- 
ciology be included in the School of Philosophy. ‘This, one of the 
most recent sciences, is now emerging from the formative state and 
is being placed upon the list of regular studies in most leading in- 
stitutions. The study of human society is an inviting field, and full 
of promise from both the practical and the culture standpoints. 
In closing, I desire to call attention to the recommendations for 
the purchase of additional books, maps, charts, etc. 
Respectfully submitted. 
[Signed] T. C. Karns, 
Professor of Philosophy and History. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee: 
Dear Srr:—As Lecturer on General History, I have under my 
charge the Freshman Class for three hours each week during the 
year. The subject is divided into two parts, the first term being oc- 
cupied with ancient, and the second term with medieval and mod- 
ern history, 
As the time at command is so short, and as such of the students 
as pursue Latin and Greek acquire a knowledge of Roman and 
Greek History in connection with the study of these languages, 
only an outline knowledge of ancient events, characters and dates, 
is expected. The first object is to incite an interest in the subject, 
and a desire to read and study it for oneself. The next object is to 
trace the growth of civilization, the development of institutions, and 
of manners and customs. A text-book is used, but is supplemented 
at each lesson with informal illustrations which are deemed likely
-P-A-G-E-232
—233— 
to impress upon the mind the relative importance of the forces dis- 
covered. Some of the students make special investigations and sub- 
mit the results in written form to the instructor. Such as choose 
to do this extra work receive due credit for it in their class grade. 
During the first part of the second term the instruction is more 
in the form of lectures, notes of which, written on the blackboard, 
are copied by the students, and form the subject of recitations. 
More individual work is expected during this term. A part of the 
notes which are to be copied comprise the names of all the best au- 
thorities on the subjects treated, including historical romances and 
dramas, so that each student may possess a good bibliography for 
future use. Engravings and photographs are made use of as far as 
possible, and a special attempt is made to make all so familiar with 
the leading styles of farchitecture as to be able to recognize them 
when seen. 
The library is fairly well supplied with the books needed for par- 
allel reading, and they are being used more and more. I should 
recommend the purchase of some good series of historical maps by 
which the students could be shown from time to time in the class 
room the various changestin the countries of Europe and Asia in- 
dicated by colors. Such maps are now much used in teaching the 
subject, and are not expensive. 
Many students come to us from secondary schools in which no 
history is studied, except that of our own country. Others are 
from schools which have already given them a fair knowledge of 
the principal events as detailed in some standard text-book. 
If by any means a division could be made by which those already 
somewhat familiar with the subject could be separated from those 
who know nothing of it, better results could be reached. This will 
be difficult to accomplish on account of conflicting claims of work 
in other branches of study, but if it can be brought about it will be 
of decided advantage to this department. 
Respectfully submitted.

V.—SCHOOL OF MATHEMATICS. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
DeEar Srr—The attendance upon the School of Mathematics for 
the session of 1894-95 is as follows: 
Freshman class, 94 (in three sections). 
Sophomore class, 55 (in two sections). 
Junior class, 13 (in two sections). 
One section of the Freshman class is taught by Mr. Claude 
Lowry, my assistant. All the others are taught by myself, giving 
me twenty-three hours a week, which is too much to allow the best 
work to be accomplished. Inasmuch as it is necessary for the en- 
gineering students to go more rapidly than the literary students, I 
am compelled to have different sections in the advanced classes, 
even though the number is small. Of the thirteen in the classes 
in calculus, eight have elected the subject. The teaching of mathe- 
matics has been much hampered by the fact that we try to cover so 
much ground in such a short space of time. Very little can be 
learned of trigonometry, for instance, in forty lessons of one hour 
each, and I think the course ought to be expanded, which might be 
done as follows: Algebra, fall term of Freshman year; geometry, 
only the plane portion, spring term of Freshman year; solid 
geometry, fall term of Sophomore year for about two months. 
The remaining seven months of the Sophomore year would be 
taken up in the study of trigonometry. Analytical geometry 
would then come in the Junior year and be entirely elective, as any 
science. Calculus would follow in the Senior year as an elective. 
In this way only those would go on with the subject who have 
shown any ability in that line, and the “awful horror” of analyti- 
eal geometry would be removed. I believe that this arrangement 
would enable me to do much better work. 
The discontinuance of the Sub-freshman class has reduced to 
some extent the number in attendance, but we are to be congratu- 
lated upon the change. The large number in the Freshman class 
is due partly to the return of many of those who completed the 
Sub-freshman work last year. This class has handed in written 
work on an average of once a week, and this has been beneficial to 
them.
-P-A-G-E-234
—235— 
To enter this class I examine only as far as the theory of ex- 
ponents, but a pupil who has gone only that far frequently finds it 
difficult to accomplish the required work because the limited time 
at my disposal requires more rapid work than many of them are 
accustomed to. To do the best work in this class the pupil ought 
to have had ten mouths in algebra before entering. I find ‘the 
greatest deficiency in the subjects of factoring and fractions, and I 
would like to suggest to our teachers to pay particular attention to 
these subjects. I generally require very accurate work, and do not 
accept a mere approximation to the result as being sufficiently cor- 
rect. Accuracy in mathematics is of the greatest importance. 
The Freshman class will begin the subject of geometry in the 
spring term. No knowledge of the subject is actually required for 
admission, but it will be a great help to the pupil if he has had 
some previous acquaintance with the subject. Both plane and solid 
geometry will be taught in the five months, and this will require 
an average of five propositions a day, including original work. 
This does not seem to be too much for each daily recitation, but in 
the aggregate it will require rather hard work without some pre- 
vious preparation. Ninety per cent. this year will have had this 
previous preparation, so I do not apprehend any trouble. I hope 
the time will soon come when the elements of geometry will be 
taught in all our preparatory schools.

VI._SCHOOL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
Dear Str :—In answer to your letter calling for a report, with 
considerable of detail, on the School of Civil Engineering, I sub- 
_ mit the following :
-P-A-G-E-235
—236— 
The school includes theoretical mechanics in addition to the sub- 
jects (pertaining more directly to civil engineering) ordinarily 
included in such a school. There are, therefore, six classes, as fol- 
lows: 
Junior Mechanics, Senior Mechanics, Freshman Civil Engineer- 
ing, Sophomore Civil Engineering, Junior Civil Engineering, and 
Senior Civil Engineering. 
Each of these classes demands definite mathematical qualifica- 
tions. Thus, to carry on any class in the school a student must 
take (or have taken) the corresponding class in the School of Math- 
ematics; that is, in the Freshman he must complete algebra and 
geometry; in the Sophomore class, trigonometry, analytical geom- 
etry, and an elementary course in calculus; in the Junior, calculus, 
determinants, and least squares. 
THEORETICAL MECHANICS. 
Junior Class.—The subjects taught may be classified as external 
mechanics and internal mechanics. The first treats of the effects 
which forces produce on a body as a whole, such as equilibrium, 
acceleration, velocity, path described, rotation, momentum, energy, 
ete. The second treats of the strains and stresses which forces 
produce in a body, the ability of the body to bear them, and the 
best distribution of the material of the body for resisting them. 
The discussions in the Junior year are limited to bodies of the 
simpler shapes, such as plates, rivets, pins, bolts, ties, posts, beams, 
shafts, etc. From the very nature of the case the method of treat- 
ment in this class is mainly analytical, but numerous graphical 
illustrations are used. All students in Civil, Electrical, or Mechan- 
ical engineering must take this class. 
Senior Class.—This class studies hydraulics, and continues the 
study by both analytical and graphical methods of internal mechan- 
ics, the bodies now considered being of more complex shapes, such 
as girders, trusses, arches, cables, masses of earth, etc. Civil 
enginecring students must take the whole course. Mechanical and 
electrical engineering students must take the hydraulics.

Crvit ENGINEERING (proper). 
Freshman Class——The theory and use of levels and angular in- 
struments are taught in this class. The construction, adjustments, 
manner of using, etc,, of each instrument is explained to the class. 
Each student is then required to use each instrument until he 
acquires reasonable facility in its use, and a definite idea of what 
degree of accuracy he can expect to attain with it. For example, 
the class is seeking, just now, to find, each member for himself, 
what error to expect in running a line of levels around a circuit 
two miles long; what distance to expect between the initial and 
terminal tacks when the effort is made to run a straight transit line 
a mile forward and back again ; what error to expect in measuring 
angles with the theodolite, transit, and sextant, ete. By way of 
office work, the class makes profiles and plats, and calculates areas 
from the last. You will observe that the aim of the work in this 
class is to cause the student to know, by personal experience, how 
to handle an engineering instrument, and that the little office work 
required is well within the mathematical knowledge of a Freshman 
class, All engineering students, whether Civil, Electrical, Mechan- 
ical, or Mining, must take this class. 
Sophomore Class.—This class continues to practice with the en- 
gineering instruments (including now the stadia, gradimeter, cli- 
nometer and planimeter) ; studies land surveying, calculates areas, 
makes profiles, plats, and contour maps, takes cross sections and 
puts in slope stakes. All engineering students must take this class. 
Junior Class.—This class makes a critical study of the construc- 
tion of engineering instruments. The idea is that an engineer 
should not only be able to correct any disarrangement of parts 
which the instruments may sustain, but that he should also be able 
to tell whether any piece of the instrument is of faulty design, or 
whether any one feature has been unduly developed at the expense 
of others; in short, that he should be a judge of an instrument. 
The class also goes through the usual field and office work pertain- 
ing to the surveys, estimates, location and construction of engineer- 
ing works. It makes a study of limes, mortars and cements; the 
properties of different brands of cements, and how their setting and 
hardening are influenced by different amounts and kinds of sand.
-P-A-G-E-237
238 
This study is, of course, made in the laboratory and at the testing 
machine. The study of foundations occupies the rest of the year. 
All civil engineering students must take this class. 
Senior Class.—This class takes some existing engineering struct- 
ure, say a bridge or a roof truss, measures it, calculates the strength 
of each of its parts, and also the stress that may be thrown on such 
parts, and by comparison of these finds what degree of stability the 
structure has, and points out any faults that may exist in its de- 
sign. The class also designs, works out details, prepares working 
drawings, and makes estimate of cost for some assigned structure, 
studies sewerage, water supply, specifications and contracts. It also 
spends a good deal of time in the laboratory and at the testing ma- 
chine. Civil engineering students must take this class. 
EQuiIpMENT. 
In the matter of quarters the School of Civil Engineering is hand- 
somely provided for, as it has eight large rooms and several small 
ones. Among these are the lecture room, laboratory, draughting 
room, blue print room, museum, office, ete. The draughting room 
is well equipped with drawing stands and drawing boards, and it 
contains forty-two lockers. There are two large blue print frames 
and a tank in which to wash the prints. The engineering instru- 
ment room contains eighteen lockers, in which are three transits, 
seven levels, one theodolite, one compass, two sextants, and the 
usual smaller instruments, such as chains, tapes, headlevels, clinom- 
eters, planimeters, etc. Each of the larger instruments, covered 
with a canvas bag to protect it from dust, stands on its tripod in 
its own locker, so as to be always ready for use. Everything (such 
as eye-glass, adjusting pins, screw-driver, hatchet, tacks, ete.) needed 
while using that instrument, is kept in its locker. This last is pro- 
vided with an accurate list of every article it contains, and is fas- 
tened with a Yale lock. When a student wishes to use an instru- 
ment, the key is charged up to him. He is not credited with the 
key until every article called for by the list in the locker is in place 
or paid for. And he pays rent for the instrument if he keeps the 
key unduly long. 
The equipment of the laboratory is too scanty. It consists of a 
lot of tools, such as planes, saws, drills, bits, braces, etc., scales, bal-
-P-A-G-E-238
—239— 
ances, several large water-tanks, and a testing machine of 20,000 
pounds capacity, with a fair supply of utensils pertaining thereto. 
We need a machine of ten or fifteen times the capacity of this, a 
two-horse power steam engine, or other motor, and a complete outfit 
for the hydraulic part of the laboratory, besides other appliances 
too numerous to mention.

VII.—_SCHOOL OF PHYSICS AND ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee: 
Dear Sir—I have the honor to submit the following report of 
the work in Physics and Electrical Engineering during the year 
1893-94: 
The whole number of students in my classes were as follows: 
  
    Physics— 
Freshmen. oo00 189 
Juniors 12 
Seniors... 6 
Thermodynamics 4 
  The work of the Freshman year is required in all courses, and is 
intended not only to give them some knowledge of the fundamental 
laws of nature, but also to furnish a training in exact ideas and ex- 
act reasoning, such as is furnished by hardly any other science. 
While, therefore, it was not possible to require all the students to 
perform experiments in the laboratory, this lack was supplied, as far 
as pussible, by abundant lecture experiments. In many of these, 
actual measurements were made before the class and the results com- 
puted. The students were also required to solve numerical prob- 
lems, and at all times to keep the question “how much” in plain
-P-A-G-E-239
—240— 
sight. While the work was, therefore, somewhat severe, I believe 
that for those who mastered the subject the results amply repaid the 
labor. The work of the Junior year, required in all the engineer- 
ing courses, was also elected by a number of literary students, and 
consisted of a study of electricity and heat. All members of the 
class were required to make experiments for themselves each week 
in the laboratory, covering the more important measurements in the 
subjects studied. 
The Senior course is especially adapted to the requirements of 
students in electrical engineering. Some of the special problems 
taken up in the laboratory during the year were: 
Calibration of standard apparatus for measuring electric currents. 
Study of the characteristic curve of shunt wound dynamo when 
overloaded. 
Determination of candle power of incandescent lamps at different 
voltages, including a comparison of the Argand gas burner with 
Methven screen, with a Hefner standard lamp. 
Study of Hysteresis and permeability of samples of iron and steel, 
using a modified Hopkinson permeameter and also a simple mag- 
netizing spiral with ballistic galvanometer. 
The laboratory equipment was materially improved during the 
year. The next additions will be for work in alternating currents, 
and a number of duplicates are in process of construction so that 
work can be carried on without loss of time or interference with ex- 
periments of other students. 
The work of graduate students will at present consist of the study 
of alternate currents, with parallel work in the laboratory building, 
and testing transformers and making tests of generators and motors.

VIII.—SCHOOL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING AND 
DRAWING. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee: 
Dear Sir :—I have the honor to submit the following report of 
the Department of Drawing: 
Instruction in freeband drawing is given throughout the year to 
the Freshman Class. During the first term the engineering and ag- 
ricultural students receive this instruction; during the second the 
literary and scientific students. The drawing rooms are fitted with 
sereens for controlling the light, adjustable drawing desks, and cases 
for models and drawing. To a very complete stock of wood models 
has recently been added a large number of pieces in plaster, cover- 
ing leaf and plant forms, scrolls, feet and hands, and a few faces, 
The course is limited to purely industrial drawing. The object al- 
ways in view is to train the eye to detect and the hand to correct 
errors. The course for engineering students includes pen drawing, 
so far as it will aid in lettering and giving a neat finish to mechan- 
ical drawings. To those who have time and inclination for more 
than one term of freehand drawing, an opportunity is given for 
a second term in ink or charcoal. 
Mechanical drawing begins with the second term of the Fresh- 
man year and continues throughout the course, with the exception 
of one term. The work is carried on in a room designed and fitted 
expressly for the purpose. Among recent improvements may be 
mentioned lockers for instruments and a case for finished drawings, 
both built by the students. Believing that neat, accurate drawings 
can only be made with good tools, the students, upon entering the 
work, ure urged to buy a limited outfit of first-class drawing instru- 
ments. The use and care of instruments, geometrical constructions, 
mechanical drawing, lettering, simple projections and blue-printing 
are taught during the first term. 
Descriptive geometry comes in the second term of the Sophomore 
year. The subject is given a theoretical study in the class-room, 
and at the same time practical problems are given for solution in 
the draughting room. 
16
-P-A-G-E-241
—242— 
The Junior class is given a progressive course in elementary ma- 
chine design, beginning with fastenings and ending with special 
types of gearing, and the solution of gearing problems. The course 
includes all machine parts, and so far as is possible, each plate is 
the solution of a problem. 
The Senior class takes up the designing of complete machines. 
During the present session the work is the design of a sixty-horse 
power compound engine of modern type, together with a boiler of 
the same capacity. Details are drawn of boiler setting, staying and 
riveting of boiler, and all parts of the engine. No text-book is fol- 
jowed, but students have access to a number of standard works on 
the subject, and are taught to refer to them for data to determine 
proportions of parts. 
Reviewing the past two years’ work, I am pleased to note a 
steady gain both in the quantity and quality of work done in my 
department. 
Following I give the number of students enrolled in all classes 
duriug the session of 1893-4: 
Freshman, freehand drawing... 
Freshman, mechanical drawing. 
Sophomore, descriptive geometry 
Junior, machine design 
Senior, machine design..

IX.—SCHOOL OF MECHANIC ARTS. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee: 
Dear Srr—I have the honor to submit the following report of 
the School of Mechanic Arts : 
The time given to mechanic arts in the technical schools of our 
country ranges from five hundred hours to fifteen hundred hours
-P-A-G-E-242
—243— 
total for the mechanical and electrical engineering courses. The 
time given to this work in this University for the same courses is 
about an average of the time in ten or twelve of the most promi- 
nent schools above referred to. This full course of mechanic arts 
is distributed over the four years of the student’s collegiate course, 
and consists of one year of six hours a week in wood-working, one 
term of the same time per week in forging and three terms of six 
hours a week and one term of twelve hours a week in machine- 
shop practice. Mechanical and electrical engineering students take 
the entire course of instruction, while the agricultural and civil en- 
gineering students take all up to the machine-shop work, and they 
have the privilege of electing this also if their time will permit. 
Woop-WoRKING. 
The equipment of the wood-working department is excellent. 
The large, well-lighted bench-room occupies the entire south end 
of the second floor of the mechanical building; and here, arranged 
for light and convenience, are twenty-six strong work-benches, 
each supplied with a bench-stop, Massey vise, lock drawers for stu- 
dents’ clothes and work, and a set of twenty first-cless tools ar- 
ranged in a neat lock case so constructed that when open every 
tool is within easy reach of the workman, and can be used without 
disturbing the rest. Each student also has free use of a large 
case of general tools in this same room, and numerous special tools 
in a well-supplied tool-room. The lathe-room is supplied with 
eight or ten wood lathes, and others are available in case of de- 
mand. The wood-working machinery department is furnished 
with a great variety of first-class machines for cutting, dressing and 
shaping lumber. 
The course of instruction will take the average student, and by 
giving him a series of exercises with each important hand tool, then 
a list of mortices, dovetails, splices and other joints found in ordi- 
nary practice, so fit him that he will be able to spend the last few 
weeks of his first term at a course of cabinet work, which will in- 
clude all progesses, from the crude material to the finished, var- 
nished and polished piece. Parallel with this term’s work he has 
text-book work on the growth, structure, enemies and preservation 
of woods. The student is exceedingly anxious to get into his sec-
-P-A-G-E-243
—-244— 
ond term’s work. Lathe practice is especially fascinating to him, 
and the course of exercises, from plain bead and cylinder work to 
fancy cups and napkin rings, holds his interest uninterrupted. He 
devotes the remainder of the term to pattern-making and more ad- 
vanced cabinet work, which serve to combine and advance the skill 
he has acquired at the bench and the lathe. 
Meran WorKING. 
The departments for iron working are supplied with a very high 
grade of appliances and tools. The forge shop is equipped with 
Buffalo forges, each furnished with a blast and forced draught, with 
an anvil and complete set of hand tools; the machine shop has in 
its equipment a planer, shaper, universal grinder, universal milling 
machine, two drill presses, three lathes and numerous sets of taps, 
dies, drills, reamers and other small tools. Heavy benches and 
vises are conveniently placed. Small tools and supplies are kept 
in the tool-room and are dealt out on the check system by a tool- 
room boy. 
It is not uncommon for the visitor through the shops, when com- 
ing to the forge shop, to express surprise that this work, which soils 
and begrimes, should follow the cleaner work of woodworking. He 
asks why it does not precede it, rather. He has only to watch the 
interested student at work, to see that he is engaged in work re- 
quiring more skill and especially more judgment than any of his 
preceding work. Starting with the management of his fire the 
student progresses from simple forgings and welds to those recog- 
nizing great skill and judgment in the requisite shapes and heats. 
Special attention is given to steel working, tool dressing and tem- 
pering. When the student reaches the machine shop the skill he has 
acquired in accuracy and finish from his previous work is usually 
sufficient to qualify him to enter at once upon actual constructive 
work after a complete exercise with each machine. His course here 
includes a great variety of work, from the making of small tools to 
the building of dynamos and machine tools. 
Some TuHines Mapp. 
All the courses are designed to be as practicable as possible, and 
it goes without proving that a student takes more interest in making
-P-A-G-E-244
—245— 
an-article he knows is to be actually used, and he gets more actual 
experience from such work. A few articles which have been made 
as class exercises might be named. Several polished cabinet cases 
for engineering instruments have just beencompleted. A large and 
handsome case for the drawing department is the result of the com- 
bined efforts of several students. Numerous patterns, which have 
been used in making castings for the machine shop, were creditably 
made by students. Nearly all the forge shop tools, planer aud 
shaper tools, and many other small tools in the department tell of 
forge shop work. Various small tools, several machine tools, en- 
gines and dynamos give expression to the careful and successful 
training in machine shop practice. 
OxsJEcT. 
The courses in mechanic arts are not intended to make artisans of 
the students. It is true that the average young man on completing 
any course could make a success of that line of work for gaining a 
livelihood by taking a little additional training in actual shops. 
But the object of the work is to give the student more self-mastery ; 
to inculcate into him a taste for labor and a respect for its dignity ; 
to train his hand and mind to act correctly and together; to teach 
him to observe and apply; to make him more able to design, esti- 
mate and superintend, and with this in view the things he makes 
are only means to an end. The rounded-out trained student is the 
only article sought to be put upon the market. 
Respectfully submitted.

X.—SCHOOL OF GENERAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY 
AND METALLURGY. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
DEAR Str—In the Science Hall are located the new and elegant 
~ chemical laboratories.
-P-A-G-E-245
—246— 
The assay laboratory is on the first floor and is equipped with a 
Blake ore-crusher, a heavy pulverizing plate, a new gold and silver 
smelting furnace (as used in the United States Mint), a gold and 
silver cupelling and refining furnace, and many other interesting 
appliances. 
The chemical lecture-room is next to the assay laboratory. It 
has supply and store-room connected. The inclined floor, set with 
handsome tablet-arm chairs, is an attractive feature. The lecture 
table is equipped with a pneumatic trough, two lead-lined sinks, 
down drafts for removing noxious gases, electric wires and switches 
controlling the electric lights and lantern, and an experimental cur- 
rent which comes direct to the lecture table from the dynamo. 
Slate blackboards and hoods are also provided. 
The qualitative and quantitative chemical laboratories are located 
on the second or main floor. They are supplied with an abundance 
of light from large windows, and are ventilated by ten stacks ninety 
feet in height. The system for distributing the water and gas to 
each student’s work-table is worthy of careful examination, while 
the method used to carry off dangerous fumes is ingenious and pecu- 
liar to these laboratories. 
These two laboratories are handsomely finished, and are spacious, 
accommodating thirty-six and sixteen men, respectively, at any 
time. 
The professor’s private laboratory, adjacent to these two large 
laboratories, is one of the most beautifully arranged anywhere to 
be found. It is the center of the chemical apartments, nearly all 
of which open into it. 
Iu addition to the above, there is a large store-room, photo- 
graphic room, balance-room and private library. 
In chemistry, metallurgy, and asssying, much work has been 
planned, and it is hoped that, with the increased facilities, much 
will be accomplished. 
The completion of the new laboratories seems to have given a 
great impetus to the work in chemistry, and witl the increased
-P-A-G-E-246
—247—- 
facilities and opportunities offered for better and more advanced 
work, the outlook for this department is very encouraging. 
Chemistry is commenced with the Sophomore class. Lectures 
are given, supplemented by text-book work, lasting one term. 
-During the second term the work of this class is in the laboratory. 
Here the student is taught laboratory practice and chemical ma- 
nipulation, and then qualitative analysis. Last year the capacity 
of the large qualitative laboratory was overtaxed, and this year it 
promises to be more crowded. ; 
Much good work has been done by the Seniors and Post-gradu- 
ates in quantitative analysis and assaying, the latter course having 
been recently introduced upon the completion of the new assay 
laboratory. 
During the present term the distribution of students in the chem- 
ical school is as follows: 
Sophomore general chemistry 
Junior analytical chemistry.. 
Senior analytical chemistry. 
Chemical technology and metallurgy.

XI.—SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURE AND HORTICULTURE, 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
Dear Srr:—During the second term-.of the session 1893-94, 
fifty-seven students of the Freshman Class were instructed in this 
school. Of this number thirty-six are classed as pursuing the agri- 
cultural and scientific course, and twenty-one the literary-scientific.
-P-A-G-E-247
—248— 
During the same term thirteen of the Sophomore Class were in- 
structed in this school. Of these eight were teachers. Two stu- 
dents of the Junior Class also attended regularly the lectures and 
performed the class work required in the agricultural course. 
In addition to the above, instruction was given to forty-nine 
teachers who attended the summer school at the University during 
the month of July, 1894. 
The agricultural course of the University of Tennessee has been 
very carefully and, we think, wisely, arranged so that any person 
who shall acquit himself fully in all that is demanded for gradua- 
tion in this school, will be thoroughly prepared to enter upon the 
duties and responsibilities of life, as far as such preparation can be 
made in au institution of learning. 
Every young man who remains but for a single year is given 
just such instruction and in just such way as will be of greatest value 
to him if he goes back to the farm permanently ; and the same 
thing is equally true if he remains here for two years, or for three 
years or more. No attempt has been made to force upon any stu- 
dent a course of teaching intended only to cram him with facts, the 
principles of which cannot be made clear by accurate and thorough 
instruction. 
Practical methods, the use of tools, the handling of stock, all that © 
concerns the mere “how” to do things, are best learned on the 
farm itself. Our design here is to accompany the teaching of facts 
by the teaching of the principles underlying them, so that when the 
real responsibilities of life come, there may be greater skill com- 
manding the greater success, when every act shall be directed by a 
knowledge of why this or the other thing shall be done. 
A close study of the conditions which exist here, as in many other 
institutions, has convinced the writer that there must be in the 
School of Agriculture and Horticulture, as in the Schools of Civil 
and Mechanical Engineering, full opportunity for that sort of direct 
application of lecture and class-room work which alone will main- 
tain the interest of the student. If the farmer’s son who enters 
_the University developes tastes and aptitudes which induce him to 
prepare for some other life vocation, he should not only be allowed
-P-A-G-E-248
—249— 
to pursue a more congenial course of study, but should in every way 
be encouraged. If he comes with the hope to prepare himself for 
the successful pursuit of agriculture, he should not be, for one mo- 
ment, discouraged by the absence of opportunities and facilities for 
thorough instruction. 
It is now well understood that knowledge—the wider and the 
more accurate the better—of the scientific principles upon which 
must be conducted every operation of modern agriculture, is pre- 
requisite to the success of the farmer in whatever line he may work. 
The competition which he must encounter is, nowadays, more of 
brain than of brawn. Physical strength, and industry to labor 
from dawn to dawn every day in the year will avail little if such 
strength and industry are not supplemented by that kind of skill 
which makes the ready hand the servant of the ready brain. 
At their meeting in July, 1894, the Board of Trustees took such ac- 
tionas will doubtless go very far to solve many of the difficulties with 
which the school of agriculture haslong contended. Upon the college 
farm there has been erected a commodious, well appointed building 
in which can be accommodated twenty or more young men who de- 
sire to take the agricultural course. In this building is provided 
every convenience that can be reasonably expected: Pure water in 
abundance; a very satisfactory steam heater, warming the building 
in winter at the lowest cost to each student occupant; a well ap- 
pointed kitchen, supplied with an efficient cooking range; a con- 
venient and properly fitted pautry, with dining-room on the same 
floor, will enable the young men to live as nicely and in as much 
comfort asin their own homes. A well lighted reading-room, which 
will be supplied with the current literature of the day, mainly agri-- 
cultural and scientific, as well as standard books of reference, is 
conveniently located. The sleeping-rooms are large, well lighted 
and ventilated. Eyery precaution has been taken to secure health- 
ful and cleanly surroundings. 
In the specially constructed tower will be placed a full onfit of 
meteorological instruments, a very desirable addition to the equip- 
ment of the Experiment Station, and furnishing another and most 
valuable means of instruction in this important branch of agricul- 
tural science.
-P-A-G-E-249
ORO 
Students in this course will have daily and hourly opportunity to _ 
study the various operations upon the Experiment Station farm, 
which serve to illustrate and verify the teaching in the lecture-room. 
Those who desire to perform a certain amount of labor at a fair 
remuneration, and thus help to pay expenses while at the school, 
will be given opportunity to do so. 
As Professor of Agriculture, earnestly endeavoring to make the 
school of greatest value to the people of the State, I felt confident 
that this new departure in the management of the school must bring 
greater success than has marked its history in the past. Whether 
or not it may be well to provide in some way for such “ short 
courses,” special or general, as are now under trial in the various 
agricultural and mechanical colleges of this country, is a matter 
now under serious consideration. This will depend, very much, 
upon the measure of success which shall come to us within the next 
year or two. 
I hand you herewith the report of the instructor in horticulture, 
to which I refer you for an account of work done in his part of the 
school, 
Very respectfully, 
[Signed.] CHARLES F, VANDERFORD, 
Professor of Agriculture and Horticulture. 
“Maj. Chas. F. Vanderford, Professor of Agriculture and Horti- 
culture: 
Dear Sir:—I respectfully submit the following report as In- 
structor in Horticulture : 
The students studying horticulture are members of the Junior and 
Senior classes of the agricultural course. They are enthusiastic and 
faithful workers, and are progressing excellently. The work of the 
entire year will include a study of fruit culture, vegetable garden- 
ing, aud floricnlture. If possible, some attention will be given 
during the second term to forestry.
-P-A-G-E-250
—251— 
The time allowed for horticulture has been exclusively devoted, 
so far, to the study of fruit culture. Barry’s “ Fruit Garden ” has 
been used as a text-book. The students have also pursued, under 
our direction, special lines of reading in suitable books devoted to 
the cultivation of fruits. The work of the term has included a 
study of the morphology of fruit trees and their roots, stems, 
branches, buds, leaves, flowers, and fruits; soils, and methods of im- 
provement; manures, and their application; propagation by seeds, 
cuttings, layering, budding, grafting ; pruning of various fruit trees 
in their different stages of growth ; general care of the vineyard, 
fruit garden, and orchard ; varieties, harvesting, packing, market- 
ing, ete. Practical illustrations in the garden and orchard have 
been made whenever possible. 
The treatment of fungous diseases has been given special atten- 
tion. 
Respectfully,

XII,.—SCHOOL OF BOTANY. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
Dear S1r:—This school is supplied with a good working outfit, 
including a complete set of simple and compound microscopes and 
accessories, with complete supply of reageants, mounting and stain- 
ing media, etc. The botanical laboratory is furnished with tables, 
gas and water fixtures, and is convenient to a very large and care- 
fully arranged herbarium. Each student is given charge of a sim- 
ple and a compound microscope, with a set of reagents and other 
necessary apparatus. 
Much attention has been given to enlarging and improving the 
herbarium. The original collection purchased from Dr. Gattinger 
several years ago, numbering about twelve thousand specimens, has 
been nearly doubled. Accessories are constantly being made from 
all parts of the country. Many specimens of economic fungi have
-P-A-G-E-251
—252— 
been received, and special attention will in the future be given to 
this part of our collection. The students are beginning to take an 
active interest in this work, some of them having made valuable 
contributions to these collections, and others haying done excellent 
work in assisting to arrange them. 
A good working botanical laboratory is also accessible to stu- 
dents. The most important botanical journals of this country and 
Europe are being received. 
The regular course begins in the second term of the Sophomore 
year, and is devoted to vegetable morphology and systematic bot- 
any. The flowering plants of this section are studied and classi- 
fied. Frequent excursions are made into the surrounding country, 
and the material thus secured is prepared for the herbarium by the 
individual student. 
The Junior year is devoted to the study of vegetable histology 
and physiology. The student here learns the use of the compound 
microscope and makes, preparations for microscopic study. The 
work is done, for the most part, in the laboratory, supplemented by 
informal lectures and occasional written reviews. 
There are excellent facilities for special investigation in system- 
atic botany, vegetable pathology, grasses or vegetable histology, 
and advanced students are encouraged, advised and assisied in this 
work. . At the same time the student is taught to rely upon his own 
resources and to cultivate a true spirit of scientific research. 
The economic side of botany is especially emphasized. This is 
required of all students in the Agricultural course. A knowledge 
of the relation of parasitic fungi to cultivated crops, and of the 
rationale of plant existence is of incalculable benefit to the farmer. 
Students preparing themselves for the study of medicine have the 
proper direction given to their studies. A knowledge of the min- 
ute structure of different woods and of the fungi causing decay of 
timber is beneficial to students of engineering.

XIII—SCHOOL OF ZOOLOGY. 
Dr. Chas. W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
Dear Srr—Since the report made in December, 1892, the course 
of study for this school has been somewhat altered. It now offers 
the following courses (1) Physiology; (2) Elementary Zoology ; 
(8) Systematic Zoology ; (4) Entymology; (5) Histology. 
The course in physiology is designed to give the student such a 
knowledge of his own body and the laws of health relating to it, 
that he may be able to care for it properly, and to cope intelligently 
with the causes of diseases. As an aid to the instruction, the school 
possesses, among other things, a life-sized manikin, with detachable 
parts, and a small collection of anatomical models and four large 
charts, illustrating the different organs and systems of the human 
body. 
The course in elementary zoology, with only three hours a week 
for the second term, is necessarily a very short one, but by the aid 
of a text-bovk, lectures, and a few dissections of typical animals, 
the student can obtain a good knowledge of the classification and 
structure of the great groups of animals. There is a good collec- 
tion of alcoholic specimens, which is used for illustrating, in class, 
the different branches of the animal kingdom. 
Systematic zoology is elective in all courses for studeuis who have 
had physiology and elementary zoology. This work extends 
through the first and second terms, with three hours a week. Aside 
from systematic work, this course embraces comparative anatomy 
any physiology, which is given in form of lectures. 
The course in entomology is designed for economic as well as 
systematic work. The economic side is offered to the agricultural 
students, in which they are instructed in the elements of the science, 
and made acquainted with some of the noxious insects and the 
means employed in combatting them. 
Histology is offered to those students who intend studying med- 
icine. The course is a short one, extending only through one term 
with two hours a week, but a knowledge of histological methods, 
and as much of the subject-matter of histology is given as the time 
devoted to it will permit.
-P-A-G-E-253
—254— 
For the above courses the laboratory is supplied with compound 
microscopes and the accessories for histological work. It also pos- 
sesses dissecting instruments and apparatus for collecting and pre- 
serving insects. 
A large collection of named fishes, and a much larger collection 
of insects, which is the property of the Agricultural Experiment 
Station, are available for the use of the students. 
During the session of 1893-94 there was an enrollment of twen- 
ty-two, distributed as follows: 
    Physiology ........ 2 
Systematic zoology. 3 
Elementary zoology 7

XIV.—SCHOOL OF MILITARY SCIENCE AND TACTICS, 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
Dear Sir:—I have the honor to make the following report on 
the Military Department of this University : 
Criasses IN Minirary DEPARTMENT. 
Under the present rules of the University only two classes, the 
Sophomore and Freshman, are required to take military instruc- 
tion. All other students at the University are encouraged to vol- 
unteer, and their recitation hours are so arranged that all, or nearly 
all, can take military instruction, without interfering with their 
other studies, if they choose to do so. 
This instruction is given for one hour only on every day, except 
Saturdays and Sundays. Of this time one hour is given each week 
to theoretical instruction and the other four hours to practical in- 
struction drill.
-P-A-G-E-254
—355—-— 
ORGANIZATION AND Drinu. 
At the beginning of the school year the cadets under military 
instruction are furmed into companies and these companies into a 
battalion, and a thorough and systematic course of instruction is 
then inaugurated. Every cadet is first put into squad drill and 
thoroughly set up and taught to carry himself in a military man- 
ner. He is then advanced from the preliminary drills and put into 
a company, and, after he becomes proficient in the company drills, 
he is instructed in the battalion drill and the ceremonies of bat- 
talion inspection, dress parade, and review. 
THEORETICAL INSTRUCTION. 
As stated above, this is for one hour each week, but, in addition 
to that, during the inclement weather from December 15th to Feb- 
ruary 1st, when the cadets cannot drill outside, there is theoretical 
instruction given for five hours each week. This instruction is by 
recitation and lecture, and includes the United States Infantry 
Drill Regulations to include the battalion drill and the ceremonies, 
and such portions of the United States Artillery Drill Regulations 
as to include the movements for foot batteries. Besides this, there 
are frequent lectures, etc., on the army regulations and customs of 
the service. Instruction in signalling with the heliograph is also 
given. By this signals are sent by means of flashes of sunlight, 
the same code being used as is used in telegraphing. So that when 
a cadet has had two years of military instruction, especially if he 
has been a cadet officer and taken advantage of his opportunities, 
he is fairly equipped to command a battalion and very well equipped 
to command a company. 
Unirorm. 
The uniform worn here is of the cadet gray and is made very 
much like the fatigue uniform worn at West Point, except that it 
is much prettier and more dressy. One uniform costing $20 is 
amply sufficient for a cadet during one whole year and sometimes 
longer. The materials of which it is made are of the best, and it 
is, in fact, the neatest and, at the same time, the most inexpensive 
clothing that a cadet can wear. The uniform for cadet commis- 
sioned officers is a little more elaborate and is almost exactly like 
that worn by the staff departments of the United States army.
-P-A-G-E-255
—256— 
EQuIPMENT. 
Everything in the way of arms and accoutrements is furnished 
the cadet free of charge. 
The drill ground has recently been enlarged and_ beautifully 
graded, so that everything may appear to the best possible ad- 
vantage. 
Brnerirs of Minirary Instruction. 
There is no department. at this University that develops the boy 
more than the military department. In the first place, from a 
physical standpoint, nothing can be better for a boy, than to have 
an hour of healthful exercise every morning before he begins the 
occupation of study. It fits him for work by giving him that exer- 
cise which the body so much needs when one is engaged in a seden- 
tary occupation. Students of the military department little appre- 
ciate the advantage of being able to go every morning to their 
studies with heads more clear and bodies strengthened by the in- 
vigorating exercise which the hour of drill gives them. Military 
training teaches the cadet, in the second place, respect for superiors, 
control of his body, mind and feelings. It constantly enforces on his 
mind the necessity for order, promptness, nearness and precision. 
These great rudiments of success in life are no where so quickly 
and so thoroughly learned as by a course of military instruction. 
In the third place, a boy or man must know something more than 
books in order to be a success in life ; and while he is being trained 
theoretically in other branches of knowledge, nothing can be better 
for him than to learn something of the command and control of men, 
In the military department every boy has an opportunity to be madea 
corporal or a sergeant or a lieutenant or a captain; and even in the 
lowest of these grades he has command of at least eight men, and 
in the highest he commands a whole company. 
The great benefiis of a short time used in learning to command 
men is very apparent here in the increased confidence and force 
given to a young man after he has been an officer. It awakens in 
him a capacity that might otherwise have jain dormant for a long 
time and puts him much earlier on the road to power and success. 
Every young man who fits himself here to command a company of
-P-A-G-E-256
men must, in case of any future war, or trouble in his own State, or 
in the United States, stand in a much better position than one who 
has never had any military experience or training. He will nat- 
urally iall into a position of command and influence, should the 
country need him. 
When a young man can obtain good military instruction along 
with other instruction, he should never lose the opportunity to do 
so. This institution offers such an opportunity. The military in- 
struction here not only does not interfere with the students, but is 
a positive help to them for the reason stated above. An institution 
organized as this one possesses great advantages over one not having 
a military department, and parents would do well to give this mat- 
ter careful consideration in selecting a school at which to place their 
sons. 
Very respectfully,

REPORT OF THE TEACHERS’ DEPARTMENT. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
Dear Sir—With regard to the Teachers’ Department of the 
University for 1894, I have the honor to report as follows: 
Recognizing the urgent demand for better educated and better 
trained teachers in the primary and secondary schools of the State, 
a shorter course for teachers of these grades was a few years ago 
established. Its academic studies correspond very closely to those 
of the Freshman and Sophomore years of the regular literary col- 
lege course. This enables any who complete the teachers’ course 
to continue, if they so desire, in the regular college course. The 
work occupies two years, but may be finished in ten months by 
those who come properly prepared. So far as practicable, the 
studies are arranged so as to be taken in the spring term by those 
who teach in the fall. Instruction in the theory and art of teach- 
ing is given during the last half of each of the two years. This 
consists of principles of teaching, courses of study, grading, organ- 
ization, discipline, moral training, school visitation, school law, ete. 
Reapine- Room AnD Musrvum. 
The quarters of the teachers’ department were greatly improved 
during the last vacation. A beautiful new lecture-room has been 
prepared. Adjoining it are a reading-room for teachers and an 
educational museum. These are handsomely fitted up, and the 
work of furnishing has begun. We desire to supply the reading- 
room with a most choice selection of educational periodicals and a 
pedagogical library. Some material is already in. We have a full 
set of reports from the Bureau of Education at Washington, be- 
sides circulars of information and histories of education in the 
various States. A most excellent collection of maps has been fur- 
nished by the general government, and a limited supply of other 
books and apparatus is already on hand. It is my purpose to make
-P-A-G-E-258
—259— 
an extensive collection of apparatus just as fast as means and op- 
portunity will. admit; also an exhibit of school work done in the 
various schools of this and other States. This will consist of pri- 
mary work, specimens of penmanship, number work, free-hand 
drawing, map-drawing, pretty maps, work in clay, examination pa- 
pers and all other kinds of school work which can be used as illus- 
tration in pedagogical training. All kinds of catalogues and 
courses of study are also being collected as material for practical 
study on the part of pupil teachers. Blank forms used in city and 
district schools, with specimens of report cards, class books, record 
books, etc., are to be included, as well as specimens of text-books 
for primary grades, intermediate grades and secondary grades. 
Model libraries for primary work, for example, or for teaching 
geography, etc., will be collected. I desire, likewise, to show, by 
collected copies, chronologically arranged, the historical development 
and improvement of text-books. By these and other collections 
teachers will be enabled to make a concrete and practical study of 
the work in which they are to engage. I have also begun a collec- 
tion of photographs of school buildings, model school-rooms, por- 
traits of noted educators, groups of teachers and children in city 
schools and in country schools, faculties of colleges, ete. The 
value of such collections is plainly evident. The educational mu- 
seum is as necessary to the professional instruction of teachers as 
cabinets of minerals and other collections to the students of science. 
The apparatus, material products and literature of education, in- 
cluding catalogues, reports, etc., comprise the laboratory for peda- 
gogical work or study. The museum, as, for instance, the one now 
being collected at Columbia College, New York, is a natural ad- 
junct to the pedagogical chair. For this work a special appropri- 
ation is desired and hereby recommended. Arrangements have 
been made whereby we expect to receive some materials from the 
Bureau of Education at Washington and from the various Indian 
schools under charge of the government. The latter consists 
mainly of specimens of work done by pupils. 
Srate AID. 
This may not be the place to suggest the importance to our State 
of the work in this department, and the advisability of material 
support. Under a late law a very large number of new secondary
-P-A-G-E-259
—260— 
schools are being established in the State. For these, properly 
qualified and trained teachers, in many cases, cannot be obtained. 
Large sums of money are being expended for public education, and 
it is to the interest of the people that such expenditures should be 
returned in first-class instruction by well-qualified teachers. No 
good system of public schools can long exist without State schools 
for the training of teachers. 
OBTAINING PosITIONs. 
Our experience teaches that the supply of good teachers is very 
limited. We have been unable to meet all the demands made upon 
us for teachers. Our best teachers are employed at once at good 
wages. We recently sent a young man to the City High School in 
New Orleans at $125.00 per month. While we do not guarantee 
' positions, we have no trouble in locating our teachers who properly 
qualify themselves. 
Summer ScHoou. 
In connection with the State Superinfendent of Public Instruc- 
tion, Hon. Frank M. Smith, the University, last July, conducted a 
very successful summer school. The attendance of teachers was 
over three hundred. The work was done mainly by the Univer- 
sity Faculty. Much good was accomplished. 
In conclusion, I am glad to say that the prospect for a large at- 
tendance of teachers during the spring term is good. Special 
classes will be organized just after the Christmas holidays. I feel 
much encouraged by the future promise of this work, which is, as 
yet, just in its beginning stage. Its importance to the State, if 
properly developed, is second to none. During the past year forty- 
seven teachers were enrolled at the University. 
Respectfully submitted.

REPORT OF THE LAW DEPARTMENT. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
Dear Sir—It is a pleasure to be able to report that there has 
been, during the past year, a steady improvement in the amount and 
character of the work done, and a steady increase in the number of 
students in regular attendance, which is now greater than at any 
time in the history of the law department. An increased number 
of graduates of the academic department are now taking the course 
in law. 
Students show a greater readiness 1o give the full two years to 
the work for the degreee. The law students have become more 
completely a part of the University, and have entered more fully 
into its life and spirit. Several members of the present Senior class 
will probably, after graduation, remain with us for a third, or post- 
graduate year. This is much to be desired, and is the only way by 
which the school can be brought and kept in line with the oldest 
and best schools in the country. 
Our department is supported from the fees paid by its students, 
and out of these fees we this year offer two prizes for the best ex- 
aminations in the work of the Junior year and for regularity of at- 
tendance. 
Our methods of instruction include: 
1. Recitations from text-books, acecompanied by discussion. 
2. Recitations from lectures, which have been previously given 
out to the students in a type-written form, and then enlarged upon 
and illustrated by the instructor. 
3. Reading illustrative cases by the instructor to the class, which 
cases are taken from the best reports, and illustrate the principles 
contained in the text- books and lectures.
-P-A-G-E-261
—262— 
4, Giving out special cases, from the reports, to individual stu- 
dents, to be specially studied and orally reported on by them in 
presence of the class. 
5. Maintaining a weekly moot court in which, making use of all 
the forms required in actions in this State, the students discuss prac- 
tical questions of law. 
6. The attendance by students at the sessions of the various courts 
which sit in Knoxville, and the indicating to students by their in- 
structor what cases will be likely to prove most valuable to them, 
and how much time each student can fairly devote to this purpose. 
The tuition and expenses in this department are certainly as low 
as at any institution in the South, and we hope that it may so com- 
mend itself to the Trustees of the University, and to the educators 
and the bar of the State, as to continue and increase its present rate 
of growth, Respectfully submitted,

REPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN. 
Dr. Chas. W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
I have the honor of submitting the following report on the con- 
dition and progress of the University of Tennessee Library : 
It has been only during recent years that the true ideal of a li- 
brary has been discerned. For many centuries there has been but 
one conception of a library, which was a mere storehouse of books, 
a place where volumes might be preserved from destruction or theft. 
This was the ideal of the libraries of medieval Europe, which were 
in the strongest cells of the monasteries, and even then the books 
were chained to their shelves. Buta marvelous change has taken 
place during the last quarter of a century, and libraries have 
evolved into something more potent as a means of culture. In- 
- stead of being mere conservers of knowledge, they have become the 
most militant factors in its dissemination. They are the principal 
sources of information, and have made possible new and more ra- 
tional systems of education. 
It has been our desire and endeavor to develop the Library of 
the University of Tennessee in accordance with this ideal as rap- 
idly as the conditions would allow, and in some ways we have suc- 
ceeded beyond our expectations. 
The most radical departure made is the seminary room. In this 
room are placed all works of reference, and from time to sime other 
selected volumes which need to be reserved for the use of whole 
_classes. As a special department to a college library, there is reason 
to believe that the seminary room of the University of Tennessee 
has no counterpart in the South, and from it we have obtained most 
gratifying results. It has been in successful operation since the 
library was removed from old college three years ago, but not until 
the present session has its value been put to a real test. Such, how- 
ever, has been the demand upon it of late, by the members of the
-P-A-G-E-263
—264— 
classes in English, history, philosophy, and the languages, that it 
has been found necessary to allow the students the privilege of 
withdrawing the books reserved therein, during the night, on the 
condition that they be returned by nine o’clock on the following 
morning. The wisdom of this move is indicated by the fact that, 
beyond the daily use of the seminary room, which is very great, the 
students have withdrawn in this way, in the period from October 
Ist to November 29th, thirteen hundred and fifty-one volumes. It 
is, furthermore, to be noted that these books are all standard and 
high-class literature. 
In the other departments has no less progress been made. A 
large number of valuable additions have been made to the shelves, 
and none, perhaps, of such value and interest as the sets of standard 
periodicals purchased during the summer and autumn. These in- 
clude complete and perfect sets of the “Atlantic,” ‘“ Harper’s,” 
“ Century,” “Scribner’s Monthly,” “Scribner’s Magazine,” “ Fo- 
rum,” and the fifth series of “ Littel’s Living Age.” These are in 
themselves an epitome of the progress in all departments of thought 
and endeavor made during the past filty years. It is to be hoped 
that we may continue adding to our files until we have complete sets 
of all high class American magazines and some of the best English 
reviews. 
Among the various additions in the way of general literature 
made during the last six months may be noted the complete works 
of Lytton, Thackeray, Simms, Dumas, Schiller, Goethe, and many 
of the best editions of the standard poets, to take the place of old 
sets worn out or broken. Books on many special subjects of study 
have been purchased upon the suggestions of the professors inter- 
ested. 
Among the things of interest added to the reading-room may 
also be mentioned the rare set of “Southern Literary Messengers,” 
loaned by Dr. Henneman, and the autograph copy of the national 
hymn, “Americi,” presented to the library by the author, F.S. 
Smith, through Miss Warner. There is also, on exhibition, a col- 
lection of autographs of Generals Lee and Jackson, and other Con- 
federate miscellania, loaned by President Dabney.
-P-A-G-E-264
—265— 
The magazine list of the reading-room is quite extensive and 
includes the best publications of this country, with a few foreign 
magazines and reviews of importance. The list numbers ninety- 
two, of which thirty-five are presented to the library. The larger 
part of the gifts are daily papers published in Tennessee. An 
effort has been made to obtain files of all, or at least a number, of 
the State papers and magazines, and the editors, as a rule, have re~ - 
sponded very graciously to the requests to place the library on their 
complimentary lists. A number of daily papers have thus been 
coming to the library without expense to the same. The editor 
of the Chattanooga Daily Times, Mr. Adolph 8. Ochs, has further 
favored the library by lending to it a complete file of his paper ex- 
tending back twenty years or more, making well nigh a complete 
history of the events which have taken place during that period. 
The recent fire which destroyed the files of the Nashville Banner, 
a loss altogether irreparable, has demonstrated the advisability of 
all newspapers having duplicate files in some safe place. There is 
no question but that the library of the State University is the 
proper place for them, for there they will be carefully preserved, 
and will be invaluable as works of reference in the study of 
politics, literature, and history. It is to be hoped that other papers 
will follow the example of the Times, and place their duplicate files 
in this library. 
The books of the library are classified according to the Dewey, 
or decimal, system. This system is admirably adapted to a college 
library, as it not only groups kindred subjects closely together, but 
it places the books of a subject, as in literature, according to their 
historical and chronological position. Thus, works of contempo- 
raries will be found side by side. This system commends itself es- 
pecially to teachers of literature and history, for all groups of 
authors or events are found in their relative positions. All books 
on a certain defined subject are to be found on the shelves together, 
making reference work an easy task. The system, furthermore, ad- 
mits of great safety in the matter of lending books, and exactness 
in making out statistics in regard to the condition of the library. 
The shelf-list, which is the subject-catalogue of the library, and the 
card-catalogue of authors and titles, are made as complete and effi- 
cient as possible.

A collection of works relating to the South was started two years

publications of that nature. The collection of such material will be 
of great immediate value, but cannot proceed successfully without 
a special endowment. Contributions of this nature are earnestly 
solicited, and will be properly credited and cared for.

There is an idea prevalent among librarians that a library can- 
not reach its highest sphere of usefulness in a building devoted to 
other purposes. This is probably due to the fact that perfect quiet 
and order are essential for library work and investigation. Con- 
centration is the motto of every library, and should be the watch- 
word of every one using one. Therefore, anything that distracts 
attention should, and must be disposed of. It is to be hoped that 
this fact, and the fact that our library is located upstairs, and will 
soon be crowded for space, will move those in authority to consider 
plans for a separate fire-proof library building. At Yale, Harvard, 
University of Pennsylvania, and Columbia, the library is the vir- 
tual, and sometimes the literal, center of the institution, from which 
radiate the various departments of scholastic endeavor, all of them 
coming in touch within its walls and responding to its influence for 
the attainment of truth and culture. Why may not the library of 
the University of Tennessee reach toward a like ideal by having a 
separate building devoted to its special work ?

REPORT OF THE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
Dear Srr—Herewith I submit a report of the operations of the 
Agricultural Experiment Station of the University of Tennessee 
for the year 1893-94: 
By order of the Board of Trustees, at their annual meeting in 
June, 1893, the organization existing prior to the first of July of 
that year was changed. The office and title of Director of the 
Station was abolished, and the duties of the Director as previously 
fixed were transferred to the President, who should be assisted in 
the correspondence, and in such other ways as he might designate, 
by a Secretary. 
During the year ending July 1, 1894, the active members of the 
Station Staff were as follows: 
Cuartes W. DABNEY, JR... 
CHARLES F, VANDERFORD. 
F. Lamson-SoriBver 
Cuar.es W. Dasney, JR 
R. L. Warts. 
S. M. Barn...

se sees, Chemist. 
Horticulturist. 
istant Botanist. 
.. Assistant Chemist. 
. Librarian and Clerk.   
   
  
          
   
  By the Board of Trustees, at their annual meeting above referred 
to, it was declared that “the college farm shall constitute the Ex- 
periment Station farm, and shall be devoted to the general purposes 
of experiment operations. The work of the Station, whether con- 
ducted in the laboratory or on the farm, shall be, as far as possible, 
of a practical character and upon questions of interest and impor- 
tance to Tennessee agriculturists, so as to bring the Station in close 
touch with the wants and sympathies of the farmers, planters and 
stock-raisers of all the different sections of the State.”

It was further directed that “the entire proceeds of the sale of 
stock and products of the farm shall be devoted to the keeping uy 
of the supplies of stock and farm implements, and in making re- 
pairs and permanent improvements upon the farm and buildings 
as the board may order.” 
The farmers of Tennessee are earnestly seeking how best to di- 
versify their industries, that they may avoid the frequent disasters 
which seem to accompany the growing of staple crops alone. They 
are entering upon untried methods by which they hope to obtain 
fair rewards for their labor, and are everywhere met by the difficul- 
ties and uncertainties which attend all new enterprises. They are 
asking how to use fertilizers so as to increase the yield per acre 
without increase of cost of the product; how to clothe their bare 
fields with nutritious grasses; how to reclaim the vast areas of 
once productive lands now regarded as almost worthless; how best 
to use the coarser forage stuffs too often suffered to waste upon the 
farm. In every department of agriculture and horticulture they 
are demanding, as they have a right to do, that the trained workers 
of their Experiment Station shall endeavor to solve for them some 
of the difficult questions presented in their daily experience. 
The action of the Board of Trustees was taken with a full ap- 
preciation of what are the plainly apparent duties of the Station. 
The policy so outlined has been adopted by the Station staff, one 
and all; and to its fruition every person employed has given his 
best service. 
_ Upon the Station farm we have set on foot, and are steadily pur- 
suing experimentation in such lines and in such ways as will enable 
us to answer, with greater or less accuracy, the many questions of 
interest pressed upon us by the people of Tennessee. 
Probably the most important investigation upon which we have 
entered is to ascertain the adaptability of grasses, especially those 
which are perennial to the various soils of the State. We have 
sought: to do this work in two ways: First, by establishing upon 
the Station farm a garden of grasses, where could be tested the va- 
rious perennials suited to our climatic and soil conditions, and to 
produce as quickly as possible grass-seeds of known purity, and
-P-A-G-E-269
—270— 
plants of such as are not easily propagated from seed, for distribu- 
tion throughout the State. Those who know the difficulties en- 
countered in any attempt to grow grasses by what is termed pure 
culture—that is, the growing of any given grass in a plot without 
admixture of other varieties—will understand why such an enter- 
prise cannot be carried through to success in any short period of 
time. We have already been able to send out to several sections 
of the State both seeds and plants sure to add very much to the 
value of the woodland as well as to the open pasturage. This work 
will be continued upon its present lines, and further additions will 
be made to the number of varieties now grown for that purpose, 
whenever opportunity shall permit. Secondly, that farmers may 
know as completely and as accurately as they should the characters, 
value, habits, and- uses of the native as well as the introduced 
grasses of the State, it was decided to prepare and publish, to be 
distributed as widely as our means would permit, a bulletin illus- 
trating as nearly as possible every grass, good, bad, or indifferent, 
now growing in the State. This work was intrusted to Prof. 
F, Lamson-Scribner, Botanist, and was diligently prosecuted un- 
til complete. 
Early in the fall of 1893, measures were taken to transfer the 
more important work of the horticulturist to the station farm, upon 
which are found many acres admirably suited in soil, location, and 
exposure, for such work as is most desirable in this department. 
The work of converting an almost useless steep hillside into a series of 
terraces to be planted in pears, grapes, and other fruits, best adapted 
to the peculiar conditions there existing, is now well under way. 
The labor of men and horses upon the farm has been so managed 
that this very large amount of work has been accomplished without 
serious cost. When completed, we shall have an orchard and fruit 
garden very conyeniently arranged to secure all necessary condi- 
tions of healthy growth and development. 
It has been decided to give much less time to what are known as 
variety tests. At best, such tests can only determine such things 
as concern the given locality and the soil upon which they are 
made. Our main object in all the work we shall do in the grow- 
ing of fruits or vegetables upon the Station farm will be to seek
-P-A-G-E-270
—271— 
the best methods by which we can maintain healthy, fruitful 
growth, and how best to combat the insects, pests, and fungous en- 
emies, under as well as above ground, which are everywhere the 
cause of ruin to the trees, fruits, and vegetables, in this latitude. 
Meanwhile we have not lost sight of that sort of investigation into 
the adaptation of plants of all kinds to the various conditions, 
whether of prevailing winds, temperature, altitude or soils, which 
is really the only manner in which variety tests can be intelligently 
conducted. For this part of our work we have sought, and I am 
glad to say that we are receiving, the generous help of the people, 
from the mountains to the Mississippi River. Out of such effort 
will come, sooner or later, such measure of success as will surely 
recompense all our labor and trouble. 
During the year 1893 the following bulletins were issued : 
No. 1—“ Some Injurious Insects of the Apple.” Of this bulletin 
five thousand copies were issued, and were sent to our correspondents 
through the State, and have been supplied upon subsequent demand, 
until very few copies are now left on hand. 
No. 2—“ The Rational Use of Feeding Stuffs—Winter Dairying 
in Tennessee.” Five thousand copies were issued, and have been 
distributed by the Station. By permission, nearly as many more 
have been printed, and distributed throughout the country without 
cost to us. 
No. 3—“ Small Fruits: Strawberries, Raspberries, Blackberries, 
Grapes.” 
No. 4—“ Field Experiments with Tomatoes and Onions. The 
Boll- worm, Corn- worm, or Tomato-worm (heliothis armiger, Hubn).” 
Of these two bulletins, a like number, five thousand each, have been 
distributed to our correspondents, and have been asked for and sent 
to many hundreds of others in the State and elsewhere. 
A cordial understanding was had with the State Bureau of Agri- 
culture, and plans were made by which the bureau at Nashville has 
greatly assisted in making the work of this Station of genuine value 
to all parts of the commonwealth.
-P-A-G-E-271

On the Ist of July, 1894, the organization of the Station was 
changed somewhat, because of the appointment of Prof. F. Lamson- 
Scribner to be Agrostologist of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
With the same Executive Committee, the Station council now is:

During the current year we have issued so far: Z 
Bulletin No. 1—“ The Grasses of Tennessee.” This bulletin con- 
tains one hundred and eighty-seven illustrations, carefully drawn 
from specimens in the herbarium of the Station, with accurate de- 
scriptions of each. 
It is a valuable contribution to the agricultural literature of the 
State, furnishing, as it does, such information.as every farmer must 
have who would properly manage his meadows and his pasturage. 
With this bulletin at hand, every intelligent farmer in the State 
should be able to recognize any grass, of whatever character, useful 
or injurious, found native in his fields or woodland pasturage, or in- 
troduced as commonly-called cultivated grasses. He can know their 
general appearance, habits of growth, time of seeding, and so be 
able to rid himself of such as are of little or no value, and protect 
such as he wishes to grow most abundantly. 
No. 2 (Also just issued)—“ Fruits: Grapes, Strawberries, Rasp- 
berries, Blackberries, Pears, Apples and Peaches,” giving concisely 
the results of the work so far with these fruits upon our grounds, 
both at the University and at the farm, and setting forth clearly 
enough the proposed work of the future by the horticultural de- 
partment of the Station. 
I herewith transmit the reports of the several members of the 
Station Staff to the President, from which can be learned what the 
several departments of the Ststion have done and are doing. 
Very respectfully, 
[Signed.] CHARLES F, VANDERFORED,

Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee: 
Dear Srr:—The following report of the work of the chemical 
division of the Experiment Station for the year 1893-94 is respect- 
fully submitted : 
During the early part of the year work on a study of the virgin 
soils of the State was continued ; some twenty analyses of soils and 
subsoils were completed. This practically completes the chemical 
work on soils. We have examined in the laboratory fifty odd sam- 
ples of soils and subsoils, and have made complete chemical 
analyses of forty-eight samples. These samples, representing, as 
they do, all the typical soil areas of the State, were carefully se- 
lected by Secretary Charles F. Vanderford, a description of the 
metnod of obtaining the samples being given in the Fifth Annual 
Report. This station now has on hand sufficient data to make an 
excellently valuable report on the soils of this State, and it is the 
intention of those in charge to publish these results as soon as pos- 
sible. 
After the completion of the soil analyses, work was begun on a 
study of the starch contents of the Irish potato. All growers of 
Trish potatoes, residents of the State, were invited to send us for 
analysis samples of their seed potatoes; unfortunately only two 
growers took advantage of this opportunity, namely, John C. 
Bridgewater, of Mount Juliet, and Hugh L. Craighead, of Nash- 
ville. Mr. Bridgewater sent in six samples and Mr. Craighead 
one. These seven samples, with one from the Station farm, were 
the only samples of seed potatoes sent us. All persons sending 
samples of seed potatoes were also requested to send us samples of 
potatoes from the resulting crop; and in response to this request 
we received, with the exception of eight samples from the Station 
farm, but one sample, and that from Mr. Craighead, of Nashville. 
Although much disappointed by the apparent lack of interest in 
the problem of improving the Irish potato crop in the State, we 
feel that something has been accomplished in making a start; and 
we hope that another year will show an increased interest in this 
important work. 
Eight samples of sorghum cane, grown from seed sent out by 
the United States Department of Agriculture, were examined for 
18
-P-A-G-E-273
—274— 
sugar; and it is the present policy of the Station to continue this 
work next year. 
During the early part of October we received the first samples of 
sugar beets, and they continued to come in until about the first of 
December. We received in all only twenty-eight samples; six of 
these, not being accompanied by the proper records, were thrown 
out. This was a surprisingly small number of samples, when we 
take into consideration the fact that more than a thousand samples 
of seed had been sent out to various parties throughout the State. 
However, some good has certainly been accomplished, in spite of 
the small number of samples sent in; the analyses show that a 
number of beets were of excellent quality, and we hope that an- 
other year’s test will show even better results upon soils of similar 
character to those growing beets showing a high per cent. of 
sucrose. 
During the present year Mr. C. A. Mooers has had charge of the 
fertilizer work, making analyses of all the samples received during 
that time. It gives me pleasure to testify to the thoroughness and 
care with which Mr. Mooers has executed his work. For the 
State inspection of fertilizers, there have been analyzed in the 
laboratory, since July 1, 1893, two hundred and eight samples of 
fertilizers, and twelve samples of phosphate rock, all of the latter 
from the phosphate rock deposits in Tennessee. 
It will be the policy of the Station to continue the work on the 
Irish potato, sorghum cane and sugar beet; and it is to be hoped 
that next year we may meet with more hearty co-operation on the 
part of the farmers throughout the State. 
It is intended to begin at once a study of the cotton-seed meals 
as found on the markets; special attention will be paid to the adul- 
teration and deterioration of the meal. Our mai object will be to 
find, if possible, some means whereby the consumer may be pro- 
tected from impure meals. 
The Station laboratory is now in excellent condition for doing 
good work. During the past year we were able to purchase some 
much-needed apparatus and supplies, and we may safely say that
-P-A-G-E-274
—275— 
the laboratory is now in better condition for good work than ever 
before. Among the pieces of apparatus purchased was a very fine 
analytical balance and set of weights; a balance for coarse weigh- 
ings up to ten pounds and set of weights; platinum crucibles and 
dishes ; platinum cylinders for the electrolysis of copper; twenty- 
four batteries for electrolytic work ; glassware, porcelain ware, ap- 
paratus for general laboratory use, chemicals, etc. 
Another room has been added to the one already used by Mr. 
Mooers for fertilizer work, and he now has his laboratory in good 
shape for work. The laboratory stands in great need of a bath 
suitable for the estimation of available phosphoric acid; the bath 
now in use, besides being of very inconvenient shape and in bad 
condition, has been in use for a number of years. A large drying 
oven is also much needed, the one at present in use being entirely 
too small. We also need the apparatus for carrying on at one time 
a number of other extractions in feedstuffs. These pieces of ap- 
paratus, with the general supplies and chemicals, will put the 
laboratories into strictly first-class condition for doing almost any 
kind of work. 
The analytical work for the year may be summarized as follows: 
     
      Samples of fertilizers 
Samples of phosphate rock. 
Samples of soil...... 0.4... 
Samples of Irish potatoes 
Samples of sorghum cane .

Dr, Chas. W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
Dear Sir—The following report of the Horticultural Division 
of the Experiment Station for the year 1893-94, is respectfully 
submitted :
-P-A-G-E-275
—276— 
The most prominent work of the horticultural division has been 
an investigation of the apple industry in Tennessee. No field of re- 
search is more promising of valuable results than this. The study 
was actually begun in January, 1893, with the following objects in 
view: 1. To ascertain the varieties which have been found best 
adapted to various sections of the State; 2. To locate and test seed- 
lings of special merit; 3. To determine the adaptability of soils, 
exposures and locations for apple culture, or for given varieties ; 
4, To study native varieties and seedlings with a view to originat- 
ing new and better sorts by hybridization. 
Hundreds of letters have been written to fruit growers through- 
out the State inquiring about varieties, soils, locations, exposures, 
ete. The responses have been very encouraging. Much valuable 
information has been secured and properly recorded. A large 
number of promising seedlings have been found, and in many in- 
stances specimens of the fruit have been sent to the horticultural 
division for examination. Some of the apples thus secured were 
very handsome, large, and of superior flavor. These samples, when 
received, were photographed, showing the size of the whole apple, 
and also a half section, thus preserving an accurate record of its 
shape, core, seed, stem, and even the grain of the flesh. Careful 
notes were made upon their color, flavor, size, etc. Cions of prom- 
ising seedlings will be secured the coming spring, and grafted on 
bearing trees in the Station orchard. By this method fruit will be 
obtained in two years. If, after fruiting, the seedling merits further 
trial, the trees will be propagated, planted on the farm, and also dis- 
tributed among intelligent orchardists for thorough testing elsewhere. 
The division is collecting data which will render it possible to pub- 
lish a catalogue of Tennessee apples. Such a catalogue is greatly 
needed, as the nomenclature of this fruit in our State is in a very 
unsatisfactory condition. It is hoped that the models of the fruits 
of the more prominent varieties may be secured for the Station 
museum. No apples were harvested in the Station orchard this 
year on account of the severe March freeze. 
In the last annual report of this division, mention was made of a 
pear orchard begun on the college farm. The trees were carefully 
sprayed during the past summer, and no fungous diseases have yet
-P-A-G-E-276
—277— 
appeared. The trees have made strong, healthy growth. Over a 
hundred additional trees willbe planted next spring. 
In Bulletin, Vol. VII., No. 2, a chapter is devoted to the peach 
industry in Tennessee. The production of this fruit has been 
greatly neglected, and every possible effort will be made to promote 
its cultivation. An investigation as to varieties, soils, locations, 
etc., similar to that of apples, has been instituted. 
A full report upon the experiments with grapes is given in the 
December bulletin of the horticultural division. The March freeze 
greatly reduced the crop; notwithstanding, many varieties yielded 
quite abundantly. It is hoped that every variety in the vineyard 
will fruit in 1895. Preparations are being made to establish a new 
vineyard on the college farm next spring. 
The usual attention has been given the cultivation of strawber- 
ries, raspberries, and blackberries. Brief chapters are devoted to 
these fruits in the bulletin above referred to. 
Special experiments were conducted with onions and lettuce. 
No report has been made of the work of the year; but a careful 
record of the facts obtained has been preserved. The experiments 
with these vegetables will] be continued next year. A general gar- 
den, without any special line of work proved quite remunerative. 
Early in the fall the decayed parts of the frame work of the 
greenhouse were replaced with new wood. The house being unfit 
for accurate experimental work, it has been used mainly for the 
culture of flowers and decorative plants. A new greenhouse is 
greatly needed to conduct certain investigations, and it is-earnestly 
hoped that such a structure will be erected next summer. 
- A vile weed, wild onion (Allium vineale, L.) is spreading at an 
alarming rate throughout the State. It is especially abundant 
along streams, and is being rapidly introduced into rolling, hilly, 
and even mountainous districts. The difficulty with which the wild 
onion is eradicated renders it one of the most dangerous weeds in 
the State. The horticultural division is conducting a large num- 
ber of experiments, both in the field and under glass, with the hope 
of finding a successful method of combating this dreaded pest.
-P-A-G-E-277
—278-—— 
Some valuable facts have already been obtained concerning its 
habits of growth. 
The horticulturist has given considerable attention to institute 
work. Several meetings of horticultural societies were attended. 
Preparations for the annual meeting of the East Tennessee Horti- 
cultural Society consumed some time. At the Jatter meeting the 
Horticultural division made an exhibit of decorative plants, fruits, 
vegetables, implements, ete. 
Respectfully, 
[Signed] R. L. Warts, 
Horticulturist. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
Dear Srr—The undersigned assumed his duties as Botanist on 
the first of July, 1894. Up to that date he was engaged on the 
grasses of Tennessee and in other ways assisting the former 
Botanist. 
Most of the time has been employed in the herbarium. A large 
number of unmounted specimens had accumulated, which have 
been, or are being, mounted, classified, catalogued, and assigned to 
their proper places in the collection. The collection of duplicates 
has been carefully gone over and rearranged. The Botanist has 
contributed his own collection of duplicates made during two years’ 
residence in West Tennessee. It is our purpose to accumulate, as 
opportunity may permit, all the native and adventive species of 
plants growing in the State; also enough material from other parts 
of the country to enable us to study our own intelligently. The 
notes and specimens thus acquired will enable us at any time to 
make a report on our valuable timbers, injurious weeds, soil distri- 
bution of native plants, parasitic fungi, or other matters of practical 
importance. During the year there have been added to the collec- 
tion about three thousand five hundred specimens. Most of these 
have come by exchange with other collections. There are included 
in this number about twelve hundred specimens of fungi. It is the 
purpose of the Botanist to pay special attention to this feature of the 
collection iz the future.
-P-A-G-E-278
—279— 
We are beginning a series of experiments on the fungous diseases 
of our various cultivated crops, those of the peach to receive special 
attention during next season. It is respectfully recommended that 
provision be made for conducting experiments under proper control 
on the life histories of fungi, and for investigating other physio- 
logical questions of immediate bearing on agriculture. For this 
work we need hot-house room and special apparatus. 
Respectfully submitted, 
[Signed.] Samueu M. Barn, 
Botanist. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
Dear Srr—I have the honor to submit the following report of 
my work since July 1, 1894, at which date this division was re- 
established. 
Attention was at once given to the collection, which was far from 
being in proper condition for reference or study, because of the fact 
that no one had direct and special charge of it for the past three 
years. Much work has been done in classifying the material on 
hand, and before spring opens most of the insects will be named and 
arranged according to the latest classification. 
For the work of next year, it is designed to study the life his- 
tories of those insects which are known as “ true bugs” (heteropters). 
Many of these insects are very injurious to vegetation, and a few 
are indisectly beneficial to man by preying upon some of the nox- 
ious species. To pursue this work in a proper manner, breeding 
cages and a suitable place for them are to be secured. Aside from 
these additions, I ask that the division be supplied with insecticides 
and the necessary machines for spraying. 
Beside studying the life-histories of “ true bugs,” a biologic col- 
lection will also be made of the economic species. This collection 
will contain, so far as possible, the egg, larva, pupa and imago 
of each species, its parasites, and samples of its injury or work.
-P-A-G-E-279
—280— 
Such a collection will be more educational to the farmer and the 
economic student than a systematic one, and should not be neglected. 
The usefulness of this division can be further extended by a close 
association with the farmer. This can only be possible by personal 
contact with them, and I ask that some provision be made that I 
may get before them, at least twice a year. 
Ihave reason to believe that the work of this division can be made 
of great value to the farmers and horticulturists of the State, and 
feel sure that my expectations will be fully realized, if the di- 
vision is given the necessary support. 
Yours respectfully, 
[Signed.] CHARLES E. CHAMBLISS, 
Entomologist.

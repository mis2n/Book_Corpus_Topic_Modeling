PREFACE 
Wirx the multiplication of departments in 
the Colleges of Agriculture, students are in 
danger of developing wrong ideas as to the rela- 
tive importance of different factors in the 
management of the farm asa unit. The student 
who becomes an enthusiast on poultry may 
forget that successful crops must be raised if 
the farm is to prosper. The one who believes 
that alfalfa will make any farm pay may neglect 
to provide profitable animals to eat the crop. 
It is desirable, therefore, that the student corre- 
late what he has learned in all the departments 
by applying it to the management of specific 
farms. 
Scientific farming is not the buying of spray- 
pumps and milking machines, nor the construc- 
tion of costly buildings, nor the spending of a 
lot of money that one does not have, although 
all of these things may be desirable at times. 
It is not farm mechanics or horticulture; it is 
not animal husbandry or farm crops. He who 
Vv

farms successfully must consider the farm as 
the unit: 
Being a new subject, the field of farm manage- 
ment is not always clearly understood. It has 
sometimes been confused with animal hus- 
bandry, horticulture, farm crops, or rural econ- 
omy. It may be taught by persons who also 
teach these or other subjects, just as horticulture 
and dairy industry are sometimes taught by 
one man; but the distinction between the sub- 
jects should be none the less clear. The teacher 
of farm management finds that his work is 
much more closely related to animal husbandry, 
farm crops, and horticulture than it is to rural 
economy. One of the important subjects in 
farm management is the selection and purchase 
ofafarm. This bears the same relation to rural 
economy as does the selection and purchase of a 
cow. It is the aim of farm management teach- 
ing to unite business principles with the scientific 
principles taught by the various departments 
into such a system that the farm as a whole shall 
yield the greatest profit. The rural economist 
must somehow tie all the farms together into a 
philosophy of progressive civilization. 
The student of architecture is taught art by 
one man, drawing by another, sanitation by 
another, strength of materials by another; but
-P-A-G-E-7
  PREFACE vii 
he would be a poor architect whose training 
stopped with these fundamentals. Finally, the 
student is required to make plans for buildings 
in order that he may have practice in applying 
the principles and in making estimates of cost. 
Similarly the student of farm management 
selects specific farms and makes plans for their 
arrangement, equipment, and management, with 
financial estimates. If a student has had prac- 
tice in making such estimates for a dairy farm, 
he will have the method of attack in making 
plans for an orange plantation. One who has 
studied this subject ought to be fairly well 
prepared to go on to a farm and decide as to the 
type of farming to take up, field and building 
arrangement, cropping system, number of each 
kind of animals to stock the place, equipment 
required, capital necessary, the amount of labor 
required, the kinds of accounts and records to 
keep, ete. 
It will often occur that some fundamental 
subject that is necessary for working such prob- 
lems is not taught in the college. A very few 
of the most vital principles must then be studied 
in the farm management course in order to plan 
for the management of an entire farm. This 
point has been kept in mind in preparing the 
references. The purpose of the writers has been 
   
-P-A-G-E-8
  viii PREFACE 
to include all the more important references that 
are likely to be useful, even though some of 
them are not distinctly on farm management. 
For instance, the farm wood lot is only one of 
the many farm crops. References on it are 
included while no other crops are mentioned. 
The methods of growing other crops are always 
taught, but few institutions give any attention 
to the wood lot as a crop. Forestry may be 
taught, but this is a very different question. In 
order to prepare a good plan for a farm in many 
parts of the United States, one must know 
something about the management of a wood 
lot. As another example, forms of tenure may 
be mentioned. Practically all the references on 
this are from the standpoint of rural economy; 
very little is known about land tenure from the 
standpoint: of the prospective farmer. How- 
ever, the references may be of some help. If 
the principles of building construction have 
been studied in some other department, the 
student is ready to consider the question from 
the. standpoint of farm management. The 
questions will then be to adapt the buildings 
to the particular farm and to the capital avail- 
able, to arrange their position and floor plans 
so as to facilitate labor, etc. ; 
The writers have found exercises 29-42, 56-72,

84-113, 120-124, 130-145, 163-193, 204-238 to 
be among the most useful. Numbers 39, 64, 
65, 79, 100, 120, 135, 136, 139, 163-193, 204-216 
are considered most important, and number 195 
has been found most important of all. 
The exercises are grouped in sections. It is 
not necessary that they ve taught in the order 
here given. With classes beginning in the mid- 
dle of the college year it has been found desir- 
able to take up such subjects as farm accounts 
in the beginning so as to be able to devote the 
good weather to farm problems and visits to 
farms. 
The authors will be glad to correspond with 
teachers concerning any difficulties in the work, 
and will be glad to receive suggestions as to 
ways in which it may be improved.

LABORATORY EXERCISES IN 
FARM MANAGEMENT 
Farming as A Business (Refs. 22-25) 
1. How does the study of farm manage- 
ment differ from farm crops? Horticulture? 
Animal husbandry? Rural economy? (Ref. 4, 
pp. 488-442.) 
2. A farmer says that he made one $100 last 
year. On investigation it is found that he spent 
$400 on school, household, and personal ex- 
penses. He also had the use of a house that cost 
$2000, had garden produce, milk, butter, eggs, 
and some meat from the farm. To what salary 
in this city would his so-called $100 be equal? 
3. About what salary would be necessary in 
this city to enable one to live as well as the 
average farmer lives? 
4. On the average farm in this State about 
how much are the products that the farm fur- 
nishes for the household worth? (Include house 
rent.)

5. Compare the opportunities on a farm and 
in a city for each of the following classes of 
persons: (1) those in poor health, (2) women, 
(3) old men, (4) young men with no capital, 
(5) young men with $5000 capital. 
6. Are failures more frequent on farms or in 
cities?

(Refs. 26-127) 
8. On an outline map of the United States 
chart the average values per acre of farm land 
according to the census of 1900, using different 
colors for the states falling in the groups having 
average values from $0-$10, $11-$20, $21-$30, 
etc.t (Ref. 10, p. 697.) 
9. Select a typical state from each of the 
following groups, North Atlantic, South At- 
lantic, North Central, South Central, Western, 
using this State for one of the five. Draw curves 
on cross-section paper showing the changes in 
land values per acre for each of the five states 
from 1850 to 1905. See Ref. 10, p. 697. Use

acre for 1905, divide the value in the last 
column on page 46, Ref. 135, by the area of 
farm land given in Ref. 10, p. 142. 
10. For the same states plot the crop yields 
for the most important crops. (Yearbook, 1908, 
pp. 598-660.) 
11. For the same states combine the ten-year 
average values per acre of corn, oats, and hay. 
Divide by three and plot the resulting average 
values. (Yearbook, 1908, pp. 598-660.) 
12. What are the leading types of farming in 
the United States? Where is each type con- 
ducted? Why? (Refs. 26, 28, 29, 31, 33, 34.) 
13. On what basis are the farms sorted by 
the Census Bureau in the classification by prin- 
cipal source of income? If a farm has $150 total 
income and receives $70 from butter and $75 
from hay and grain, how would it be classified? 
14, Which division of the United States has 
the largest percentage of hay and grain farms? 
Fruit farms, ete.? (Ref. 10, p. liii.) 
15. What is the most frequent size of farm 
with each of the types? (Ref. 10, p. liv.) 
16. What is the most frequent amount of 
farm income with each of the types? (Ref. 10, 
p. lv.) 
17. What relation is there between the type

30. How many acres would make a good- 
sized farm for dairying? Truck growing? 
Greenhouse farming? Potato growing? 
31. Two farms are identical except that the 
cost of marketing is $50 per year less from the 
first farm. Assuming that this condition is 
permanent and that the interest rate is 5 per 
cent permanently, how much more is the first 
farm worth? 
32. How much more valuable is a farm with 
running water supply piped to the buildings 
than a similar farm with a windmill and ele- 
vated tank? (The extra annual cost includes 
repairs, depreciation, extra labor, oil, etc.) 
33. Assume good roads, two identical 100- 
acre farms 1 mile and 4 miles from railway 
station and creamery, milk hauled once a day: 
How much more is the first farm worth as a 
dairy farm? Potato and hay farm? Sheep 
farm? 
If the prices are $50 and $40 per acre, which 
would you buy for dairying? For potatoes and 
hay? For sheep? (See Exercises 156-158.)

many days will this make in a season? 
36. What were the taxes paid last year on 
each of the farms scored in exercise 39 and what 
per cent on the price asked? 
37. Is it usually cheaper to buy improve- 
ments or to make them? Why? 
38. In the town of Dryden, Tompkins County, 
New York, on farms worth from $11 to $20 per 
acre inclusive, averaging $17.87, the average 
yield of oats was 27 bushels, of potatoes 95 
bushels, and of hay .95 tons per acre; on farms 
worth from $41 to $50 per acre inclusive, av- 
eraging $46.42, the average yield of oats was 37 
bushels, of potatoes 140 bushels, and of hay 1.47 
tons per acre. Assuming that the difference in 
productivity is due to permanent soil conditions 
and that all other conditions are the same, farms 
of which class would be the more profitable in- 
vestments? If the difference in productivity is 
the result of previous poor management and 
the farms are identical in other respects, in- 
cluding soils, farms of which class would be 
the more profitable investment? (See Exercise 
175.) 
39. Score several farms according to the fol- 
lowing score card. If possible, one of these 
should be the student’s home farm.

DIRECTIONS 
The number of points assigned is not the limit, but is 
suggestive. For example, if the water supply is exception- 
ally good, give it more than 40 points. Any other excep- 
tional values may be scored more than the points assigned. 
In some cases a deduction of all the points assigned is not 
sufficient. Distance to market may absolutely disqualify 
a farm for the sale of milk. If the score card is followed
-P-A-G-E-24
ee ee rer Te ee 
10 LABORATORY EXERCISES 
exactly, this farm may score higher than a fairly good farm 
| near market. In all such cases deduct additional points 
from the total score. It is only by this flexibility that 
scores can be made that are truly comparable. The best 
farm for the purpose should have the highest final score. 
The chief purposes of a score card are to make the exami- 
nation systematic and to prevent the forgetting of important 
items. 
If the points are not properly distributed for the kind 
of farming to be followed, a new distribution of points 
should be made before comparing farms. For instance, 
for truck farms all points that have to do with ease of till- 
age should be given a higher rating, while fertility is of less 
importance. In irrigated sections water right, alkali, and 
ease of application of water must be included. 
No points are assigned for climate. This should be con- 
sidered when judging farms in different regions or at differ- 
ent altitudes, or when topography or proximity to water 
make a difference in the climate of the farms that are being 
compared. 
40. What is personal property? Real es- 
tate? (Ref. 7, pp. 153-155.) What things ’ 
should be included in a contract for sale of real 
estate? 
41. What is an abstract of title? How is it 
obtained in this state? Who usually pays for 
it? How will you determine whether all back 
taxes are paid? (Ref. 7, pp. 159-162 and 238- 
239.) 
42. Define the different kinds of deeds. 
Which is the usual kind? Who should pay for 
drawing the deed? For recording it? (Ref.

43. What are the common forms of benine in 
this region? 
44, Do good and poor land rent for the same 
share? If so, which is the better investment 
for the tenant? For the landlord? 
45. How much capital would you need to 
make it pay to start as a tenant? How much 
would you need in order to make it pay to buy 
rather than rent? (See Exercise 175.) 
46. Give the principal features of a lease 
favorable for the landlord. For the tenant. 
For maintaining the fertility of the land. What 
features will come nearest to satisfying all these 
conditions? 
47. Write a lease including these features.

at simple interest.) 
51. Compare the total capital and its distri- 
bution on different types of farms in the United 
States. (Ref. 10, pp. lvii-lix.) 
52. At the time of the last census what was 
the average capital per farm in this State? 
What proportion of it was invested in real estate? 
Machinery? Stock? (Ref. 10, p. 142.) 
53. What differences are there in the amount 
and distribution of capital on dairy, potato, 
fruit, and general farms in Reference 13? 
54. How do the amounts and distribution of 
capital differ on the most profitable and least 
profitable farms in Reference 13? (See also

56. If a four-year rotation of corn, oats, hay 
two years, is followed, how much more will it 
cost per year per acre to farm land 100 rods from 
the buildings than that near the buildings? 
How much more will the nearer field be worth 
per acre if interest rates are 5 per cent? That 
is, what sum of money at 5 per cent will yield 
interest equal to the extra annual cost? 
57. If interest, repairs, and depreciation on a 
fence for a permanent pasture cost 5 cents per 
rod per year, how much more per acre is a square 
field of 20 acres worth than a field 20 x 160 
rods? 
58. If the annual cost per rod of fence is 
5 cents, how much will it cost per acre to main- 
tain a fence around a square field of 40 acres? 
A square field of 1 acre? 
59. In addition to his permanent pasture a 
farmer has 100 acres of land in rotation. He 
uses a four-year rotation and has four equal 
fields. He wishes to know whether it will pay 
him to keep all the fields fenced in order to be 
able to pasture after harvest. Pasture in this 
region costs 75 cents per month per head. The 
aftergrowth will keep 30 cattle about one month 
each year. The depreciation, repairs, and in-  
-P-A-G-E-28

terest on the fence are thought to be about 5 
cents per rod per year. The fence consumes 
about one acre of land for each mile of fence. 
The land is worth $50 per acre. Will it pay 
him to fence the farm? (This leaves out of 
account the inconvenience of farming up to 
fences, the value of the aftergrowth in sup- 
plying humus, and the advantage of having 
crops fenced against stock.)

acres. He goes to town once a day with milk 
and makes very few other trips He grows 
feed for 40 head of stock and returns the manure 
to the land. He desires to know which will be 
more profitable, to place his house on the cor- 
ner of the farm nearest town or to place it 
in the center of one side of the farm, making it 
nearer the fields but 80 rods farther to town.

The four-year rotation is preferable. It will 
roadily be seen that it is simpler than the three- 
year rotation. It requires a little less plowing. 
The oat yields will probably be better since 
none of the oats are planted on sod. 
On the 27-acre oat field only 19 acres is seeded 
to grass and clover. The remaining 8 acres is 
planted to oats the following year and is then 
seeded. 
In 1914 corn and potatoes will again be grown 
on field 1. Their positions on this field may 
then be reversed. In 1915, when this field is 
again in oats, the portion that is not seeded 
with grass may be changed so that a different 
part of the field will be called upon for two 
successive oat crops.

Field 6, 10 acres corn stubble. 
Fields 5 and 6 are each isolated. The other 
fields are all side by side and in the order given. 
How can he arrange to have six nearly equal 
fields? How should he proceed to establish the 
rotation?

County, New York, was cut clean in 1888. It 
was pastured the first four years, after which the 
brush was thinned. The value as a pasture prob- 
ably equaled the cost of thinning. In 1908 
the wood was cut and sold for barrel staves. 
The receipts were $190 per acre and the cost of 
harvesting was about $30 per acre. On what 
value per acre has this paid 5 per cent compound 
interest?

147. The average shrinkage of ear corn in tests 
for eight years in Iowa up to the first of each 
month was as follows: December 5.2 per cent, 
January 6.9 per cent, February 7.5 per cent, 
March 7.8 per cent, April 9.7 per cent, May

If ear corn could be sold at 40 cents per 
bushel in November, counting 75 pounds to the 
bushel, and at the same price in December, 
counting 70 pounds to the bushel, at which date 
should it be sold? How much would be gained

155. In order to compete with a creamery, 
a certain New York company offers $1.50 per 100 
pounds for milk containing 4.1 per cent butter 
fat. For each tenth of a per cent increase in 
butter fat up to 6 per cent, they offer 5 cents 
per 100 pounds increase in price. If there is 
no objection to using a separator for standard- 
izing milk, what grade of milk should be sold? 
156. A farmer who has 36 cows and lives one 
mile from the creamery sold 122,823 pounds of 
milk in 1908, for which he received $1855.61. 
Hauling the milk required the time of one horse 
and man 45 minutes per day for 365 days. 
Estimate the cost of hauling. How much is 
this per 100 pounds? What per cent of the value 
of the product? How much milk did he sell per 
cow? What were the gross receipts per cow? 
157. Another farmer who lives 4 miles from 
the same creamery kept 23 cows and sold 75,578 
pounds of milk for which he received $1191.86. 
The hauling required an average of 2.5 hours 
per day for one man and team. Make the same 
calculations as in Exercise 156. Considering 
only the cost of hauling milk, how much more

If there has been an increase in inventory, 
include it with receipts. Include a decrease 
in inventory with expenses. 
Farm income equals receipts minus expenses. 
This represents the net returns for the use of 
the capital invested and for all unpaid labor. 
Subtracting the interest that the capital would 
earn if invested at the usual rate gives the net 
amount received for all unpaid labor. Change 
the interest rate if 5 per cent is not correct. 
The unpaid labor includes that of the farmer 
himself and of all other persons including mem-
-P-A-G-E-57
LABORATORY EXERCISES 43 
bers of the family who have done farm work 
and received no pay. Subtracting the esti- 
mated value of all this labor except that of the 
farmer gives a figure which represents the net 
returns from the labor of the farmer alone or 
labor income per man. 
If the farm is a tenant farm, make out a record 
as above for the tenant, including the tenant’s 
capital, receipts, expenses, labor income, etc. 
Make out a similar record for the landlord, but 
do not calculate a labor income. In this case 
the farm income is the interest received. From 
it calculate the per cent. 
164. Estimate the value of work done by the 
farmer, add to this the value of other unpaid 
labor, and subtract from the farm income to 
get the interest made on the capital. What 
per cent is this on the average capital? 
165. Find the receipts per cow, per hen, 
per sheep, etc. To find the total receipts for any 
kind of animals add the present inventory to the 
receipts from products and sales of stock, and 
subtract the sum of the last year’s inventory 
and purchases.

183. In six townships in Tompkins County 
labor incomes were calculated for 869 farmers 
who worked their own farms. Ten of these, 
about one in a hundred, made labor incomes of 
over $2000. It is interesting to see how they 
were able to do so much better than the aver- 
age. The following records are summaries of a 
year’s business on these farms. 
Other live stock includes young stock and 
other minor stock. The yield of corn is re- 
ported in bushels of shelled corn. The soil 
types refer to names given in the soil map of 
the county prepared by the Bureau of Soilss 
United States Department of Agriculture. Sales 
of cattle or other stock, as listed in receipts, is 
the receipts above the cost of purchases. This 
is also corrected for any change in inventory. 
The sales of cattle plus the sales of dairy prod- 
ucts, divided by the number of cows, gives 
what is called the receipts per cow. The re- 
ceipts per sheep and per hen are obtained in a 
similar manner. 
184. Compare the following items on these 
farms with the averages in Exercise 175: size 
of farm, capital, value of machinery, value of 
horses, labor bill, feed bill, fertilizer bill, crop 
yields per acre.

185. It is often stated that a farmer should 
learn how to produce one product, become a 
specialist on this and confine his attention to it. 
Does this seem to be the best way to make 
money in this County? 
186. What objection is there to running a 
strictly dairy farm, when milk is sold at whole- 
sale? There are such farms in the County, but 
they are not among the most profitable. Notice 
by the labor cost that farmers 1 to 6 had only 
enough help by the year to milk the cows and 
had a little extra help in harvest. Suppose 
that they had produced nothing but milk to 
sell, how would it have affected their expenses? 
Their receipts? How did the farmer on farm 6 
keep his men busy? He had just enough men 
to do the milking besides having some extra 
help in the summer. 
187. The milk from farm 6 was retailed. 
The average price received by other farmers 
was between 2! and 3 cents per quart, prob- 
ably averaging 2.7 cents. Calculate the ap- 
proximate amount of milk sold per cow. Notice 
that this is above the amounts fed to calves and 
used at home. Compare with the average total 
production’ per cow in New York (Ref. 10, 
p. 588). Eighty veal calves were sold from 
farm 9; the receipts are the amount received 
above cost of calves.
-P-A-G-E-71

188. It is the common opinion that the dairy- 
man can buy cows cheaper than raise them. If 
this is true with average cows, would it neces- 
sarily be true with good cows? Notice that 
each of these men sells more cattle than he 
buys. How can the man on farm 6 make it 
pay to raise calves, when he sells milk for so 
high a price? 
189. The great majority of cows in the 
County are common stock, with considerable 
Durham blood mixed with more or less Hol- 
stein, Jersey and Guernsey. The great majority 
of bulls are grades. Compare with the breeds 
on these farms. How did farm 8 come to pay 
so well with such low receipts per cow? 
190. It is often said that the reason farmers 
in this region do not make more money is be- 
cause they buy too much grain feed or concen- 
trates. Compare the feed bills on these farms 
with the average farm in Exercise 175. 
191. The average receipts per sheep is a little 
over $5. Compare with farm 9. 
192. In five townships in the northern part 
of Livingston County, New York, labor incomes 
were calculated for 420 farmers who worked 
their own farms. Of these a number made labor 
incomes above $2000, and 11, or about one in 
forty, made above $3000. The records of eight  
-P-A-G-E-72
  58 LABORATORY EXERCISES 
of these exceptionally profitable farms follow. 
Three are not given. One was a pure-bred stock 
farm, one was a 1200-acre general farm, one a 
muck farm. 
This region is a rich, level country that has 
always been noted for its good agriculture. 
The land is comparatively level, the farms large. 
Beans, wheat, potatoes, hay, milk, sheep, horses, 
are the chief products. The cattle are mostly 
Durham grades. Holsteins and other dairy 
breeds are being introduced. It also has some 
muck lands that are used for truck crops. With 
all types of farming there were failures as well as 
successes. The figures are for the year 1908, a 
year later than those in Exercise 183. The prices 
for milk and some other products were higher 
than in Tompkins County the preceding year. 
Make a study of these records.

A. Visit a farm; go over it carefully, noting 
condition, capacity and arrangement of build- 
ings, condition of fences, size and arrangement 
of fields, soils, previous crops and crop yields, 
roads, markets, ete. Determine prices obtained 
for products, taxes paid, insurance rates, and 
cost of feed. 
B. Make a detailed inventory of the farm 
property. The inventory for 1911 is made 
under C, No. XI. It will be included on this 
sheet for comparison. The inventory may be 
replaced by a list of necessary items.

another half day to make the inventory. Before going over 
the farm, a map should be supplied to each student showing 
the present arrangement of fields and buildings. Each field 
should be numbered and its area given. Such maps may be 
prepared in Exercise 65. A good solution of this problem 
will require several days’ work. If detailed plans and specifi- 
cations for buildings are made much more time will be re-

this varies much with the value of the animals 
and with other conditions. Depreciation and 
losses on mature poultry are usually about 50 
per cent. Depreciation on machinery will prob- 
ably be 10 per cent, besides the cost of repairs, 
which should be included under expenses.

capital, receipts, and expenses according to the 
system of rental.

system of cash rent, what labor income would you 
make? What per cent would the landlord make?

200. The following are extracts from a letter 
written by a business man in New York City. 
“T have just purchased a farm 30 miles from 
New York City, on which I expect to live with 
my family. There are about 100 acres, half 
in woods. The farm is to be a milk factory 
primarily. I shall keep 20 cows and 1 bull, 
4 horses, 4 pigs, and chickens. A milkman 
will take the milk at the farm and pay 4 cents 
per quart. There are 300 old apple trees on the 
place. I am actively engaged in business in 
New York, and shall run this farm as a side issue. 
I want to make it a paying proposition from 
the start, and expect to make $3000 per year 
from it. 
“T want a practical young man, preferably an
-P-A-G-E-85

agricultural graduate, to run it for me. I will 
pay him $40 per month to start with, and all 
expenses except laundry, and give him at the 
end of the year 10 per cent on the net income 
from the farm.” 
What salary would this probably amount to? 
What reply would you make to this letter? 
201. A cement company writes that they have 
purchased several hundred acres of land in 
Virginia for obtaining cement materials. The 
land is adapted to truck-growing and alfalfa. 
They desire a manager for this land, and will 
pay $1500 per year, with house furnished, and 
will furnish and keep one horse and cow and 
give the use of ten acres of land. What college 
salary would this be equal to?

but wishes to own a farm as soon as possible. 
What shall he do?

Farm Recorps anp Accounts (Refs. 385-392) 
204. Inventory. — Not every farmer will care 
to keep a complete set of farm accounts, but 
every one should make a list of his property once 
a year in order to see how much he is worth and 
to learn how much he has gained or lost during 
the year. Very frequently a farmer is discour- 
aged with his year’s work because he is short 
of cash, when, as a matter of fact, he has done 
well, but has the profits in increases in the value 
of stock and products on hand. In another year 
he may be too optimistic because he has money 
in lis pocket, even though it came from sales 
that decreased the inventory. 
The farm inventory should be taken during 
the winter when the crops are largely sold and 
when work is et pressing. This may be 
January 1 or April 1, or some month between 
these dates. An itemized list of all the farm 
property is made|with the estimated present 
value of each item. It is best to list the dif- 
ferent kinds of property, as horses, equipment, 
etc., separately. A summary can then be made, 
giving the total of each kind of property. 
The following is the summary of a farm in- 
ventory at the beginning and at the end of a 
year:

205. Accounts with One or More Crops or Kinds 
of Animals. — An inventory shows the condi- 
tion of the business year by year. It does not 
tell which crops or enterprises have paid. Many 
farmers desire to keep accounts with one or 
more of the crops or kinds of animals in order 
to seeif they pay. The following facts are taken 
from accounts kept with barley and oats by A. J. 
Culver, Westfield, N.Y. Rule a sheet of paper 
with columns for debits and credits, and keep 
the account with each crop. Charge labor at 
30 cents per hour, unless otherwise stated.

206.~ Complete Set of Accounts. —By extend- 
ing the number of accounts like those in Exer- 
cises 204 and 205 one will have a complete set 
of accounts. Such a set will also be more ac- 
curate. When keeping accounts with only one 
or two items the charge for horse labor, use of 
machinery, man labor and several other items 
must be estimated. If a complete set of ac- 
counts is kept, the cost of these will be deter- 
mined. The horse labor and use of machinery 
usually costs much more than is expected. 
The following accounts were kept on a New 
York farm of about 90 acres. The farm had 
recently been purchased, and the farmer was 
equipping it, repairing buildings, and getting it 
in shape for use. Before closing the accounts, 
the farmer’s impression was that his money 
had disappeared faster than these improvements 
had been accomplished, or that he was losing 
1 For a similar account with an apple orchard, see Ref. 66, 
pp. 295-298. Many examples are also given in various farm 
papers,
-P-A-G-E-90
  76 LABORATORY EXERCISES 
considerable money. He also thought that the 
poultry was not paying. This impression came 
from the very low egg production the first part 
of the year. The opinion was that the orchard 
and cows were about the only very profitable 
enterprises. . At the close of the year’s accounts 
we will see how these impressions agree with 
the facts. 
Accounts are to be kept under the following 
heads: Inventory, Cash, 1908 Alfalfa (2 acres), 
1909 Alfalfa (2? acres), 1910 Alfalfa (94 acres), 
Bees, Cows, Equipment, Farm, Garden (1 
acre), Hay (27 acres), Horses, Improvements, 
Interest, Labor, Lime, Manure, Notes and 
Accounts Payable, Notes and Accounts Re- 
ceivable, 1909 Oats (7? acres), 1910 Oats, 
Orchard (24 acres), Pasture (28 acres), Per- 
sonal, Poultry, 1910 Wheat (3 acres). 
Under Inventory, sometimes called capital, 
enter the summary of the resources and liabili- 
ties at the beginning of the year. 
The barn is being remade and other improve- 
ments added. In order that the total cost of 
this work may be found easily, an account is 
opened with Improvements rather than making 
the entries direct to the Farm. At the end of 
the year this amount will be added to the value 
of the farm and transferred to the Farm account.
-P-A-G-E-91
  
LABORATORY EXERCISES 77 
Ordinary repairs that are required to maintain 
» the value of the farm are not added to the in- 
ventory. Such repairs are charged to the 
farm. 
Accounts are sometimes opened with bills 
payable and bills receivable, meaning written 
obligations, and with each individual whom 
we owe or who owes us. Usually there are so 
few such accounts on a farm that it is a waste 
of time to keep separate pages for each one. 
In this set all notes and accounts that we owe 
are kept in one list and those that are owed to 
us are kept in another. 
Personal accounts are sometimes separated 
into table expenses, house furnishings, house- 
hold expenses, clothing, etc. In this set of 
accounts these are all included under Personal. 
The value of the work of the owner is also in- 
cluded in this account. 
The account with Labor is opened for con- 
venience. It will be charged with the cost of all 
labor and the value of the owner’s labor. At 
the end of the year the total cost will be dis- 
tributed according to the time spent on differ- 
ent enterprises. 
Equipment that is used for only one crop or 
enterprise is sometimes charged to that account. 
On a general farm there is little such equip:  
-P-A-G-E-92
78 LABORATORY EXERCISES 
ment. In this set of accounts, all equipment is 
charged to the equipment account. 
The complete set of accounts included an 
egg record, work report, and ledger. A sample 
page from the egg record is given on page 87 
and sample pages of the work report on pages

‘spaces for writing explanations of transactions. 
It is therefore best to get a book that is ruled for 
daybook, journal, or cash. The left-hand page 
may be used for debit items and the right-hand 
page for credit items, or, if preferred, use one 
page only, writing debit items in the left-hand 
column and credit items in the right-hand col- 
umn. The forms on pages 78 and 79 show 
how a few of the accounts will look when started. 
Each account has a number. It is then not 
necessary to write any explanations in the cash 
account, as the number and date will enable 
one to find the items at once if they are desired. 
Explanations of all items should be included in 
all other accounts. The cash account may be 
kept on a loose sheet of paper so that it can be 
laid on the table, and so save turning pages. 
This will enable one to make the entries more 
rapidly. The figures after the explanations will 
serve as a means of checking the opposite entry, 
so that we may be sure that the account is 
entered in both places. After the payment for 
the telephone bill, the figure 2 indicates that 
the item has been carried to account No. 2, 
and under Cash the cross reference indicates 
that the item came from account No. 24, which 
is the Personal account. Page 81 shows how 
an account will look if kept on one page only.

The object of keeping the cash account is to 
be able to check the work periodically. The 
cash account can be added and the balance 
compared with the cash on hand and in the bank. 
If these do not agree, probably some item has 
been omitted. Often this can be called to mind. 
Sometimes it cannot. Such omissions will usu- 
ally be small personal or living expenses that 
have been forgotten. If this is thought to be 
the case, the amount can be entered under Per- 
sonal as ‘‘items omitted,” and carried to the 
cash account. The cash should be checked 
often enough to prevent any serious errors. 
An omission of a few dollars per year should not 
discourage one. The cash account also com- 
pletes the double entry. The proper transfer 
of entries can be checked by seeing if the total 
of all debits in all accounts equals the total of 
all credits. 
If one is quite sure that he is very accurate. 
G

the cash account may be omitted. This makes 
the accounts single entry. The danger of errors 
and the probability of loss of time in looking 
for them makes this method very undesirable. 
Every transaction requires an entry on the 
left-hand side and an equal entry on the right- 
hand side. Whenever a department or account 
receives value the entry is made on the left- 
hand side of that account and on the right-hand 
side of the account giving the value. 
If you are certain that an entry belongs to 
one side of a certain account, you may be sure 
that it will be on the opposite side of the other 
account concerned. (For principles of making 
entries, see Refs. 385, 386, 387, 389, 390, or any 
text-book of bookkeeping.) 
The following are the facts concerning the 
year’s business on this farm. They show the 
farm transactions as they occurred, except that 
in a number of places the totals for a part of the 
year are given in one sum so as to shorten the 
time required of the student. Keep the ac- 
counts as suggested above. Where detailed in- 
ventories are given, as in the case of horses, 
1 If a student does not make any mistakes, it requires about 
fifteen hours to complete exerci: 06 to 216. The average 
student requires more than this amount of time. Ifa shorter 
set of accounts is desired, see Exercises 217 to 222, which 
require about half as much time.

equipment, etc., do not enter each item, but 
find the total for that account. 
No attention need be given to date new, date 
purchased, or cost. These are included to show 
how the inventory was kept. Some of the in- 
ventories for the end of the year are taken from 
the accounts; others are included here. They 
will be used at the end of the set of accounts. 
The 1909 inventory is all that is considered 
here.

Labor, — The following shows the work report 
for the month of July. By man hour is meant 
the time of one man one hour. Horse hour 
means the time of one horse one hour. This 
makes it easy to record the time of one horse 
working alone or of three-horse teams. In the 
diary and work report all kinds of notes concern- 
ing the farm may be included. It makes a 
kind of a daybook. Such a diary will be of 
much use for reference. If one prefers, the en- 
tire work report may be kept in the form used 
for chores, adding columns for hay, oats, etc., 
and including man hours and horse hours under 
each. For such a form, see page 118. The only 
objection to this form is that it does not tell 
the kind of work done. 
If one prefers, a separate work report may be 
kept for each man or the time for all the men 
may be added and kept in one book. Two 
men worked on this place during the summer. 
Their time was kept in one book as illustrated 
on the following pages for July. 
From the following find the total number of 
hours of labor for each account for July. These 
amounts will be added to the amounts given on 
page 102 in order to get the total for the year.

Find the total hours of labor for each of the 
above items for the entire year; also the total 
hours of all labor for man and for horse. 
ind the balance of the labor account and the 
cost per hour of labor. Charge the various ac- 
counts with their share of the cost. In making 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
LABORATORY EXERCISES 103 
this and following calculations, use the nearest 
hour. 
Horses. — Enter the inventory for the horse 
account, charge interest at 5 per cent on the 
average of the inventories at the beginning and 
end of the year, and credit the interest account. 
Find the balance of the horse account. Dis- 
tribute this loss or cost among the various ac- 
counts according to the number of hours of 
horse labor. 
Equipment. — Enter the inventory value of 
equipment. Charge interest at 5 per cent on 
the average of the inventories. Find the bal- 
ance of the equipment account. Find the total 
hours of horse labor, omitting the time spent on 
equipment. Find the cost per hour for use of 
equipment. Distribute the balance to the va- 
rious accounts other than equipment according 
to the number of hours of horse labor. The 
equipment is usually used on various enter- 
prises in about this proportion. 
Lime. — Find the balance of the lime account, 
and distribute to the three alfalfa fields in pro- 
portion to their areas. This account was kept 
because it would have been difficult to know how 
much to charge to each field until the total 
cost was known. If it had all gone to one field, 
it would have been entered directly. No crop 
   
-P-A-G-E-118
  104 LABORATORY EXERCISES 
has been grown since this lime was applied. 
Its cost, including labor, is therefore included in 
the inventory. It is thought that this applica- 
tion will last five years or more on this farm. 
In 1911, 4 of the value will be included in the 
inventory. If the alfalfa should be plowed up 
at the end of two years, it would be credited 
with 3 of the value of the lime, and succeeding 
crops would be charged with this amount, thus 
making each crop pay ¢ of the total cost. 
Manure. — For convenience, a similar account 
is kept with manure. At the end of the year the 
total value of the manure, including the labor 
of hauling it, can then be distributed to the crops 
on which it was used. In this set of accounts 
the manure applied is for next year’s alfalfa. 
After being charged to the alfalfa, it is included 
in the inventory. Next year about 60 per cent 
of the amount will be included in the inventory. 
It is not fair to charge all the cost of manure to 
the first year’s crop, because over half of it will 
usually be left for succeeding years. 
If one is raising corn, oats, wheat, and clover 
in a four-year rotation, and uses manure on the 
corn, it will probably be fair to charge the corn 
with about 40 per cent of the manure, oats 30 
per cent, wheat 20 per cent, clover 10 per cent. 
The simplest way to do this is to charge all of 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
  LABORATORY EXERCISES 105 
the manure to the corn, and at the end of the year 
transfer 60 per cent of the charge to oats by 
crediting corn with 60 per cent of the amount 
and debiting oats. Similarly, 30 per cent of 
the original value will be carried over to wheat. 
This may sound complicated, but it is a very 
simple matter in practice. For a different 
method of charging manure see page 119. 
Find the balance of the manure account and 
carry to other accounts as follows: 4 to garden, 
é to 1909 alfalfa, 2 to 1910 alfalfa. 
Improvements. — Find the balance of the im- 
provement account and carry to the farm account. 
Inventories. — Inventory the 1910 oats, 1910 
wheat, 1909 alfalfa, 1910 alfalfa at what they 
have cost. The total cost of improvements 
and of land bought will be added to the last 
year’s value of the farm to get the new inven- 
tory. Inventory notes and accounts payable 
and notes and accounts receivable from the ac- 
counts. All other inventories are given on 
pages 83 to 86. Enter all inventories. 
Interest. — Charge interest at 5 per cent on 
the average of their inventories to the farm, 
cows, and poultry. 
Loss and Gain. — Balance all the accounts, 
except inventory, and carry the differences to 
the account of loss and gain.
-P-A-G-E-120
  106 LABORATORY EXERCISES 
Find the balance of loss and gain account 
and the balance of the account with inventory. 
These balances should be equal. 
Distribute the new inventory and have the 
accounts ready for the next year’s business. 
207. What were the profits on the year’s 
work? What were the profits, omitting the per- 
sonal account ? 
What was the cost of living ? 
What proportion of the personal expenses did 
the farm furnish ? 
208. What net profit did each of the follow- 
ing pay per hour of man labor expended on them: 
Cows? Poultry? Oats? Hay? Orchard? 
209. What was the total number of hours 
of horse labor? Counting 300 working days 
in the year, what was the avcrage number of 
hours worked per horse per day? (Notice that 
one horse was on the farm 9 months and one 12 
months.) Can you suggest any ways of reduc- 
ing the cost of horse labor next year? (See also 
Ref. 12, p. 82.) What was the cost of equipment 
per hour of team time? 
210. The 1909 inventory of oats was for 
36 hours of man labor and 72 hours of horse 
labor done in 1908. For hay omit $120 in the

212. The orchard contains 33 Baldwin trees, 
15 Rhode Island Greening, 10 Spitzenburg, 
/ 2 Snow, 5 King, and 34 miscellaneous varieties 
and young trees filled in. What was the aver- 
age yield per tree? The average receipts per 
tree? Leaving out the cider apples, what was 
the average yield of the Baldwin trees? Green- 
ing? Spitzenburg? What were the average re- 
ceipts per tree of each of the five kinds? How 
much greater would the gross receipts have been 
if all the 99 trees had been Baldwin? 
213. What was the total cost per acre of 
starting alfalfa when not limed or manured? (See 
inventory, January 1, 1909, of the 1908 alfalfa.) 
What was the cost per acre when alfalfa was 
limed and manured? (See inventory of 1909 
alfalfa.) 
214. What was the cost per ton of hauling

and applying lime? What was its total cost per 
ton, including price, freight, and work? The 
lime was hauled about one mile. The lime that 
was sold was sold direct from the car. 
215. The cement floor was for a barn 30 x 60 
feet. What was its total cost? Its cost per 
square foot? See September 10, October 8, 27, 
and work report, pages 100 to 102. The gravel 
was secured on the farm. The floor was about 
7 inches thick, consisting of 2 inches clear gravel; 
4 inches concrete, 1 part cement to 8 of gravel 
and sand; 1 inch finishing coat, 1 part cement to 
3 parts sand. 
216. What suggestions can you make for 
increasing the profits next year? 
‘216 a. The usual system of share renting in 
the region where this farm is located is as fol- 
lows: The landlord furnishes land and build- 
ings, half the seed, fertilizer and apple barrels 
and pays half of the threshing bill and receives 
half of the crop. If the hay had been grown on 
shares, what would it have cost the landlord? 
The tenant? (In these calculations omit $120 
worth of old hay in the 1909 inventory and 
omit credits before July.) Make similar calcula- 
tions for 1909 oats. For the orchard. Should 
all crops be shared on the same basis regardless 
of the labor required?

following pay per hour of man labor expended 
on them? Corn? Cows? Hay? Oats? Or- 
chard? Poultry? Potatoes? Rye? Wheat? 
220. What was the total number of hours of 
horse labor? Using the average number of 
horses and counting 300 working days in the 
year, what was the average number of hours 
worked per day? What was the cost per hour? 
Can you suggest any ways of reducing this cost 
next year? What was the cost of equipment for 
each hour of use? 
221. What is the trouble on this farm? 
What changes would you suggest for the next 
year? 
222. The land is well adapted to apples, po- 
tatoes, corn, hay, wheat, oats, rye. The loca- 
tion and buildings are good for dairying. The 
pasture is not tillable. The location is good for 
poultry. Considering the capital and the re- 
sults of the year’s accounts, which of these would 
you produce? What would you do about the 
threshing machine?

_ Accounts ror A 400-AcrrE Farm 
223. Business transactions for a year on a 
large dairy farm are illustrated in this exercise. 
The farmer, besides running his farm of 400 
acres, with its dairy stock, part pure bred, has 
an interest in a local bank. Altogether it is a 
business of considerable size. 
As in the preceding accounts, the inventory 
is given in summary and the transactions of only 
two months are given in detail. The transac- 
tions for each account for the remainder of the 
year are combined and entered in total.

In addition, the items of labor are given each 
day for one month, and a daily work report is to 
be kept by the student, as shown above. The
-P-A-G-E-133
  LABORATORY EXERCISES 119 
labor by man and by horse for each account for 
the other eleven months is given in total. By 
man hour is meant the time of one man one 
hour. By horse hour is meant the time of one 
horse one hour. 
A sheet with columns for each account will 
show the man and horse labor for a month. 
Combining the totals from each monthly sheet 
gives the total labor for each account for the 
year. The columns at the right are for record- 
ing the number of days each man works. This 
form of work report requires less work in finding 
the total hours of labor for the various accounts 
than the diary form, but it does not describe the 
work done. See pages 99 to 101. A farm diary 
may be kept for this purpose. 
The manure question has been handled in a 
different manner than in the first set of accounts, 
page104. A regular four-yearrotation of: 1.corn, 
2. oats, 3. part wheat and part hay, 4. hay, is 
followed. The manure is regularly put on the 
corn ground, and thus the fertility obtained by 
the first, second, third, and fourth year crops 
remains constant from year to year. The 
amount of manure applied is practically the 
same each year. Under these conditions the 
easiest way to properly distribute the manure 
charge is to first charge all the manure, together 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
  120 LABORATORY EXERCISES 
with the labor of application, to the farm. 
Determine the total cost of application per acre: 
(this needs to be done only once) and then 
charge the crops with sufficient rent to cover 
the cost of manure and use of land. To the rent 
per acre of land add 40 per cent of the manure 
cost for the first crop, 30 per cent for the second, 
20 per cent for the third, and 10 per cent for the 
fourth. On this farm the cost of manure and 
application per acre averaged $14, and the rent 
$3.50. The annual charges are calculated as 
follows: 
1st crop, 40% of $14 + $3.50 = approximately $9 
2d crop, 30% of $14 + $3.50 = approximately $7.50 
8d crop, 20% of $14 + $3.50 = approximately $6.50 
4th crop, 10% of $14 + $3.50 = approximately $5 
Personal accounts are kept with the regular 
hired men. At the end of each month their 
accounts are credited with the value of their 
time, and labor account is charged. Whenever 
a man receives payment, entries are made in 
his account and in the cash account, the labor 
account not being concerned. Two of the 
laborers board with Fred Bates, who is also a 
laborer, and their board is paid to Bates by the 
farmer. So Bates’s account, besides being cred- 
ited with his labor, is also credited with the board 
of these two men. The value of the owner's
-P-A-G-E-135
LABORATORY EXERCISES 121 
work is charged to labor and credited to personal 
account at the end of the year, so that the total 
cost of labor will be obtained. The various ac- 
counts can then be charged with the total labor 
that they actually received. This amount 
should be omitted in determining the total cost 
of living. 
The equipment that is used entirely for any 
one kind of stock, as poultry equipment or 
horse harness, is charged to and inventoried 
with that stock. General farm equipment is 
included under machinery. This is somewhat 
different from the method used in Exercises 206 
and 217. 
Accounts are kept under the following heads: 
Capital, Bank Stock, Fred Bates, 1908 Beets 
(2a), Cash, 1908 Corn (30a), 1909 Corn (30a), 
Dairy, Bill Denter (blacksmith), Farm, John
